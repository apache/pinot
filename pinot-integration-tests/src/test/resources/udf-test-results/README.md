# UDF Test Snapshots

This directory contains the results of UDF tests run against Apache Pinot.

IMPORTANT: All the files in this directory are generated by the UDF tests and should not be modified manually.
Instead of modifying these files, you should run the main method of the UdfTest test class to regenerate them.

There are two main types of files in this directory:
1. `all-functions.yaml`: This file contains a map from function names to their UDF classes.
2. `<function-name>.yaml`: These files contain the results of running the UDF tests for each function.
  The content of these files is the YAML serialization of the `UdfTestResult.BySignature.Dto` class.
3. `<function-name>.md`: These files contain the results of running the UDF tests for each function in Markdown format.
  The content of these files is generated from the `UdfTestResult.BySignature` class and they are intended to be 
  directly used as documentation, copying these files to the `pinot-docs` repository. This is not yet tested.
