The npc id of the npc that is looted seemed correct and localization also should not be an thing in this case. I've disabled the quest id 61634 but this didn't help. So I added 156339 to the npcs and it finally counted. I didn't reactivate the quest id I previously commented out, so I don't know if this matters.\r\n\r\n> My line looks like this now \"line 578 npcs = {156340, 156339 },\" but it wasn't counted twice. So no idea what is wrong with Orstus, but Sotiros works. \r\n\r\nNot sure what's the matter here, maybe it can only looted from one of the NPCs? Perhaps it's \"random\" which one it is? I have never even been to this location ingame, so I don't know anything about these rares.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WowRarity/Rarity/issues/comments/883914010","html_url":"https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity/issues/336#issuecomment-883914010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WowRarity/Rarity/issues/336","id":883914010,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBoVp8c40r3Ua","user":{"login":"Duckwhale","id":16489133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5MTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale","html_url":"https://github.com/Duckwhale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Duckwhale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T06:00:02Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T06:00:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From the CurseForge comment:\r\n\r\n> Not both of this NPC pair are lootable after defeating them, only Sotiros was glimmering","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T06:00:02Z","org":{"id":79935280,"login":"WowRarity","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/WowRarity","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79935280?"}}

(#11090)\n\nCurrently, we verify the startup of a Streams client by checking the transition\r\nfrom REBALANCING to RUNNING and if the client processed some records\r\nin the EOS system test. However, if the Streams client only\r\nhas standby tasks assigned as it can happen if the client is catching \r\nup by using warm-up replicas, the client will never process\r\nrecords within the timeout of the startup verification. Hence, the test \r\nwill fail although everything is fine. This commit fixes this by reducing\r\nthe time to the next probing rebalance and by increasing the number of \r\nmax warm-up replicas. In such a way, the catch up of the client and the \r\nfollowing processing of records should still be within the startup verification \r\ntimeout of the client.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Anna Sophie Blee-Goldman <ableegoldman@apache.org>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/commits/00c51eae1c1e9ee2b080a7b0155fdb3c7c6b6d4c"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T06:00:04Z","org":{"id":47359,"login":"apache","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/apache","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?"}}

With that tickbox, you should also be able to force it to be visible or not. \r\n `display=false` : Box is empty\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42072372/107120897-cdf61280-688f-11eb-8e73-1a119cb0c6d3.png)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NPBruce/valkyrie/issues/comments/883942784","html_url":"https://github.com/NPBruce/valkyrie/issues/1451#issuecomment-883942784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NPBruce/valkyrie/issues/1451","id":883942784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-vB9840r-WA","user":{"login":"NicolaZee","id":29044647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDQ0NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29044647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee","html_url":"https://github.com/NicolaZee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaZee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T07:00:01Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T07:00:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Good idea to show the Display Tick box.

Although on-screen keyboards can't reliably detect for how long keys are held down, they should still be able to work by triggering the hat blocks. This is done by repeatedly sending the isDown: true thing to the VM\r\n\r\nPerhaps something similar can be done with the \"when this sprite clicked\" block. Thus, this issue is multi-part:\r\n\r\n1. Investigate whether postIOData-ing isDown: true for mouse multiple times can trigger the \"when this sprite clicked\" hat block multiple times.\r\n  - Hopefully it does. Maybe some finicking might be required (eg if it requires a mouseup before the next mousedown)\r\n  - If this is not possible, close this issue.\r\n2. Implement.\r\n  - An option to support multiple fingers\r\n  - Every pointerdown should cause a isDown: true at the new pointer's location\r\n  - <mouse down?> should return whether *at least* one pointer is down. Should check what the existing behaviour is\r\n  - (mouse x) and (mouse y) can do whatever\r\n\r\nAlso, might consider adding an option to support on-screen keyboards?\r\n\r\nI'm writing this late at night; hopefully when I see this later I don't get confused","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-21T07:00:03Z"}

From repository\r\n    2. (_new_) From Project DB\r\n    3. From definitely-gp\r\n    4. Derived (Go) or default\r\n- When starting from a custom `.gitpod.yml` (from the Project DB), the initializer also places the uncomitted `.gitpod.yml` into the workspace (to encourage repo-based configs)\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n\r\n- Create a new team\r\n- Add a new project (either by inserting into `d_b_project`, or we set up a GitHub App integration -- @AlexTugarev could you help with the latter?)\r\n- If the project already has a repo-based config, the configurator should indicate that and be disabled. If there is no repo config, the configurator should allow you to write a new `.gitpod.yml` (e.g. based on one of the presets) and then test it / iterate on it in a quick loop (with the build output on the right)\r\n\r\nThe UX of this is still rough, but the goal is to add this final step rather soon, and then iterate on the entire Add Project flow.","created_at":"2021-06-28T09:18:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T08:00:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15cbca865d27363a6344dd9cdb57e4155d6384e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3171280082,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxMjgwMDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2481698797,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDgxNjk4Nzk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/component:%20dashboard","name":"component: dashboard","color":"e1e4e8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3173195428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTczMTk1NDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/do-not-merge/hold","name":"do-not-merge/hold","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3046862260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDQ2ODYyMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/roadmap%20item:%20teams%20&%20projects","name":"roadmap item: teams & projects","color":"656769","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3171736349,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxNzM2MzQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/statuses/8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","head":{"label":"gitpod-io:jx/configure-project","ref":"jx/configure-project","sha":"8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","user":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130879558,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA4Nzk1NTg=","name":"gitpod","full_name":"gitpod-io/gitpod","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod","description":"Gitpod automates the provisioning of ready-to-code development environments.

Derived (Go) or default\r\n- When starting from a custom `.gitpod.yml` (from the Project DB), the initializer also places the uncomitted `.gitpod.yml` into the workspace (to encourage repo-based configs)\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n\r\n- Create a new team\r\n- Add a new project (either by inserting into `d_b_project`, or we set up a GitHub App integration -- @AlexTugarev could you help with the latter?)\r\n- If the project already has a repo-based config, the configurator should indicate that and be disabled. If there is no repo config, the configurator should allow you to write a new `.gitpod.yml` (e.g. based on one of the presets) and then test it / iterate on it in a quick loop (with the build output on the right)\r\n\r\nThe UX of this is still rough, but the goal is to add this final step rather soon, and then iterate on the entire Add Project flow.","created_at":"2021-06-28T09:18:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T08:00:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15cbca865d27363a6344dd9cdb57e4155d6384e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3171280082,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxMjgwMDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2481698797,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDgxNjk4Nzk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/component:%20dashboard","name":"component: dashboard","color":"e1e4e8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3173195428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTczMTk1NDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/do-not-merge/hold","name":"do-not-merge/hold","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3046862260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDQ2ODYyMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/roadmap%20item:%20teams%20&%20projects","name":"roadmap item: teams & projects","color":"656769","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3171736349,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTcxNzM2MzQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/4631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpod-io/gitpod/statuses/8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","head":{"label":"gitpod-io:jx/configure-project","ref":"jx/configure-project","sha":"8601021844904dcd946b303258e7d1f71cf4a7b6","user":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130879558,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA4Nzk1NTg=","name":"gitpod","full_name":"gitpod-io/gitpod","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gitpod-io","id":37021919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3MDIxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37021919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitpod-io/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod","description":"Gitpod automates the provisioning of ready-to-code development environments.

The option to use tethering is not available in the _import_ module and selecting the tethering view results in the error message `no camera with tethering support available for use...`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Connect Nikon D780 with PC via USB cable \r\n2. Turn on Nikon D780\r\n3. Run `darktable`\r\n4. Check `import` module (only `mount camera` option available)\r\n5. Open `tethering` view (see message: _no camera with tethering support available for use..._)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n- Allow tethering with Nikon D780 as it seems to be supported by `gphoto2`\r\n- See `switch to tethered shooting` option in `import` module\r\n- Availability of actual tethererd shooting in the `tethering` view\r\n\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\n* darktable version : 3.6.0\r\n* OS                : Linux Kernel 5.12.15-arch1-1\r\n* Linux - Distro    : ArchLinux\r\n* Memory            : 16 GB\r\n* Graphics card     : NVidia GeForce RTX 2060\r\n* Graphics driver   : \r\n* OpenCL installed  : yes\r\n* OpenCL activated  :  yes\r\n* Xorg              : 1.20.12-1\r\n* Desktop           : i3wm\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- I was able to *successfully* use tethering via `gphoto2` in the troubleshooting process as provided here: https://www.darktable.org/usermanual/en/tethering/troubleshooting/\r\n- Nonetheless, tethering with `darktable` seems not to work.\r\n\r\n**Further information**\r\nAs instructed in the troubleshooting section for tethering, I logged the output of `darktable -d camctl 2>1 >camctl.log` which is the following:\r\n```\r\n% cat camctl.log \r\n0.803433 [camera_control] creating new context 0x5636e41833a0\r\n0.823962 [camera_control] loaded 2562 camera drivers.\r\n1.344988 [camera_control] loaded 38 port drivers.\r\n1.358053 [camera_control] 1 cameras connected\r\n1.358062 [camera_control] found new Nikon DSC D780 on port usb:001,018\r\n18.097786 [camera_control] destroy darktable camcontrol\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Remarks**\r\nIn case there is any further information missing that could be of help for resolving this issue just let me know.

When clicking the button to clear the image, the popover is closed. We confirmed that the popover is closed by the `useOutsideClick` hook. We suspect this happens because the clear button is removed from the DOM before the outside click handler is executed, so it doesn't know that the clear button was _inside_ the popover. In order to prevent this, we plan to use `event.stopPropagation()` in the `onClear` callback.\r\n\r\nThe second challenge we faced was using the ImageInput with the `identity` variant of the Avatar component which has a circular border radius. \r\n\r\n## Approach and changes\r\n\r\n- Pass the click event to the `onClear` prop of the ImageInput\r\n- Make the ImageInput's border-radius configurable through the addition of a `borderRadius` prop (I’m not happy about exposing such a verbose styling prop, but I don’t see a better way 😕)\r\n\r\n## Definition of done\r\n\r\n* [x] Development completed\r\n* [x] Reviewers assigned\r\n* [x] Unit and integration tests\r\n* [x] Meets minimum browser support\r\n* [x] Meets accessibility requirements\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-20T09:46:56Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T08:59:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9981e00b8873ffec048751cff67c1124ee77975","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"justman00","id":36477870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDc3ODcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36477870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00","html_url":"https://github.com/justman00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justman00/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":634343322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MzQzNDMzMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20bug","name":"🐞

When clicking the button to clear the image, the popover is closed. We confirmed that the popover is closed by the `useOutsideClick` hook. We suspect this happens because the clear button is removed from the DOM before the outside click handler is executed, so it doesn't know that the clear button was _inside_ the popover. In order to prevent this, we plan to use `event.stopPropagation()` in the `onClear` callback.\r\n\r\nThe second challenge we faced was using the ImageInput with the `identity` variant of the Avatar component which has a circular border radius. \r\n\r\n## Approach and changes\r\n\r\n- Pass the click event to the `onClear` prop of the ImageInput\r\n- Make the ImageInput's border-radius configurable through the addition of a `borderRadius` prop (I’m not happy about exposing such a verbose styling prop, but I don’t see a better way 😕)\r\n\r\n## Definition of done\r\n\r\n* [x] Development completed\r\n* [x] Reviewers assigned\r\n* [x] Unit and integration tests\r\n* [x] Meets minimum browser support\r\n* [x] Meets accessibility
