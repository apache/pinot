    <ShortDescription>Using shaded APIs when calling SPI methods.</ShortDescription>
    <LongDescription>
      At least one call to an SPI method using shaded libraries has been detected.
      This can produce problems in runtime when the shaded classes are repackaged.
      For example, you may be trying to call a method that receives an argument whose static type is a Jackson package.
      Given that Jackson should be shaded, your plugin will actually try to call that method using its shaded version
      of Jackson, which would produce a MethodNotFound at runtime.
