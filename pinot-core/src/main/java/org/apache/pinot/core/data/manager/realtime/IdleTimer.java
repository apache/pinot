/**
 * The IdleTimer is responsible for keeping track of 2 different idle times:
 *  - The stream idle time which resets every time we remake the stream consumer.
 *    This depends on the user configured "idle.timeout.millis" stream config.
 *  - the total idle time which only resets when we consume something.
 *
 * This is not a running timer. It only advances as long as we keep calling "markIdle".
 * This also makes it sightly inaccurate as we don't start counting idle time until
 * we've been idle for the first time. This is fine for our use case as we are using this
 * in a fast moving consumeLoop with iterations taking on the order of milliseconds to seconds.
