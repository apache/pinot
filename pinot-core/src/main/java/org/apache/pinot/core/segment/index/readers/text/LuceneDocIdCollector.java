/**
 * A simple collector created to bypass all the heap heavy process
 * of collecting the results in Lucene. Lucene by default will
 * create a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.TopScoreDocCollector}
 * which internally uses a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.TopDocsCollector}
 * and uses a PriorityQueue to maintain the top results. From the heap usage
 * experiments (please see the design doc), we found out that this was
 * substantially contributing to heap whereas we currently don't need any
 * scoring or top doc collecting.
 * Every time Lucene finds a matching document for the text search query,
 * a callback is invoked into this collector that simply collects the
 * matching doc's docID. We store the docID in a bitmap to be traversed later
 * as part of doc id iteration etc.
