 * Helper class to store a subset of Record fields
 * IntermediateRecord is derived from a Record
 * Some of the main properties of an IntermediateRecord are:
 *
 * 1. Key in IntermediateRecord is expected to be identical to the one in the Record
 * 2. For values, IntermediateRecord should only have the columns needed for order by
 * 3. Inside the values, the columns should be ordered by the order by sequence
 * 4. For order by on aggregations, final results are extracted
 * 5. There is a mandatory field to store the original record to prevent from duplicate looking up
