/**
 * Another version of {@link ConcurrentIndexedTable} used for use cases
 * configured to have infinite group by (num group limit to se 1B or higher).
 * For such cases, there won't be any resizing/trimming during upsert since
 * trimThreshold is very high. Thus, we can avoid the overhead of readLock's
 * lock and unlock operations which are otherwise used in ConcurrentIndexedTable
 * to prevent race conditions between 2 threads doing upsert and one of them ends
 * up trimming from upsert. For use cases with very large number of groups, we had
 * noticed that load-unlock overhead was > 1sec and this specialized concurrent
 * indexed table avoids that by overriding just the upsert method
