# docker-pinot
This is a docker image of [Apache Thirdeye](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/tree/master/thirdeye).

## How to build a docker image

There is a docker build script which will build a given Git repo/branch and tag the image.

Usage:

```SHELL
./docker-build.sh [Docker Tag] [Git Branch] [Pinot Git URL]
```

This script will check out Pinot Repo `[Pinot Git URL]` on branch `[Git Branch]` and build the docker image for that.

The docker image is tagged as `[Docker Tag]`.

`Docker Tag`: Name and tag your docker image. Default is `thirdeye:latest`.

`Git Branch`: The Pinot branch to build. Default is `master`.

`Pinot Git URL`: The Pinot Git Repo to build, users can set it to their own fork. Please note that, the URL is `https://` based, not `git://`. Default is the Apache Repo: `https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git`.

* Example of building and tagging a snapshot on your own fork:
```SHELL
./docker-build.sh thirdeye:latest master https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git
```

## How to publish a docker image

Script `docker-push.sh` publishes a given docker image to your docker registry.

In order to push to your own repo, the image needs to be explicitly tagged with the repo name.

* Example of publishing a image to [apachepinot/thirdeye](https://cloud.docker.com/u/apachepinot/repository/docker/apachepinot/thirdeye) dockerHub repo.

```SHELL
docker tag thirdeye:latest apachepinot/thirdeye:latest
./docker-push.sh apachepinot/thirdeye:latest
```

Script `docker-build-and-push.sh` builds and publishes this docker image to your docker registry after build.

* Example of building and publishing a image to [apachepinot/thirdeye](https://cloud.docker.com/u/apachepinot/repository/docker/apachepinot/thirdeye) dockerHub repo.

```SHELL
./docker-build-and-push.sh apachepinot/thirdeye:latest master https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git
```

## How to Run it

The entry point of docker image is `start-thirdeye.sh` script.
