# Superset

Docker image for [Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) with Pinot integration.


## How to build

Pinot Superset image is built on top of [apache/superset](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset) with Pinotdb driver.

Below command will build Superset image based on `apache/superset:0.37` then tag it as `apachepinot/pinot-superset:0.37`.

```bash
docker build --build-arg SUPERSET_IMAGE_TAG=0.37 --tag apachepinot/pinot-superset:0.37 .
```

## How to push

```bash
docker push apachepinot/pinot-superset:0.37
```

## Configuration

Follow the [instructions](https://superset.apache.org/installation.html#configuration) provided by Apache Superset for writing your own `superset_config.py`.

Place this file in a local directory and mount this directory to `/etc/superset` inside the container. This location is included in the image's `PYTHONPATH`. Mounting this file to a different location is possible, but it will need to be in the `PYTHONPATH`.


## Volumes

The image defines two data volumes: one for mounting configuration into the container, and one for data (logs, SQLite DBs, &c).

The configuration volume is located alternatively at `/etc/superset` or `/app/superset`; either is acceptable. Both of these directories are included in the `PYTHONPATH` of the image. Mount any configuration (specifically the `superset_config.py` file) here to have it read by the app on startup.

The data volume is located at `/app/superset_home` and it is where you would mount your SQLite file (if you are using that as your backend), or a volume to collect any logs that are routed there.

## Kubernetes Examples

Please refer to [`superset.yaml`](../../../kubernetes/helm/superset.yaml) as k8s deployment example.
