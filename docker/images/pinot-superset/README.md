# Superset

Docker image for [Superset](https://github.com/ApacheInfra/superset) with Pinot integration.

This docker build project is based on Project [docker-superset](https://github.com/amancevice/docker-superset) and specialized for Pinot.

## How to build

Please modify file `Makefile` to change `image` and `superset_version` accordingly.

Below command will build docker image and tag it as `superset_version` and `latest`.

```bash
make latest
```

You can also build directly with `docker build` command by setting arguments:
```bash
docker build \
	--build-arg NODE_VERSION=latest \
	--build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.6 \
	--build-arg SUPERSET_VERSION=0.34.1 \
	--tag fx19880617/pinot-superset:0.34.1 \
	--target build .
```
## How to push

```bash
make push
```

## Configuration

Follow the [instructions](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#configuration) provided by Apache Superset for writing your own `superset_config.py`.

Place this file in a local directory and mount this directory to `/etc/superset` inside the container. This location is included in the image's `PYTHONPATH`. Mounting this file to a different location is possible, but it will need to be in the `PYTHONPATH`.


## Volumes

The image defines two data volumes: one for mounting configuration into the container, and one for data (logs, SQLite DBs, &c).

The configuration volume is located alternatively at `/etc/superset` or `/home/superset`; either is acceptable. Both of these directories are included in the `PYTHONPATH` of the image. Mount any configuration (specifically the `superset_config.py` file) here to have it read by the app on startup.

The data volume is located at `/var/lib/superset` and it is where you would mount your SQLite file (if you are using that as your backend), or a volume to collect any logs that are routed there. This location is used as the value of the `SUPERSET_HOME` environmental variable.

## Kubernetes Examples

Please refer to [`superset.yaml`](../../../kubernetes/examples/helm/superset.yaml) as k8s deployment example.
