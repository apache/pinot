# docker-pinot
This is a docker image of [Apache Pinot](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot).

## How to build a docker image

There is a docker build script which will build a given Git repo/branch and tag the image.

Usage:

```SHELL
./docker-build.sh [Docker Tag] [Git Branch] [Pinot Git URL] [Kafka Version] [Java Version]
```

This script will check out Pinot Repo `[Pinot Git URL]` on branch `[Git Branch]` and build the docker image for that.

The docker image is tagged as `[Docker Tag]`.

`Docker Tag`: Name and tag your docker image. Default is `pinot:latest`.

`Git Branch`: The Pinot branch to build. Default is `master`.

`Pinot Git URL`: The Pinot Git Repo to build, users can set it to their own fork. Please note that, the URL is `https://` based, not `git://`. Default is the Apache Repo: `https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git`.

`Kafka Version`: The Kafka Version to build pinot with. Default is `2.0`

`Java Version`: The Java Version to build pinot with. Default is `8`

* Example of building and tagging a snapshot on your own fork:
```SHELL
./docker-build.sh pinot_fork:snapshot-5.2 snapshot-5.2 https://github.com/your_own_fork/pinot.git
```

* Example of building a release version:
```SHELL
./docker-build.sh pinot:release-0.1.0 release-0.1.0 https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git
```

## How to publish a docker image

Script `docker-push.sh` publishes a given docker image to your docker registry.

In order to push to your own repo, the image needs to be explicitly tagged with the repo name.

* Example of publishing a image to [apachepinot/pinot](https://cloud.docker.com/u/apachepinot/repository/docker/apachepinot/pinot) dockerHub repo.

```SHELL
./docker-push.sh apachepinot/pinot:latest
```

* Tag a built image, then push.
````SHELL
docker tag pinot:release-0.1.0 apachepinot/pinot:release-0.1.0
docker push apachepinot/pinot:release-0.1.0
````

Script `docker-build-and-push.sh` builds and publishes this docker image to your docker registry after build.

* Example of building and publishing a image to [apachepinot/pinot](https://cloud.docker.com/u/apachepinot/repository/docker/apachepinot/pinot) dockerHub repo.

```SHELL
./docker-build-and-push.sh apachepinot/pinot:latest master https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot.git
```

## How to Run it

The entry point of docker image is `pinot-admin.sh` script.

### Bring up Zookeeper
Example of bring up a local zookeeper in docker:
```SHELL
docker pull zookeeper
docker run --name  pinot-zookeeper --restart always -p 2181:2181  zookeeper
```
You can extract the zookeeper host from:
```SHELL
docker inspect pinot-zookeeper|grep IPAddress
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
```
Please use local zookeeper path `172.17.0.2:2181` as `-zkAddress` parameter.

### Pinot Controller
Example of bring up a local controller:
```SHELL
docker run -p 9000:9000 pinot:release-0.1.0 StartController -zkAddress 172.17.0.2:2181
```

### Pinot Broker
Example of bring up a local broker:
```SHELL
docker run -p 8099:8099 pinot:release-0.1.0 StartBroker -zkAddress 172.17.0.2:2181
```

### Pinot Server
Example of bring up a local server:
```SHELL
docker run -p 8098:8098 pinot:release-0.1.0 StartServer -zkAddress 172.17.0.2:2181
```

## QuickStart


### Use docker compose to bring up Pinot stack

Please note that this quickstart is based on Kafka 2.0.

Below is a script to use docker compose to bring up zookeeper/kafka/pinot-controller/pinot-broker/pinot-server
```SHELL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

### Create table and load data from Kafka.

Below is the script to create airlineStats table
```SHELL
docker run --network=pinot_default apachepinot/pinot:release-0.7.1 AddTable -schemaFile examples/stream/airlineStats/airlineStats_schema.json -tableConfigFile examples/stream/airlineStats/docker/airlineStats_realtime_table_config.json -controllerHost pinot-controller -controllerPort 9000 -exec
```

Below is the script to ingest airplane stats data to Kafka
```SHELL
docker run --network=pinot_default apachepinot/pinot:release-0.7.1 StreamAvroIntoKafka -avroFile examples/stream/airlineStats/sample_data/airlineStats_data.avro -kafkaTopic flights-realtime -kafkaBrokerList kafka:9092 -zkAddress zookeeper:2181
```

In order to query pinot, try to open `localhost:9000` from your browser.
