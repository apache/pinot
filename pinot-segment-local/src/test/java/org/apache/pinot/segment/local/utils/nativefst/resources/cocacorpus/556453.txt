@@28295585 @1995585/ <p> It 's said , " Skiing is easy to learn , but hard to perfect . " This is due , in part , to the equipment . Some intermediate skis , which are forgiving and playful , struggle to cope with more demanding terrain and speed . Some expert skis confidently perform across all terrain at high speed , but become temperamental on mild terrain at slower speed . The RTM 78 is Volkl 's attempt to bridge these two categories of skis . This aim is achieved primarily through Volkl 's utilization of their XTD Transmission construction . This construction amasses most of the ski 's material toward the edges ensuring optimal energy transmission for confident skiing on more advanced terrain . However , the wood core is minimal , so the ski 's flex is soft , allowing relaxed skiing on moderate slopes .

@@28295666 @1995666/ <p> Long before it became a global leader in sunglass technology , Oakley was obsessed with inventing the world 's best goggles . Crowbar- Snow is the latest milestone of that 28-year obsession , and it takes goggle technology to the highest elevation of performance . <p> Crowbar- Snow is the first Oakley ski goggle with struts to balance and distribute frame pressure for all-day comfort . We engineered the contact area to match facial contouring for a precise anatomical fit . Silicone backing keeps the strap in place . Triple-layer fleece face foam maintains comfort while wicking away the sweat of all-out sessions . <p> The lightweight and flexible O Matter- frame is combined with optically pure Plutonite- lens material to achieve impact protection that meets ANSI Z87.1 standards while filtering out 100% of all UV . The extended lens size is shaped with curvature that opens your peripheral and downward view , and the patented innovations of High Definition Optics- ( HDO- ) maintain startling clarity at every angle of vision .
