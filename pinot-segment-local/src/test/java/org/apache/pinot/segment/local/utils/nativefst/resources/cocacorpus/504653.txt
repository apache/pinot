Beyond protecting products , retailers need to reinforce protections around the devices that protect their products . How are keys and tag detachers handled when not in use ? Is there an explicit policy about ignoring EAS alarms ? Ironically , one of the defenses against thieves stealing EAS tag detachers is that the detachers have their own EAS device . But if the tool is removed during a busy time for the store , when the EAS alarms are ignored , the thief has a double win . <p> The most frightening part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one store gets hit , that key/detacher can now unlock anything in that store . In fact , it can most likely unlock anything in any other store in that chain and can probably defeat the protection of any store within any chain where the same system is installed , said Karen Bomber , director of marketing operations for Tyco Retail , which sells EAS to Wal-Mart . As a practical matter , there is little defense against this problem , because there is no cost-effective way to " if you will " change the locks . <p> ( Note : It 's of some comfort that EAS label deactivation tools are much less attractive to these kinds of thieves , given the size of the deactivators and how they are typically integrated into POS stations . ) <p> From a " protect the protector " standpoint , this is reminiscent of the TJX data breach . One of the great details of that attack , although it never got much attention , is that Gonzalez 's crew apparently was able to steal the chain 's encryption key . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were also able to access the payment data before it was encrypted , so they never had a need to use the encryption key .

That 's just like not protecting your keeper key or your EAS tag detacher . <p> Is leaving the unused devices in a locked drawer or a secure backroom office so onerous ? <p> Current mechanisms all seem to focus on after-the-fact deterrents .

Does facial recognition make sense ? One vendor on Tuesday ( April 23 ) tried , with a system that allows facial recognition to unlock a refrigerator , which determines which products are removed based on weight . <p> Although the current version of the system has serious technical limitations , the potential is probably greater for facial recognition than any other technology .

And if that shopper does have a fever , how about 50 cents off Tylenol ? ) <p> As a practical matter , facial biometrics has huge potential for CRM and marketing efforts , much more so than for payment authentication . ShelfX , the vendor behind Tuesday 's introduction , is pushing its facial recognition package as a way for shoppers to charge their account when removing items from a locked refrigerator , instead of using the NFC card that shoppers are issued . <p> A minor restriction is that each store " not each chain " has its own customer database .

The system is not likely to recognize a shopper if there is even a slight change in appearance , said ShelfX CEO Ran Margalit . " Let 's say you have on sunglasses and you did n't shave today , " he said , citing two situations that could fool the system into not recognizing a shopper . " That 's why we tell you to keep your card in your pocket . " ( Here 's a rather low-cost demo of how it 's supposed to work . ) <p> If the system is that particular " and if the shopper has to bring the NFC card along anyway " it seems simpler to just use the card . Unless , of course , the shopper was given a monetary incentive to use the facial recognition system .
