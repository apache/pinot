This is because , relative to the ratio , silver is somewhat cheap . <p> Conversely , a low ratio tends to favor gold and may be a signal it 's a good time to buy the yellow metal . Many large-scale , experienced investors may trade their silver for gold as the ratio drops . <p> Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be difficult for novice or small-scale investors to read the signals and make a profit . <p> Typically , the gold-to-silver ratio serves as an impetus for diversifying holdings ( experienced investors agree that diversity is good ) . If one investment flops , alternate investments in your portfolio pick up the slack " or losses . <p> Historically , what did the Gold-to-Silver Ratio look like ? <p> Since 1687 " as far back as the records reach " the gold-to-silver ratio vacillated between roughly 14 and 100 . Around 1900 , the ratio steadied , remaining relatively flat . <p> Indeed , prior to 1900 , the gold-to-silver ratio hovered around 16 . This was likely because many countries were using gold- and silver-backed currencies . For instance , France and the United States ( among others ) assigned statutory limits on what the ratio could be . <p> Also , the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there 's 17.5 times more silver in the Earth 's crust than gold , which could provide another explanation for the pre-1900 gold-to-silver ratio average . <p> Throughout the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has fluctuated wildly at times <p> What does this mean for the future ? <p> Some experts predict the gold-to-silver ratio will return to its long-term , pre-1900 average of 16 to 1 .

It 's worth noting however , among these experts are some of the most ardent advocates for silver investing . <p> In the end , in order for the ratio to return to its pre-1900 average , the price of silver would need to rise to approximately $105 per ounce .

@@41347928 @1347928/ <h> The Amazing Purchasing Power of Silver " 1964 vs . Today <p> Most of us have either told or heard those tales of yesteryear about how you could get a hamburger for a dime , or a gallon of gas for a quarter . This was the reality in 1964 ! <p> Of course , these nostalgic facts become a bit slanted once you take income into account " in 1964 , the average wage was only $6000 per year . While there are a lot of sources documenting the decline of the dollar , there really is n't much out there illustrating the rise of silver relative to purchasing power . <p> A recent piece in Silver Enthusiast though breaks down how much things cost back in 1964 in both dollars and silver and compares these numbers to today. - If a person held onto a stash of quarters and dimes from 1964 ( extremely rare , we know ) , their purchasing power would have outpaced inflation many times over . <p> Consider the following scenarios : <p> In 1964 , it would take 10 dimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same number of dimes would buy you approximately 20 hamburgers ( value of coins = approx. $23 , hamburger = $0.99 each ) <p> At around $0.25 per gallon in 1964 , it would have cost you 13 quarters to fill up a 12-gallon tank . Today , you could buy 20 gallons of gas with the same number of quarters ( value of coins = approx. $75 , cost of gas = $3.70/gallon ) . <p> When we get into houses and cars , which are by far the two most expensive items an ordinary person will buy in their lifetime , the differences between 1964 and today are even more staggering . <p> In 1964 , a new car cost $3500 on average . Let 's say you had 3500 , silver dollars from back then . Today , a new car with an average cost of over $30,000 will only require you to give up around 1000 of those silver dollars ! <p> The average cost for a home in 1964 was $19,000 , which required 15,000 ounces of silver ( $1.30/oz ) to purchase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces of your stash " and that 's even after you factor in the average cost of a home now being $263,000 . At $32/oz , your 15k ounces of silver is worth roughly $480,000 ! ! <p> As you can imagine , there are a lot of things you can do with the additional $217,000see this quick infographic for some examples . <p> Of course , these scenarios are really just theoretical in the end . <p> Many Americans- held pre- ' 64 silver dimes , quarters and so on because they expected the metal to increase in value , and because it was actually illegal for Americans to own gold bullion at that time . During the Great Depression , all gold bullion was confiscated by the U.S. Government , and owning gold- for investment purposes was not allowed again until the 1970s . <p> In 1964 , 15,000 ounces of silver ( at $1.30/oz ) was worth roughly 3-times the average salary of $6000/year . <p> Today , 3-times the average income equals roughly $150,000 while the silver is worth almost a half a million ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace with inflation , it has covered it several times over again . <p> It 's fascinating to compare the purchasing power of silver from then to now . <p> What will be even more interesting is when today 's silver bullion investors make these comparisons 20 , 30 or 40 years from now . <p> We 're big fans of silver , as you can probably tell from roaming around our website , and pre-1964 , 90% junk silver coins are some of or favorites . Not only do these coins offer a great way to save silver for an emergency or barter situation , the precious metal within them , as you can see , helps preserve and even enhance your purchasing power over the long-term . <h> Comments <p> Indeed interesting times . Sadly it was n't sustaintable and government noticed it very fast and stopped issuing silver coins , because their melt value was higher then their monetary value . Its interesting tho , if you look back at late 19. century and how big purchasing power morgan dollars had with the same of amout of silver per dollar as these ones .

These are the standard bullion products you see readily available on the market , often with intricate designs stamped into each face .

However , pouring is a lengthy , inefficient process when compared with the more common pressing . This is especially true for lightweight , smaller silver products .

Players must earn gold ( the game 's primary source of currency ) in order to buy the wares they need to succeed on quests and in battles . <p> Much like a sovereign mint controls how much money is available for circulation , the gold available on game servers is regulated according to supply and demand by Blizzard . As far as gameplay goes , gold is essentially created by an invisible source . Players can not create gold and are not involved in the manufacture of gold coins . However , players can earn gold as a quest reward , by mining for ore , or for selling materials and wares . <p> Each playable character has a profession in WoW . Professions that involve metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reap high profits from mining as a primary profession . Various metal ores , minerals , and stones can be sold " either in raw form or after smelting ( one unit of gold ore yields one gold bar ) " to other players with differing professions for use in their own craft . Many blacksmiths and engineers maintain mining as a secondary profession so they can obtain and smelt materials they need to craft wares , rather than buying directly from miners . <p> Characters in these professions will need to go on gathering runs , during which they can mine various metals straight from the ground with a pick . In-game mineable metals include copper , tin , silver , iron , gold , cobalt , and titanium , along with a host of mythical metals like mithril , thorium , adamantite , nethercite , saronite , elementium , kyparite , and more . <p> Mining these metals takes time and investment . Your character may need to be at a certain skill level or may require new equipment in order to successfully mine for a material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft various items " like weapons , armor , stirrups ( to prevent dismounting ) , and skeleton keys ( to unlock chests ) " for your guildmates and to put up for sale in the auction house . While mining for mythical metals can enhance your in-game skills , items made from them typically do n't possess special properties . Using mythical metals is simply a selling point you can use when putting an item in the auction house , which helps drive the economy . <p> Once you 're ready to sell an item , the auction house is where most players go . There , you can see other similar items and their listed prices . This helps you set a price for your own wares . Essentially , you can charge whatever another player is willing to pay . The in-game economy is susceptible to supply and demand , much like in real life . Because of this , you may see inflation in the price of certain goods that are rare or in high demand . <p> Plenty of players seek armor , weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battles . But success may come at a higher price , as you may also need enchantments and buff potions to enhance your strength and other stats . Nearly every boss battle and dungeon raid requires every participating player to be equipped with a potion and flask , which can be bought from an alchemist . Whereas blacksmiths and engineers work predominately with metals , alchemists work with botanicals and herbs . Because of how important potions are to every player , flowers drive the in-game economy more than metals . <p> But the monetary system of the game is still made of metal . This currency is measured in copper , silver , and gold coins . Silver and copper , though present , are scarcely used and can only fund low-cost items such as ink . Gold coins reign as the top form of currency within the game . On top of buying goods like potions and weapons , the gold you amass as you play can also pay for services like armor repair . <p> Players also have the option to use real money to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to redesign your character , transfer to a different realm , or switch to a new faction ( factions include the Horde and the Alliance ) . You can also turn in your token for a free month of gameplay or sell your token in the auction house . Flipping perspectives , successful players who have earned a large sum of gold can buy these tokens in the auction house and use them to earn free gameplay for as many months as they can keep it up . <p> Part of the reason this game has been so popular for over a decade is because of the intricacies of the fantasy world of Azeroth , which is where much of World of Warcraft is set . The complex economic and monetary systems in place continually provide players with challenges and opportunities to earn new skills . <h> Comments <p> I 'd suggest using Iron rather than Gold as an example mining and smelting metal , to avoid confusion with the currency of the same name . <p> Silver and copper coins are simply fractions of gold . I think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a price might be designated as 25.05.99 gold , or 25.0599g . <p> I highly recommend that one use the Auctioneer addon to " play " the auction house . It gathers data about the entire market and provides very useful enhancements for pricing your items for sale and getting the best deal on items to buy . It adds information to your inventory to help you determine the relative value of your possessions . <p> You have also described the in game basic economy at Everquest ( copper , silver , gold and platinum however ) . Everquest II ( also copper , silver , gold and platinum ) , and Guildwars II ( copper , silver and gold ) . <p> Each of the above also has specialized earned currencies such as honor points , karma points , shards , etc. in each of the various games utilized for specific vendor purchases , faction purchases , etc . <p> It was n't misspent if you enjoyed playing ! These games are so fully immersive and developed that they are n't  just games anymore ; they help teach real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about Everquest and Guildwars as well !

@@41347975 @1347975/ <h> The Metals of Star Wars <p> Rogue One , the latest movie in the Star Wars franchise , is currently in theaters and many moviegoers have enjoyed diving back into the action-packed , droid-filled , lightsaber-swinging universe . Because the franchise has spanned movies , books , and TV shows for decades , the details that have been created to bring the stories to life are nothing short of spectacular . <p> In addition to a host of planets , species , and robots , Star Wars also created fictional metals that can be found on various worlds . Extreme fans may know about the metals ' origins , uses , and even mining techniques . Let 's explore some of the most popular metals created by the Star Wars franchise in more detail . <p> Beskar : Also known as Mandalorian iron , beskar is found on Mandalore and its moon , Concordia . The metal is durable and exceptionally strong , with the ability to withstand blows from a lightsaber . Beskar 's natural strength is amplified during the forging process , using techniques that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their secrets to outsiders for any price . It is used to make Mandalorian armor , various weapons ( including lightsaber hilts ) , handheld shields , and starships . <p> Carbonite : Perhaps best known for the trapping of Han Solo by Darth Vader , carbonite is a liquid made from carbon gas that could be made solid through rapid freezing . Carbon-freezing is used to encase goods for preservation and for putting people into a state of hibernation , which was used for long voyages across space before the invention of hyperdrive . Some mining droids are also made out of carbonite because of its heat-resistant properties . <p> Phrik : Mined on Gromas , phrik is a rare , nearly indestructible metallic compound . It 's so durable that a container of the metal was able to stay intact on Alderaan when the planet was blown up by the Death Star . Phrik is used to make lightweight , durable battle armor , along with various melee weapons and lightsaber hilts .

Additionally , the Imperial Palace walls are lined with cortosis ore for protection . <p> Songsteel : This lightweight , luminescent silver metal is used to make swords and staves . Songsteel is generally reserved for high-class weapons because of how tedious it is to forge and shape . Similar to phrik and cortosis , songsteel is also resistant to lightsaber strikes , making it an ideal choice for weaponry . <p> It 's impressive that a fictional world has been able to fabricate details so intricate , they 're almost tangible .

It tells the story of Alexander Hamilton , an immigrant who came to America during the fight for independence from Great Britain , who ended up playing a critical role in shaping the United States government and economy . The popularity of Miranda 's musical has caused people from all over to re-study the history of America 's beginnings , along with introducing the masses to a new type of musical theatre . <p> Since Hamilton was heavily involved in developing America 's banking system , and since one of our writers is a huge fan of the musical , we did n't want to throw away our shot to write about the founding father on our blog . Let 's go ! <p> Alexander Hamilton was born in the British West Indies , where he began working at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to keep financial records and gained experience in international commerce . Impressed by his ambition and an eloquent letter he wrote about a hurricane that destroyed his town , Hamilton 's employer gathered a pool of money to send him to the mainland for a proper education . <p> Hamilton arrived in New York in 1773 at age 16 . He enrolled in King 's College ( present day Columbia University ) , but he left before graduating to join forces with the Patriots in protest of British control of the colonies . He fought in several battles during the Revolutionary War and then in 1777 , General George Washington hired Hamilton as his aide-de-camp . Hamilton became a trusted advisor to the General for the next five years , handling his correspondence , composing strategic reports , and rallying supplies and funds for the war . But all the while , his head was full of fantasies of fighting in the war , which he believed would help him rise above his station once the war was over . <p> In 1781 , Washington granted Hamilton permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorktown . It was a victorious endeavor that soon resulted in British surrender and later , peace treaties that officially marked the end of the war . <p> After the war , Hamilton remained focused on his career . He believed that American states were too divided and required a strong central government in order to truly achieve independence . Hamilton left his post as Washington 's advisor in 1782 to study law . After passing the bar , he established a practice in New York City and was involved in cases that helped create the judicial review system . But politics and public service continued to call to him . <p> Hamilton served as a New York delegate at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 , where he promoted his agenda for a stronger federal government under a new constitution . He became a major proponent for the constitution , collaborating with James Madison and John Jay to write the Federalist Papers in defense of the document . The constitution was ratified in 1788 and Washington was elected the first president of the United States in 1789 . <p> Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a daunting job since the fledgling nation had accrued large amounts of domestic and foreign war debt . Hamilton set out to create economic policies that would rid the nation of debt and promote the central government . Some of the policies he proposed included initiating the payment of federal war bonds , having the federal government assume states ' debts , and instituting a federal system for taxation under which government revenue would be based on custom duties . <p> Additionally , Hamilton proposed a national bank and after Congress ' approval in 1791 , the Bank of the United States was created . The bank was able to lend money to the government in order to pay off state debts . Additionally , the bank issued the first American paper money , promoted businesses by extending credit , and offered government subsidies to manufacturers to help them compete with European imports . <p> Hamilton had also planned to establish a US Mint under the Treasury Department , but it ended up being established under the State Department in 1792 . However , the mint was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hamilton 's beliefs and policies were controversial during that time period , and he had many disagreements with other cabinet members . State loyalists were fearful of a central government holding so much power and fought back against the federal assumption of state debts . Thomas Jefferson became one of his main adversaries when it came to political and economic pursuits . Jefferson claimed that Hamilton 's bank exceeded the powers of the constitution , while Hamilton believed it to be necessary in order to strengthen the country 's economy . The disagreement between these two men led to a fracture deep enough to create the nation 's first political parties , with Hamilton leading the Federalist party and Jefferson leading the Democratic Republican party . <p> In 1790 , Hamilton was able to reach a compromise with the opposing party that called for the nation 's capital to be transferred to a new site built near the Potomac River in return for Congress approving policies that supported a central government over states ' rights . <p> Hamilton resigned as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 , after single-handedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to law , he remained an important figure in the field of politics . During the election of 1800 , Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in a vote for the presidency . Though he never saw eye to eye with Jefferson , Hamilton endorsed his campaign , believing him to be the lesser of two evils and trusting him to not abuse the power of the presidency . Burr , who was once a friend of Hamilton 's , lost the election to Jefferson . Later , Burr ran for the New York governorship and again lost after Hamilton spoke out against his ability to be a political leader . <p> Enraged and convinced that Hamilton was to blame for his career failures , Burr challenged him to a duel . Both men arrived in Weehawken , New Jersey early on the morning of July 11 , 1804 , pistols in hand . Burr 's shot fatally wounded Hamilton ; he died the next day in his New York home . Hamilton 's wife , Elizabeth Schuyler , dedicated her remaining 50 years to preserving Alexander 's legacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizable as some of the other founding fathers , but he is remembered as the architect of our country 's banking and economic system . His work placed America on an equal financial footing with many European nations , and created the foundation for our modern capitalist economy . It 's only fitting that he 's pictured on the US ten dollar bill , one of very few Americans who never held the presidency to be featured on US currency . And though you may not remember much about Hamilton from your history classes , the highly successful Broadway musical is reminding everyone about how Hamilton started as an orphan immigrant and became a founding father of the United States of America . <p> To own your own piece of American history , we recommend the 2017 American Silver Eagle produced by the US Mint .

Even in most presidential campaigns , at least one candidate proposes the reintroduction of the gold standard . <p> This begs the question : What is the gold standard ? And if it is so good , why did we abandon it ? <p> The gold standard is an economic system in which the value of a currency is determined by ( and exchangeable for ) gold . <p> One of the benefits of the gold standard is that when the currency is pegged to a finite resource like gold , outrageous government spending tends to be curbed .

As a result , they invented the gold standard . No longer would people have to carry and store heavy gold bullion or gold coins . Faith was placed in the government that their paper money would be worth something should they want to convert it back to a physical asset .

Paper money , in this scenario , was not separate from gold and could be converted . <p> This system lasted until World War I. While this period was not free of its share of financial crises , it is considered by some historians to be the most economically stable period in American history . <h> 1900 <p> Concerned that the country might revert back to using gold and silver , Congress decided to pass the Gold Standard Act , which made gold the standard currency .

Convertibility from paper to gold was ended . President Roosevelt , in effect , decided to nationalize gold when he issued an executive order making it so that all gold coins and bullion had to be relinquished to the federal government .

First up , we have the World War II ghost train of gold , often referred to as the nazi gold train . <p> World War II brought to life many horrific situations , along with some mysterious events that have yet to be solved . It is widely known that after capturing Jews and other victims of the Holocaust , the nazis stole artwork and other valuables from emptied homes and even some museums . The nazis hid their stolen loot to ensure they had a source of income after the war ended . Some of these goods were said to have been loaded onto a train that disappeared into history . <p> According to legend , the 495-foot train loaded with millions of dollars ' worth of valuables , guns , and other equipment vanished into a system of secret tunnels underneath the Owl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to have entered a tunnel in 1945 in what was then Germany , near present day Walbrzych , and never emerged . It was supposedly fleeing the advancing Soviet forces as WWII drew close to an end . <p> Believers expect that the train was buried in the tunnels and mines that were part of an unfinished , secret nazi project referred to as Project Riese ( which means giant in German ) . Historians have pointed out that nazi-dug tunnels run throughout the southwest mountains in present day Poland , which was one of the biggest construction projects in the history of the Third Reich . It 's still unclear why these tunnels were dug . Some think that a possible reason was to hide loot from excavated secret railway stashes . This also leads some people think that the Germans ' need for secrecy is why there 's no documentation of the ghost train . <p> Since the end of the war , many searches have been conducted to find the ghost train , though there is no concrete proof that it ever existed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men claimed to have received a deathbed confession about the train 's whereabouts . The men originally remained anonymous and sought to gain 10 percent of the value of the train 's treasures in return for revealing its location . After working with the Polish government , the two men went public and released images taken with a ground penetrating radar system that appeared to show a man-made shaft with a large object , presumed to be the train . In fact , the two men claimed it was a 500-foot long armored train equipped with gun platforms and loaded with precious metals . The Polish police force and military got involved to keep treasure hunters away from the area while it was checked for mines and other booby traps . After it was determined that there were no explosives , mining specialists came in to non-invasively assess the site . No hard evidence of a train was found . <p> Later , the two men gained permission and began digging at the site .

King Midas was widely known for both his wisdom and his extreme greed . He used his power as a monarch to accumulate a vast amount of wealth . <p> One day , Dionysus , the god of fertility and wine , passed through Phrygia with a group of friends who had been traveling with him . One of these friends was Silenus , a satyr who was somewhat of a right-hand man to Dionysus ( he was once the god 's schoolmaster and foster father ) . Silenus was perhaps celebrating their return a bit too hard and drunkenly wandered off into King Midas ' rose garden and promptly fell asleep . <p> The palace guards brought the intruder to King Midas , who recognized him immediately .

When Midas stepped into the river , he felt the power flow from his body into the water , turning the sand in the riverbed to gold . Midas then placed everything affected by the golden touch into the river and the effects were reversed . <p> Following the onset and subsequent removal of the golden touch ( also known as the Midas touch ) , the king decided to deny riches going forward . He retreated to the countryside to live a more humble life . <p> Midas may have been an overly greedy fool , but it is prudent for individuals and families to invest in precious metals to protect your financial future .

@@41348043 @1348043/ <h> 9 Step Process for Discovering , Mining &amp; Refining Gold <p> We 've no doubt all seen the old western movies of the prospector with a pan in the river searching for gold . In early America , pioneers sunk their fortunes into searching for gold this way . <p> In modern times though , mining for gold is a much more intensive , yet sophisticated process . Most surface , or alluvial gold has been found , which is why gold is mainly mined from the earth today . It 's largely a matter of technology and requires much expertise and elaborate equipment . <p> Mining for gold today can essentially be broken down into 9 steps . Continue reading to learn more about how gold is discovered , how it 's brought out of the ground and how it 's refined to produce beautiful gold coins , bars , jewelry and other items . <p> Step #1 " Finding Deposits <p> The first step is discovering where gold deposits may be . Geologists use special geology ' maps to look for promising areas to explore further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine if any gold is in the ground beneath . <p> Step #2 " Analysis of Promising Areas <p> Once some promising areas are identified through their geological characteristics , targets for drill testing are outlined using a variety of techniques , including remote sensing , geophysics and geochemistry ( both air and ground based ) . <p> Step #3 " Drill Testing/Samples <p> Next , rock samples are taken through drill testing and analyzed . Geologists and mining engineers use these samples to determine if gold actually exists , the size of the deposit and the quality of gold in the ground beneath . This information is used to determine if enough gold exists under the surface to make mining worthwhile . <p> Step #4 " Type of mine <p> If it 's determined the amount and quality of deposits makes mining worthwhile , engineers will next determine the type of mine that 's needed , any physical obstacles and the impact the mine will have on the surrounding environment . <p> Step #5 " Building Infrastructure <p> Before any mining can take place , infrastructure like roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-pit mines can take up to a year to construct before any mining can occur . And since many potential mines are in remote areas , entire infrastructures like roads , administrative offices , equipment storage areas and even whole towns have to be built . Much of the time , it can be up to 5 years between the times discovery is made to when actual mining takes place . <p> Step #6 " Mining samples and determining processing <p> Once mining gets underway , samples must be taken to determine the precise metallurgical qualities of the ore . This is done in order to determine the appropriate processing technique . <p> Step #7 " Processing ( on-site ) <p> Once ore is extracted , processing it into pure gold must be done . Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals . Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing . <p> Step #8 Refining ( off-site ) <p> Once basic processing is done , the ore is taken to a refinery where the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with chloride , which converts any remaining foreign metals to chloride which will then drift off the gold . The result is 99.5% pure gold , which is then cast into electrodes ( known as anodes ) where it is then placed into an electrolytic cell .

In the old days , the mine would be boarded up and abandoned . Today though , a reclamation project is done to try and return the land to its previous natural state " as much as possible anyway . <p> As you can see , the process of taking metal ore from the earth and converting it to gold bullion is quite extensive and requires a lot - front-end investment and time .

@@41348054 @1348054/ <h> The Wolverine , and His Metallic Origin <p> Logan , Hugh Jackman 's last movie as the X-Man known as Wolverine , is currently in theaters and appealing to comic and superhero fans around the world . Like kryptonite is associated with Superman and vibranium is associated with Captain America , adamantium is the predominant focus in the world of Wolverine . In fact , Wolverine 's iconic claws are made of the the metal . But what is it ? <p> Adamantium is an iron-based alloy that was artificially created within the Marvel Comics universe . It is incredibly dense and strong , making it nearly indestructible . An adamantium blade can cut almost any known substance , with the exception of Captain America 's shield . <p> The metal was first created in the comics when Dr. Myron MacLain attempted to create a strong metal alloy for Americans to use as a weapon during World War II . During his experimentation , he fell asleep and the materials he was working with " steel , vibranium , and other metals " bonded together . Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to replicate it in that form . This original adamantium sample is known as Proto-Adamantium and was eventually worked into Captain America 's shield . <p> In an attempt to recreate the original formula , True Adamantium was developed . It 's nearly as strong and durable as the original form of the metal , but it can be reproduced ( albeit at an astronomical cost ) . The formula became a US government secret , and was rarely used because of how difficult and expensive it is to synthesize . In an effort to cut costs , Secondary Adamantium was developed . It is still a strong metal , but characters with superhuman strength are able to damage it . <p> Despite the expense , it was True Adamantium that was fused with Wolverine 's skeleton . Early in life , Logan developed the mutant ability to heal rapidly , along with strength , speed , heightened senses , and animalistic instincts . His ability to heal quickly made him a prime candidate for the Weapon X project , a government project dedicated to weaponizing superpowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was subjected to a grueling surgery that no one else could 've survived , in which adamantium was fused to his entire skeleton . He was also given his famed retractable claws . Logan became the project 's most successful subject , though he later escaped and joined forces with the X-Men . <p> Logan 's healing abilities not only allowed him to survive the surgery , but it also caused a molecular change in the adamantium . The metal did not inhibit the biological processes of his bones and began to act like a part of his body , allowing him to regenerate adamantium . This effectively created a new form of adamantium , known as Adamantium Beta . <p> Since all forms of adamantium are strong , it 's almost impossible to break or damage Wolverine 's claws . He was transformed into a deadly fighter who essentially can not be disarmed since his claws are housed within his own forearms . There are a few instances in the comics where Wolverine 's claws were damaged by a particularly strong enemy , but he was able to regrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One particularly gruesome scene showed Magneto , a villain with the ability to control metal , ripping the adamantium from Wolverine 's body . The act resulted in Wolverine needing a lengthy break , but he did regenerate his skeleton and claws eventually . <p> If adamantium was a real metal , there 's no doubt it would be incredibly valuable . But we 'll just have to live with real life metals like gold and silver . Fortunately , the Superman Then and Now coin and stamp set is a great investment option for comic book and superhero fans . <p> Wolverine is a well-known character in pop culture , but we want to know which X-Man is your favorite !

Why is there a 68:1 gold to silver ratio when it seems gold is more easily mined and does n't face the same consumption habits as silver ? <p> I share the theories of many others who believe in silver spot price is controlled by a combination of a few factors ; I believe price manipulation is alive and well . Several large banks are currently under fire for their roles in verified price rigging . I believe more banks will be prosecuted in the near future , as well . <p> In addition to banks , industry has a huge interest in keeping silver prices low . By undervaluing the metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I harped on this last week , but I do believe silver has a marketing problem , as well . If the general public truly understood the investment opportunity silver presents at current spot prices , I think we would consistently be sold out of silver . <p> So , while gold is more rare below the surface , silver is more rare and undervalued above ground . Silver has been operating at a supply deficit for many years , and I think it 's only a matter of time before spot price reconciles with the true value of this beautiful bullion . <p> Share your thoughts on silver ! Did you know silver is more rare above ground than silver ? Where do you see the price of silver going in the next 5 years ? 10 years ? <p> Like most things in life , driven by fear . When England had the Brexit vote silver went from around $14 beginning of 2016 to $21 by August 1 . In a short 7 months silver increased 50% on a fear of an event not to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $16 In 12 months saw a 50% increase and a 24% decrease to finish up 14% . <p> Trump becomes President , announces a travel ban from a few countries , fear sent silver from $16-$18 up 12.5% . Nothing to do with actual physical supply and demand but perceived safeguards . <p> Can these numbers be " fixed " ? Absolutely . Unless some one can physically see and document each hoard , its a sight unseen sorta thing . <p> Since silver is lower priced , I can imagine that its uses are used a lot more than gold . Where gold plated electronics may cost more the same can be done with silver at close to 70 times less . <p> Pricing might be related to politics in the end , and my gripe is with the ratio between gold and silver . The only way for silver to get the rarity tag is for some organization to try to make a major purchase and that amount is currently unavailable . Then , heads may turn . <p> Like anything else , sources will end drying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the stock market . If there is a " projected harvest " of a precious metal and if the precious metal fails to meet that goal , silver then has a 3 month window at a new bottom pricing . <p> Indicators are getting a bit tougher to analyze and predict when silver is going to climb by a significant amount . Most " major " climbs in silver is about seventy-five cents or more an ounce . Watch this happen IF the Feds in the USA raise the interest rate in mid March . Then silver will head back a positive direction , at least for several months . <p> Honestly ? I do n't  see a major increase in silver spot prices . It took a HUGE effort by the Hunt Brothers , and silver climbed how much ? To near 40$ USD ? I think when the US government issues a declaration that cull coins are allowed to be melted and used for other purposes is a state to where the availability of silver has been acknowledged and silver would start to climb in an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce per year . The gap of gold to silver would be forced to be at a closer ratio , probably at 50:1 or so . Then let the political and corporation greed commence once again . <p> Greatly stated ! I highly agree silver to be considerably undervalued and this places the commodity in a position to be prone to explosive gains once its true value becomes more apparent . Silver is truly a Hold and Wait investment . <p> I stack silver and have more silver than gold due to my budgets . That being said , I read and hear all the time that silver is being " consumed or used for industry " , solar power and the such ! I can not believe that story at all ! Metals can be recycled ! We see how hobbyist are recycling electronic parts to gain a few grams of gold these days . Recycling of silver can and will occur if its that sought after . <p> Another thing to note is that over seas silver mines rarely publish accurate mining stats for their own financial gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ! I believe that silver is over over priced at the moment ! <p> Well , one difference with silver is it is highly consumed in ways that are n't  recyclable- like medicine . But , I do agree , there are stockpiles of discarded electronics which could be recycled . I know China started a recycling program to repatriate silver and gold from electronics . <p> Also , that 's an interesting point about the overseas mines . I 'd like to do some more research on that .

The Articles of Confederation left it up to individual states to print their own money , which led to many disputes and general monetary chaos . <p> Once the Articles of Confederation were dissolved and the United States Constitution was put into place , it was determined that the government would take control of the United States ' currency .

Firstly , the Confederate states , with only access to the southern mints , were forced to use high-value gold coins as currency . The Union states , with smaller-value copper and silver coinage , were better able to stabilize their dollar while the Confederacy experienced a severe inflation . <p> Secondly , both sides began printing paper money as a substitute to precious metals currency , and this caused the Confederacy to suffer even further inflation .

@@41348096 @1348096/ <h> Friday Fables : The Beale Ciphers <p> The Beale Ciphers , also known as the Beale Papers , are a set of ciphers dating back to the 1800s that supposedly detail the contents and location of buried treasure in Virginia . These ciphers have baffled many people for centuries ; some have even started digging without first cracking the code . Still , there are others who question the authenticity of the ciphers and the information that was published along with them . We 'll tell the story and let you decide if you think the Beale Ciphers could be real or fake . <p> In 1817 , Thomas J. Beale led a party of 30 men on a buffalo hunt in a region north of Santa Fe . The men wound up discovering a rich vein of gold and abandoned the hunt in favor of mining . They accumulated a large store of gold and other metals over the next two years and ultimately decided to bring it back to Virginia by wagon . Once back home , they buried the gold , silver , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet below the surface . It 's estimated that the modern value of this cache is approximately 30 million dollars . <p> Beale and his group entrusted their secret to Robert Morriss , an innkeeper in Lynchburg . Beale gave Morriss an iron box and instructed him to keep it sealed for ten years while the men traveled west again to accumulate more riches . If they failed to return after ten years passed , Morriss was to open the box and follow the instructions within . <p> The men did not return and it took Morriss 23 years to open the box . Inside , he found a letter telling him to uncover the treasure and disperse it to the men 's surviving relatives . Along with the letter , there were three cryptograms that , once decoded , would divulge the location of the treasure , the contents of the cache , and information about the family members of the men . Morriss was supposed to receive a key for decoding the cryptograms , but it never arrived . He spent years trying to decrypt the messages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died , Morriss passed the cryptograms to James B. Ward in 1863 . By accident , Ward solved the second cryptogram cipher by using the Declaration of Independence to decode the message . It listed the contents of the secret vault . However , Ward was unable to decrypt the other two messages after years of trying . He decided to publicize the cryptograms to remove the responsibility from his own shoulders . In 1885 , he published a pamphlet with the very long title of The Beale Papers containing Authentic Statements regarding the TREASURE BURIED in 1819 and 1821 , near Bufords , in Bedford County , Virginia , and Which Has Never Been Recovered . Each copy was sold for 50 cents , which is approximately $13 today . <p> Since the publication , thousands of people have attempted to decode the messages , but none have been successful . Some people skipped the ciphers all together and began digging in locations that they thought to be promising . The Beale Cypher Association was founded in 1968 , with the hope that a large pool of talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has contributed to historical research that has helped us understand the bigger picture of the tale , but the remaining ciphers have not been cracked and no treasure has been found . <p> Some research has led many people to believe that the Beale Ciphers and the entire story are actually a hoax . What 's lead to that belief ? Many of the clues involve inaccuracies found in Ward 's pamphlet , such as an incorrect date for when Morriss became the innkeeper at the Washington Hotel and using words that were n't found in print until many years after the publication . <p> Additionally , there is no solid evidence that a Thomas Beale lived in Virginia at that time , neither is there documentation of his expedition out west . Finally , the accuracy of the reproduced ciphers can not be verified because the original Beale Ciphers were reportedly lost in a fire at the Virginia Job Print plant . <p> Many skeptics believe that Ward created the entire legend , which he then wrote into a pamphlet and proceeded to sell it . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original papers and the pamphlet suggest that they were written by the same individual . Further , some believe he drew inspiration from several popular works of fiction . One of these is Edgar Allan Poe 's story The Gold Bug , which also included cryptograms . Another stems from a Kentucky legend about a man who discovered a silver mine . Other people believe that Ward was in fact a Freemason , drawing parallels in his story to several Masonic rites . <p> A computer study of the two undeciphered messages conducted in 1971 concluded that they contain cyclic patterns in the numbers , suggesting that they are encoded in a similar fashion to the decoded second cipher . <p> Though evidence suggests the Beale Ciphers are nothing more than an elaborate hoax , there are still cryptographers and treasure hunters who continue to work hard at cracking the code . Even if the treasure does n't actually exist , they 're spurred on by the thrill of solving a riddle that has baffled so many people . <p> Fortunately , you do n't need to decode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add value to your bullion portfolio with the 2017 American Gold Eagle coins , which come in a variety of weights . <p> What do you think about the Beale Ciphers ?

Because prices change by the minute , many are confused when it comes to how these spot prices are determined on such a fluctuating basis . <p> Here , we will take a look at what exactly spot prices are , how they 're determined , and how you can use spot prices in your next precious metal investment . <h> What is a Spot Price ? <p> A spot price is typically defined as the current market price for which a commodity can be bought or sold in the present moment .

If you decide to wait and buy your gold based on the spot price come December , you risk buying for a lower price should the market fall in that direction . Buyers usually use futures contracts to protect their price point , but others still pay spot price for immediate purchases . <h> How are Spot Prices Determined ? <p> Spot prices for precious metals are mostly speculation , but they are typically determined by looking at futures contracts and exchanges in the coming months . <p> When determining the spot price for precious metals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Copper is soft , easily manipulated , and conducts heat wonderfully , making it an ideal metal of choice for jewelry , building material , and coinage . <p> For thousands of years , copper has been sharing its wonderful properties with humans . Continue reading to learn more about copper 's history and its most common modern uses . <h> Earliest History <p> Historians are not certain , but copper has been a pivotal part of history for at least the last 11,000 years . It is believed to have first been used around 9000 BCE in the Middle East . Pure copper occurs naturally in nature and it is easily mined , so methods of extracting copper from its ores ( smelting ) arose early . <p> Copper 's first wide usage was mostly for ornamentation . This included jewelry , combs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistry . The early Mesopotamians shared their love of copper with the ancient Egyptians . <p> Around this time , it was discovered that melted copper could be fashioned and hardened into tools , and the ancient Egyptians made use of this property . They began using copper to make agricultural tools as well as cookware , saws , knives , etc . The Egyptians are also credited with making the first copper alloys . They discovered that copper could be made stronger when it was mixed with tin or other metals . Thus , bronze was born . <h> The Bronze Age and the Romans <p> The Egyptians discovered bronze by mixing copper with either arsenic or tin , although tin became preferred due to arsenic 's toxic fumes and tin 's malleability . It is believed that bronze was first produced by the Egyptians around 4,000 BCE and soon spread to other parts of Western Asia and Europe . <p> Bronze is much harder than copper and less easily manipulated . It can be shaped and hardened fairly easily . When iron smelting became popular , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Romans began widely importing copper from mines all across their empire and began using the metal for engineering purposes , musical instruments , armor , and weaponry ( until iron came along ) . <p> Another important use of copper for the Romans was for coinage . <h> Copper in Coins <p> Copper , and copper alloys in particular , were used for coinage as early as the 3rd century BCE . Initially , copper lumps were used as coinage , with their value depending on size . However , this soon changed . Coins created from copper alloys became popular and changed depending on which ruler was in power . For example , Julius Caesar preferred his coins to be made from brass ( an alloy of copper and zinc ) , while Octavius Augustus Caesar 's coins were made from a copper-lead-tin alloy . <p> Copper was the ideal metal for coin-making . Copper and its alloys actively resisted wear and corrosion over time , and they could be manipulated to include detailed works of art on their faces . They were also recyclable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread throughout the world and its use in coinage is global . In the United States , gold and silver were originally used for coins , but the price of these precious metals became too much . Instead , copper and its alloys took their place . American pennies were originally made from pure copper , and alloys of copper and nickel were used to produce dimes and nickels . The World Wars caused a copper shortage in America , and so the metal was conserved for use in weaponry and ammunition . <p> Today , many bronze-colored coins are made from copper-plated zinc or steel . This includes the U.S. penny and the United Kingdom 's 1-pound and 2-pound coins . <h> Modern Copper Uses <p> From the time of the Romans to today , copper has continued to be used widely . Renaissance artists used copper for sculpting ( again , because of its flexibility ) , and it is still used for that purpose today .

Everything from construction materials to household appliances and your smartphone contain copper . Some of copper 's most common modern uses include the following : <h> Electrical <p> Copper is highly valued for its electrical conductivity , and this is what the majority of copper is used for today . Copper is used widely in generators , transformers , and electrical wiring for numerous devices including computers , cell phones , and automobiles as well as household appliances like microwaves and washing machines . <h> Construction <p> Copper 's durability and resistance to water make it a top choice for many construction materials and projects , especially those that could come in contact with water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can take place within water .

@@41348134 @1348134/ <h> 5 Step Process for Minting Silver Coins <p> Ever wonder how pure silver ( or gold ) is transformed into those shiny coins we all love ? <p> Creating silver bullion coins involves a 5-step processduring this process , strikers take special care to ensure purity , texture , weight and other important aspects of making a quality silver coin . <p> Continue reading for a breakdown of this process .

Melting <p> The first step in this process is to melt 99.9% pure silver in a furnace burning at about 2000 degrees . Once melted , the molten silver is poured into these cylindrical billets . When solidified , one of these billets weighs 810 ounces . <p> 2 . Extrude <p> Once the billets ' are formed , they are then taken to an extruder where it 's forced through to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , workers check both sides for any scratches . After it cools , the strips are cut into smaller lengths . <p> 3 . Blanks <p> Once the silver strips are cut into more manageable pieces , they are then sent into a press that punches the silver strip into 1-oz rounds . These blanks ' as they 're called are each weighed to ensure the final coin will weigh the correct amount . <p> 4 . Burnish <p> This essentially cleans the blanks and gives the silver coins that signature shine we all know and love . Blanks are cleaned using these very small 6 mm balls ( almost like a b-b ) called satellites ' that rub the coins and make them shiny . <p> 5 . Strike/Press <p> Next , minters take the burnished blanks and press the coin 's final design in . These designs are initially etched into a steel die , which is then used to press the design into the silver blank . Once the coins are pressed , silver coins are ready for shipment . <p> Check out this interesting video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this video are not for sale to the general public , this is the general process mints use to make shiny silver ( and gold ) coins . <h> Comments <p> The silver bullion is going to break through all benchmarks for the year and ill tell you why . Silver is now trading at about $34 which is significantly lower than its inflation adjusted all time highs . We all know that both the domestic and international markets have been having a lot of trouble lately.To top it off the use of Silver in manufacturing has increased , What this means is that the amount of silver that is unrecoverable has increased and supplies are depleted ( because of the prohibitively high price of extracting silver after its been used in manufacturing applications ) . This means only one thing silver may become a stronger safe heaven for investors trying to hedge a falling market . I was skeptical at first myself but the indicators are all pointing in the right direction on this one

These coins were minted the year that President Franklin Roosevelt issued a seizure of all gold coinage . The 145,000 Eagles that had been minted for the year were not yet in circulation , and they were all destroyed.all except a rare and mysterious few . <p> In 2002 , Joan Langbord , the daughter of a late Philadelphia jeweler named Israel Swift , found 10 of these Double Eagles in a safety deposit box belonging to her father . When she took them to the government to be authenticated , they were deemed authentic and then seized . <p> In 2011 , the court determined that the gold seizure was warranted because Mint records showed that no Double Eagles ought to have been released to the public . Since they all should have been destroyed , the court decided that Swift 's Eagles must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mint . <p> In the 1940s , several St. Gaudens Eagles were found in circulation ; their origins had also traced back to Swift . Swift told the government at that time that he did n't  know where exactly the coins had come from , that they had been traded in with large collections . All the coins found in circulation at that point were destroyed . <p> While the court agreed with the government 's rights to the coins during their 2011 ruling , the Court of Appeals overturned the decision this past April , and required the government to return the coins to Langbord and her sons . <p> In 2001 , one of these Double Golden Eagle coins sold for $7.8 million dollars .

@@41348161 @1348161/ <h> The Value of Modern Numismatic Coins <h> Provident Metals explores the overlooked market and value of modern gold and silver numismatic coins <p> Provident Metals provides multiple ways to invest in physical bullion . Most investment precious metals are purchased as bullion , but many coin collectors choose to invest in numismatic coins . What is the difference between bullion and numismatic coins ? In this article , we discuss this difference and take a closer look at why modern numismatic coins have a value proposition worth considering . <h> Numismatic coins <p> Numismatic coins are coins that are collected primarily for their rarity and historical significance . The market value of a numismatic coin is typically more than the face value of the coin and the value of the weight of precious metals the coin contains . Numismatic coins are usually coins that are no longer produced and not in circulation , but rather kept and sold by coin collectors . <h> Bullion <p> Bullion , by definition , typically refers to gold ( or other precious metals like silver or copper ) bars or ingots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to coins and rounds . Bullion coins are coins minted by governments for the purposes of investment , while bullion rounds are minted by private mints for the same purpose . Bullion , whatever type it is , is considered valuable because of the content of its precious metal . <h> Modern Numismatic Coins <p> Modern Numismatic Coins , on the other hand , are coins or rounds that are minted in modern times . They may be minted primarily as investment rounds ( bullion ) , but their intricate designs and their increased rarity as time goes on means that they have the potential to become valuable numismatically valuable . <p> Just received my bullion and I am very happy with quality and the speed of delivery . I will continue to be a customer . - James G. <p> Thank you for professional business transactions . I have recommended you to all my friends . - Levi C. <p> I absolutely love Provident Metals . I think that you guys are the best online bullion dealer out there . PPM has such low prices , fast shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understanding the Value of Modern Numismatic Coins <p> What would be the benefit of buying modern numismatic coins compared to standard bullion or numismatic coins ? Primarily they have a good value proposition . Their limited mintage increases their value in secondary markets like EBay or pawnshops . <p> For example , Provident Metals produced the Zombucks Walker 1oz silver round at a mintage of a little under 48,000 . When these 48,000 coins sold out from the primary retailer , their value significantly increased on the secondary market , especially for collectors seeking to acquire the entire Zombucks series . So a round that might have sold for a relatively low price in 2013 is already opening at an auction price of $60 or more just three years later . At the point where the market value of the round has outpaced the value of the silver content , the coin is more of a modern numismatic coin than bullion . <p> Another benefit of modern numismatic coins is that you 're able to collect these coins in bulk like bullion something that is n't always possible with traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mint tube of 20 or a monster box of 500 . Furthermore , these modern numismatic coins may qualify for your precious metals IRA , which means that you can invest in both their bullion content and collectability.

My only hesitation about my last order was that the older dimes in it were worn to the point of almost being blank backed- in other words , no dates or denominations were visible . For people to use these coins as future barter or to sell in a pinch , future buyers need to know these coins are on the up and up . Blank backed coins would be readily rejected by many who are not knowledgable about them . If premiums are going to rise on these , which they will due to demand , the pieces should be sold with dates and the blanks sold in a separate category as culls . Other than that suggestion , I was pleased by Provident 's services and prices . <p> Awesome value , beautiful coins <p> Tim on 12/7/12 <p> If you 're buying silver for silver ( that 's the point , is n't it ? ) , then cheaper is better .

I did some research and 1967 and 1968 candian coins were made differently . Some were made with only 50% silver and others were made with the standard 80% . There is no discernible way to tell if you have a 50% or 80% coin . There was one 1967 coin in my bag , however there was also a 1955 US quarter .

What copper may lack in aesthetics ( compared to its popular yellow cousin anyway ) , it makes up for in other important ways . <p> For example , copper is one of the most useful metals on Earth , outpacing all other metals in terms of growth . <p> In fact , thanks to significant demand worldwide , coppers spot prices are up 393 percent from their lows in 2001. 393 percent ! <p> Still not sold ? Here are three more reasons to consider adding copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Demand for the red metal is primarily driven by industrial use . The properties of copper make it a very efficient conductor of electricity , as well as strong , flexible and resistant to corrosion . <p> Thanks to these qualities , copper is used in nearly every major industry you can think of : transportation , engineering , machinery and equipment , electrical , building , automotive , computers and more . In fact , copper is an essential component of whatever gadget you are using to read this article right now . <p> Because of its crucial function in industries relating to construction and development , investors are commonly advised to buy copper if they believe in growth . <p> For example , to build a modern skyscraper takes a lot of heavy machinery , technology , and electrical power . Not to mention , people moving to cities need some form of transportation to get to work . All of this requires large quantities of copper . <p> Development is a key driving factor behind copper prices in recent years , especially in China , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and improving standards of living . It 's no wonder that Asia alone consumes nearly half of the world 's supply of copper . <p> In the United States , copper consumption has increased by nearly 700 percent since 1990 , and data shows demand driven up in the near future . <h> 2 . Slowing Supply <p> On top of skyrocketing demand , global copper supply appears to be drying up . The last significant copper mine was uncovered nearly a century ago and there has n't been a new mine discovery since . <p> Do a quick Google search and you 'll find story after story of copper shortages happening in the last few years , and many forecasters are bracing for the inevitable copper scarcity on the horizon . <p> When the amount of copper injected into the market is unable to sustain long-term demand , production will have to slow to a crawl and prices will shoot up " unless new copper deposits are discovered soon . <p> Furthermore , factors like political instability , natural disasters , labor disputes and major accidents can all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term supplies . <h> 3 . Diversification Helps <p> The exponentially-increasing rate of demand , as well as the diminishing supply , ensures that copper will retain and even grow its value in the long term , making it an obvious choice for serious investors who want to diversify their financial portfolio . <p> It is said that Ancient Chinese merchants came up with a unique way of reducing risk . They would divide their goods among several ships . That way , in the event that one ship was capsized by a storm or attacked by pirates , at least the other ships stood a good chance of making it through and the shipment was n't a total loss . <p> The same tactic can work for modern investors , too . <p> While diversification does n't guarantee avoiding a loss , it does help shield your portfolio from the ebb and flow of the market . Therefore , the more you diversify , the better prepared you will be to manage risk . <p> Precious metals in general act as a safeguard from volatile stocks , bonds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your assets into an industrial metal like copper , you can diversify even further to protect yourself against losses . <h> Where Can I Buy Copper ? <p> Copper is a great metal to own if you want to protect your wealth for less cost than gold and silver . <p> Please note : since copper is used extensively for industrial purposes , make sure to buy refined , high quality copper bullion , as opposed to scrap material used by manufacturers . <p> At Provident Metals , we sell premium copper bullion bars and coins to help investors claim a stake in rare metals , while affordably securing their savings . <h> Comments <p> I had no idea there was such a high demand for copper wire these days , let alone no new mines for supply ! Its unfortunate that there is such a shortage of it because its used for almost all electrical machines and buildings . I think investing in copper now can make a huge impact down the road . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Correct me if I am wrong but copper spot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1 pound bars are listed for almost $7 per bar . So spot would need to triple for you to even get close to making money.please advise . <p> Basically , its very expensive to produce copper bullion , which is why there is such a disparity . If copper were to increase in price and balance the costs , there would be a better spread . It is a lot cheaper in its raw form , but its not easily monetized and its not as pure ( hallmarked as 999 fine for example ) . Many of our customers consider copper to be a speculative " investment " or a novelty . <p> I am fairly new to the precious metals world but I have managed to put away a nice little pile of silver and have started putting back copper . Most of which I have got through provided metals . I have been overwhelmed by their wonderful service and fair prices . If you are thinking about buying i 'd go through them i 'm going to continue to . <p> Thanks for the questions . Provident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad selection of copper bullion that features rounds manufactured by a variety of mints , including some exclusive to Provident Metals . <p> For anyone considering a purchase of copper as an investment or as bullion , they must bear this in mind ( as stated in the article ) : Copper is an industrial metal , not a precious metal . <p> Even though copper has , at different times and in varying places , been used as a monetary metal , it does not hold sufficient value to be a meaningful hedge against the frailties of fiat currency . <p> Precious metals are a hedge , or insurance , against currency-related monetary and economic problems , whereas an investment in copper is bet on economic recovery and growth . <p> Having said this , I do own a little copper . In days to come , prudent farmers may be happy to trade a little produce for some copper after all , just as stated in the article , it is a tremendously useful material . <p> You say that copper is up 393% compared to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a quick review of the spot prices from 2001 compared to now reveal a much different story . Here is some math . Gold at the end of 2001 was $276.00 or so . It is now about $1,300 . A 100% increase would be a doubling of price . So , to say that gold is up only 151% is to say that the current spot price is : $693 or so . $276 x 1.51 = $416 + $276 = $693 . My math may be incorrect , but the gist of my assertion is n't . What are your thoughts ? <p> if you are investing a good amount of cash on , you will need a ware house to store it in , or one hell of a shed you can secure in ..

@@41348199 @1348199/ <h> What 's in a Penny ? <p> The American penny has been around for more than two centuries , and during those 200-plus years the penny has had many changes . Today , pennies are copper-plated zinc , meaning that the composition of the coin is 97.5% zinc and only 2.5% copper . Prior to 1982 , though , the copper penny was just that " copper . <p> History shows that the penny has appeared in many forms and to say that the 1-cent coin was ever entirely copper would be false . However , between 1793-1982 penny composition was mostly copper . Below is a brief history of the penny : <p> 1793-1837 : Pennies were mostly composed of pure copper . <p> 1837-1857 : Pennies were bronze , minted as 95% copper and 5% tin and zinc . <p> 1857-1864 : Pennies were made with 88% copper and 12% nickel . <p> 1864-1962 : Pennies were bronze again , with brief variations to the coin during WWII . <p> 1962-1982 : Tin was removed from the penny , making its composition 95% copper and 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper , became the norm . <p> Coin collectors have been interested in particular pennies for many years . Historical pennies such as the American Large Cent , the Flying Eagle Penny , the Indian Head Copper Cent and the Lincoln Wheat Penny have found their collecting value with the rarity and quality of each coin and mint year . <p> For example , copper Lincoln Wheat Pennies from 1943 are extremely rare due to the fact that during that year mint facilities mainly produced steel pennies ( zinc-coated steel ) in order to save copper for the war effort . This event has made copper Lincoln Wheat Pennies one of the most lucrative one-cent pieces around , fetching tens of thousands of dollars for a single coin . <p> Most of us are unlikely to stumble upon a 1943 copper Lincoln Wheat Penny , but penny collecting still has its value , especially when you begin to think of the copper content of older pennies . <p> Since 2005 the price of copper bullion has been on the rise . Aside from a steep drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially compared to copper prices in the latter half of the last century . This increase in copper value has sparked interest in older , copper-filled pennies . <p> Penny collecting is no longer a coin collector 's forte . With the copper content of older pennies greatly exceeding the copper in newer copper-coated zinc pennies , metal collectors have seen an investment opportunity in one-cent pieces minted before 1982 . <p> If you happen to be a metal investor or a penny collector , do n't forget to be on the lookout for rare historical pennies that are worth well more than just their copper content .

I called provident and they assured me everything was being done to find / locate my order and it arrived 48 or 72 hours later ( I believe 48 , it was on a weekend ) I was so scared it had been lost or stolen but in the end I LOVE THIS ITEM ! ( Only issue was there was no bar code and other info on the plastic bag around the item like my previous PAMP orders ? Is this an issue ? I 'm going back to Silver for most of the year with maybe a gram or two here and their ! I ca n't wait for my Chinese red core pandas with the first of the 30gram metric weight ! I 'm sure they will be great for my collection . Oh and Laura who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're an angel ! The support was amazing . Keep up the great work PM ! I 'll be back in a few weeks for my next silver itch ! <p> Good Buy <p> EHardway on 12/4/14 <p> I used to buy 1 oz gold bars but I recently switched to the three PAMP 10 Gram bars because they come out to be about the same price as a 1oz bar . I like 10 gram size because its easier to unload . Also these bars are really nice looking and they have a serial number . <p> A great choice for small investors <p> BigJim on 2/25/14 <p> The PAMP fractional gold bars come in a variety of sizes that make it easy to invest in physical gold . A nice feature is the assay card and corresponding serial number on the bar itself , most bars do n't have the serial number on the bar and card , only the card . The 10g bars have the number stamped , the 5g and 1g bars look like they have the serial number laser etched on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable . You wo n't have to worry about humidity or " safe chafe " on these cards . The buy-back price is very good , better than most any other bullion product . If you want to take some profits or finance another investment , the buy back price will become important . The premium is low , premiums are easy to pay and hard to recoup , so keep that in mind . I have absolutely no complaints about any of the PAMP gold I have purchased from Provident , some even came with sequential serial numbers , a nice perk . <p> Best Prices Ever ! <p> Ulises on 2/3/14 <p> Absolutely Love my 10g Pamp bar . The size did surprise me a bit , but this is in fact my first Gold bar purchase and what a beautiful design . I look forward to buying more from Provident Metals . : ) <p> Very competitive pricing , and bars are beautiful <p> Woodie on 3/6/13 <p> I have ordered gold and silver in pamp bars and have always been pleased ... Very satisfied <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/2/13 <p> I have been a faithful buyer of this and the 20 gram Pamp Suisse gold bars for awhile . I like the idea of ' fractional ' gold for its usability if we ever have economic collape or any other shtf situation . I like Pamp because of Provident 's low premiums , making this affordable . I pay a premium which is more than reasonable , and can channel those ' premium savings ' into silver ! And do . I also notice that buyback of these Pamp bars is at a higher offer than for some other forms of gold ounces or fractional ounces . I love the goddess Fortuna artwork on each bar , the high respect for the Pamp name , the Pamp Suisse security features and lastly the Swiss reliability and heritage in precious metals.I buy these for a storehouse of value , getting my worthless USD fiat paper money transferred into a real asset . In the future these will cost more and more paper dollars because of inflation , so I prefer to lock in a sure amount of gold grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bar ! <p> Happy once I picked up the product <p> Kenneth on 8/28/12 <p> Great pricing , great product . Have repeatedly requested alternative shipping . Let 's face it USPS sucks . Shipping costs are attractive , but waiting in line at the Post Office because they do n't want to come to the door over and over again is frustrating . UPS and Fed Ex goes above the bar in ensuring home delivery . I have yet to experience that with my purchases which also include silver . <p> A gud gold bars <p> lennylouis on 3/6/12 <p> Gud quality . I really love it . I ordered like 40 grams already . Fast shipping as well <p> a good price for a good product <p> Bennett on 10/15/11 <p> I ordered the ten gram bar as my first gold bar purchase . I received it and was very satisfied with its eye appeal . This is a good in between size as i could not afford the ounce bars .

On the front of the Morgan dollar , Morgan 's Lady Liberty can be seen in profile with her hair cascading in curls down the back , held in place by a band engraved appropriately with the word LIBERTY . The Latin motto , E PLURIBUS UNIM ( from one many ) is featured prominently across the top of the coin with thirteen stars representing each of the original thirteen colonies bordering the bottom of the coin .

Faster shipping than competitors.Ordered 2 bars from both companies at same time . y'all won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine mint <p> Possibly the best deal on silver anywhere <p> Elliot on 10/19/14 <p> Folks , if you 're a serious accumulator of silver and want the best bang for your increasingly doomed buck , this is about as good a deal as you 're going to get . True , the " standard " 10 oz OPM and Provident bars are ever so slightly less expensive ( I have all three ) , but the additional artwork and quality of this bar at a negligible extra mark-up makes this the winner . If you do n't personally care about the artwork--think about what it may do for you when it comes to sell . Of all the 10 oz bars I own , the Geiger Security line may be the " nicest " , but it 's also significantly more money ( but not outrageously more , like the Pamp Suisse bars ) so one of those suffices . The only other 10 oz bar of comparable value to the Provident Year of the Horse bar that I would highly recommend is the Sunshine Mint bar . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Provident ! In my opinion , the Sunshine Mint bar has the edge over the Year of the Horse bar because of the mint mark security feature .... <p> What a bar ! ! <p> Paul on 10/16/14 <p> What a great looking bar . The pictures do n't do it justice . So bright and shiny , this is a great design for the " year of the horse " . Safely packaged in extremely clear plastic . Love it . <p> Very nice bullion bar .

@@41348287 @1348287/ <h> Reviews <p> In 1988 , the Royal Canadian Mint issued the world 's first pure 99.99% pure silver bullion coin , the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf . At that point , the only widely available silver bullion coin was the .999 American Silver Eagle . Silver Maple Leaf coins have a fineness of .9999 , making them the purest silver coins regularly issued in the world . The Royal Canadian Mint 's insistence on using only the finest planchets , or coin blanks , in minting these coins has made the Silver Maple Leaf the standard against which all other silver bullion coins are judged.The Canadian Silver Maple Leaf has a face value of $5 ( the highest such value of any one ounce government-issued silver coin ) , measures 38.0mm in diameter , and consists of one troy ounce of pure silver . Each of these coins features a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain on the obverse and the national symbol of Canada , the maple leaf , on the reverse .

Fast shipping unless it goes through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Provident offers free shipping , they do not cheap out on packaging . After looking at other sites , I settled on provident because they consistently had the best prices for all the four of the main precious metals they sell . <p> Great Silver for a great price <p> George on 12/28/15 <p> The best company that i have ever bought silver from <p> Provident quality <p> James on 12/23/15 <p> My experiences with Provident have only been on the very best of terms . The fair pricing is one thing but the ease of buying with the Elemetal account is incredible , finally having the option of paying cash or trading silver is wonderful . The beauty of the bars is a bonus . I enjoy buying through Provident . Thank you for making it this easy <p> Ordered on 12/17 , received on 12/21 , and all I can say is wow ! These bars are individually enclosed in plastic and have an attractive design . This is my third metals order placed thru Provident and I 'm very very pleased . Looking forward to hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Love -em <p> david on 12/17/15 <p> Excellent bars .. Purchased 4 10oz bars .... great price ... about a week to recieve them ... I am definitely buying more from Provident ... wish they had more choices in 5oz and 1oz bars though .. <p> Great Price , Fast shipping <p> Joseph on 12/16/15 <p> thank you <p> Great price , good quality <p> Mario on 12/9/15 <p> After watching silver prices for a long time and watching prices from multiple websites I finally decided to make my first purchase from Provident . Very quickly after they received my payment they had it shipped out . 2 weeks time from the day I had a money order in the mail to the time I got my bar in the mail . It was shipped discreetly in two bubble packages and had a protective sleeve around the bar . The bars quality overall was great front and back but the sides were a little ruff . Overall a great bar and i will buy more . <p> Silver Bar <p> George on 12/9/15 <p> I have bought many 10oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll kept buying from them only <p> Great Purchase <p> TR on 12/9/15 <p> I would say that this is one of the best buys on a quality silver product . I 'm very pleased with the ten pack I got in the mail today , low premium and high buy back , hard to go wrong with these . I always check first with Provident before I look around . They are hard to beat when it comes to silver bars . Thanks , Provident . <p> This is a nice looking bar and comes encased in a VERY protective rubbery plastic cover . Aesthetically it is has a really nice design . I have come to prefer the Sunshine Mint 10oz bars , however , due to their anti-counterfeit feature and the fact that they are commonly available at a lower price . It would be nice if Provident could incorporate a similar security feature and price their " name brand " bar more competitively . Provident used to be my one and only source for silver but their competition has recently offered better pricing , ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a temporary phase for Provident because I have always liked working with them . <p> To me when it comes to silver , this is silver . Who cares if its not in perfect condition , its still worth its weight in silver . I only worry about coins like the 1996 Walking Liberty to have perfect lines n such . These 10oz bars are just fine . <p> wow <p> ken on 11/27/15 <p> silver at .29 over spot ..... ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> No one <p> Paul on 11/25/15 <p> No one make it easier to purchase 10oz silver bars , and with the price benefit of Provident Metals silver bars , I appreciate how hard PM works to provide value . Coupled with free shipping over $99 , and I can purchase as frequently as I find enough for a single bar . PM is n't the only silver I hold , but it is quickly becoming the majority . <p> It 's silver : ) <p> Ryan on 11/25/15 <p> Clean and attractive design . See a lot of comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these very people would say after receiving a hand poured bar ? For such low premiums over spot , one should not expect perfection and be thankful for more bullion for your buck . <p> It 's silver : ) <p> Ryan on 11/25/15 <p> Clean and attractive design . See a lot of comments about scratches and scuffs on different bar reviews . Wonder what these very people would say after receiving a hand poured bar ? For such low premiums over spot , one should not expect perfection and be thankful for more bullion for your buck . <p> Great Price and Fast Shipping <p> Alejandro on 11/25/15 <p> I placed my Second order with Provident Metals for 20 of the 10oz Silver bars on November 9 , 2015 and I had it in my hands by November 17 , 2015 ( 7 business days total ) .

My 5 bar order came in a timely fashion . My only complaint is the very loose plastic wrapping ; takes up more storage space . Wish more bullion companies would tight-wrap their bars , like RMC . Otherwise , 5-Star review . <p> Great looking bar <p> Brian on 11/18/15 <p> I 'm buying silver while its low and these 10 ounce bars are a great way to invest in silver . Plus they are great looking bars for the collector also . <p> great for the price <p> James on 11/17/15 <p> These bars are not amazing to look at but that does n't matter , it 's . 999 silver just like a englehard or johnson matthey bar <p> SATISFIED BUT CONDITION OF BAR COULD BE BETTER <p> Zach on 11/8/15 <p> Silver is silver .

The only negative is the bar has some imperfections but as I said " silver is silver " . <p> Bars are great <p> Jason M on 11/8/15 <p> The silver bars are great . I ordered 3 of them . The worst part was just usps who did n't even hold my package for more than a day before shipping it back . But provident 's customer service was very helpful , they took care of everything . Picked up and re-shipped the package in a very timely manner . <p> Could n't be happier <p> John on 11/6/15 <p> I 've purchased 7 of these bars in the last couple of months .

Spot price was low and I took advantage of it , Provident Metal had a great price for the 10oz Silver bars compared to the competition , the lowest I believe . Great price and fast shipping and the bars are all sealed individually in connected transparent flexible plastic casings , nice and shiny , brand new , and best of all , pure Silver .

Recently I decided to try a few of these 10 oz. bars . They are so nice I have changed my attitude towards saving larger bars .

Very happy with the purchase . The bar is n't anything special but sill looks great . Simple design for a simple investor looking to stack at a relatively low cost over spot . Only bought one and paid $1.08 over spot . Not bad for not buying in a bulk quantity . Ordered on Aug. 1st and received the bar on Aug. 17th . Also not bad considering I pay by check via snail mail to try and keep costs as low as possible and minimize the premium I pay . This is my second transaction with Provident and it went as good as the first . Great price ! Fast Shipping !

Backing the truck up ! ! ! <p> Good enough for me <p> Jon on 6/20/15 <p> I have purchased 2 of these and I like the fact that its just silver . I am not concerned about the fine detail of the bar . Silver is silver and I could care less if the detail is fine or not . They are heavier than I thought . I buy silver because it is a good investment . I look forward to buying more form Provident in the future . I love this company . I used to buy from a local company here , but they did me wrong . So Provident , you have my support and business forever ! Thank you guys ! <p> Keep up the good work . <p> Guy on 6/3/15 <p> I love these type of 10 oz bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Best investments <p> Daniel on 5/29/15 <p> Buying either silver bars , or the select Peace Dollars at Provident Metals is a great &amp; safe investment . Any coin collector should offset their coins with silver bars bullion . I do &amp; should be taking advantage now before the prices go up . You get the best prices here .

Not the fastest shipping , but I 'm not going to do anything with it other than bury it in the backyard . Great place to get affordable bullion . <p> VERY NICE ! <p> ray on 12/19/14 <p> This has to be one of my favorite items I 've purchased from Provident.You will not be disappointed at all , with the purchase of one ( or more ) of these.BEAUTIFUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of these just a few days ago , and " Voila " , here they are today on my doorstep.Packaged very well , and am quite pleased , and I do n't please easily ... Thanx Provident.More business coming your way . <p> EXCELLENT BULLION BARS <p> Edward on 10/17/14 <p> I received 2 of these 10 oz bars yesterday and 2 more today . These are the best value for bullion that I have found and I am always happy with Provident purchases . They are always shipped promptly and arrive well packed . For those people that are not happy with these bars just remember ... If you want beauty and perfection you should not buy bullion bars ... Pay the high premiiums for government minted coins . At the end of the day and ounce of silver is an ounce of silver and my low premium bullion will be worth the same as your high dollar collector coins . I will be buying many more of these bars . <p> 4.5 Stars <p> JJ on 10/16/14 <p> Very pleased ! Sealed plastic is a huge plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not in as good condition or well cared for . The face and back of my bar are immaculate while the edges show a few dings . This is what you are paying such a low premium for ! <p> Outstanding bar for the price . If you are simply stacking at low cost , this bar is for you . Lots of them , are for you . <p> If you are collecting with a little more than weight in mind I would still pick one up , but for a higher premium there are nicer looking bars out there for you to spend your day ogling . Still I suggest you add at least one of these to your collection ! <p> Great bar <p> William on 10/12/14 <p> New to silver investing but better spot price than a local guy and was here in a few days . Ordered a standing liberty and two more rounds . Will be buying more bars in the future . <p> Very Happy <p> Sean on 10/11/14 <p> I just purchased two of these bars and recieved them yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick shipping ! ! <p> I love these ... <p> Nicholas on 10/9/14 <p> Excellent product if the silver goes down more I will be buying more . <p> Good for the price <p> MKAgReview on 10/2/14 <p> Weight is good , plastic cover is better than some competitors . Nicks in the edge and on the reverse some of the raised edge is actually flush with the design .

I started buying on the auction site , then at the local pawn , then did a google search and found Provident and some other online bullion shops . I 'm proud to say that Provident is now my 1st and last stop when looking to buy ( usually just a few ounces a week ) . The prices are right , the selection is 1st rate , and their service dept means business . <p> These beautiful 10 oz bars proudly display the Provident logo , and I proudly support Provident and OPM for their fairness and Made-In-USA patriotism . They 're literally pocket change above spot and you can sell em back without losing any significant money . What 's not to love ? And as far as any imperfections go , so what ? It 's silver at practically spot price . If you want art go to a gallery .. <p> Thanks Provident ! <p> Love the product <p> Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these 10oz beauties .....

It is a pleasure to do business with Provident as well . <p> Will be getting more of these ... <p> James on 2/12/14 <p> Great over spot price , and if you pay attention you will notice that their buy back amount is always going to be a smig better than others at the same over spot price . The bar is struck well enough but more importantly it is .999 that can be both acquired and sold at the best prices Provident has . I will be continuing to purchase these for sure .

Highly recommended . <p> Not quite as good as I 'd hoped . <p> Brandon on 10/17/13 <p> I was actually looking forward to these . It gave me a little reasurance that providents name was on them . Their quality did n't seem as good as some of the other bars I have gotten . the edges were a little rough , and the finish was pitted . With other bars I 've gotten , year of the snake , NTR ect. the finish looks a lot better . Others had near mirror finish and sharp details , not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wo n't be getting them again .... maybe its because they are recycled .

I turned to these when the premiums on RCM bars and silver phils went through the roof . I would n't go hog wild on these because they are reportable , and I do have low-level concerns about recognition of these if provident somehow is n't around when you go to sell ( OPM recognizable on reverse , though ) . But with the premiums on major name bars and phils through the roof , these certainly have a place in any stack . <p> Awesome low premium silver product ! <p> Vincent on 10/4/13 <p> These provident bars at a mere $.79 over spot are a great low premium way to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 9/20/13 <p> The Provident logo really makes for a good looking bar .

Most of them are unfruitful , yet people continue to try . <p> One of the most recent tales of hidden treasure is Fenn 's treasure , said to be situated somewhere in the Rocky Mountains . Hidden by 85-year-old Forrest Fenn in the summer of 2010 , the treasure is said to be a bronze box containing over a million dollars ' worth of gold nuggets , gemstones , rare coins , jewelry , and pre-Columbian gold figures .

@@41348318 @1348318/ <h> Should I Invest in Fractional Gold ? <p> Is less gold per ounce worth the investment ? <p> Fractional coins are bullion coins that contain less than one troy ounce of gold or silver , and they serve as an alternate way to invest in precious metals . In fact , most coin releases are available in sizes that are less than one troy ounce . <p> Why would one invest in fractional gold coins ? Here 's a look at what makes these coins different , along with a few pros and cons of choosing fractional gold pieces as investments . <h> What is Fractional Gold ? <p> Fractional gold , simply put , is any coin or round that contains less than the standard minimum of one troy ounce of gold . The most common denominations for fractional gold coins typically contain 1/2 , 1/4 , or 1/10 of an ounce of gold ; however , any amount less than one ounce is considered fractional . As the amount of gold decreases , the price of the coin also decreases . <h> Advantages of Fractional Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are still pros to purchasing these coins as investments : <p> Cost . One of the best arguments to buying fractional gold coins is the lower cost . The price of gold coins of a larger weight can be pretty steep , and can be quite a financial investment if you decide to make collecting bullion coins a hobby . <p> Collection building . Buying bullion in smaller sizes means you can purchase more coins at a lower price for each , and doing so can help you build a more well-rounded gold collection or investment portfolio . <p> Flexibility . Trading your gold coins can be hard , especially if your entire collection consists of one or more troy ounce coins . If you 're looking to trade in a bit of your gold for cash without letting go of your more expensive pieces , fractional gold coins give you a cheaper option for doing so . <p> Trading and bartering . Fractional gold coins are typically easier to liquidate , and bartering with these coins can also lead to great trading opportunities that may not be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the price of gold rises , demand for fractional gold coins is likely to increase too . Since larger coins are more populous , having some fractional gold pieces could provide excellent selling opportunities in the future . <p> Economic crash . In the event that the economy crashes , fractional gold coins would be much easier to trade for typical goods and services than larger coins . Larger coins would trade for more than would be needed for smaller purchases . <h> Disadvantages of Fractional Gold <p> Despite the perks of smaller gold ounce coins , fractional gold does carry a few cons as well . These disadvantages include : <p> Higher markup price . Fractional gold coins cost the same to mint as coins containing more gold . This means that fractional gold coins will likely have a higher markup price in relation to their purchase price than bigger coins ( anywhere from 9 to 15 percent typically ) . A one troy ounce gold coin will usually have the lowest markup price of all , which is one reason this option is so appealing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher premiums too ; such high premiums , in fact , that it can dissuade some collectors from investing in them and opting for a typical one troy ounce coin . Typical premium markups range between 9 and 15 percent for fractional gold coins . <p> Overall , while the higher markup price is not desirable , fractional gold coins do make excellent investment pieces and can provide a means of investment for those looking to spend less than $1,000 on precious metal bullion coins . Additionally , many collectors agree that investing in fractional gold coins makes for a more well-rounded collector 's portfolio . <p> Whether you 're interested in making a fractional gold coin your next investment piece , or you would rather stick with one troy ounce coins , Provident Metals has a variety of options to meet your needs .

Is Provident deliberately raising their spot cost to keep the price where they want it ? I went back and looked at prior purchases and the lowest I ever paid for 40 rounds was $684 and at that time the price of silver was $15.98 . What 's going on ? Do I need to look for another silver LONG ... Reply : Thank you Terry for your business and your product review . &lt;br&gt;This is very common when there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've experienced lately , demand has skyrocketed at record pace . That leaves bullion dealers , suppliers , refiners working hard to find more metal . Cost of mining goes up . Cost of refining goes up . Suppliers ( US Mint , Foreign Mint , ALL private mint ) cost goes up . Bullion Dealers - As a result , Provident Metals cost goes up . Unfortunately , our customers cost goes up as well . Providents margins/spread are still the same , we 're not making more per product , our cost has just increased . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I assure you when the distance between supply and demand has narrowed , you will continue to save more with Provident Metals . If you have any further questions or concerns , please feel free to contact us anytime at ( 800 ) 313-3315 Option #4 . <p> Excellent <p> Sam on 6/23/15 <p> I always buy from Provident , they always deliver and I am satisfied with the products and services they provide .

Great detail . <p> 1st Time Buyer at Provident <p> Dave in Cincinnati on 3/31/15 <p> Just want to give a big THANK YOU to Provident . I received 20 of the Morgan 1oz rounds and they are way more than I expected . These are suburb coins with great detail to match . I 'm very happy with my first order and now definitely a Provident fan . I will be ordering more of the Morgan 's . Whoever designed this really knew what they were doing . Rated 4 Stars because nothing is perfect , but this is as good as it gets ! <p> Absolutely Beautiful Morgan Silver Rounds <p> Edward on 2/26/15 <p> I am absolutely impressed with the quality and beauty of these Morgan Silver Rounds . They look just like the original Morgan Silver Dollars except they are bigger and more beautiful , it 's just like getting it mint state Morgan Dollar but bigger in that it 's a full troy ounce of silver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need to order some of these to see exactly what I am describing here .

Will definitely be buying more . <p> Great Looking Round <p> Gerald on 1/19/15 <p> These look great and remind me of the original Morgan dollars of bygone days . Nice offering by Provident <p> Good dealing with Provident <p> Michael on 12/12/14 <p> The order took a bit longer , no fault of Provident though . I was waiting awhile and called as I felt the check should 've been there by the elapsed time . The customer service rep said I was going to get a call because I sent check and crossed the numbers for the amount owed . I sent another check out ( with the right amount ) and within 10 days got the product . I ca n't stress the ease in transactions on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll triple check . Next order is all ready " on hold " and I ca n't wait to get it . <p> Simply Beautiful Round <p> Keith on 12/8/14 <p> My personal favorite of the three types that I purchased from Provident recently . Very detailed round with nice lines and mirror finish . Price was great and shipment arrived within five days . <p> Beautiful product <p> Sal on 11/24/14 <p> This is my 7th order of these beauties and every one of them is beautiful . Great price , beautiful coin , I want more ... <p> My favorite generic coin <p> Robert on 11/21/14 <p> I have nearly all the recent generic one oz silver coins and for the money I like these Morgans the best . Clean , beautiful design on both sides . They look official and there silver content is clearly marked . If silver returned as daily currency then these beauties may be what I go to . Just would hate to part with even one . <p> Great product ! <p> Jimmy on 11/3/14 <p> very nice <p> Again , buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the most beautiful Morgan 's out there ! ! ! Hope the price gets even lower Great finish , Great value , . Just stacking these babies up . Awesome Coins . Love them ! Shaun Get some of these soon . <p> Stunning ! <p> Steve on 9/28/14 <p> Included in my last order was this Morgan Round . Simply beautiful ! Perfect in every aspect , so bright and shiny I almost need sunglasses to look at it ! When I buy Bullion , I look no further than Provident . <p> Small flaw <p> Tom on 9/18/14 <p> Overall these are great rounds , but a minor flaw was on every one of my 100 . A small hair thin line can be seen on the obverse rim . Probably not noticeable to most , but it sticks outout to me since I know its there . Perhaps a die imperfection since all bear the same mark , same location . I prefer OPM rounds . Simple and shiny . <p> Best quality of all the rounds I have <p> Charles on 9/16/14 <p> I ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing Liberty And the OPM's.The Morgans are by far the nicest finish of these 4 coins . They rank right up there with the ASE and Maples as far as no casting flash on the lip . They are not a polished mirror finish if that 's what you are looking for , but a great looking coin in my opinion . The all came in nice 20 count plastic coin tubes . Thanks , Provident is great place to buy ! <p> Nice <p> Gregory on 9/16/14 <p> Just received them yesterday , nice and clean .. <p> Good product <p> fastmvr on 9/3/14 <p> I just received my order of 100 of these beautiful Morgan replicas , and they were delivered in ( 5 ) plastic storage tubes of 20 coins each . As others have commented , the coins themselves are much more beautiful than the website representations . I will happily keep them as a precious metal or to give as gifts on certain occasions . Thanks Provident . <p> wonderful <p> Justin on 9/3/14 <p> I purchased a roll of 20 of these , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective barrel . The morgan rounds I received are stunningly beautiful and unscratched . With that said there is no coin value , so you ca n't have them professionally graded . Nor can you spend them like money except with someone accepts silver for bartering . <p> The rounds also passed the magnet test which is an easy way to check your silver purchases for purity . <p> LONG ... <p> First but definitely not last <p> Jerry on 8/29/14 <p> This was my first foray into the world of bullion , and I was a bit anxious . Provident had the best price on rounds , and one week after sending them payment , my Morgan 's were in hand . Looking for long-term investment , I have little concern over the style I buy , as long as I get my ounce of silver , but I 'm very pleased with the look and finish of these " coins " , and more pleased with how easy Provident made the transaction . I 'll be back . <p> Silver Round <p> Michael on 8/27/14 <p> I recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping fast , but the quality of the coin exceeded my expectations ! They all came in individual plastic packages for protection , and they all have their own individual characteristics that make them all look beautiful . Thank you very much and will be ordering more VERY soon ! <p> Absolutely Awesome <p> Amanda on 7/19/14 <p> Of the turn of the century replica silver rounds I own this is one of the best . Add to that 3 days from the time I placed my order to sitting in my hand , tremendous . Thank you Provident . <p> ONE OF A KIND <p> Anthony on 7/14/14 <p> These Morgans ca n't compare when looking at them on the Provident website to real life , they are so much better in person . When I received them I was shocked with the quality . This generic coin has a quality just about or close to a numismatic coin but a low premium price point . I 'm going to save as much as I can so I can grab a Monster Box of these babies . <p> Beautiful replica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replica . This coin is the next best way to buy a morgan dollar other than a real morgan dollar . <p> Superb Quality <p> JD on 6/20/14 <p> I 've bought morgan silver rounds from other dealers , but I have to say that this is by far the nicest and shiniest morgan silver round I 've received . I definitely recommend buying generic silver rounds from Provident . I will be buying more . <p> IN GOD WE TRUST <p> john on 6/11/14 <p> GREAT LOOKING COIN , IN GOD WE TRUST , LOVE IT <p> great product &amp; service <p> raul on 6/9/14 <p> I got my Morgan Dollar silver rounds in on Saturday . They came in a day earlier than expected and boy do they look good . I knew from the website photos that it was a beautiful coin , but holding one in your hand in good light , wow are they something to behold .

Provident Metals is a good company to deal with.Albert <p> Love these <p> Sal on 1/20/11 <p> I have always liked the look of the Morgan Dollar . These rounds give that look with the value of a full ounce of silver . Beautiful <p> Great Looking Round <p> Curtis on 12/27/10 <p> We just received our order today and the " Round " looks great . I believe I like the Saint Gaudens design more , but it 's nice to have a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boasting one of most iconic designs in American coinage history , the Morgan Dollar 1 oz Silver round is the ideal addition to your portfolio . Each round measures 39mm in diameter and contains .999 fine silver . <p> Designer George T. Morgan recruited Anna Willess Williams to model for the original Morgan Silver Dollar in 1876 . He sketched her profile through five sittings to portray a new Lady Liberty on the obverse of each coin . This round pays homage to Morgan 's original creation and features an inscription of E PLURIBUS UNUM . <p> The United States Mint manufactured the Morgan Dollar from 1878-1904 , and again in 1921 . It was the first silver dollar minted after the Coinage Act of 1873 seized all silver coining . <p> The Sherman Silver Purchase Act caused the Morgan to deplete in 1904 , but the Pittman Act in 1918 authorized silver dollars to be melted and recoined and Morgans were produced for one more year in 1921 . The Peace dollar replaced the design that same year . 78994 @qwx488994 79011 @qwx489011

I have bought a substantial number of them over the last few years and have paid as much as $37 for them . At the moment my investment in Eagles is NOT profitable . While the value has dropped considerably over the last year or so and is currently not showing much growth , I am optimistic for its future potential . <p> Great Coin . Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I ordered a tube of 20 of these as part of a larger order . The shipment arrived well packaged and within a week of placing the order . I could not be more pleased with the coins and Provident Metal 's service . The 20 American Eagles came sealed in the original U.S. Mint tube and all seemed to be in BU condition or close to it . I put them in 40mm Air-Tite holders so they can be handled and stay untarnished . These are a great investment being 1oz of .999 silver , plus they are IRA certified and carry a value of $1 US . They are both beautiful to collect and would make a great medium for bartering or investing . Very pleased ! <p> Great Quality <p> Justin on 11/14/13 <p> Just recently started adding silver again after almost two years off .

The quality is always consistent , and the shipping speeds are always fast or better than expected . These 2013 ASEs are much better than usual , maybe more care is being taken at West Point or San Francisco ? The premium charged is one of the lowest in industry as well . Do n't know how they do it , but I am grateful that they are in business , and they make buying physical PMs such a pleasure .

Britannia has been featured on coinage dating back to Roman times under the rule of Emperor Hadrian , and now she adorns the nation 's modern bullion products . <h> A Note on Britannia <p> Britannia first appeared on British coinage in 1672 , which led to her becoming a mainstay on coinage from then on . She was struck onto pennies issued under every monarch beginning in 1767 until decimalization . Afterwards , she appeared on 50 pence coins until 2008 . <p> Britannia 's maritime motifs have been increasingly emphasized with each of her incarnations on coins . Her spear became a trident , and she is often pictured by the sea . <p> 2017 marks the 30th anniversary of Britannia standing tall on British bullion . Her original bullion design began with sculptor Philip Nathan in 1987 , which was featured on the British Gold Britannia . Her strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful gale whips against her shield . <p> This design carried over the Silver Britannia when it was released , following the success of the Gold Britannia . To celebrate the Silver Britannia 's 20th anniversary in 2017 , a radial sunburst background was added to enhance the coin 's security . <h> Other Changes with Britannia Coinage <p> Apart from subtle design changes in the Queen 's effigy and the visage of Britannia , the Silver Britannias have seen other minor changes over the years . Most notably , Silver Britannia coins have become more pure in recent years . From 1997 to 2012 , Silver Britannias contained .958 fine silver . The coins minted from 2013 on contain .999 fine silver . This higher purity has made Silver Britannias notable in the modern international coin market . <p> In celebration of the Silver Britannia 's 20th anniversary in 2017 , the Royal Mint added micro-inscribed radial lines behind the beloved Britannia design . These act as a form of security and provide an anti-counterfeiting measure . <h> About the British Royal Mint <p> With roots stemming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble beginnings as the London Mint in the 800s . This was just one of many mints in the United Kingdom during the time . By the 1200s , the London Mint moved its location to the Tower of London , where it gained a minting monopoly that lasted for 500 years . <p> From 1699 until his death in 1727 , Sir Isaac Newton held the post of Master of the Royal Mint . He was more notably known as a mathematician . However , Newton was responsible for moving British currency from the Pound Sterling to the Gold Standard in 1717 . <p> The mint fell under the rule of the Royal Family , and eventually went on to become a limited company . This new operation began producing all circulation coinage for the UK , along with coinage for 60 other countries . The mint now produces about 15 percent of the world 's coinage . <h> Why Should I Invest in the Silver Britannia ? <p> Like most sovereign minted silver bullion coins , the silver Britannia consists of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purity are guaranteed by a sovereign entity . Consequently , the British Silver Britannia is a great investment coins , and it qualifies to be included in self-directed precious metals IRAs . Additionally , because the each year 's mintage is limited , and because design elements change over time , the silver Britannia is also attractive to coin collectors . <p> If you 'd like to take part in the rich tradition of the Royal Mint while investing in your financial future , the British Silver Britannia is a solid choice for your bullion collection .

I love this kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made ? ? I am after all a " melt man " in the end .

These things are awesome ! <p> Love the Zombucks <p> Mark on 3/6/15 <p> Amazing detail and relief for a private mint . I love the Zombucks and this may be the best one yet . It looks like a normal coin until you look close and then blam ... zombie . <p> This Zombie has some POP ! ! ! <p> Fred on 2/16/15 <p> Fantastic design on this zombuck ... next to the first one my favorite in the series ! Got 5 , may get more ... Great service as always , thanks ! ! <p> Starving Liberty <p> Leon on 2/1/15 <p> Yes 7 out of 10 only 3 more to go . The Starving Liberty is a very nice round . Must say my favorite is still the Morgue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detailed . Looks to me the proportion of her head may be a tad smaller then it should be . But I am looking hard to find something since Provident always has a quality product . If you read my reviews I 'm sounding like a broken record about how great every thing has been . ( For you younger stackers a record was a round disk made of vinyl that played music ) Looking forward to the last 3 of the series and to see what you come up with next in the Zombucks . Peace , Love &amp; Happiness . Leon KY <p> Starving Liberty <p> Tim on 1/28/15 <p> I only gave the Starving Liberty 4 stars because of the fact that it does n't look like it belongs in the series . To me , it looks like another mint made these . Compare a Walker and a Starving Liberty side by side and you 'll see what I 'm talking about . This might be the direction the series is going . Only time will tell . Maybe a series II ? Regardless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series this year . If Provident does do a series II in Zombucks , please release the every 2 months instead of every 3 . <p> Extremely High Quality <p> Samuel Leeds on 1/23/15 <p> The relief on these coins is unreal . I kind of assume that they had to be stamped 2 or 3 times just to make the shield pop out like that . <p> Before I purchased them , I thought that this particular round was going to be kind of ho-hum when compared to the rest of the Zombucks , but in reality it is number 1 or 2 for me . The fact that the face of the zombie was such a small part of the round made me think the " zombification " aspect of the coin would be minimal . <p> But in the end it 's the craftsmanship of the shield that makes this round an absolute stunner . It really has to be seen in person to fully appreciate it . <p> Great Coins <p> john on 1/21/15 <p> I Have All 7 So Far And Ca n't Wait To Finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series <p> Mammoth on 1/19/15 <p> The detail on the Starving Liberty Silver Round is easily the best of all the Zombucks ! However , they made one BIG error by putting the date on this round , because as we all know - most Standing Liberty Quarters are dateless . Hopefully the coin designers will strive for greater accuracy with the last three coins of the Zombucks series . <p> Awesome <p> Andy on 1/17/15 <p> I love these coins and i 'm gon na start buying as many as I Possibly can !

The best by far in my opinion ! ! ! ! ! <p> Best coin of the collection <p> Bret on 1/11/15 <p> This is probably the most detailed of the collection to date , from her shield to her neck to the decaying walls , very well put together . <p> Amazing ! <p> Gregory on 1/9/15 <p> This is definitely the best Zombuck made so far !

@@41348383 @1348383/ <h> Silver Bullion FAQ : <h> Why invest in silver ? <p> Silver is a wise investment for a variety of reasons ; as legal tender , silver is quite literally money . In addition to being legal tender , silver has countless industrial and medical uses . Silver is a hedge against inflation and is one of the only assets with : <p> Affordability <p> High Demand <p> Industrial and monetary uses <p> Lower risk than other precious metals <p> In short , silver is an ideal way to build a well diversified retirement portfolio with a time tested commodity . <h> What does " spot price " mean ? <p> Spot price is the current price at which a commodity , like gold or silver , can be bought or sold . It is considered the explicit value of a particular precious metal at that point in time in the marketplace . For silver , the spot price reflects the current price for one ounce of pure silver . Thus , a silver spot price of 17.54 means that silver is currently valued at $17.54 per ounce.What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base price of the metal ; you can not actually buy physical silver or silver ETFs at spot price . With trading fees , you will always be buying somewhere above spot price . How much you pay above spot price can vary based on the dealer and type of bullion you purchase . <h> What affects spot price ? <p> There are a multitude of factors that can affect the spot price of a commodity like silver , such as : <p> Supply and demand <p> Political climate <p> Environmental conditions affecting physical mines <p> With the variety of potential influences on the spot price of silver , determining the optimum time to buy can be challenging . <p> Matters affecting the strength of the dollar have a significant impact on silver spot price ; thus , maintaining awareness of economic conditions can help predict where spot price is heading . <h> Why does spot price matter ? <p> Spot price is important to consider when purchasing silver because the price you pay for any bullion product is determined by the current spot price plus a premium determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bar or round , you can determine which dealers charge the lowest premiums . Provident Metals takes pride in offering low premiums and high buy-back prices on spot price . <p> Because silver has so many industrial , electronic , and medicinal uses , the spot price is relevant to those investing in products and stocks outside of COMEX , as well . When spot price rises for silver , investors and consumers often see a correlating rise in those industries utilizing large quantities of silver . <h> What currency is spot price quoted ? <p> Spot price is available in a multitude of currencies , depending on location . On the Provident Metals website , spot price is quoted in U.S. dollars ( USD ) . <h> How often does spot price change ? <p> Spot price is in constant fluctuation , potentially changing from one moment to the next . Changes in spot price can occur for a variety of reasons ; political , economic , social , and environmental factors are among those that can cause flux . <p> A weak dollar can change the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-old , trusted commodity . Changes in supply and demand will affect the spot price of silver , as well as events like political elections . A multitude of factors have the potential to affect spot price at any given moment ; this is why spot price is always changing . <h> When is spot price on my order determined ? <p> While you shop , spot price is fluctuating . Once you arrive at the " Place my Order " section of the checkout process , you will be given two minutes to confirm your order , while spot price is locked down . If during those two minutes you do not confirm your order , the spot price may change , which will result in a change to your purchase price . <p> No ; once your purchase is made , you will receive an order confirmation email with the total received at check out .

" <p> Ask price is the minimum amount a seller requires to sell bullion . If you are a seller , the price most relevant to you is the ask price , as it is the amount you require to sell . It will be based off the current spot price plus your premium . <h> What is " bid price ? " <p> Bid price is the amount a buyer offers to purchase bullion . If you are a buyer , the bid price is most important to you , as it is the number you will pay . The bid price is affected by the current spot price plus the premium added by a dealer . <h> Why is there a price difference based on my method of payment ? <p> Because credit and debit cards incur a fee for processing , cash payment methods receive a discount , as they are not charged a fee . <h> What unit of measurement does spot price use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the difference between a troy ounce and an avoirdupois ounce ? <p> 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams 1 ounce = 28.3495231 grams <p> While the exact origin of the troy ounce is not certain , the widely held belief is the French marketplace named Troyes developed a standardized measurement of weight for its national and international merchants . The troy ounce is roughly 10% heavier than the most commonly used ounce ( the avoirdupois ounce ) . <p> Precious metals are measured in troy ounces , while base metals ( such as copper ) , are measured in avoirdupois ounces . To convert your avoirdupois ounces to troy ounces , simply multiply by 0.91 . <h> What is the Gold-to-Silver Ratio , and why does it matter ? <p> The gold-to-silver ratio is the amount of silver it takes to purchase one ounce of gold . For experienced investors , the gold-to-silver ratio is one of many indicators used to determine the right ( and wrong ) time to buy or sell their precious metals . <p> Simply take the price of gold , divide it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent market prices : $1218.45 ( gold price ) $16.05 ( silver price ) = approximately 76 ( Gold-to-Silver Ratio ) <p> Most economists will agree a lower gold to silver ratio is ahead , but the market can be tough to predict . High ratios typically indicate a bullish gold market and bearish or stagnant silver market . Investors tend to buy silver and sell gold during high ratios , while they sell silver and buy gold during low ratios . <h> When is the best time to buy silver ? <p> Because so many factors can affect spot price , the best method to determine when to purchase silver involves monitoring the market for a time to establish an idea of the current fluctuation ; while market observation can help determine prices , you should always evaluate the risk you are willing to assume with any commodity investment . As a lower cost precious metal , silver can be a good investment with low risk for those looking to expand their portfolio . <h> How should I invest in silver ? <p> There are a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rounds are among the most popular , and each has its advantages . <p> Silver Bars are a great option due to their low premium and stackability <p> Silver Coins as legal tender , silver coins can be used for their face value or have worth based on the amount of silver they contain <p> In addition to purchasing bullion , you can invest by buying and trading silver online , 24 hours a day , at Elemetal Vault , a sister company of Provident Metals . Elemetal Vault offers real-time trading along with convenient and secure storage of your bullion . <h> What is the difference between a private mint and a sovereign mint ? <p> A private mint is an independently owned and run mint , crafting rounds for consumer purchase , outside of actual currency . A sovereign mint is a government owned and run mint , creating coins with a specific face value , with the ability to be used as currency . <h> What is the benefit of privately mint bullion ? <p> Privately minted bullion typically offers collectible coins and bars , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; collections like the Zombucks series do n't hold a face value for currency , but the art of the round makes it an attractive investment piece for bullion collectors . Premium is lower for privately minted bullion because they are not guaranteed by a sovereign mint as currency . <h> What is the benefit of sovereign bullion ? <p> Sovereign minted bullion holds an intrinsic value based on the amount of silver used to create the coin , but the bullion also holds a face value which does not fluctuate . Should spot price of silver fall below the face value of your coin , you need not worry about losing your investment . Sovereign minted bullion is broadly recognized and accepted , as well . <h> Does the face value of sovereign bullion affect its worth ? <p> The face value will not affect the silver content or spot price value of a coin ; however , if used as currency , the face value will offer insight to the coin 's value . <h> What is the difference between numismatic coins and bullion coins ? <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase numismatic or bullion rounds ; knowing the difference between the two can potentially grant you significant savings . Bullion rounds hold value based on the amount of silver with which they are crafted ; numismatic coins , however , rely less on receiving value from the actual silver with which they are made because they may be worth a great deal more due to rarity , collectibility , historical significance , etc . <p> Bullion rounds are often the primary investment pieces for those looking to build a precious metals portfolio . Numismatic rounds are often purchased by collectors and coin enthusiasts for reasons other than their silver content . <h> Why is silver less expensive than gold ? <p> There are many theories explaining why silver is less expensive than gold . Whether from price manipulation scandals or the public 's perception of gold , silver has never been more valuable than its sister metal . Whatever the true reason for this price anomaly , investors forecast a decrease in the gold-to-silver ratio in the years to come , as a product of an increase in the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online ? <h> Who should buy silver ? <p> Investors looking to diversify their portfolio may choose to buy silver as a hard asset and hedge against inflation .

She was wearing a patriots #12 jersey Tom Brady . <p> I said : So , you 're a Patriots fan ? she said : I am I said : Besides Brady who is you other favorite player ? she said : Rob Gronkowski I said : are you sure ? she says in a matter of fact reply : I am sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress was , you guessed it that lady bartender , Amanda .

In there I have close to 15 autographed Rob Gronkowski 16+20 prints . I told one of my daughters that I 'd be back . I went back to that establishment and walked towards the bar . When the lady bartender saw me she said : OMG , what is wrong . I said , nothing , and placed the 16+20 on the bar upside down . She flips it over and I started walking out . She sees its a photo of the Gronk then realizes its an autographed photo . She was speechless . I did n't  want to make a big deal out of it . <p> Before getting back to my roots of coins and precious metals , I dabbled in memorabilia .

A few years ago I was Christmas shopping with my son and we ran across an elderly lady looking at dog print PJs . In casual conversation , she commented to us how much she loved them but they would have to wait because gifts for her family were more important . At that moment I thought it would be wonderful to purchase them for the lady who was obviously putting others above herself . Unfortunately we quickly became sidetracked with our own quest and missed the chance to brighten someones day .

My order included $13 face and I received all Washington quarters . The condition of these were great . All the dates and mint marks were readable and I could n't have asked for better . It 's always a thrill for me to order these 90% lots from Provident and I will continue to do so . I have to say the pricing is the best I have found anywhere as well - Thanks again Provident for continuing to keep this customer happy and satisfied in all areas ! <p> Great Coins - clad promptly replaced <p> Darren on 10/19/15 <p> I recently ordered $20 in junk silver coins . I received 80 quarters . All were Washington quarters in good shape . Two of the quarters were dated 1965 . After contacting Provident , they promptly sent two coins as replacement .

Just like old times the quarters brought back memory 's when I use to hold REAL money in my hands . I will order again . <p> HONEST SELLER <p> Frank on 10/8/15 <p> Provident stands behind their sales . The last order I placed had a 1966 quarter in the batch . I called Provident and they replaced it with no questions asked . Great and honest seller . I will be making many more purchases from Provident . <p> Very Nice <p> Liam on 9/21/15 <p> Got my order today and received two halves . One was a 1963 D Franklin and one was a 1943 Liberty !

A nice mix of Roosevelt and a few Mercury , some pretty worn and some real nice . It 's the luck of the draw , depends on what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , you need to remember , silver is silver at this level . <p> Quite satisfied <p> Klint on 7/10/15 <p> I 've ordered a few of these and they 've come as Washington quarters every time . I do n't care , I just want the silver . It would be cool if they 'd let you pick dimes or quarters since there 's an option to buy $1 in specific halves . But I got what I wanted and they were all in pretty good condition . I 'm sure I 'll buy more . <p> Satisfied customer . <p> Brooks on 6/14/15 <p> This is my first order of this item from Provident - I got quarters with varying dates and conditions , though all were well dated and reasonably clean . I am very satisfied with my purchase . <p> Love buying face value <p> Chad on 5/18/15 <p> I will continue to buy 90% $1.00 face value lots from Provident Metals because I enjoy the thrill that I get from not knowing what I am going to receive . I am not concerned if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of all of them as long as it 's 90% . I will continue to store what I do get and keep adding as I go . For me it 's a lot of fun . Thanks Provident for continuing to offer these lots at fantastic prices ! ! <p> Junk Silver Purchases <p> Kevin on 5/16/15 <p> I have ordered junk silver many times from Provident and have been SUPER pleased every time ! Not only do I get a nice mix but older coins as well ! Furthermore the price has ALWAYS beat any other source , so Thanks ! ! <p> more quarters ? <p> Dylan on 5/12/15 <p> I too have only received quarters . I 've ordered about $120 face value or so in various $ increments and nothing but quarters . While I 'm pleased with the quarters , I 've gotten them from the early 1900 's to 1964 from cull to bu condition , I too would really like some dimes ! All in all , Provident does a great job , never had an issue with them , just would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many Quarters <p> Jeremy on 5/2/15 <p> I understand you 're not guaranteed anything but I have purchased about $15 face value of this product and have never gotten a dime . Yeah , it 's nice to have 60 silver quarters but as a person trying to build up a silver collection , I am lacking dimes . I even emailed the company asking if they can try to put dimes in , and still nothing . I only purchase the product $2 face value at a time so many they are sending the dimes to people willing to spend more money ? I saw some people claiming to purchase $5 and get 50 dimes . I seriously doubt that ! They should just label this product ' 90% Junk Silver Quarters ' . <p> Great <p> David on 4/30/15 <p> I made my first purchase with Provident Metals and must say I am pleased with the GREAT service and FAST delivery . I ordered $10 FV of the junk coins and was pleased to get a mix of half dollars , quarters and dimes. 3 dimes are Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1922 to 1964 on all the coins with quite a few in the 40 's and 50 's . Very pleased with order and will order again .. <p> 14$ fv of 90% junk : ) <p> steven on 3/26/15 <p> so i ordered 14$ face value of this junk silver , i received 56 quarters , mostly washingtons but i did get 8 standing liberty ( only 3 with visible dates ) and one barber quarter which was in good condition by my standards , and about 20 au washington quarters as well , definately going to order more ! <p> Very pleased <p> Michael S. on 3/23/15 <p> Was hoping for anything other than dimes . Was very pleased with quarters . Of $43 FV , $41.50 Washington ( nothing of note date wise ) , mostly G to VG condition . A few slicks , to be expected ... Will buy again ! <p> boom <p> steven on 3/13/15 <p> ordered $1 fv to check it out and got two halves , 64 kennedy and 56 franklin , both pretty nice condition , just ordered more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recieved halves one was totally worn out , could barely tell that it was a libery half . Only because i collect them . Gave it a three since it is junk silver and loved the rest of my order . Was hopin for quarters or dimes thou . <p> Great service ! <p> Edward on 3/6/15 <p> First time dealing with Provident. ordered 2 $100 face value Junk Silver bags . Requested dimes and quarters . Arrived today . One bag was all quarters and the other was some quarters and mostly dimes . Very satisfied with the product as well as the service and support and will recommend Provident to friends . <p> Fast Shipping even with the storms <p> Curt on 3/4/15 <p> My order was received in 3 days even with the snow storms . Received all half dollars in great shape . Happy , Happy , Happy . Thanks Provident Metals for a great product at a great price . <p> 99% accurate order <p> Chris on 2/23/15 <p> I ordered $10 face and received all dimes . I did find a 1968 dime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request I had makes up for the difference . <p> Great Purchase <p> Brentyn on 2/8/15 <p> Added $3 face to an order ! Received all quarters and they were in AU+ condition ! Awesome ! The 1964s were in BU condition ! ! Could n't be happier <p> Solid Overall - A Clad in with the Silver <p> Ken on 1/16/15 <p> This is the very first non-five star review I am giving Provident . In my latest order I added a couple of bucks worth of 90% coins as I always do . I was surprised that out of the 20 dimes sent , one was actually a fairly obvious clad- a 1965 . It 's only one dime , but with such a small order , that meant that 5% of the silver was actually clad . <p> 100 nice Mercury Dimes <p> Philip on 1/3/15 <p> Always order at least $10 face in constitutional silver and I am happy with what Provident ships . This time it was 100 nice Mercury dimes , no slicks or culls . My favorite dimes ! Have gotten dimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing what they will ship . I recommend you spread out your order to get better variety . Thanks Provident - you rock ! <p> I 'm overall happy with the order , but was hoping for less worn pieces . I purchased $10 face and received all quarters ( Washington ) . Most are in really nice shape and are from the 50's-64 . I did receive two dollars of worn quarters from the 40 's . Order was shipped within a couple of days and arrived in two more . Quick service ... will purchase again . <p> Ordered one unit . <p> Al on 12/14/14 <p> Received 10 silver Roosevelt dimes . I was surprised with the dimes , and I 'm really happy with them . <p> *Update* <p> Shelby on 10/23/14 <p> Received my second order in five days once again and my third shipped out just as fast . They gave me all Franklin halves this time and that was a welcome surprise . This is the first online dealer I 've used and I do n't think I will be looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Great Company <p> Shelby on 10/21/14 <p> I ordered $40 face value in my first order on October 15th . It shipped on the 17th and I received on the 20th ! After reading some of the past reviews I was absolutely amazed at how fast I had my coins in hand . I hoped for a mix but received all quarters , just meant I had to order some more ; ) All silver coins were there . There were four cull standing liberties , but they were still pretty awesome . I placed my second order a few days ago and realized yesterday that it now says stock delayed . So I do n't  know if shipping will be as fast but honestly , I buy silver for the future anyways so I 'm not worried about waiting a bit when the price is this good ! Thanks Providentify ! <p> Best Deals On The Web <p> Rob on 10/19/14 <p> Great coins at a great price . I bought 10 lots and all were Washington quarters . Most of the 40 coins were Good to Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Nothing rare , by any means , but definitely worth more for their numismatic value than their silver content . And to top it off , shipping was super-fast -- I think I ordered on a Wednesday a couple of weeks ago , and they were here that Saturday . <p> One other thing . I 'm not really one to gush over a business , but when a company earns my business with outstanding service and great prices , I believe it 's only fair to give credit where credit is due -- I 've searched the web high and low for good deals on silver and Provident Metals has far and away the best prices of any of the major precious metals dealers I 've come across on the web . This product , for instance , which Provident sells for $13.94 ( as of this writing ) is well over $14 at some of the other major dealers . Another example ? Provident is selling NGC MS64 Morgan dollars for $69.95 -- all others are at $71 and change or higher . Might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds up . <p> So overall , a great product , great prices , a smooth transaction and fast shipping . Ca n't ask for much more than that . <p> I know they 're called junk ... not my favorite purchase <p> Ruth on 10/17/14 <p> I have purchased from Provident several times and am usually very pleased with what arrives in the mail . This time ... not so much . I ordered $50 face value of junk silver and received 500 well-worn dimes : 499 Roosevelts and one lonely Mercury dime . The majority are 1964s , and very few are shiny . I 'm disappointed that , since Provident chose to send me dimes , they did n't include more Mercurys ( one of my favorite coins ) . It was tedious counting the order , because most of the dimes do n't even look like 90% silver and I had to use a magnifier to check the dates . I wish I had added a couple dollars face value to each of my previous orders instead of buying a large order of these at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10/16/14 <p> Ordered $10 face and got quarters . I really love this option to order exactly how much you want to fit your budget . I have made several of these orders and have been happy each time . Will definitely order again . Hoping for dimes next time ! <p> ok <p> chad on 10/9/14 <p> I got $5 face value . Received all dimes ( 50 ) no mercury . Got what I asked for but wo n't be ordering these again . <p> Outstanding Experience <p> Matt on 10/6/14 <p> Received all $30 face in quarters , including one well worn Standing Liberty . Most quarters in good shape , better than expected . Even received some in AU and BU condition . Average weight per face dollar was .719 troy ounces , better than the .715 advertised . Fair prices compared to spot price . Excellent communication from Provident on every step of the process . Keep me well informed . The only drawback was the slight delay incurred when Provident held the order for payment confirmation , even though my check had already cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ordered and accepted it as part of the deal . After the order cleared the processing queue , shipping was very fast . Well packaged . Overall outstanding experience . Will definitely order from Provident again . <p> 90% Junk Coins <p> AG on 9/26/14 <p> I was lucky enough to get all quarters in my order . Quarters were the only junk coins missing from my collection and most of them were from WW2 . <p> Very Happy <p> JY on 9/13/14 <p> Received all $10 in quarters . There was a good mix of dates . Many of the more recent coins were in great condition . The 2 Standing Liberty 's and the Barber were a welcome bonus . I 'd order this again . <p> AWESOME ! ! ! ! <p> Chris on 9/9/14 <p> I collect Error coins and I found 2 D/D quarters found a 1964 D over D , 1959 D over D and a beautiful 1948 Gold toned AU Quarter . Keep them coming Provident . <p> Great Quarters ! <p> Wade on 8/25/14 <p> I was pleased with the 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag a shot to see how I would like it . I knew I could get dimes even though I was really wanting quarters . Needless to say I was extremely pleased to see that I got four pretty nice quarters ; ( 1 ) 1962 , and ( 3 ) 1964s . <p> I would n't say they are uncirculated but I would say they are in very good condition - above normal given they are 50 years old ! <p> Do n't hesitate at giving this product a shot . <p> Happy happy <p> Tim on 8/12/14 <p> This is my second order of 90% from provident . I order about $10 face in each order and will be ordering again and again . I love the thrill of buying silver not knowing what your going to get . I 'm literally waiting at the door for the mailman when it comes in . Each time I have been satisfied . Mainly receive quarters which is fine by me . Have gotten some standing liberties , mostly worn and dateless but it 's pretty cool , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another batch next paycheck and I ca n't wait to see what I get . Thanks provident . I will be starting a tube channel uploading videos of my unboxings from provident , stay tuned ! <p> Repeat order review <p> Chad on 8/6/14 <p> Once again I am very happy with my purchase from Provident Metals . I ordered $7 face and I received all quarters which is exactly what I was hoping for . I will continue to buy these as much as I can because there is nothing like the feeling of 90% silver in your hand and the sound that it makes . Thanks for the fast shipping ( 6 days from order until in my hands ) and secure delivery . I will be back .... again ! <p> 5 Dollar Face ... Just to see <p> Mark on 6/14/14 <p> Ordered $5 Face just to see what I 'd get . All Quarters between 59 and 64 . I 'm happy and I 'll be ordering more . BTW ... ordered on Tuesday , here on Saturday . Thanks PM . <p> Received 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Received all Quarters . About 1/3 appear BU to me .

As described .. I 'll be ordering again <p> Excellent <p> Devon on 3/2/14 <p> Snagged $2 face to go along with a few other things in an order . Once again , Provident delivers . Received 8 quarters , 2 Barber in G/VG condition , 2 dateless standing liberty quarters , and 4 Washington quarters . Would definitely go to Provident again when it comes to buying 90% , and so should you . <p> Received what was ordered <p> David on 2/10/14 <p> This was my 2nd order of junk silver . Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked a little variety . 350 dimes is ok though . <p> Too Many Dimes ! ! <p> Stephen on 2/2/14 <p> I just received $300.00 face value of the mixed junk silver and $250.00 of it was dimes ! ! I wanted some dimes but not 2500 of them.Also there were four non-silver coins in the bunch . Provident has been good about making things right so I am not too concerned about it . <p> Nice collection of junk silver <p> Luke on 1/17/14 <p> Ordered $1 face value with my last order and I 'm not disappointed . Got 3 washington quarters that I would rate as AU and one Barber that was pretty worn . Even though it 's worn , it 's from 1898 and still worth more than a washington ! I 'll definitely be ordering this again with my next order . <p> good <p> kyle on 1/17/14 <p> got 4 quarters , which is what i wanted . 3 washingtons and 1 barber . 1 of the washingtons was pretty worn and the barber was REALLY worn , but overall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAPPY ... HAPPY <p> Michael on 12/30/13 <p> $1000 got me $66 in face . All Qtrs . OUT OF THIS I FINALLY GOT A DOUBLE DIE . Last big batch had many dimes . Time before this had $33 face in halves . The people saying they did not get a good selection need to come up on how many units they purchase . I now have 9 friends who seen what I got and now buy from Provident . I bought at auctions and E bay . No More ! It 's here . I get paid Friday and plan on going big again . Now if something comes in less than expected I can make my money back selling some locally . My local Pawn show is dying to find my source . Jump in- the waters HOT ! <p> great product fast shipping <p> Curt on 12/30/13 <p> I have received my order in 3 days . All coins in good shape dates from 1934 to 1964 . Thanks for a great product . <p> You get what you pay for . <p> Curt on 12/28/13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I got in quarters , but I was hoping for dimes , but you get what you get . Second order in transit now . Thank You Provident Metals . <p> Made it right <p> Stephen on 12/27/13 <p> My order was for $6 face value , but I only received 22 quarters . As soon as I made Provident aware of the problem they promptly sent me the missing coins . Good job Provident ! <p> Good value <p> Chris on 12/19/13 <p> I 'm a first time customer after some referrals and I 'm very happy . I got my order quick and it was just as advertised . We ended up getting all dimes , but that 's what the item says , dimes or quarters . It would have been cool to have some other things mixed in , but definitely no complaints here . The prices are very good and the products are as well , so we 'll be back again . <p> Not good <p> Daniel on 12/11/13 <p> Order $1 face value worth and I am glad I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 standing liberties ) and all were slicked out and under weight . I would not advise getting these coins because the silver weight was under and the premium was over melt . <p> Great <p> Travis on 12/9/13 <p> I received another order of 20 ..... Recieved 200 dimes . All readable dates . <p> MY PURCHASE AT PROVIDENT <p> ALFREDO on 12/9/13 <p> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY FIRST ORDER . I WILL SOON ORDER SOME MORE . <p> Very Good . <p> Jarred on 12/7/13 <p> Purchased these to fill holes in my quarter and dime book , but to my suprise I revieved all half dollars . Silver is Silver I will order again with hopes of getting the dimes . Very Satisfied . <p> All Washington 's <p> Ruben on 12/6/13 <p> Very happy with my order ! <p> love it <p> colton on 12/2/13 <p> Received all quarters 3 Washington and 1 standing liberty quarter . 2 of the Washington were BU one of them was AU and the standing liberty quarter was AU . <p> would order again <p> Mike on 11/22/13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and thin but i was surprised at how many look almost uncirculated . <p> Really Pleased <p> Larry on 11/17/13 <p> Ordered $25 face , expecting dimes or quarters &amp; received all halves , a nice surprise . If I had specifically ordering halves I would have paid about $1.40 more per dollar face , so I figure I saved $35.00 more or less on a $445 purchase for a 7% discount . Nice deal . Received 11 Kennedys , all 1964 's , 15 Franklins and 24 Liberty Walkers . Two of the Kennedys I might grade BU , five AU . Maybe one AU in the Franklins . Remainder were pretty much average circulated with only 2 or 3 real culls . I 'm happy . Another surprise , previous orders took 3 weeks for delivery with a certified check , this order filled in 2 weeks with a personal check . Go figure . <p> Great deal <p> Travis on 11/17/13 <p> I have made several purchases of these and and have never been let down . Just received my last order and am pleased as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda and hot water they look great . <p> Very Happy ! ! <p> Tim on 10/28/13 <p> Recieved all quarters and even a couple of very nice proofs ! I am very happy with my purchase and the customer service at Provident is outstanding ! ! <p> Kind of disappointed <p> Mongoose on 10/15/13 <p> Ordered $20 , received all quarters , which I 'm ok with . About 1/4 of them were SLQ , one Barber , and the rest were Washington . Most of the Washingtons were in very good condition with many near uncirculated . However , all of the standing libs with the exception of one were dateless slicks ; many of them were nearly unrecognizable . I stacked them next to a similar number of the Washingtons and the stack of Washingtons was a few quarter thicknesses taller . I was expecting them to show some wear but was surprised by such a great percentage of them being in slick to cull condition . I 've ordered from PM several times and this is the first time I 've been somewhat disappointed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all quarters . Will buy again . <p> Quarters <p> Blue on 9/30/13 <p> Received all Quarters that are nice and one standing liberty that was extremely worn , no date and barely make out the eagle on the back . nearly half the thickness of the other quarters . Overall though satisfied . <p> Very pleased <p> Alex on 9/11/13 <p> I bought $9.00 worth as part of a larger order . I received 34 Washington quarters and 2 Barber quarters , which I was ecstatic about . I 'm very pleased with the condition of all the coins and the shipment time . Thanks . <p> Great ! <p> Ryan on 8/31/13 <p> I like to buy a few of these every time I place an order at provident . The last 2 times I have received all quarters . Would love to get some dimes , but I guess you ca n't be to picky with these great prices : D good investment . <p> Very Pleased ! ! ! <p> Michael A on 8/27/13 <p> I purchased $15.00 face value for my initial purchase .... mostly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins instead of junk silver . I received all Quarters in my lot and they were all very clean and nice . Whether by design or not , I actually received $15.25 face value with an extra thrown in for good luck ! Thank you for an excellent transaction and you have created a loyal customer ! <p> $4 face purchased and all quarters recieved . <p> Hank on 7/28/13 <p> I received 16 Quarters , all in the 60s VG to AU grades . One of those 16 was a 1936 D that was in Good condition , One standing liberty that was extremely worn , no date and barely make out the eagle on the back . nearly half the size of the other quarters . <p> Over all a good investment for this market . <p> Hank <p> Good purchase <p> Ken on 7/27/13 <p> This was my first order and was well pleased . I bought $5 and got all quarters with dates ranging from the 1930 's to 1964 . These were purchased for the silver content so this was fine with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time around <p> Michael on 7/11/13 <p> I bought $30 face in this lot . Did not know what to expect . These came all dimes . I had 138 Mercury and 165 Rosy 's . Yes , they went over by a few and it did indeed scale to weight . I had 16 extreme nice coins in this lot . NO skins in this lot at all . I am doing this again and again . Thank you for the great deal . Now onto some other coins . <p> Another great order <p> Tim on 6/29/13 <p> I received all halves with my order , which is awesome . A good mix of ' 64 Kennedy 's , Franklin 's , a couple Walking Liberty 's , and a Barber half ( my first ! ) . <p> 90% is a great investment for small to serious stackers . <p> Very Pleased . <p> William on 6/27/13 <p> Placed order for $60.00 face value and received all dimes , one week later.Have not sorted yet , however most are in great condition , many are higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting and grading these . <p> As always , Great Service . <p> Still stacking <p> Damon on 6/25/13 <p> These are what I started with&amp; I 'm still a buyer even now , even with increased premiums . They have n't been minted in nearly 50 years , it 's a sign if scarcity . It 's also a good reminder of our dollars list purchasing power . Gas is still a quarter , if its the right type . Never had any issues in several orders of these <p> Nice ! <p> Caleb on 5/25/13 <p> I really like these . I have some pretty old ones in very good condition.nlove provident metals for selling these . <p> Good quality , high premium over spot . <p> Jordan on 4/26/13 <p> This junk silver is exactly as described . Great product ; however , with the price drop in silver , you are paying a hefty premium . <p> Happy Customer <p> Eric on 4/16/13 <p> I ordered $1 face value just to test it out . I got in quarters , but I was hoping for dimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provident Metals . <p> Flawless Transaction , Great Service <p> Thomas on 4/13/13 <p> This was my first order from Provident ; $26 face value and I received 260 dimes ( would n't have minded a few quarters but no complaints ! ) . I buy only for the silver content so the lack of older numi 's does n't bother me in the least . Delivery was 13 days from the day I placed my order online , perhaps a little later than I 'd prefer ( hey , I 'm the impatient sort , what can I say ? ) but again , no complaints . All the dimes are G to VG+ condition which is just fine for my needs . I like that Provident does n't require a CC when ordering by check/MO so that 's a plus in my book . Overall I 'm very happy w/price , shipping and Provident keeping me informed every step of the way via email so Provident can count on me ordering again soon ! <p> What a great company to deal with ! <p> Gerry on 4/3/13 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years now . I have placed about 8 or 9 orders for various coins , mostly junk silver . I have NO complaints , and their prices are better than anyone else I have found . The one and only time I got a couple of very bad coins , a phone call replaced them . Great to have an honest and reliable company to trust with my investments ! <p> I 'll be back <p> Robert on 3/14/13 <p> First order of these and very nice indeed . I got $20 face and received a 50-50 mix of quarters and dimes . Got about two dollars worth of the ATB quarters that were all BU or better . Soon as the wife gives me more money , I plan to buy more . <p> Pleased <p> rich on 3/12/13 <p> Ordered $20.00 &amp; received all dimes , including 60 Mercs &amp; 1 Barber.This is my third order &amp; all have been very satisfactory.Will be back for more . <p> Better than expected ! <p> Javier on 2/25/13 <p> I bought $5 I believe ; all in quarters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . I just wish they 'd lower the price , I found a local dealer that does $20 bucks per dollar . <p> Good deal ! <p> uri on 2/19/13 <p> ordered $1 worth to get a feel for this product . The idea of " our choice " is new to me but seems like it could be a pleasant surprise . I received a standing liberty ( ca n't make out the date ) . a 1960. a 1941 and a 1909 barber quarter that was in great condition . That coin alone made this purchase worth it . I 'll be ordering again once they are back in stock . <p> Very pleased <p> Phil D on 2/6/13 <p> Ordered $20. face and was hoping for dimes . Hooray , all dimes and almost half were nice Mercury Liberty dimes in beautiful condition , too . 4 were Barbers , 103 were Roosevelts . Will include more constitutional silver again on next order.Thank you Provident ! <p> Good Service <p> matt on 2/5/13 <p> Ordered $100 face value . Got all dimes ( which is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not silver . A 2 minute phone call to customer service , and they were replaced in days . Great service and speedy delivery . Will order more . <p> Very Nice <p> Blue on 2/1/13 <p> Received my latest order and once again Providence Metals comes through . THANKS <p> Right on time <p> Ethan on 1/29/13 <p> I ordered $4 face value and got 16 shiny quarters in 8 days . I will be ordering again and again as these will still be worth something after the dollar falls apart . Thanks for the excellent service . <p> Good service <p> Larry on 1/29/13 <p> I places my first order in December . It took about 8 days to come in . I used the debit card to pay . I only ordered $2 and got all quarters . They were what I expected I guess . I put 4 stars because i do n't  know if this was good for them or not . after next order i will have a better idea . Next time I may use the cash price option to not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my next purchase to maximize my shipping costs . Good job Provident ! <p> Mercuries and Roosevelts <p> Mage on 1/10/13 <p> Just got $17 face of junk silver in provident all in Dimes which is what we wanted . $11+ in Roosevelts and $5+ in Mercs . Before we got all in halves which was n't bad either . As always a great experience with provident . <p> Great service and quality <p> Chad on 12/31/12 <p> I have received all quarters from my different orders . Most were washington but did have a couple standing liberty quarters as well . Very satisfied with Provident and how they offer options for small buyers . They have a new customer for life because of this , their quality of items and their low shipping costs . Thanks Provident ! <p> not super pretty , but it is junk after all . junk wealth that is . <p> J on 12/31/12 <p> bought $100 face and got 1000 dimes . It is what I 'd hoped for so ca n't complain . Overall a very good experience . <p> No Complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ordering 90% coins from Provident since last summer . I buy for the silver content , but the quality of the coins I 've gotten so far has been pretty good . Some of them have been incredible beautiful . I 've only gotten quarters everytime I 've ordered them . ( I 'm holding out hope I 'll be suprised by dimes one of these months . ) I 'm on a pretty small budget when it comes to buying silver . I really like that I can buy in small amounts . It is a huge plus . This is the only site I 've found so far that I can do that with . Provident has a loyal customer with me . <p> fair deal ! <p> David on 12/27/12 <p> I just had gone thru my latest purchase and found a few AU 25 cent pieces.Most were VG+ , so that 's why I buy from Provident . <p> Great quality items cheap ! ! ! <p> stephen on 12/26/12 <p> second time buying this . Bought $5 face and it came all quarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all quarters but it is what it is . All were great dates and no cull items , so that 's always a plus . Six provident metals orders and very pleased with all six . <p> Among other things , I ordered $50 in junk silver . It came all quarters , ranging from excellent to poor condition . I do n't mind the few poor examples because this is an investment in silver , not coins . Nevertheless , three of the quarters are worth *way* more than the silver value , including a nearly uncirculated 1938 . <p> I also got silver eagles , which are gorgeous and perfect . <p> It took a little longer for delivery than I would have preferred , but still well within Provident 's estimate . <p> provident rocks <p> JD on 12/12/12 <p> Got my first order today . 3$ face . It came all quarters . 1 is a standing liberty ( 1930 ) . 2 are 1964 nearly uncirculated. 3 were WWII at least fine . Also order 5 1/10 ozt incuse indian rounds and airtights . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment was fast . Thus the 4 stars . Overall , I 'm very pleased . I will be ordering again soon . I certainly will pay the small debit card premium in order to cut down on wait time . It nearly drove me nuts . Thank you provident for allowing us to buy small quantities ! ! <p> Great mix of coins ! <p> Willie on 12/4/12 <p> I just received my first order from Provident Metals and I could n't be more pleased , as it is just what I expected and more ! My order was for $20 face value and I received half of it in dimes and half in quarters . There is a very nice mixture of coins as well . I received mostly Roosevelt dimes , but also had several Mercury and Barber dimes as well . There was also a Standing Liberty quarter mixed in my Washington quarters too . The quality was nice too , ranging from decently warn to nearly uncirculated on some . All but the Standing Liberty quarter had readable dates . I am very happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk silver coins from in the future ! Thank you Provident Metals ! <p> Another 90% Purchase <p> Jared on 12/3/12 <p> Have ordered several times now from Provident &amp; have never been disappointed . $20 face--All quarters ( had 3 standing liberties-worn &amp; no date ) . Provident 's prices are hard to beat . <p> great quality coins <p> stephen on 11/26/12 <p> Got my order today . Took two weeks but who cares its silver . All dates but one readable most in the forties and thirties . $10 all quarters which is totally fine . Will be buying again ! One of the only places you can buy by the dollar and it still be a great deal ! <p> Fast Shipping , Great Coins ! <p> Tim on 11/8/12 <p> I ordered over $20 in face and received all halves , which was what I was secretly hoping to receive . About 1/2 were ' 64 Kennedy 's , several in excellent condition , 4 Walking Liberties , one of which was in nearly perfect condition , and the rest were Franklin 's , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely order again ! <p> Sigh <p> Stephen on 11/2/12 <p> Eight quarters are now worth almost $50.00 . <p> Talk about depressing ! <p> But the coins are as promised and delivery was fast . Thank you Provident ! <p> Very nice ! <p> David on 10/16/12 <p> I have purchased several times from Provident and have never been disappointed.The latest was labeled junk but it was far from that.Provident IS THE PLACE to buy your coins ! <p> Great stuff <p> Ryan on 9/26/12 <p> I just recieved my shipment of 100 dollars . It was all quarters which is just fine by me . It was pretty much all Washingtons with two really rough barbers . I bought it as a silver investment but over 7 dollars worth of Washingtons were just beautiful coins worth far more than their silver content . I pulled them out and will be keeping them with my coin collection . Very pleased with the quality ! <p> Awesome Junk ! <p> Jake on 8/5/12 <p> Another great and quick delivery by providentmetals . You ca n't go wrong buying these coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper . Will be coming back next month hopefully they keep their prices low . Thanks PM . <p> Outstanding ! <p> Tom on 8/4/12 <p> Ordered on Thursday and received my order on Saturday . I bought $10 face and received all dimes . Sixty-five Roosevelt and thirty-five Mercury . Three of the Mercs appear to be nearly uncirculated . Could n't be happier . <p> Another great transaction ! <p> Daniel on 8/1/12 <p> I received all halves in my order and a few were either AU or BU quality ! Shipping seems slow if you write a personal check but they ship within their stated guidelines.All in all another perfect transaction ! <p> 50/50 <p> Troy on 8/1/12 <p> I received 4 quarters . One 1964D almost uncirculated , One 1964 with nice toning , One 1952 heavilly worn quarter and a 1934 CULL quarter that is heavily worn with several deep gouges . I realize it 's called " Junk " but I was n't expecting any CULL ! <p> Nice coins . <p> Marvin on 7/18/12 <p> Nice coins . Took a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a repeat customer . <p> Reliable , Fair Pricing <p> David on 7/17/12 <p> Finally a company that knows how to do business without attempting to screw the customer . I received my $100 face junk 90% after the requisite waiting period for the funds to clear , and I have no complaints at all . They shipped as soon as possible , the coin count was correct and the description is as advertised , with some cull pieces but mostly grading poor ( not so many ) up to fair/good ( most ) . I 'm very happy with your service , and I have just ordered some survival food and more Franklin halves . Your pricing is quite fair and consistent with market prices . Thank you ! I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship . <p> Nice selection of halves <p> majorTom on 7/17/12 <p> Purchased $6 face : 3 walkers , 7 Franklin and 2 Kennedy . 6 different dates for the Franklin 's . Very happy with the selection . Ordered on Friday received on Monday , and packaged very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices ! <p> David on 7/15/12 <p> The best junk for your buck . Awesome ! <p> AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE ! <p> Jeffrey on 7/11/12 <p> Received $5 face in junk silver coin , which I realize is not a " LARGE " order . I was disappointed in one coin . When I contacted customer service not only was I given a choice on how to satisfy my disappointment but I was treated as if I were a " BIG SPENDER " ! This kind of customer service is hard to come by these days from any size company ! PM you not only made my day but you have earned a customer for life ! I doubt any other company can compare their customer service with yours especially for us " SMALL SPENDERS " ! Keep up the great job ! <p> Nice alternative to fractional coins <p> Brandon on 7/9/12 <p> I just received my shipment of $10 USD face value in " junk silver " coins . The order was all quarters and broke down as follows : <p> 1930s - 11940s - 101950s - 91960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins were dated 1964 <p> I am small buyer who has chosen to convert some of his savings into hard assets . I have bought 1 oz bars from other sites and have recently become a buyer with Provident Metals . PM offers a pretty decent selection : I particular like their Indian-head fractional ounces and their prices are far better than other sites . <p> The recent " Derecho " storms that hit the Southeast and my community have made me reconsider the value of cash and silver when the power-grid goes down . Gas , banks , ATM and grocery were all closed and when they opened the lines were very long . <p> I will continue to purchase 90% silver when my funds allow but will likely focus more on food storage by adding Wise Foods to my next order . <p> Repeat customer . <p> Brent on 7/8/12 <p> Provident has the best prices that I can find . They are fair and ship quickly . Highly recommended ! <p> Perfect <p> David on 7/6/12 <p> Received less than 5 days after placing my order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good to perfect condition <p> Happy Camper <p> Phil on 7/2/12 <p> Fast shipping on eight silver quarters . I 'm only interested in the silver so I ca n't grade the coins but all seem in good shape although one is quite warn . All are Washington quarters . This is my third purchase and I 'm very happy . <p> Multiple Orders , Multiple Times Satisfied ! <p> Dawg on 6/22/12 <p> I have received several orders of silver coins recently . I have been totally satisfied with the quality , diverse selection , prices and fast shipping . The BEST ! ! ! ! ! ! Thank you ! <p> Satisfaction <p> Phil on 6/11/12 <p> Just got eight quarters . I 'd have been happy with anything so this is just great . I 'm only interested in the silver so I wo n't comment on the condition but all the dates were readable . <p> I am a little disappointed in that it took a week after getting the order to ship . That 's why only four stars . I 'm happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> jeff on 6/11/12 <p> I ordered this item and had it delivered by the end of the week . I ordered 10 face dollars and it came in all dimes . <p> The Best Junk I 've Ever Had ! <p> Andrew on 6/9/12 <p> Just received my package and got mostly quarters and some dimes . ProMetals have the best prices online , trust me i already check everywhere , the only company that beats their prices is tulving , however they have a minimum purchase of 500 ounces , lol . I 'll continue to buy from this guys as long as they keep their prices/shipping reasonable . <p> Another stack of junk <p> Todd on 6/6/12 <p> Got another order of quarters and halfs . They are exactly as advertised . PM has the best price on the net . <p> very satisfied <p> Russell on 5/24/12 <p> I am a repeat satisfied customer who decided to jump in a bit deeper . I ordered $5,000 worth , requested and received all Washington quarters . I am very pleased with the overall quality of the coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few . Many were excellent to near BU . There were 987 coins in the package . I am a happy camper ! ! <p> Not junk ! <p> David on 5/21/12 <p> I have been very happy with my first order of $1.00 coins , the .50 and the so-called junk ! ? Provident is putting a smile on my family 's faces . I will buy again ! <p> A repeat customer for a reason <p> Ron on 5/19/12 <p> In this particular order , I received all quarters - mostly Washington type prior to 1965 , and one each Standing Liberty and Barber type . I keep coming back to Provident for all my smaller silver &amp; gold bullion coin orders for a reason . Their service is the best . They keep me updated with email notifications at each step of the order and shipment process . The website is so easy to use , and being available 24 hours a day let 's me take advantage of short term price drops in thinly traded overnight markets . And finally , when I have had minor issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accurately . I will keep coming back again and again . <p> MY FIRST " JUNK " BUY <p> Jeffrey on 5/19/12 <p> I ordered $10 face value of " junk " silver coins . Received $9 in Washington quarters and 3 Standing and 1 barber . very happy with the selection and value for the money ! <p> First " Junk " buy <p> Todd on 5/8/12 <p> Got my first shipment of $25 face value in junk coins and they were all quarters . That is great by me . Condition varys from fair to above average . I am pleased and will buy again . <p> First Time Buyer ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> christopher on 5/1/12 <p> Bought $8 face value of these and was extremely happy with these coins . All coins were quarters and were in good shape . 3 of the coins seemed to be in BU condition ! Found one quarter in BU that looks to have a die clash on the top of Washington 's head ! Who knows , might be worth lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , but I 'm happy to have gotten everything I paid for . Shipping was fast and easy and I will be buying more soon ! Keep up the good work Provident ! <p> Will repeat <p> nicholas on 4/30/12 <p> Ordered $17 face value . Received them all in dimes which was fine . 3 were mercury . One was a 1984 so I called customer service and they sent me a new one same day . Good customer service , will become a repeat customer . <p> What are they gon na be ? <p> Jared on 4/23/12 <p> $22 face : received quarters , had one standing liberty no date mixed in . Also a 2006 state series PF , ai n't sure about that really . Although it does say in the overview " lot could contain proof coins dated after 1992 " . Provident still rocks &amp; gon na keep ordering from them . <p> I have purchased just about all of my junk silver from Provident for the last three years . I have always been pleased with the coins received . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some mixed . But they have always had a good selection of collectible coins and hard silver value . I buy them primarily as investment and I 'm not as concerned about collectibility , but is certainly a bonus to find the collectible value in each order as well . Their prices are VERY hard to beat ! <p> Generally Pleased <p> Vincent on 4/5/12 <p> I received all dimes for my order ; maily a split between Roosevelts and Mercuries with a few Barbers . The only disappointment was that 3 Roosevelts were clad so I lost a little value there . Otherwise , the shipment was received on time and in good condition . <p> Good stuff <p> Silverrrr on 3/30/12 <p> Got a dollar face value just to see what I would get . Got a old Walking liberty and a Franklin half , the Franklin was pretty close to bu and the liberty was n't worn that much either . Either way silver this cheap is a bargain . Thanks Provident . <p> Second order <p> Steve on 3/26/12 <p> I 've ordered these coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving all in quarters with a mix of dates including three proof silver state quarters . The second batch was $4 face value , arriving all in dimes with a mix of dates including 3 mercury dimes . I 'm happy with my orders and will be ordering again soon ! <p> Stop searching . This is the place to buy . <p> Bert on 3/5/12 <p> Just signed for my latest order . $4 face value to go with the $3 from last order . 28 total coins ( all Washington quarters ) , 14 different dates among them . There is nowhere I have found to buy 90% silver U.S. coins this cheap , let alone in this small denomination . For those of us who can not afford to buy a $1000 FV bag , or even a $100 FV bag for that mater , Provident gives an affordable opportunity to stack physical Silver . As soon as I am done writing this , I am placing my next order ! <p> Fantastic as usual <p> Bert on 3/4/12 <p> I have ordered several times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value to go with my gold purchase . 12 Washington quarters 7 different dates , all in excellent condition . This is the place to buy if you are looking to stack . <p> $9500 all in dimes <p> Bought high on 1/30/12 <p> Was a bit surprised to get $9500 worth all in dimes . Not Provident Metals fault that I bought at the peak . : - ( <p> Great service ! <p> Great quality <p> Steven on 1/30/12 <p> I received all quarters and they even sent me a standing liberty ! <p> First Time Buy from Provident <p> Mike on 1/26/12 <p> I ordered $40 face value of " Junk Silver " .

The dates were a good mix from 1932 up to 1964 with lots from the 1940 's . The 1964 's were in very good condition and the older coins were lightly worn and had character to them . I had a few standing liberties in the bunch ( maybe 5 ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitechredneck on 10/12/11 <p> Just got another $100 bag order in. 56 of which were walkers , 8 barbers , 35 franklins , and the rest were 64 's . Now I know some of you guys out there might think big deal , when it really is . I have purchased $100 bags from PMEX and did n't receive anything older than a George Washington quarter , and the oldest of those I believe was a 1938 , No BU 's either and paid $1 more per $1 face than here at Provident . I 've have purchased $100 bags from individual dealers that gave a good mix of coins and would have to say that the experience , thus far after buying now a couple of $100 face bags from Provident , is a lot easier and less annoying than buying from an individual . And the products are better than my expectations . <p> Roll the dice .. <p> Chris on 10/11/11 <p> I received all halves .. A few Barbers , Walking Libertys , but mostly 64 Kennedys and Franklins <p> Really cool coins <p> Hitechredneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all quarters about a roll of standing liberties.My second order was $50 again received all halves about 1/4 were walkers 1/4 benjamins and the rest were kennedys . Some were mirror finish proof like these were benjamins . Also quarters had some with the same finish . Placed another order for $100 face and checked to see if I could specify and currently all they have is halves . So I think they are as good as it gets for fair pricing and product quality . Especially when you can buy 1$ for the same price as $99 . <p> My only regret .......... <p> Cliffy on 9/30/11 <p> was that I did n't find out about Provident Metals until August of this year . I had bought " A-mark " silver 1oz rounds with a group of friends , through another company who also carried junk silver coins . This was in early 2010 ( approx. $17oz ! ! ! ! ) I had wanted to buy more silver , but many companies including the one we used had very high minimums . Junk was $1000 face minimum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with that kind of cash quickly . <p> But with Provident I can buy a little here , a little there as my budget allows . I have made and received 3 orders thus-far . I 'll buy $3 or $4 face at a time . As others have stated , some of the coins look un-circulated ( I received some 1964 quarters and some 1957 Dimes that looked pristine ) . <p> Provident has provided an honest , safe and reliable way for us common folk to invest in silver and other precious metals . Keep up the good work ! <p> BEATS THE HECK OUT OF EBAY PRICES <p> butch on 9/29/11 <p> Better quality than I expected at a great price . I will be purchasing only here <p> Impressed <p> james on 9/27/11 <p> First time ordering from Provident and i have to say i was really impressed .

Ca n't go wrong ! <p> Great Buy ! <p> Eric on 9/23/11 <p> The coins arrived quickly via USPS , and most were in great condition . Some were even quite " new " , like straight from the mint . I am investing for the silver and not for my collection , so condition is not important . Definitely will buy more of these coins . I got a bunch of Washington quarters , which was what I wanted ! <p> lowest premium over spot <p> Bob on 9/23/11 <p> I have been looking on the internet for several years and never found a lower premium over spot for junk silver . Prices on bullion coins are excellent also but the junk silver deal is the best . <p> I have bought items on ebay but bidders there do n't seem to know that they can buy without competition here and get whatever quantities they want . Many times , they will bid more than you pay here . Guess that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received a box in the mail that indicated nothing to do with Provident Metals or coins , silver etc . The return address made it look like something ordinary and unsuspecting . The coins were all quarters . Some very well worn and some looking brand new .

All of the bars in my order were struck just fine . Frankly , I do n't sit around staring at my bars so I do n't need them to be especially pretty ... as long as they are 999 , store easily , and can be acquired at a low premium over spot then I 'm game ... and they get five stars . The only bar I gave less stars to was the OPM 1oz bars but certainly not for being ugly ... they just do n't store in standard albums and boxes because they are an odd size ... <p> Poor quality <p> Kevin on 1/30/14 <p> The snake on these bars is supposed to be frosted kinda like a proof coin would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the snake looks frosted which gives this bar a very ugly appearance .

Both look more or less brand new . Thoroughly satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8/23/14 <p> Purchased two of these rounds because that 's all I was allowed per order . I received 2 1982 rounds which were still in the original attached plastic packaging . Both rounds were in excellent shape . Ca n't wait until they get more in stock <p> A classic among silver rounds <p> Robert on 8/11/14 <p> Had to pick some up to add variety to the silver hoard . Thanks PM ! <p> Collector Rounds <p> Jared on 4/14/14 <p> Ordered two tubes when they went on sale . Received all 1985 's , but all were BU ... Amazing to see that old of a coin in such good shape . Great batch of Prospectors . Been a customer with Provident for a while , they are the people 's choice . <p> unbelievable <p> Mike R ( Long island ) on 11/14/13 <p> I just got my delivery of 5 coins.These baby 's are almost proof like condition.All thecoins were 1987 eagle reverse.I would 've loved more than one year but still VERYVERY HAPPY.Keep up the the good work . <p> THANK YOU PROVIDENT <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10/13/13 <p> I recently purchased two of these Engelhardt Prospector silver rounds . They were both 1984 's and were in more or less new condition . I 'm very pleased with this purchase . <p> Good stuff <p> Chris on 8/30/13 <p> I ordered a few of these just see the quality . They came 8 days after I ordered them and were in pretty decent condition considering the age of the rounds and that they are obviously second hand . I definitely recommend and have since ordered more . Was hoping for different dates but only received 1985 's . Not a big deal at all . <p> thanks <p> joseph on 7/25/13 <p> " Unbelieveable " ! That is what I said to my wife as I unpacked the box of Prospector coins and saw them for the first time . I have had a few purchases for other items with Provident this past year so I guess I should n't have been surprised . Some of these will be gifts to relatives so their condition is much appreciated . Thanks ! <p> Much Better Than Photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered four and received a 1984 and three dated 1986 . They look new and have a brilliant detailed design . I am thrilled - once again Provident came through with a great find , fair price and great service . <p> Fantastic <p> Jason on 7/19/13 <p> Just received a few and I have to say that the quality for these 1984 &amp; 85 's is spectacular . Thanks again Provident <p> Excellent coins <p> DY on 7/19/13 <p> I 've always liked these coins because Englehard was a good mint that produced high-quality coins . Because they stopped making these in 1988 , they 're great collector 's pieces . Most of my coins varied in dates from 1982- 1985 . Some have the Englehard logo on the bag , while others have an attractive eagle design . All of them look just as brilliant and stunning as if they were freshly minted ( which tells me that someone knew how to store their silver ) . <p> Go Provident ! <p> Matt M. on 7/15/13 <p> Picked up three of these great looking ( AU ) silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for the past three years so far , and all three ( 1984s ) look amazing ! Continue the great service and keep up the great deals and free shipping promos as well , many thanks . <p> Awesome <p> Sooner Silver on 3/9/13 <p> Awesome ! ! ! Enough said ! ! <p> Perfect <p> Robert on 1/20/13 <p> Bought 2 of these and I am very pleased . Thank you Provident . <p> Great ! <p> George on 1/12/13 <p> Just received my Prospectors . They look just like new , 1984 's &amp; 1985 's ! Put them straight into their Airtites for safe keeping . Another fantastic job by Provident Metals ! Thanks a Million ! <p> I was impressed . <p> Timothy on 1/7/13 <p> I ordered 10 of these Engelhard Prospector rounds . I had never done business with Provident Metals , so I was n't sure of what to expect , but , I had been wanting some of these for my collection for awhile now and I decided to take a chance . And , I am glad that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absolutely perfect . They are all 1984 with the Eagle on the reverse . For being almost 30 years old , 9 of them look like they were minted this morning . The 10th one has no marks or scratches , although it does have a light golden surface . It still is a satisfying round . I will make another purchase from Provident Metals , just to see if they can impress me again . <p> Good for it 's age . <p> Chad on 11/6/12 <p> I love the design of this round . The one I received was worn a bit , but I 'd assume quite good for its age . <p> Near Mint <p> David on 10/30/12 <p> Ordered one and it arrived with a flawless shine/near mint condition . Fast shipping . Very pleased ! <p> Great investment <p> thesilverboom on 10/29/12 <p> Love the one troy once .999+ fine silver ! ! ! ! ! woowow nice piece of history . <p> Much Nicer than Expected <p> Jason L on 10/23/12 <p> I purchased just one round of the Prospector , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The design on the coin is truly beautiful , and no pictures that I have seen truly do it justice . The round showed no wear at all and looks like a brand new piece . <p> Great Oldies but Goodies <p> Ken on 5/9/12 <p> Fabulous silver round with a high luster and minimal toning ( Its 30 Years old ) . I collected a lot of these as a young man , they were all I 'd buy .

Trust me , they are truly superb ! <p> NEW ! ! ! <p> bao on 1/9/11 <p> beautiful coins ! just got my shipment from PM and was pleasantly surprised at how nice these coins are ! Engelhard FTW ! ! <p> Engelhard silver bullion products , due to their long history of desirability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors that is second to none . After being formed in the early twentieth century , the Engelhard Corporation rapidly grew to become the world 's largest refiner of precious metals before being purchased by BASF in 2006 . There are no better names in the private precious metals industry , and , since Engelhard ceased production of its silver bullion products in the late 1980 's , the only way to attain these highly sought after items is on the secondary market . <p> Because these silver rounds are obtained through the secondary market , we can not guarantee which design we will receive or ship .

Though data from the Labor Department shows that 43,000 mining jobs have been added since October , the mining category includes jobs in oil and gas extraction .
