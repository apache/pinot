@@45049583 @5049583/ <h> The Rise Of The Coupon Nation <h> The Rise Of The Coupon Nation <p> Once upon a time coupons were the domain of your nan , or maybe your mum who would cut one out of the newspaper on occasions when she found one . Then the big supermarkets started to get in on the act and issue their own in store coupons meaning that if you wanted to redeem them you had to shop in their store . This has now grown into a massive competition with almost all major retailers issuing coupons to various degrees , but it 's not just them anymore . <p> Gone are the days of scouring the paper for those elusive coupons it 's all gone technical . With retailers last year alone issuing in excess of 466m coupons online and with a whopping 76% of those being redeemed it seems we 're getting more eager for a bargain than ever before . <p> I am very pleased to say we are the UKs largest coupon website too . You wo n't find a website in the UK with more coupons than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company many couponers will be familiar with seeing on the bottom of their coupons as they issue over 80% of all online coupons , and as far as they are concerned , it 's only getting bigger with an average growth of 35% each year in the amount issued and redeemed . <p> The supermarkets themselves eager to get a piece of the action have struck deals with some of the more popular sites such as supersavvyme.co.uk with some of the coupons they issue being store specific in order to drive traffic their way . But with the majority of online coupons now being generic the hunt is on for the best bargain across quite a few retail stores . <p> Although the big discount stores do n't accept anyone else 's coupons claiming they already give amazing savings with their low prices , they are not immune to the coupon craze . Aldi until recently would regularly publish these and a handful of other coupons in the paper , and also not that long ago were giving away 50% of their baby range coupons in pregnancy and new mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they are ? If we were n't going to buy something , but did because it saved us 50P is it really a saving ? The answer is yes and no . Most of the big stores like Tesco 's will tailor the coupons they send you to what you already buy , with maybe the odd one to tempt you to something new . But with a lot of the generic ones you have to be a little more savvy . If you regularly buy the product because it 's the cheapest ( say the stores own brand ) and even with the coupon the label brad is more expensive , then no that 's not a saving . If however you buy a different label brand , have no loyalty to it for any reason and it 's the cheaper option then congratulations , you have yourself a bargain . <p> With the rise in coupons not seeming to be coming to an end anytime soon there seem to be more and more people who are cottoning onto the possibilities and the savings they could make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to expand , and include more and more ways of finding , getting and spending them . <p> Many codes and coupons now do n't even need to be printed out . Online apps and voucher codes as well as barcodes on your phone seem to be going hand in hand with the old fashioned paper coupons , and although we still seem to be light-years behind our American cousins , we have to ask is this the shape of coupon things to come ?

There is a full explanation of what they are and how to spot them further down this post . I have heard from a few of you in the past who have fallen victim to these pages and someone has had their bank account emptied after supplying her bank details for her cash prize to go into , another had to supply her mobile phone number so they could contact her regarding her prize which she then was added to a spam text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving from them . <p> Please , let everyone know about this .

Currently , parents are able to sacrifice part of their salary in order to obtain childcare vouchers of an equal amount . The big attraction of doing this is , you do n't have to pay any tax or National Insurance on the amount contributed to the scheme , which is where the big savings come into it . <p> For example , a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in child care vouchers after taking a salary sacrifice of the same amount , will benefit by saving -933 tax/NIC .

However , some parents are better off under the current arrangements . <p> The new scheme will not be available to families where either parent earns over -15,000 , whereas the current scheme offers high earners the opportunity to enjoy tax savings at the same level as basic-rate taxpayers . <p> The new arrangement also does n't provide any National Insurance savings which could be a significant loss to some people . <p> So for those of you who are n't already using childcare vouchers , there 's still time to get your company involved ! Remember , employers enjoy National Insurance savings from the current scheme so it would be in their best interest to set up a scheme before the 2015 deadline !

@@45049695 @5049695/ <h> The role of pocket money in teaching responsible money management <h> The role of pocket money in teaching responsible money management <p> Debt is on the increase , and this generation of children is growing up with a different perspective on money than any preceding generation . Pay day loans , mortgage rates and credit cards are all part of daily advertising , and money is , apparently , readily available to meet all our needs . So how can we teach our children responsible money management , especially in the current lending culture ? Pocket money is part of the lives of most children , although how much they receive and what they can do with it is very much a family decision . But in todays society , its also an ideal mechanism for teaching children how to be fiscally responsible , so some all-round parenting advice might be helpful.I give my 3 children -3 a week pocket money . I have been told a few times that -3 is nothing and I 'm obviously tight but worked out over a month , -3 will set me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill ! <p> Research shows that when there 's a gap between what parents say and what they do , children will always follow actions before words . So before you even start thinking about the issues around pocket money , its worth taking a good look at your own attitude to spending . Do you live beyond your means , or is your debt sensibly managed ? Do you like to spend now and pay later with credit cards , or are you more inclined to save for things you want ? Whatever your choices , be prepared to explain them to your child and help them to understand the language of money . <p> The first question you then need to ask is : how much should you give your child ? That depends not just on the age of your child , but on what you expect them to do with it . For example , do you expect your teens to pay for their own bus fares , phone and clothes ? Or do you think that pocket money should be a freebie , for your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills ? <p> You should also consider whether your want to attach conditions to the weekly payout . The term pocket money actually stems from a small money pocket in which people could put money that they were given without having to work for it . Many parents , however , feel that doing chores is a fair exchange , which teaches children the value of work and the fact that nothing comes free . <p> Also talk to your child about how they spend their money . If you include an element to be saved , are you going to insist on this , or allow your child a free choice and just give advice on saving ? The most important lesson your young child will learn is that once its gone , its gone , and that can be a strong motivation to save . Giving a little extra when you see your child saving for something will help to encourage a good habit . <p> In a society which is becoming ever-more polarised financially , and as poverty , disease and the effects of war fill our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , to give to charity . Include your child in this , and allow them to be part of the giving . Teaching your child the power of money is a vital life lesson . Teach it well , and your child will grow into an adult who is not just sensible , but generous and caring in the way they use what they have .

The water was through really quickly and there was pretty much just a cup of hot water for the finished product . I like a strong coffee ( 6 strength ) so there should have been no issues getting some flavour into the drink , but no , nothing.Not Sending feedback ... <p> I love the idea of this , but in reality it is disappointing for reasons including the following : <p> - due to its design you have to purchase the cone paper filters if you want a decent coffee- the coffee is typically lukewarm ; using already boiling water does n't work as the water dispenser only works with water below a certain temperature , leaving the hot water sitting in the machine. - the flask is a nice idea but , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coffee on the go it would 've made sense for the flask to fit in a general car cup holder .
