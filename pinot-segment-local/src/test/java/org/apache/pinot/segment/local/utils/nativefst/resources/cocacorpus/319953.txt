Within a blue marlin trolling spread , a combination of hookless teasers , artificial lures , and live bait are used to attract marlin from the depths below and entice a bite . <h> Live Bait <p> Before a blue marlin can be caught , fresh and lively bait must first be obtained .

Do it wrong , you may never see a fish like that again ; do it right and you 've got the trophy of a lifetime . <h> Keep the Line Tight , - but not too Tight <p> It is essential that you keep a firm tension on the line at all times . If there is slack , the fish will have a better chance of throwing the hook , and you will be left with a large amount of disappointment .

By fighting their runs , all you are doing is increasing the chances that your line will break and your prize will get away . Instead , set the drag so the fish can take out line while still tiring itself . This will wear down the fish ; eventually their runs will get shorter , less violent , and less frequent . <h> Pull Up , Reel on the Down Motion , Repeat <p> When hauling in a big fish , you ca n't just reel , reel , reel and hope to land it quickly .

Go slow , be patient , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag about . <h> Keep Them Out of Structures- <p> This tip is for inshore saltwater fishing and angling on lake shores and rivers , so if you 're deep sea fishing , you can pretty much ignore it . If a fish is making a run for structure like logs , rocks , or reefs , the structure can strain the line and cause it to snap . If your trophy is heading for cover , do whatever you can to keep them out . Throw out the previous tips and go into emergency mode . If a heavy fish makes it into the cover , you can pretty much assume they will be lost , so draw the line , tighten the drag , and crank them out as hard as you can . If the line snaps , oh well ; you would have lost them if they made it to cover anyway . <h> Photo and Release as Soon as Possible <p> Okay , this tip is really for what to do after you reeled in a big fish , but it 's still important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as possible .

With the right approach , you can catch largemouth bass no matter how hot it gets . <h> Top-Water Lures for the Middle of the Day <p> Top-water fishing can be one of the most effective ways to catch bass on a hot , windless summer day . During the summer , the lake 's surrounding habitat is full of life , and it 's not just fish .

This is a great way to find active bass , as those lingering near the top are often in the market for a meal . <h> Cast Near the Grass and Weeds <p> After the spring spawn , bass like to move into grassy and weedy areas where they can rest and regain some energy . The depth can vary depending on the clarity of the water , as dark water will usually hold shallow bass while clear water will push the bass deeper . In general , fishing around the edges of grass and weed beds will be more effective in the early morning and late evening , when bass are usually more active .

One of the best places to find bass on a sunny day is underneath docks , where they are hanging out , cooling off , and waiting for a meal to come their way . Work on skipping chatter baits underneath the docks , or use a jig that you slowly finesse around the dock 's structure . Always remember , however , that your first priority should be respecting the property . Never do anything that could damage the area , and always retrieve a lure that has been snagged on the dock . <h> Make Some Noise <p> One last technique is to use lures that have some noise and vibrations .

Maybe you are buying your first fishing rod , or maybe you want to upgrade from your old push-button reel system. - Whatever your reasons , you need to do a little research before making your purchase . With these easy tips , you 'll have the right fishing reel for catching any species you want . <h> Instant Anti-Reverse Handles <p> Start your search by finding spinning reels that have no backwards motion on the handle . If you can more the handle backwards even a little , it can prevent a powerful and accurate hook set , greatly reducing your fishing success . <p> There should be no play whatsoever when you want to stop the reel .

The drag system should let out line in a smooth , seamless manner , without pulls and jerks as the line goes . If it jerks and stutters like a car with a bad transmission , it may not be the right choice of reel . <p> Most anglers recommend a front-drag system on a spinning lure , as it is closer to the spool and easier to access and adjust during the excitement of a catch . <h> Amount of Ball Bearings <p> We wo n't dive too deep into the mechanics , but just know that the greater the amount of ball bearings , the smoother the retrieve in your spinning reel . <p> Many experts recommend getting the reel with the most ball bearing that you can afford , but a good number to keep in mind is five .

A 4:1 gear ratio is considered slow , while a 6:1 is considered fast .

Almost anything bloody and meaty will work , including permit , cobia , amberjack , kingfish , and ladyfish . You should also consider mounting a skirt near the hook , as this will create tempting movements in the water and hide the hook from the shark 's vision. - <h> Techniques- <p> Most shark anglers will drift for sharks , using a chum line to bring them near the boat .

@@100945605 @5145605/ <h> Choosing the Right Baitcasting Reel <p> May 21 , 2015 <p> Any angler who wants to use a wide variety of artificial lures will eventually need to use a baitcasting reel , also known as baitcasters . Although they take time and patience to master , these reels are perfect for accurate casting , allowing you to cast with precision and stop a lure in midair . <p> So when you decide to purchase a baitcasting reel , what are some of the things you should consider ? Take a look at these helpful tips to get started . <h> Find the Right Gear Ratio <p> One of the first things you will need to do is find the right gear ratio " a factor that affects the speed of your lure retrieve .

For Texas rigs , jigs , and soft plastics , something in the area of 5:1 is a good choice . For some spinnerbaits , buzz baits , and other lures that need a fast action , you can go with a 6:1 or 7:1 reel . <h> Spool Size <p> Next , you will want to look at the reel 's spool size .

If you purchase a baitcasting reel that does n't feel comfortable in your hands you wo n't be an effective angler . A comfortable grip and well-balanced rod-and-reel combination can help you cast with more accuracy , especially after you have casted hundreds of times in a single outing . Take the time to try out multiple reels , testing out the mechanisms like thumb latches , tensioners , reeling handles , drag settings , and other features .

In general , they produce more noise , more flash , and more vibrations . They are also very versatile and come in varieties that allow you to cover every cubic foot of water . While they can be expensive at first , they can be reused over and over again . You can easily spend $15 on a single lure , but if you manage to keep it from snags , you 'll get your money 's worth . <h> Live Bait <p> Live bait is anything that is ( or recently was ) alive . Nightcrawlers and other worms are the universal choice for many anglers , as you can catch just about any freshwater fish with these animals . Basically , if a fish eats it in the wild , you can put it on a hook and use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flies , grasshoppers , crabs , shrimp , bluegills , and leeches . Many bait shops have a ready supply of nightcrawlers and wax worms , as well as fully-stocked minnow tanks . <p> Live bait is incredibly effective because you are presenting the fish with something they actually eat . It has the same smell , motion , and appearance as their natural food , so enticing a bite is usually as simple as dropping the bait and waiting . Unlike artificial lures , which have to be constantly casted and reeled , live bait is usually casted once and left alone . This makes it an especially easy way to take kids fishing . They can be messy , and it can be a hassle to purchase bait and keep it alive , but it 's a time-honored way to catch a pale full of fish . <h> The Right Apparel for Your Fishing Adventure <p> Anglers of all types need high-quality apparel , so visit the online store from Huk and check out our full selection of comfortable fishing apparel .

Check out these awesome tips from some of our pro staff to get the most out of your ice fishing experience . <h> Dress for the Weather- <p> If the ice is frozen enough to walk on that means the air is probably cold enough to freeze you quickly . Make sure you dress appropriately or your ice fishing adventure will be over before it starts . You 'll want to start with a base layer close to your skin .

You 'll be cozy and comfortable , all while enjoying one of the most interesting fishing challenges around. - <p> If you are not moving your fishing location , a permanent fish house gives you all the conveniences of a cabin , including warmth , lighting , and storage . Fish houses can also be installed with a small stove , bunk beds , and more . <p> If you plan on moving from spot to spot , a pop tent or portable fish house offers the protection you are looking for , although they wo n't be as insulated or convenient as a larger and heavier fish house. - <h> Breaking the Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position , it 's time to cut through the ice .

This can be very tiring and time consuming , but manual augers are more affordable and less likely to break . <p> Motorized or powered augers are easier to use , but they are more expensive and require fuel for operation . There are also augers that attach to a handheld drill , basically turning your power tool into an ice auger . Just be sure that your drill is strong enough for this task , as solid ice could ruin a perfectly good drill that 's not designed for this type of force . <p> Finally , do n't forget a scoop or tool for clearing out the hole when ice starts to reform . <h> Down to the Fishing <p> When preparing your gear for ice fishing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish house or pop tent .

But sometime taking a do-it-yourself approach to life is a good choice . While fly-tying is a popular hobby , not too many anglers have homemade bass lures in their tackle box . <p> You can change that . <p> Try out some of these homemade bass baits and you might find that making your own lures could be your new favorite hobby ... after fishing , of course ! <h> Bottle Cap Spinners <p> Perhaps the most basic of homemade lures , the bottle cap spinner is a great place to start . Simply fold a bottle cap in half and put a treble hook on one side and a swivel leader in the other .

By simply connecting treble hooks and a connection for your line to a wine cork , you have a top-water lure that will entice a hungry bass . By adding a bottle cap at the front , you increase the splashing of the lure , creating an irresistible temptation . <h> Kitchen Spoon Lures <p> How many spoons are there in your kitchen drawer ? Do you really need that many ? Why not use them something worthwhile , like catching fish ? Take a spoon of any size and cut the handle off . Smooth the cut edge and drill a small hole at both ends .

If you have been to the bait shop , you know what a lure looks like , so you can easily replicate the size and shape of an effective lure . If you want even more guidance , trace the shape of one of your lures so you know you 're getting it right . Add a little weight so the lure will sink , but not too much that it wo n't swim , and attack hooks at the underbelly and the tail . <p> All of these lures can be fully customized to meet your specific needs . You can add bright colors , earth tones , scale designs , and even eyes .

@@100945680 @5145680/ <h> How to Conserve your Favorite Fishing Spots <p> August 13 , 2015 <p> Every angler has their favorite fishing spot , and they all want their spots to last forever . Nothing is more disappointing than fishing in a spot for years , pulling out hundreds of trophies , only to have it wrecked by trash , over fishing , or poor conservation practices . <p> So what can you do to conserve your spot ? We 'd like to give you some simple tips to ensure your favorite fishing hole is there for years . <h> Keep- It Clean <p> The first thing you can do to preserve and conserve your favorite fishing spot is to treat it like your own yard . Clean it up , do n't leave your trash lying around , and always make sure it looks better than you left it . If your fishing from a boat , do n't let trash like wrappers or bait containers go overboard . If you 're fishing from shore , make sure you take everything home with you . Leave the spot looking great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Practice Catch and Release <p> Whether your spot is ten square miles of saltwater flats or a small corner on a farm pond , practicing catch and release is a good way to conserve the population and ensure plenty of fish for years to come . Legally , you are more than welcome to take your limit , and we would never tell you to stop keeping your fill , but if you want to ensure a healthy population for a long time , practicing catch and release on a few outings is a always good idea . <h> Handle and Release Fish Properly <p> If you are playing catch and release , it wo n't help if you harm the fish while handling it . The longer a fish fights on the end of your line , the more stress is goes through , so do n't toy with it ; get it off the hook as fast as possible . Also , remember that fish have a protective coating , and this slime can be scraped away with contact . Handle the fish quickly and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go back to increasing the game fish population . <h> Keep it Secret if You Can <p> It 's every angler 's moral dilemma : should you tell your friends and fellow fishermen about your spot , or should you keep it to yourself ? If your priority is keeping the spot beautiful , active , and full of fish , then telling other anglers wo n't help your cause . Sure , the chances of someone actually taking your spot , fishing it bare , and leaving you with nothing to catch is slim , but why risk it . There 's something peaceful and serene about having your own secret fishing spot . And , less competition for a great catch when there are n't any other anglers around . 50075 @qwx910075 50077 @qwx910077 50078 @qwx910078 50076 @qwx910076

@@100945684 @5145684/ <h> Fall Bass Fishing Tips <p> The fall is a great time for bass fishing . As the water cools , it triggers the feeding frenzy that gives anglers nearly effortless fishing . <p> With the right techniques , you can make the fall fishing season your best time for catching heavy-hitting , hard-fighting bass . <h> Look to the Rocks <p> During the fall , the water starts to cool , but rocks and boulders , which store heat better than any other structure in the lake , will hold schools of fish . Both bass and baitfish want to be near the warmer water , so any area with lot of rocks is a great place to start your fishing . Rock piles , erosion barriers , and other stone structures can give you plenty of action from bass that are looking to warm their bodies and catch a meal . <h> Shallow Waters <p> Sticking to the same warm-water principle as before , looking for shallower waters is often a smart practice for fall bass fishing . Shallow waters will warm faster , so bass will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , usually spots that are three to five feet deep . <h> Steep Ledges and Drop Offs <p> Bass love the shallow waters in fall , but they also want to be near deeper waters , which can hold available food . Areas that have a shallow spot with a steep ledge nearby will produce some of the best bass fishing in the fall . Use your depth finder to identify steep drop offs , and then use large billed crankbaits to run a lure along the ledge . <h> Speed Up Your Retrieve <p> During the hot days of summer , bass will slow down their activity to conserve energy , so slowing down your retrieve is often a good technique . The fall , however , calls for a faster retrieve . This will give the lure more action , attracting the attention of bass , who have lots of feeding options in the fall .

Crankbaits can be difficult to use in the summer , when weeds get caught on the numerous hooks , but these weeds recede in the fall , opening up the waters for a rattling crankbait . <h> Remember : Bass School in the Fall <p> Most seasons , bass do n't school together , so when you catch one it 's best to move on to a different spot . Throw that piece of wisdom out in the fall . Bass will actually congregate together during the autumn , so when you catch one , continue to hit that spot and you 'll likely catch another , and another , and another ... 50075 @qwx910075 50077 @qwx910077 50078 @qwx910078 50076 @qwx910076

The same goes for fall , when retailers are hoping to unload their fishing tackle to make room for seasonal items like hunting equipment and winter clothing . <h> Be Patient When Buying New Lures <p> It 's been said that lures are not made to attract fish , but to attract anglers . Flashy colors , advanced engineering , and unique designs all have their place , but remember that tackle manufacturers are competing for your attention , and those bright colors and shiny attachments may do more to catch your eye than a bass 's . <h> Back-Fill Your Spools <p> One of the most practical steps you can take to saving money is backfilling your spools with old line . New line is essential for pro-level anglers , but the entire reel does n't have to be filled with top-end braided material .

You could throw them out and buy a new supply , or you could purchase a few materials to refurbish them . <p> A package of new hooks costs about $10 and gives you enough to re-hook plenty of lures . If the hooks are still in decent shape , take some steel wool to remove the rust and sharpen the ends with a file .

These monsters have roamed the ocean since prehistoric times and can live up to 80 years . In fish terms , that 's ancient . Although tarpon have no commercial value and can only be fished catch-and-release , they remain one of the most sought-after sport fish species in the world . To fully appreciate the awe-inspiring charisma of the tarpon , their intense strength and circus-freak acrobatics must be experienced firsthand . If you 're curious about wrestling with the Silver King , read on for a crash-course on tarpon fishing gear , baits , and techniques . <h> Intercepting Tarpon <p> Tarpon are highly migratory . To catch one , you have to be in the right place at the right time . Throughout their long lives , tarpon travel many thousands of miles across their range which extends from the Atlantic Coast of Brazil to Virginia and beyond . Some of the greatest concentrations of tarpon , however , are found in the Gulf of Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their warm water winter homes near Mexico and Central America and head north . After a long journey , they move into bays and passes from Texas to Florida where they feast on local forage " blue crabs are a favorite " in preparation for their annual spawning event . While Tarpon spawn offshore , the time period before they head to sea is when anglers should make their move . If you time it right and come prepared , tarpon can be caught in many inshore waters throughout the Gulf Coast . <h> Tarpon Fishing Gear <p> Although tarpon are capable of reaching over 250 pounds , super heavy tackle is n't needed . Go ahead and leave the Tuna Sticks and boat-winch reels at home . <h> Rod , Reel , and Line <p> A spinning reel in the 5000 to 7000 size paired with a medium-heavy rod is a great all-purpose outfit for tarpon fishing . The reel should be fully sealed to guard against corrosive saltwater and have a strong , smooth drag to quickly tame your quarry . 50-pound test braided line is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty on the spool " 250 to 300 yards . <h> Terminal Tackle for Tarpon <p> At the business end of your line , 60- to 80-pound test fluorocarbon is the leader material of choice . Tarpon do n't have teeth , but their bony jaws are rough like sandpaper " the added abrasion resistance of fluorocarbon will reduce the risk of getting cut off . For unshakable hookups , circle hooks in sizes 6/0 to 10/0 are what you need . Circle hooks tend to stay seated in the corner of a tarpon 's mouth better than standard " J " hooks . Plus , with a circle hook , you 're less likely to gut-hook a tarpon , which is important since they must be released unharmed . <h> Gloves <p> Tarpon are stout fish . Their scales are like armor and their mouths are hard and sharp . If you do n't want to get cut up when handling the fish , bring a good pair of gloves and do n't forget to wear them . <h> Tarpon Fishing Apparel <p> Locales where tarpon are found tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days under the blazing sun and humidity with a capital " H. " The Huk Icon Long Sleeve shirt is one of the best ways to stay protected from the sun and stay cool while fishing for tarpon .

That way your fellow anglers " and the fish " know you mean business . <h> Best Bait and Lures for Tarpon <p> From their larval state to fully mature adults , tarpon are opportunistic feeders . Whatever 's around is what 's on their menu . <h> Live Bait <p> Tarpon do most of their feeding on baitfish " pilchards , pinfish , grunts , mutton minnows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these baitfish species will catch tarpon under the right conditions . The key is to use what the tarpon are naturally eating . <p> When tarpon move into inshore waters along the Gulf Coast , however , they temporarily pass on baitfish in favor of a more abundant fare : blue crabs . The bottom line is , if you want to catch tarpon inshore , do n't leave the marina without plenty of live blue crabs . <h> Artificial Lures for Tarpon <p> If your goal is to simply catch a tarpon , live bait is the way to go . But if you want more of a challenge , artificial lures can be a very rewarding way to catch tarpon . Topwater plugs like the Bomber Badonk-A-Donk are great to fish on days when tarpon are clearly rolling on the surface . They come in a huge range of colors to match the local baitfish and can be fished with a variety of cast-and-retrieve techniques . <p> When tarpon are feeding subsurface either on the bottom or somewhere in the mid-water column , a soft plastic swimbait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Wild Eyed Swim Shad by Storm Lures is a great choice . Swimbaits are very versatile and can be fished free-line , under a cork , or bounced off the bottom . <h> Rigging Live Blue Crabs and Other Baits for Tarpon <p> Most tarpon fishing is accomplished man-to-fish . No complicated trolling spreads or kite setups needed . Keep things simple and you 'll be rewarded . Whether you 're rigging up live blue crabs , live baitfish , or soft plastics on a jighead , the free-line rig is by far the best rig for tarpon . Simply tie a 5- to 8-foot length of 60- to 80-pound fluorocarbon to your main line using a strong barrel swivel , then tie a circle hook to the leader using a non-slip mono loop knot . The loop knot allows the bait to move more freely in the current .

Cruise around until you spot fish rolling . Standing high up on a poling platform with a quality pair of polarized sunglasses is essential . When you find a pod , ease the boat into position down-current of the fish . Cast your bait or lure beyond the pod and slowly work your lure through the fish . Hang on , and be ready for the strike . <h> Drifting for Tarpon <p> When tarpon are feeding subsurface or are concentrated in deep passes , drifting is the ticket .

Carefully position the boat up-current of the fish so it will carry you through the middle of the pod .

Depending on how deep the fish are holding and how fast the current is moving , you may need to add weight to your free-line rig . In moderate to strong currents , the rig can be fished weightless . But if you need to get the bait down quick , an egg weight can be added to the main line above the swivel before tying on the leader , creating a fish-finder rig . <p> With your boat in position and your rigs ready , the drift can commence . Kill the motor and allow the current to carry the boat . Cast your lines out and be ready for a strike .

@@100945754 @5145754/ <h> Responsible Fishing &amp; Boating Techniques <p> April 12 , 2016 <p> Fishing is one of the most rewarding sports in the country , but anglers need to understand that their actions can have a major impact on the water , the surrounding area , and the fishery . By maintaining responsible fishing and boating techniques , you not only keep the sport strong , you protect the quality and availability of fish for future generations . <p> So how can you be a responsible angler your entire life ? It 's actually quite simple and convenient , and most of it comes down to common sense . <p> Respect Private Docks and Shoreline Property : - The docks , beaches , and shoreline areas are often owned by your fellow anglers and boaters . You have a right to fish near the shores and around the docks , but do everything you can to respect their property . Do n't leave lures and line snagged on docks , and do n't damage shorelines in any way . <p> Do n't Fish near Swimming and Beach Areas : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beach areas , as you do n't want to leave sharp lures where kids will be playing . <p> Handle Fish with Care and Release Quickly : - If you 're playing catch-and-release , you need to handle the fish delicately and release them as soon as possible . Do n't keep them out of the water for too long , and make sure to hold them horizontally when taking a picture . Avoid dropping them on the deck and get them back to their watery home so they can be enjoyed by other anglers . <p> Respect All Wildlife : - When you 're on the lake , you 're not just near fish . There are also mammals , birds , crustaceans , and many other wildlife around . While it 's tempting to get in close and view the animals , give wildlife plenty of distance and avoid disturbing their activities . <p> Pick Up Your Trash ! : - It 's sad that we have to say it .

If you see a piece of garbage in the water or on the shore , pick it up and throw it away when you return . You should n't have to do it , but you 'll feel proud that you did your part to protect the water , the fish , and the wildlife . <p> Know the Fishing Regulations : - Conservation officials set specific bag limits and size regulations based on meticulous research .

@@100945759 @5145759/ <h> The Biggest Largemouth Bass Ever Caught <p> Despite the popularity of bass fishing , world record catches are surprisingly infrequent . You 'd think with all the professional tournament anglers and weekend warriors pounding the water , a new record-breaking bass would turn up every few years or so . But that 's not the case . In fact , the official IGFA all-tackle record for biggest largemouth bass ever caught has been held for over 80 years . Only in the last decade has the record been challenged . As with most fish tales , the story behind the world record bass is n't so straightforward . To start unwinding this yarn , allow us to introduce you to a Great Depression-era farmer named George Perry ... <h> Official Largemouth World Record : George Perry 's Undefeated Bass <p> On June 2nd , 1932 , George Perry caught the current world record bass out of Lake Montgomery , an oxbow lake off the Ocmulgee River in southern Georgia . The fish ( the whopper ) weighed 22 pounds , 4 ounces . At that time , world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a sport angler by today 's definition , and pursuing a record was nowhere on his radar . He and a buddy simply went down to the lake to put some meat on the table . After catching and landing the beast with a creek chub fintail shiner lure , they drove home , stopping to weigh the fish at the local post office . The fish fed Mr. Perry 's family of six for two consecutive dinners . <p> Since the IGFA had yet to be formed and no other agencies were keeping official world records for fish at the time , Mr. Perry 's catch almost slipped through the cracks . Luckily , Mr. Perry was told about a big fish contest that Field &amp; Stream magazine was running . He entered the fish , and although he had no photograph to accompany the submission , the measurements and weight of his remarkable fish were enough to win the contest . His prize was an assortment of clothing and a shotgun with some shells . But most importantly , the fish was documented in print " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass ever caught . <p> Two years later , Field &amp; Stream began officially certifying world records . When it came time to fill the largemouth bass record , they entered Mr. Perry 's contest-winning fish . It was the biggest bass they 've ever heard of by a long shot . Coincidentally , Mr. Perry won the same big fish contest again that year with a 13 pound 14-ounce bass . Some people are just born fishy ... <p> Technically , Mr. Perry 's bass is still the world record holder . In 2009 , however , a Japanese angler stamped his name in the books alongside Perry 's with a mega-bass of his own . <h> Tied World Record Largemouth Bass : Manabu Kurita 22.5 lb <p> Although some of the best bass fishing tackle hails from Japan " Shimano , Gamakatsu , and Daiwa to name a few " the country is n't usually thought of as a monster bass hotspot . Since largemouth bass are non-native , the Japanese government considers them a nuisance , actively carrying out plans to exterminate the species . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore bass fanatics , including Manabu Kurita , the only man to have ever tied Mr. Perry 's undefeated world record largemouth bass . <p> Kurita caught his record bass in Lake Biwa , and the catch was confirmed as legitimate through a polygraph test . Weighing 22 pounds , 5 ounces , the bass actually surpasses Mr. Perry 's 1932 record bass , but IGFA regulations require that the new record outweighs the current record by more than two ounces . So for official record purposes , the catch is considered a tie . <p> Now the question is , who will step up and establish the new world record largemouth ? <h> Tips for Catching Your Own Record Setting Bass <p> It 's unknown whether or not a largemouth bass can naturally grow beyond the 22-pound mark . But that does n't mean you should stop trying to hook into a record breaker . If you want to move beyond frying pan-sized bass , here are a few tips to help : <h> Change Your Mindset to Target Trophies <p> Catching trophy-class bass is an entirely different game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to catch bass in the 10-pound-plus range , you have to come to terms with the fact that you are n't going to catch very many , if any fish on a regular basis .

Your persistence and discipline will pay off . <h> Up-Size Your Lures <p> The adage " bigger baits catch bigger fish " holds true when chasing the biggest largemouth . These old fish do n't feed all day long like smaller bass do . Instead , they wait for a nice big meal to swim along . They 're looking for the biggest payoff for the least amount of energy exerted . Do n't be afraid to go big . <h> Seek Out Areas with Low Fishing Pressure <p> The biggest bass are survivors . That 's how they 've grown so large . They 've successfully eluded the pressures of larger predators in their early days and have outwitted anglers as they 've grown . Your odds of catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations with the least amount of angling pressure possible . Often times , the best spots will be where other anglers ca n't or wo n't make the effort to reach .

You need the right gear to stay comfortable no matter what the weather 's doing . Springtime is typically best for catching big bass since the spawning ritual makes the fish vulnerable to mistakes .

And just the practice of working together and making it happen is something special . " <p> The Huk crew fished day three of the tournament with no luck , but their tournament fishing career is just getting started .

@@100945763 @5145763/ <h> Water Science : How Oxygen Levels Change Fishing <p> August 05 , 2015 <p> Fish , like humans , need oxygen to survive . Unlike humans , or even aquatic mammals like whales and dolphins , fish do n't pull oxygen from the air . Instead , they get their oxygen from the water they swim in . <p> While oxygen levels in the air can vary ( most notably with altitude ) , the amount we breathe is almost entirely constant . <p> For fish , however , the amount of oxygen adsorbed in the water can go from highs to lows in a few minutes . As an angler , understanding oxygen levels , and how it affects fish behavior , can lead to more success on the water . <h> Gills : Taking Oxygen from the Water <p> First of all , let 's talk about the gills . Everyone knows a fish has gills , but not everyone knows how they work . Designed to have a maximum amount of surface space , the gills have tiny filaments that take the oxygen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are a lot of filaments , providing the fish with enough oxygen to hunt , swim , hide , and strike . <h> More Oxygen Means More Activity- <p> In general , when there is more oxygen dissolved in the water , fish will be much more active . Fish in less-oxygenated water will often be sluggish , conserving their energy for times when it is absolutely needed , like escaping predators . Lower oxygen levels will also lead to slower and less aggressive feeding , as fish are likely to strike only at prey that presents a good chance of being captured , while passing on prey that is quick or protected by structure . <h> How Water Gets Oxygen <p> Water and oxygen interact basically through contact . As water passes through the air , or vice-versa , the water absorbs a small amount of oxygen , creating a better environment for the fish . It 's pretty simple really : when water is moving , there is ( in general ) more oxygen . Therefore , turbid water below dams , areas near tributaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Oxygen Levels Mean to Anglers <p> Some scientist and biologist speculate that oxygen level is the single most important variable to creating a habitable environment for fish . It makes sense ; if there is little oxygen , fewer fish can survive . If you are fishing on a river , the most active spot will often be just below a dam , where water has been freshly oxygenated and species of all types are filling their gills with energy . Choppy waters are usually more oxygenated , at least near the surface , and rain can often inject a large amount of oxygen to a lake or river .

Here 's a comprehensive rainbow trout fly fishing guide including tips and gear to get you casting . <h> Rainbow Trout Fly Fishing Gear <p> If you 're just getting into the sport and are shopping for your first fly fishing outfit , here is a versatile setup that will catch rainbows in 90 percent of the water you fish : <p> Spools of 4X , 5X , and 6X nylon tippet .
