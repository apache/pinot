Once cooked , ingredients that are stored properly ( see our advice on storing leftovers below ) can be refrigerated for up to two days , or frozen long-term . <p> Another simple option is freezing . As long as you have a four-star freezer compartment operating at -18-C or lower , you can freeze most perishable foods " check the packaging for the freezer-safe symbol , or do your research online . At this temperature , foods can be safely frozen indefinitely , but the quality is likely to significantly deteriorate after a few months . You then simply defrost your food in the fridge and consume within 24 hours . <p> Remember : Food that has been defrosted should never be refrozen . <p> There are plenty of other preservation techniques that help expand the lifespan of ingredients , including pickling , dehydrating , canning , curing and fermenting . <p> Disclaimer : This guide is based on food safety and hygiene best practice , but you should always exercise caution when working with food that might have gone off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away anything you are not sure about . Always follow the food producer 's cooking and storage instructions where available . <h> What to do with leftovers <p> If you 've cooked too much food , do n't just scrape leftovers into the bin . Is there enough for tomorrow 's lunch or dinner ? Or could they form part of a future meal ? <p> You can refrigerate leftovers for two days or freeze them long-term , so it 's wasteful to bin anything other than scraps . <p> Whichever option you choose , remember that hot food must be chilled to room temperature or lower first . Putting hot food straight into the fridge or freezer can increase the appliance 's internal temperature and make its contents too warm . <p> In order to minimise bacterial growth , you should aim to cool hot food within 90 minutes . Here are five ways to speed up the cooling process : <p> Store : Decant your food from the hot pan or dish , which will retain its heat , into a storage container . <p> Split : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your food . <p> Spread : Spreading out food creates a larger surface area , which speeds up cooling . <p> Stand : Stand your food container in cold water or ice , or at least leave to stand in a cooler area . <p> Once cooled , it 's important to wrap and/or box your leftovers . This will minimise exposure to harmful bacteria " and help protect the quality of your food . Whatever you use , make sure it is fridge/freezer-safe ( as appropriate ) . <p> To reduce the washing-up load , you can simply wrap the dish the food was cooked in . This is especially convenient if you can reheat in the same container . Make sure to wrap with cling film ready for the microwave , or foil ready for the oven . <p> If you 'll be reheating the leftovers but the original cooking dish is n't suitable for storage , decanting into another cooking container is the most convenient option . Food that will be microwaved can be stored and then reheated in one of our microwave-safe plastic food boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling film . Food that will be reheated in the oven should be stored in an oven-friendly container and covered with foil . Food that will be reheated on the hob can be transferred to a pan and covered with cling film . <p> Remember : You should always reheat food until it is piping hot all the way through . This may take longer than usual if the cooking container has been in the refrigerator or freezer . <p> If the options above are not suitable , or you will be consuming the leftovers cold , you should use one of our airtight food containers . Alternatively , wrap in cling film or foil " just remember that foil can affect the taste of acidic foods such as tomatoes . <p> When refrigerating leftovers , ensure that they are stored above raw foods , to reduce the risk of contamination . Consume within 48 hours " label the container with the use-by date accordingly . <p> If you wish to freeze your leftovers , they must be stored in a four-star freezer or freezer compartment operating at -18-C or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although quality will deteriorate over time .

But where do you start ? - First , you need to decide which decluttering method is right for you . There are two paths you can go down , and the best one for you depends on your personality type , how much time you have to dedicate to the process , and how many things you currently own . Here 's our quick guide to finding the best decluttering method for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most extreme form of decluttering is the everything at once ' method . This simply involves collecting every single one of the possessions in your home together at once and sorting through them in one go . <p> In practice , there are a number of ways you can do this . The first is to literally make a pile of all of your items , but that is n't particularly practical for most people . A more convenient method is to mark a weekend on your calendar where you 'll go through every room in your home one after the other , considering every single item in each and whether or not you still need it in your life . <p> One very effective take on the everything at once ' method can be throwing a packing party ' . This process , which was popularised by Ryan Nicodemus in a blog post on The Minimalists blog , involves packing up everything you own into cardboard boxes as if you were moving home . You then live your life as usual , unpacking items as and when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicodemus gave himself three weeks , although you might be more comfortable with a longer timeframe " you get rid of everything still left in the boxes . The amount of things you end up getting rid of can often be incredibly surprising . <p> Perfect for : <p> Those who prefer to jump in the deep end and hate the idea of the process taking months <p> Those with a relatively manageable amount of stuff ( that will take no longer than a full weekend to go through ) <p> Those who have a whole weekend to dedicate to the process <p> Those who 've decluttered before and want a top up ' <h> The bit by bit ' method <p> The second and more common way of decluttering a home is the bit by bit ' method espoused by Marie Kondo , among others . Rather than tackling every item you own in one go , this involves cutting back on your clutter gradually , often over a period of months . <p> With this method , you pick a manageable space " a drawer , a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bite off more than you can chew , especially if you 're a natural hoarder and decluttering is totally new to you . Breaking your clutter down like this can help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed and giving up . <p> A popular twist on this method is the one item a day ' method . This involves getting rid of a single possession every day for an entire year , leaving you with significantly less stuff twelve months later . Of course , there 's no need to restrict yourself to one item a day , but this rule keeps minimalism at the forefront of your mind and helps prevent you from slipping back into the old habits that result in a cluttered and untidy home in the first place . <p> Perfect for : <p> Those who prefer to take things slow and steady rather than rushing in <p> Those who are n't convinced about the benefits of decluttering <p> Those who do n't have a whole weekend to dedicate to decluttering <p> Those who have an especially large amount of clutter <h> How to declutter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on your journey to home organisation , the act of decluttering is always the same . While you could just walk through your home throwing things out as you go , we would strongly recommend you be a bit more organised about the process . Here 's the best way to declutter your home : <p> Get two boxes : one for items you no longer want that are in good condition ( which you 'll sell or donate ) and one for items you no longer want that are in poor condition ( that you 'll recycle or bin ) . <p> Choose a small area of your home such as a desk drawer or a shelf . Do n't pass over any item , and carefully consider whether or not each one adds value to your life . If not , add it to one of the boxes to be binned or recycled . <p> Rearrange the items you 're going to keep , dispose of the items you 've designated as rubbish , and sell or donate the rest of them at the earliest opportunity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't mean it 's easy . It 's not unusual to get emotionally attached to your possessions , making it hard to get rid of them even if you know you no longer need them . If you 're new to the process , start with an easy ' area " perhaps somewhere that contains a number of items you 've been meaning to get round to disposing of for some time , or somewhere that contains very few items you 're likely to be emotionally attached to , such as a toiletries cabinet or a cleaning cupboard . <h> The rules of decluttering <p> While you can deal with your clutter however you want , here are a few principles you should stick to if you want the process to make as a big an impact on your life as possible : <p> If you have n't used an item for six months and ca n't see yourself using it in the next six months , throw it away or donate it . <p> Ask yourself why you want to declutter . You do n't earn points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define exactly what you want to get out of decluttering , then you 're more likely to stay motivated throughout the process and see it through to the end . <p> Make decluttering a game rather than a chore : see how fast you can fill an entire bin bag full of items to get rid of , or challenge your spouse to a race to be the first one to find 10 items of clothing you 're going to donate to charity . <p> A place for everything and everything in its place : designate a home for your things and you 'll find it much easier to maintain a tidy home . <p> Could you convert this item to a digital format ? For example , think about scanning family photographs onto your computer and getting rid of the originals . Keep this in mind with physical movie and music collections " could you replace these with a subscription to a few streaming services ? <p> Do n't feel pressured or obligated to throw anything away . If you treasure your family photo album and get pleasure every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then do n't feel like you get rid of them to fit some kind of minimalist standard . <h> How to maintain a tidy , clutter-free home <p> Decluttering your home can often take a weight off your shoulders , making your living space a more pleasant place to be and helping you find things when you need them . However , old habits die hard , and if you 've spent a lifetime accumulating clutter and living in an untidy home , you may find clutter beginning to take over your house again after as little as a few weeks . <p> However , there are few easy steps you can take to maintain a clean and tidy home and prevent clutter from building up again . Firstly , if you enjoy living in an uncluttered house , you should take the minimalist mindset with you while you shop , as you 'll defeat the object of decluttering in the first place if you immediately go out and replace the items you 've thrown away with new ones . <p> Everyone has their own sweet spot ' when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to deprive yourself of items you really want in the name of home organisation .

Use the process of decluttering as a chance to consider if you 're making the best use of your available space , and think about clever storage solutions when you 're finding a new home for your possessions . This way , you 'll not only be cutting down on the amount of things you have to store , but also be storing them in a more efficient way , saving you even more space . <p> Here are some clever storage solutions to help you make the most of every room in the house and make it as easy as possible to keep your living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Living room storage ideas <p> The living room offers ample storage opportunities that few people fully utilise .

A coffee table is another great extra storage solution , especially if you get a unit with pull-out drawers or space for baskets . Purchasing the largest TV unit your living room will accommodate is another great way to get more storage out of the space , especially if you choose one with drawer space to keep your items hidden . <p> Lastly , if there is a gap underneath your sofas , consider utilising it with some underbed storage boxes . Of course , your living room needs to be stylish first and foremost , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen until it 's pulled out from underneath the chair .

Jewellery storage boxes are also great for keeping dressing tables tidy , and preventing items from getting lost or damaged . <h> Kitchen storage ideas <p> For many people , the kitchen can be the hardest room to declutter due to many kitchen appliances being big and bulky .

@@7478204 @678204/ @qwx92574 <h> BPA plastic : hazard or hysteria ? <p> While shopping for plastic products , you may have come across a few items that are described as being BPA-free ' . If you 're wondering what this means , or if you should be worried about BPA , you 've come to the right place . <p> In this guide , we will look at what BPA actually is , why so many people are concerned about it , and what plastic producers are doing to increase public confidence in their products . Read on to find out more . <h> What is BPA ? <p> Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of plastics . It is used primarily because it lends the material strength and toughness , as well as making it near shatter-proof . One of the main types of plastic it is used in is polycarbonate , which is robust , possesses great optical clarity , is very lightweight , and has high heat and electric resistance . Because of these qualities , polycarbonate is used in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs and DVDs . <p> BPA was first discovered in 1891 by Russian chemist Aleksandr Dianin , and has grown to be one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world . According to a University of Missouri- review- in 2012 , 2011 saw the production of over 4.5 million tonnes of BPA plastic for polycarbonate globally , which just goes to show how widely the chemical is used in plastic products across a range of industries . <p> Due to its presence in so many products which we come into regular contact with , the chemical is passed into our bodies , most often from food and drink we consume that are stored in containers made with BPA . In fact , the Centre for Disease Control found that 93% of people it tested in- a survey- had the substance present in their system , indicating how commonplace it is . <h> Should I be worried about BPA ? <p> BPA has undergone many tests in its 120 years of existence , with a variety of conclusions drawn about its effect on the health of humans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it can act as a synthetic oestrogen , the female reproductive hormone . There are theories that suggest BPA can trick the body and cause an imbalance in our systems . This has caused some studies to link the substance with a number of health risks , particularly for pregnant women and infants . <p> At the time of writing , the consensus seems to be that , at the current levels of BPA found in humans , no harmful effect is evident . This is a stance adopted by the European Food Standards Agency ( EFSA ) in their latest review of the subject . They also indicate that current levels of the chemical found in our systems is considerably below the tolerable daily intake that they have set as part of their safety standards . <h> Where did the concern around BPA come from ? <p> Recent concerns were raised in early 2008 , when it was found that every infant formula manufacturer used BPA in the containers of their products , which resulted in the US launching a Congressional investigation into this use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers admitted that they did not know what level of BPA was in their formula , and others were found to have carried out inadequate tests. - <p> Because of the huge concern for the welfare of infants that the story raised and the uncertainty over the effects of BPA in infants , many manufacturers of plastic products for children began switching to a BPA-free production process to help allay the fears of the public . <h> What are BPA-free products ? <p> BPA-free products have been manufactured in a way that completely removes BPA from the production process , replacing the chemical with alternatives not associated with any of the health risks . Purchasing these , instead of those that are made with BPA , is a great way of minimising exposure to the chemical for those who are concerned about its effects . Many manufacturers now offer many products in BPA-free plastic , including water bottles , baby cups , and plastic food containers . <h> How can I tell if a product is BPA-free ? <p> There are a few ways that you can be sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first place you should check is the manufacturer description , which will often state whether the product is BPA-free . You can also check for a BPA-free sticker or label on the product or packaging . <p> The most reliable way to check whether an item is BPA-free is to consult the plastic identification code number " usually stamped on the bottom of the container . There are seven categories , where numbers 1 to 6 are free of BPA . This means that only those printed with the number 7 will contain the chemical . The numbers are also accompanied by a sequence of letters which give more detail about the plastic . The two most common and safest BPA-free plastics are those that fall under categories 2 and 5 . <p> The categories are set out to the right . <p> Number <p> Code letter(s) <p> Name of plastic or resin <p> Examples of use <p> 1 <p> PETE / PET <p> Polyethylene terephthalate <p> Soft drinks bottles <p> 2 <p> HDPE <p> High-density polyethylene <p> Some reusable plastic food storage containers <p> 3 <p> V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit cards <p> 4 <p> LDPE <p> Low-density polyethylene <p> Plastic shopping bags <p> 5 <p> PP <p> Polypropylene <p> Some reusable plastic food storage containers <p> 6 <p> PS <p> Polystyrene <p> Foam drinking cups <p> 7 <p> OTHER <p> Other substances ( may include BPA ) <p> Any item not made of the above materials <h> Do I need to buy BPA-free products ? <p> There is no hard evidence to suggest that normal exposure to BPA is harmful. - <p> However , if you are concerned about the potential effects of the chemical , BPA-free products allow you to use everyday items with limited exposure . There are plenty of great alternatives available , which means you can continue benefiting from the plastic products that make your life easier . <h> Are there any other ways of minimising exposure to BPA ? <p> Due to the wide use of BPA in so many everyday products , it is virtually impossible to eliminate exposure to the chemical entirely . Nevertheless , there are a few steps you can take to minimise the amount you come into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great start , but let 's take a look at some of the others : <p> Avoid canned food : The linings in the cans used to package canned goods are often manufactured with BPA , which can be - - passed onto the food and into your system when eaten . Instead , eat non-canned varieties or fresh where possible . <p> Avoid microwaveable meals : The plastic used in the packaging of microwave meals can often contain BPA , which is passed on to the food . <p> Avoid microwaving polycarbonate food containers : When you microwave a polycarbonate container , the material can break down and release BPA chemicals into its contents . Look out for the number 7 plastic identification code on the bottom and avoid microwaving any that are imprinted with it . <p> Buy wooden gifts for children : Instead of plastic toys that could potentially contain BPA , consider more traditional wooden toys as gifts .
