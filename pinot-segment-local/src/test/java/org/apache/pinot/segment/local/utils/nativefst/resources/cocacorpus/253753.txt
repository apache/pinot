During the initial construction stages of this project a Rimkus professional served as a civil construction management engineer for Sandia Labs , overseeing the upgrading and expansion of laboratory utility systems to support the new complex of high technology buildings. more The Rimkus professional assisted Sandia Labs in managing the contract with the utility contractor from both the technical and financial aspects . In particular the Rimkus construction management engineer responsibilities included reviewing construction drawings for quality and constructability , developing process controls for all construction phases and overseeing quality control function by interfacing with Quality Control inspectors and resolving problems . <p> The U.S. Coast Guard became involved in a multi-year dispute with a contractor over construction deficiencies in a maintenance shop building . The litigation , handled by the U.S. Department of Justice Commercial Litigation Office , was over the contractors failure to remove and replace defective building materials. more A Rimkus architectural engineer was retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts deposition , prepare an expert report , and provide expert testimony at trial . The trial concluded favorably for the U.S. Coast Guard , due in part to the technical expertise of the Rimkus professional . <p> The design brief for the Byron Rogers Federal Office Building and Courthouse in Denver , Colorado included the ambitious goal of making it the most energy efficient building in GSAs portfolio of existing buildings . As a member of the design-build team , Rimkus architects and engineers provided consultation and design review for the proposed modifications to the building envelope . This work involved upgrading the opaque portions of the envelopewhich needed to remain in place due to the buildings historic natureas well as improving the thermal performance of the existing windows . Rimkus personnel conducted sophisticated hygrothermal modeling to analyze the performance of the envelope design . The objectives were to mitigate potential problems associated with vapor migration through the precast concrete wall panels , as well as to avoid condensation on the glass of the improved windows . The roof design was also evaluated for compliance with codes and GSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was found to be in conflict with construction documents and then made recommendations for a resolution . <p> A crude oil and petroleum products pipeline company was experiencing an unusually high frequency of hydrocarbon releases into streams , rivers and coastal bays from pipeline and tankage leaks . The United States Department of Justice , Environmental and Natural Resources Division , representing the US Environmental Enforcement Agency sued the pipeline company for 194 violations of the Clean Water Act. more Rimkus pipeline operations and environmental experts were retained assess the causation of the leaks ( corrosion , third party accidents , human errors , etc. ) and determine if the pipeline companys maintenance procedures , repair practices , corrosion prevention program , and spill prevention and detection program were in compliance with established standards . Rimkus also assisted in determining the avoided cost of compliance associated with the environmental releases to calculate the allowable , multimillion dollar fine under federal regulations that was levied against the pipeline company . <p> A sugar refinery wastewater treatment plant under construction suffered an explosion during the construction of two aeration tanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wastewater was being pumped into the operating tank . A second explosion a few seconds later caused major damage to the first aeration tank , then in operation , while the second was still under construction . Rimkus was retained to determine the cause of the explosion. more The city had required the construction of the wastewater treatment facility to treat the stream prior to its delivery into the sanitary sewer system because the make-up of the stream was overwhelming the citys facilities . The plan called for two tanks with aerators to treat the wastewater . The wastewater first flowed into a sump from which a submersible pump pumped it into the top of the tank . From the tank , the now treated wastewater would exit through a standpipe and flow to the sewer . The sump also had a bypass line through which the wastewater could flow directly into the sewer in an emergency situation ( such as a pump failure ) . Within the first 30 minutes following our arrival at the site , we had determined the cause of the first explosion and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion . We determined that ( 1 ) the submersible pump , originally explosion-proof , was no longer such ; ( 2 ) the piping from the tank standpipe connected with the sump overflow pipe below ground at some point prior to reaching the sewer ; and ( 3 ) the initial sump explosion caused a flame front that traveled down the bypass line , back up the outlet pipe to the standpipe , and into the top of the operating tankwhich was full of explosive gasses from the breakdown of the sugars in the wastewater . Subsequent tear-down of the sump pump , along with review of the underground piping plan for the treating plant under construction , proved out our theories . <p> A backhoe working in a pipeline right-of-way struck and damaged a natural gas liquids pipeline carrying product from the Texas Panhandle to the Houston area . Fortunately , there was no explosion and no injuries . However , the ensuing fire , visible from as much as 50 miles distant , caused significant damage to the pipeline that was struck , damaged two other pipelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly caused lost revenue for a nearby producing well . Rimkus was retained to evaluate the losses claimed by the various parties. more The third-party claimants assertions were relatively straightforward . We addressed each , pointed out errors and improper charges , and our client was able to address and resolve them without issue . However , the owner of the pipeline that was struck presented a complex claim for lost revenues , lost product consumed in the fire , lost profit opportunity , and even a component for pain and suffering . The total claim was in excess of $2 million . Rimkus experts were able to address all aspects of the claimed loss . We found instances of overstatement of the product that was lost , duplication of lost revenues ( losses appearing in both the lost pipeline throughput revenue and the downstream mark-up of the price for the product being carried ) as well as the inclusion of cost for items such as salaried company personnel time which was not an extra expense . Participating in settlement discussions with attorneys for both sides , we were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimant . As a result , the damage claim was settled amicably between the parties for less than 50% of the original demand . <p> An international engineering firm was involved in a dispute with an international construction company on a refinery expansion project in a Pacific Rim country . The project had run far behind schedule and was significantly over budget . At stake in the dispute were tens of millions of dollars . Rimkus was retained by the engineering firm to assist in preparations for an arbitration hearing. more We were asked to offer opinions on whether the construction company had planned and scheduled the project properly to address some of the key issues . One key finding was that the contractor failed to adequately plan for and then failed to properly execute construction of the modular design for the project . This resulted in extensive delays . At one point , they were falling behind 2+ more days each week . Further , the contractor elected to do extensive pre-construction off-site and then move these huge components through the town to the refinery site . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbitration on short notice , Rimkus brought to bear over 30 consultants , each working on a small portion of the project , who in total spent nearly 10,500 man-hours in the short seven months that were available . Their individual work products were accumulated into the major segments of the arbitration . We then produced a combined animation and live video presentation for the arbitrators and to support the Rimkus testifying experts . <p> An office building in the Rio Piedras district of San Juan , Puerto Rico experienced a massive gas-fueled explosion that completely blew out the lower floors of this six-story building . More than 30 people were killed in the explosion . Another 80 , both inside and outside the building , were injured . Rimkus was retained by the local water utility , one of the potentially responsible parties , to determine the cause of the explosion and the source of the gas build-up that led to it. more A number of parties were listed as having potential responsibility for causing the explosion , including the local gas distribution utility and the sewer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . Because of the extent of the damage , the litigants were in disagreement even as to the floor on which the explosion originated . Some claimed that lighter-than-air sewer gas exploded on an upper floor , while others claimed that heavier than air propane exploded in the basement . Our examination determined that it indeed originated in the basement , used for merchandise storage by a first floor shoe store . Our finding was supported by evidence including the imprint of a boot sole on the underside of a surviving concrete beam , indicating that the contents of the basement were blown upward by the explosion . We also found that the local gas utility had experienced dozens of pipeline leaks in the area . Given an extended period of drought that had been ongoing in San Juan area , we determinedand later testified in depositionthat shrinkage of the earth surrounding buried pipelines left an annular space around the pipe through which the leaking gas flowed , entered the basement , and reached explosive limits .

Discovered in 1998 , BP operates the Mad Dog facility ( 60.5% ) with co-owners BHP Billiton ( 23.9% ) and Chevron ( 15.6% ) . Field production began in 2005 from a floating truss spar facility that is designed to process up to 80,000 bpd , with current oil in place estimates at greater than 4 billion barrels . As a result of numerous challenges encountered throughout field development , the Mad Dog field has been a rich source of learnings leading to advances in resource optimization , technology breakthroughs , as well as , important cost efficiencies . The appraisal process unveiled a complex subsurface story which was eventually overcome with technology advances in seismic data acquisition and processing , resulting in numerous resource adjustments throughout life to date . Mad Dog has served as a subsurface laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; LoSalG EOR during the next phase of development will unlock even greater potential than initially imagined . In 2008 , Hurricane Ike interrupted field development drilling when heavy winds toppled the drilling derrick to the seabed floor , and the subsequent rig replacement in 2012 resulted in the heaviest lift ever in the Gulf of Mexico . In 2013 , Mad Dog embarked on a recycle of the Phase 2 development concept which is now nearing completion .

They are used for lubricant retention and contaminant exclusion in oilfield equipment , and in severe service applications in other industries . <h> - Press Releases <p> In order to help our oilfield customers meet the rotary testing requirements of API 16 RCD , Kalsi Engineering has invested in a rotary seal fixture that performs high pressure testing of our latest-generation RCD seals and associated technology . This new fixture tests a pair of 10.50 " ( 266.7mm ) rotary seals simultaneously , and is rated for pressures up to 3,500 psi ( 24.13 MPa ) and is capable of speeds up to 190 rpm . It is equipped with instruments that safely allow for 24 hour-a-day unmanned operation . The fixture was designed for ease of assembly , and is readily adaptable to any desired seal-to-housing extrusion gap clearance . It can be used with either conventional non-floating seal carriers , or our latest and most advanced laterally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the key benefits of the fixture is better fidelity to the thermal mass of an actual RCD , compared to our smaller general purpose seal test fixtures . <p> We recently achieved a testing milestone that demonstrated the inherent high pressure capability of our plastic lined , hydrodynamically lubricated 682-series seals . The seals were tested at 2,300 psi ( 15.86 MPa ) and 100 rpm with a relatively large 0.020 " ( 0.51mm ) radial extrusion gap clearance and a non-floating carrier . The lower seal was exposed to modest fluid circulation , simulating an RCD with circulating bearing lubricant . The upper seal was isolated from fluid circulation , simulating an uncooled RCD . The test was terminated at 182 hours when a rise in running torque was detected . The lower seal was unworn at the conclusion of the test , and the upper seal had but slight wear . <p> The fixture has also allowed us to explore the performance characteristics of elastomeric hydrodynamic rotary seals when used with our innovative floating backup ring . This arrangement provides the smallest possible extrusion gap clearance without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withstand high pressure for long periods of time . The new fixture has also allowed us to design enhancements that make large diameter backup rings more immune to differential pressure-related distortion , and more tolerant of marginal lubrication . <p> Our investment in this fixture is allowing us to continue to expand and document the performance envelope of large diameter high pressure shaft seals . In addition to increasing the speed and pressure capability of RCDs , the exciting results of our research and development program are also applicable to other high pressure rotary equipment , such as hydraulic swivels and cementing heads . For additional information , visit http : //www.kalsi.com or call 281-240-6500. <h> - Products <p> Sealed bearing mud motors have several rotary seal locations , and all are critical to reliability . A rotary seal in an axially floating pressure compensation piston is used to balance the lubricant pressure to the drillstring bore pressure . A rotary seal in a fixed location is used to withstand the high pressure differential between the lubricant and the well annulus pressure . A rotary seal in an axially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling fluid . For more information , visit : <p> Enhanced lubrication seals were developed to lubricate efficiently with low viscosity lubricants , to reduce seal running torque ( i.e. seal drag ) , seal generated heat , and wear in the high differential pressure conditions encountered in applications such as high pressure hydraulic swivels . <p> Enhanced Lubrication Seals are available in single durometer , dual durometer , and plastic lined configurations . In the dual durometer and plastic lined configurations , the inner part of the seal has a higher modulus than the outer part of the seal , for improved high pressure extrusion resistance . The dual durometer and plastic lined configurations further reduce breakout and running torque , and seal generated heat , while augmenting extrusion resistance . <p> Plastic lined Kalsi Seals have a plastic layer at the dynamic interface , and an elastomer energizing section forming the seal body . Radial compression of the elastomer loads the dynamic lip against the shaft . This seal is directed at increasing high pressure sealing capacity and reducing breakout torque . As with other Kalsi-brand rotary seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minimize the wear of the dynamic sealing surfaces . The significant level of hydrodynamic efficiency that is required to lubricate a plastic seal in high differential pressure conditions is achieved by advanced geometries developed and patented by Kalsi Engineering . <p> The use of a plastic liner places a material at the extrusion gap that has a higher modulus of elasticity , compared to elastomers . This increase in modulus promotes high pressure extrusion resistance . The use of a plastic liner also places a material at the shaft that has a lower coefficient of friction than the elastomer that contacts the seal groove . This reduces breakout torque , compared to Kalsi Seals composed entirely of elastomer , and helps to ensure that the seal does not slip within the seal groove .
