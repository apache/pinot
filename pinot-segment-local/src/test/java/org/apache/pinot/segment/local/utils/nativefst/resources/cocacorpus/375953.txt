@@45517998 @5517998/ <h> How to have Strong WiFi Signal in every Room of your House <p> Are you having problems picking up a string Wi-Fi signal throughout your house ? We all suffer from this , no matter how strong a router we buy , its signal can only travel so far . Most of us have more than one computer or device that needs to pick up a signal and we do n't all sit huddled around the router in one room . Even one of the strongest routers on the market , the Netgear Nighthawk R7000 , ca n't give you a full signal throughout the whole house . Luckily , there is a very cheap and effective solution that will boost your signal significantly . <p> Image : No WiFi Signal in your House with Thick Walls <p> There are two small adaptors that you need . The first one is a Tenda P200 , a 200 mbps Powerline mini adaptor , available on Amazon.com link for less than $50 . All you do is plug the adaptor into a power socket next to your router , attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your router. - That 's the first part . <p> Image : Tenda P200 <p> Now , to get that signal boosted around the entire house , the next step is to purchase a Tenda PW201 300 mbps wireless Powerline communication adaptor- link . You will need to buy one for each room that you want a strong signal in and , again , you can get them from Amazon for less than $35 each . Simply plug one into a power socket in each room that you want a good signal in and they will pick up the electrical signal from the mini adaptor attached to your router . You should now have a really strong Wi-Fi signal in every room of your house . Note that this is not a wireless repeater and does not affect the wifi speed in any way . If you want wired internet in that room , simply buy a Tenda P200 instead of a PW201A . All the devices under the same electric meter gets your signal . Things to remember This need to be plugged directly to the wall socket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  work that way because the powerline signals are stripped off by these devices . <p> Image : Tenda PW201 <p> Video : Unboxing the Tenda PW201 <h> How to Setup : <p> The below image shows how you can set up the following devices in the given configuration in your house . You need to connect the P200 which has now wireless capability with the main wireless router having internet in it already , and add a subsequent Pw201a in each room with weak wifi signal . <p> We always assume that buying bigger and better routers is the answer to a weak signal but these are not cheap , especially if you want a really good one . The above solution will cost you less than $100 and will provide you with strong Wi-Fi wherever you want it . If you connect your iPhone or iPad to your Wi-Fi router but are finding that you ca n't pick up a signal very well , you could always try switching to one of these routers , ideal for mobile devices :

@@45518036 @5518036/ <h> How to Stop iPhone Charging Cable from Breaking Fraying <p> The reason which differentiates Apple from other companies and takes it to a totally another level is the dedication of the company with which it brings new innovations in its products , which themselves are carved out of the best available materials with top-notch designing and engineering techniques . This dedication does not only help Apple find new ways to improve their products , but also helps them invent new materials to stay ahead of the game and in the hearts of its fans . However , even the moon has spots , and so does Apple have some drawbacks in its quality , which are mainly evident in the Lightning cables provided by Apple . <p> Image : Stop iPhone cable Fraying <p> Apple used to ship older devices like the iPhone 4S with the 30-pin cables , but then it introduced the Lightning cable and promised to bump the durability by many folds. - But users who use the Lightning cable a lot for charging or syncing data know already that it is n't as durable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users have been seen complaining about the ends of the cable getting frayed quickly by just using it generally . <p> The damage to the Lightning cable is mainly caused by manipulating or twisting it in ways for which it was not designed , which makes sense of course . Most of the users have also been known to carelessly pull out the cable hard from the socket or grab the cable by its sheath instead of grabbing the hard plastic connection . So if you do the same , then you should know that the cable will get damaged soon . <h> Want to Prevent that ? Follow these simple steps- : <p> Method 1 : DIY <p> Get two click pens/retractable pens , those which have springs inside them . Mostly , the springs are of the same size in all the pens . <p> Open the pens , remove the springs , and keep the pens aside .

This will make it much more visible and probably far more likely to be used . <p> Game Center App to Disappear <p> The Game Center app on iOS will disappear with iOS 8 . Instead , the same functionality provided by the center will be integrated in the Games that have Game Center support . <p> Improvements to Notification Center <p> At the moment , there are 3 tabs in the Notification Center " Today , Missed and All .

@@45518238 @5518238/ <h> What is Jailbreaking ? <p> Jailbreaking is the process of accessing the root system of an iOS device . Effectively , by using a piece of specially built software , you are breaking your way out of the security prison that Apple locks you in. - The California-based Company are somewhat strict on what they will let you do with your iOS device , thus the need for jailbreaking . Once the software has been applied , exploits are used to gain access deep inside the iOS , thus allowing for modification and customization of your device , way beyond what Apple wants you to do . <h> What is Cydia : <p> Cydia is the jailbreak version of the iOS App store . It can only be installed on your device when you jailbreak . Cydia was developed shortly after the iPhone 2G was released in 2007 and was actually the first app store ; Apple did not open theirs until later on. - Cydia was the project of a developer named Saurik , otherwise known as Jay Freeman , and it was developed to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apps , tweaks , themes and modifications , covering just about everything you could think of relating to your iOS device. - Cydia was named after the Cydia Pomonella , or the Codling Moth .

First and foremost , it is a completely legal process , giving you the satisfaction of being able to modify your device , against Apples wishes , but within the law. - Secondly , jailbreaking gives you thousands of different ways to modify and customise your iOS device . You can change the look by installing themes , icon packages , and icon masks . You can change the way your device functions by downloading and installing any number of tweaks and modifications including old favorites like SBSettings , Activator and Auxo. iPhone 5s users can do more with the Touch I 'd fingerprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed in Cydia in recent weeks . Really and truthfully , there is n't a great deal you cant do with a jailbroken iOS device . <p> Image : iOS 8 Jailbreak Apps <h> What are the Disadvantages ? <p> There are n't  any real disadvantages to jailbreaking . As we said before , it is a perfectly legal process. - Once you have jailbroken your device though , you can not update to new firmwares without losing the jailbreak so you do have to wait until the developers give you go ahead or stay on a lower firmware than other people. - The other disadvantage is that , despite being ruled legal , Apple still do not want you to jailbreak . Therefore , they class it as a violation of the EULA and threaten to void the warranty of anyone who is caught jailbreaking . That said , if you do need to take your device back to the store , a simple factory restore will remove all traces of the jailbreak and apple need never know about it . <h> Can Jailbreaking Brick My iPhone , iPod or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early days of jailbreaking there was always the possibility of this happening . these days , the developers are working with a lot more knowledge and much better software and hardware .

Its not because apple so called " hated jailbreakers " but they see it as a way to maliciously go into the OS and allow access to forbidden parts of the operating system and if something goes wrong then people will goto them , which is a reason why it voids the warranty . As i was saying , its not targeted to just jailbreakers but to people that will use the jailbreak to maliciously gain access to the device ( I.E. that one bug from a while ago that rick rolls people by gaining access via SSH with the default passcode " alpine " ) , these exploits are patched due to apple not being directed in case something maliciously or illegal .
