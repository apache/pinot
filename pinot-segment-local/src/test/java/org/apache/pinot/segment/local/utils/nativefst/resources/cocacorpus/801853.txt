
 Elizabeth Butler , the great feminist campaigner of North View , Wimbledon Common <p> For three years from 1890 , one of Britain 's most famous campaigners for women 's social reform lived opposite Wimbledon Common at No 8 North View . <p> While there , Josephine Elizabeth Butler ( 1828-1906 ) , whose 185th birthday falls tomorrow , wrote one of her books , Recollections of George Butler . <p> It was about her late husband and supporter over 38 years . She had cared for him at their home in Winchester until his death on 14 March 1890 and moved to Wimbledon afterwards . <p> Known for her promotion of women 's education , she was particularly famous as a campaigner for the welfare of prostitutes . Five years before coming to Wimbledon she had joined another local resident , William T Stead of Wimbledon Park Road , editor of the Pall Mall Gazette , in helping to expose child prostitution or the " white slave trade " ( see Heritage story 6 January 2012 ) . <p> That had led to the raising of the age of consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spreading the word overseas , travelling on the continent to support similar campaigns there . <p> But her campaigning career dated back long before that . She had been born into a strongly reformist family . <p> Her father , John Grey , a cousin of the Liberal Prime Minister Lord Grey , had actively supported the abolition of slavery , emancipation of Catholics , and the great Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 . <h> Promoted stories <p> When Josephine married George Butler , a tutor at Oxford , in 1852 , they came to share a lifelong commitment to social reform and Christian values . They lived first in Oxford , then Cheltenham College where George became vice-principal . <p> There in 1863 the youngest of their four children , their daughter Eva , was killed by falling from the top of stairs , aged six . <p> The tragedy depressed Josephine and she sought personal solace by ministering to the sufferings of others . <p> In 1866 George became headmaster of Liverpool College and when the family moved there , Josephine ignored advice by visiting the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyles but attacking the double standards of society . <p> In a contrasting feminist cause she also joined the women 's suffragist Anne Clough in helping to form the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women . <p> In 1869 , Josephine led a national campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts . These were a blatant example of the bias against women that existed in those days . <p> They had recently been passed in an effort to control the spread of venereal diseases in the Armed Forces by regulating prostitution . <p> The men were simply regarded as victims while the Acts allowed forcible medical examinations and detentions of prostitutes for treatment . <p> In that year , it was proposed that the Acts be extended from the garrison towns and naval ports where they were first implemented , to the entire country . <p> This aroused strong opposition from civil liberties supporters of both sexes . Josephine concentrated all of her energies on opposing the move , suffering vilification and even physical assault in a campaign that would continue for the next 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control his wife as Victorian husbands were expected to do . He stood by her , regardless . Finally in 1886 , the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed . <p> Four years earlier , George had retired from Liverpool College and taken up the canonry at Winchester Cathedral . In their new city , Josephine opened a refuge for women in need of care and shelter . <p> Always outspoken , she managed to offend both conservative Anglicans by her reformist views and secularists by her strong faith . <p> She dedicated several years to nursing George after he was taken sick . Then moving to Wimbledon , she wrote her book about him which was published in 1892 . But she suffered from poor health and loneliness . After three years in Wimbledon she left the house at North View to return to her native Northumberland where she lived with her eldest son George on his estate at Galewood . <p> This was followed by another work , Personal Reminiscences of a Great Crusade which appeared in 1896 . When the old cause resurfaced in 1897 with new Contagious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she campaigned once again . In 1898 she published a Life of St Catherine of Siena and in her last years became a passive supporter of the National Union of Suffrage Societies , aiming to secure votes for women . <p> Josephine Butler died age 78 on 30 December 1906 and was buried nearby at the little church in Kirknewton . <p> The Wimbledon Society is working with the Wimbledon Guardian to ensure that you , the readers , can share the fascinating discoveries that continue to turn off my ad-blocker ? <h> Queen Beatrix and 
 's super cemetery uncovered <p> IN a leafy corner of Aldersbrook lie the remains of Bobby Moore , Dame Anna Neagle and two of Jack the Ripper 's victims . <p> They are just some of the thousands of people who have been laid to rest in the 200 acre City of London Cemetery , the largest municipal cemetery in the country . <p> The cemetery was built in 1853 at a time when London 's churchyards were in crisis . <p> A population explosion coupled with an increase in cholera-related deaths saw bodies piling up at an alarming rate and , with the situation reaching crisis point , the City of London Corporation moved to build a new super cemetery . <p> The man charged with finding a site for the new burial ground was Sir William Haywood , an accomplished surveyor who had already played a leading role in the building of the capital 's sewage system . <p> He identified the site in Aldersbrook , the Corporation purchased the land , and the construction of the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium began . <p> Current Superintendant Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " If you were choosing a site or designing a cemetery today you would be hard pressed to find a better site or landscape .

" <p> While former England football captain Bobby Moore is arguably the most famous person associated with the cemetery , there are plenty of other fascinating stories to be told about the people who are laid to rest there . <p> Mr Burks conducts tours of the cemetery in the summer months and is a mine of information on the people buried there . <p> He said : " One of the most interesting stories involving the people buried here is that of Percy Thompson . <p> " He was murdered in Wanstead during the 1920s by a man called Frederick Bywaters while returning home from a night out with his wife Edith . <p> " When it emerged that Edith and Frederick had been having an affair there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder .

 book recalls East End origins of many of estate 's residents <p> THE East End origins of many of the families who make up the backbone of Debden have been explored in a new book by one of its residents . <p> In his book A 1960s East End Childhood , Simon Webb , 58 , of Newmans Lane , remembers the run-down terraces and streets littered with bomb sites which many families left for the newly-built council estate on the edge of Loughton . <p> " I grew up in Custom House and we moved to Bethnal Green , " he said . " It was fairly primitive , because we did n't have an inside lavatory or a bathroom and all the water had to be heated up with coal . <p> " You had to build a fire if you wanted hot water and we had a tin bath in front of the fire . I have two siblings and I 'm the youngest , so I got the water last , when it was dirty and cold . <p> " There were bomb sites all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The ground had been cleared , but there were still broken bricks , plaster and nails and all sorts lying around . " <p> The Debden estate was built from 1945 onwards by the London County Council , to house Londoners who had been bombed out or were living in sub-standard housing . <p> The Council used prisoners of war from a nearby camp at Lippitts Hill , west of Loughton , to build some of the roads , including Rectory Lane , and some of the homes . <p> Houses and roads were still being built as people moved in and The Broadway was only finished in 1958 . <p> " Gradually , a lot of people drifted out from the East End , " said Mr Webb . " It was a great movement . <p> " It happened all the time . First , my uncle moved to Hornchurch , then my Grandma moved to Romford . <p> " I have relatives who moved to Debden when the houses were first built in the 1940s . " <h> Promoted stories <p> He said that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their old tight-knit neighbourhoods , which had been broken up . <p> " People would be offered a house and move , but there was a lot of travelling to and from east London , because people would go back to visit , " he added . <p> " The community spirit was strong in the East End , but once people moved to other places , it broke up . <p> " In the East End , a lot more people would have relatives living around the corner or in the next street . <p> " I would n't say Debden seemed like a real community , because it was full of people from all over London . <p> " There were a lot of people from the Kings Cross area there as well .

 the history of Walthamstow Windmill <p> JUST over 200 years ago , in a clearing of Epping Forest , the Walthamstow Windmill stood proud for all around to see . <p> Surrounded by corn fields , it stood on a high point of the forest ridge , at about above sea level and was strategically placed so residents of the surrounding area could access it . <p> Access was vital so residents could grind their produce to make flour for bread a staple part of their diet and the miller would take a percentage . <p> Windmills were prevalent in the eastern counties throughout the 17th and 18th centuries because the area was the main corn-growing region in Britain . <p> A map of Essex dated 1777 shows 187 windmills , including the Walthamstow Windmill . <p> But the number rapidly declined towards the end of the 19th Century , mainly because the importation of vast quantities of corn from the American prairies drove the development of steam-driven roller mills at British ports . <p> The Walthamstow Windmill was founded in 1676 , when the lord of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building lease to John Hawkes , millwright of Whitechapel , with the agreement of his tenants . <p> The lease was for half an acre of land at Tile Kiln Hill and John Hawkes was to build a cottage and a windmill . <h> Promoted stories <p> Although there is very little surviving evidence about the mill , the Walthamstow Parish Registers record the burial of a ' John Grimston , Miller ' in 1684 and the burial of the ' Old Miller ' two years later . <p> Other historical records show one of the windmill 's later occupants , John Hanes , was brought before the Walthamstow Toni Manor courts in 1745 , 1746 and 1747 for brewing beer without a licence . <p> The last available reference to anyone running the mill is in 1800 , although it was depicted on the first Ordanance Survey map of the area in 1805 . <p> It is thought the mill stopped producing flour at this time because local people would have used the water mills of the River Lea to the north and south of Walthamstow . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its most famous occupant was noted botanist and philanthropist Edward Forster junior , who lived at the cottage between 1826 and 1838 . <p> Walthamstow Windmill was of a post mill design , which meant the body of the mill turned on a central post so the sails could be turned to face the direction of the wind . <p> Share article <p> Several examples of post mills still survive today in Essex and can be visited between April and September , including Roding , Finchingfield and Mountnessing , which are all owned by Essex County Council . <p> For more information on the mills and turn off my ad-blocker ? <h> Prime Minister Vladimir

 to look at council newspaper nonsense <p> Greenwich Council newspaper Greenwich Time 's report of the authority 's debate on whether or not to allow Olympic equestrian events to be held at Greenwich Park was very different to our story on the same debate . <p> In this special report we ask why two articles about the same event could be so different and we try to ask some of the councillors present which report was the most accurate . <p> WOOLWICH Town Hall staged a heated meeting on March 23 . Tempers flared , voices were raised and a petition bearing 13,500 signatures was handed in objecting to the planned use of Greenwich Park for equestrian events during the Olympic Games in 2012 . <p> Despite the opposition , the plan was approved with 38 conditions attached . <p> Our report talked about the protests . It had to . News Shopper is a fair newspaper , duty bound to present facts in the correct context and with no bias . <p> Greenwich Time clearly does not play by the same rules . Its report never mentioned the protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meeting , the threats of legal action and the animosity displayed by some to Lord Coe . <p> In fact , it was a strong contender for the most craven , simpering piece of nonsense ever to appear in its pages . <p> To read Peter Cordwell 's report you would think the decision was taken with no opposition in a room full of assenting voices . That 's just not true . <p> But when one paper strives to be editorially independent and relies completely on the money it is able to attract in an open market every week and the other is propped up by a guaranteed bottomless pit of council tax and its news agenda is wholly in support of the ruling party this is not a fair fight . <p> This is n't personal . This is n't political . This has nothing to do with the make up of the ruling party . This is about fairness and transparency . <p> Why is Greenwich Council allowed to spend so much money and we 'll go into exactly how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why should anyone reading Greenwich Time take it seriously ? <p> A letter to Greenwich Time <p> NEWS Shopper editor Richard Firth has written to Greenwich Time . The following is an extract of his letter : <p> By my reporter 's reckoning , there were 300 protestors at the meeting . This was not mentioned in Peter Cordwell 's report . <p> He also believed campaign group No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrian Events ( ) submitted a petition against the event , signed by 13,500 people . This was not mentioned in Peter Cordwell 's report . <p> He also understood there to be a threat of legal action from over Greenwich Council 's right to make this decision . This was not mentioned in Peter Cordwell 's report . <p> It was Mark 's understanding that 30 presentations , most of them opposed to this plan , were made at the meeting . This was not mentioned in Peter Cordwell 's report . <p> Mark also believes he heard Lord Coe barracked during his speech and saw him hounded by several people as he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mark tells me several people expressed their concerns at the level of detail in the application and about the potential for long-term damage to the park . This was not mentioned in Peter Cordwell 's report . <p> Labour councillors in Greenwich who banned them talking to the papers ? <p> NEWS Shopper tried to contact six Labour councillors who were on the planning board on the night of the meeting to find out if they thought Greenwich Time 's report was a decent representation of what happened . <p> All of the councillors were emailed on April 6 with News Shopper 's article along with Greenwich Time 's coverage but only one replied . <p> Councillor Denise Hyland was called at 12.21pm on her office number but we were put through to the council 's communications department . She emailed back referring us to the communications department . <p> Councillor Sajid Jawaid answered his mobile phone at 12.25pm but told us to call the communications department for a response . <p> A message was left for Councillor Peter Kotz on his home number at 12.27pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications department . <p> A message was left for Councillor Clive Mardner at 12.29pm and Councillor Steve Offord at 12.33pm . <p> Councillor John Wakefield said he did not want to comment on what Greenwich Time had written because he had not read it . <p> We told him about the email and he said he would think about it . <p> We never heard from him he 's presumably still thinking about it . <p> Why would n't they talk to us ? <p> They are , after all , elected representatives . We do n't want to talk to the communications department , we want to be able to tell our readers what the people they voted for actually think . <p> Could it be the case that the councillors are banned from talking to the press in case they dare speak out against the Labour party line ? <p> Some Greenwich councillors are allowed to talk to us ... <p> CONSERVATIVE Councillor Spencer Drury ( below ) said : " They are hoping to fool residents with their warped version of reality - that , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwich Time going in people 's doors . <p> " It 's basically a Labour party paper printed and paid for by taxpayers ' money . If it was an information booklet published quarterly then yes , fine . With its own section for Chris Roberts it 's clearly propaganda .

" <p> Green party Peninsula ward candidate , Darryl Chamberlain , said : " If Greenwich Time purports to be a ' newspaper ' , then it should report a full range of views , not censor them because the council 's Labour leadership disagrees with them . <p> " Indeed , the previous week 's Greenwich Time boasted about how good 2012 would be for Greenwich even though it was being distributed before the planning meeting , at which the council is supposed to act neutrally . <p> " This is n't a matter of being for or against the Olympics coming to Greenwich Park , it 's a matter of the council 's conduct .

 art of stamp collecting <p> PYGMIES and pyramids , Orang Utans and tigers , for generations a hobby now seen by many as dull and dusty opened up a new world for young people in the area . <p> As the Leytonstone and Wanstead Philatelic society celebrates its 75th year I talked to members about their passion and how changing times have lead this once popular hobby to become increasingly obscure . <p> The Society was founded in 1946 and since then members have met every two weeks at Wanstead House to discuss , trade and buy stamps from every corner of the globe . <p> In its early days the Society was mostly made up of young people , but since then the average age of members has risen considerably as computer games and television compete for children 's attention . <p> David Pashby , 74 , of Glengall Road in Woodford , first started attending the Society in the 1950s .

There was better craftmanship . Now there are so many produced that the standards have declined . " It is a better hobby for young people than , say , computer games , because you learn so much : you want to find out about the people and places on the stamps .

 to turn an old police station into a seven-storey block of flats are " appalling " . <p> The old Finchley Police Station , in Ballards Lane , could become a block of 70 flats if plans are approved by Barnet Council . <p> But people who live nearby have launched a petition fighting the new development and it has already reached more than 100 signatures . <p> Tal Potishman , of The Ridgeway , opposite the site , said : " People living in the vicinity will be affected because the plans are totally out of character with the area , as neighbouring flats are no more than three storeys high . <p> " On weekends , our street is already packed with visitors to the high street shops . Where are they going to park , let alone the poor local residents ? <p> " And what about visitors ?

 set for early pre-season return as Smith compares goal hero to Premier League winner Vardy <p> Scott Hogan 's reward for bagging seven goals since returning to action from injury last month , is to see his summer holiday cut short . <p> The Brentford striker hit his third successive double - to add to goals from Sergi Canos , Lasse Vibe and Chelsea John Swift - as the Bees cruised to a 5-1 win at Huddersfield Town on Saturday . <p> Hogan arrived at Griffin Park from Rochdale in the summer of 2014 , but cruciate knee ligament damage suffered in a 2-0 win at Rotherham in August saw him ruled out of his first season at the club . <p> A succession of setbacks this term only saw him return to fitness in March helping inspire his side to a run of seven wins from nine games . <p> The former Rochdale frontman said last week that his motivation this term has been to prove his worth on his comeback and his goal haul can only be a sign of things to come next term . <p> Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his third brace in successive appearances for the Bees <p> He has certainly done that and , while the rest of the squad enjoy a well earned break , boss Dean Smith has warned he will be back in the swing of things much earlier than expect to ensure he finds his shooting boots ahead of the new season . <p> " Each player will have an individual programme during the summer , " he said . <p> " Obviously Scott with his history will have his own , but I think everyone can see his progress . <p> He is still being managed and he 'll probably be one of 4-5 players who will come in a week early . " <p> Hogan 's return has also seen a resurgence in the form of Lasse Vibe , who climbed off the bench as Hogan 's replacement to rifle home his seventh goal in his past seven appearances . <p> And Smith hailed the riches at his disposal . <p> " What we have at the moment are two players in Scott Hogan and Lasse Vibe who go in behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie Vardy at the moment who does n't stop working , but that 's what we have in Scott and Lasse and they give us an out ball . " <p> The pair were both on scoresheet as Brentford ended their season in style and cemented a ninth place finish after a season of transition under three different head coaches . <p> It was a remarkable start to the game with Canos breaking down the right and firing past Jed Steer after only 22 seconds . <p> The Bees had another good chance when a Jake Bidwell corner from the right was headed on by Harlee Dean and Yoann Barbet could n't convert from close range . <p> In reply a mazy run down the right by Sean Scannell ended with a weak shot easily gathered by David Button . <p> A great early ball from Nico Yennaris released Hogan down the left , but his final shot could n't match his excellent first touch and you can contact IPSO here <h> Simon Broadribb 's <p> Perhaps the best

 a West Wickham pub has described the bizarre moment he wrestled a four-legged customer to the ground when a panicked deer bounded in after running down the high street . <p> The male Roe deer , who was about the same size as a Great Dane , surprised pub dwellers when he ran into the conservatory of The Swan on Thursday ( May 26 ) . <p> Thanks to the quick-thinking actions of staff and customers , the animal survived the ordeal and was safely released back into the wild . <p> Manager Neil Howley said he was going upstairs when his wife Michelle shouted " there 's a deer in the conservatory !

" <p> Sgt Brown said : " When it comes to the policing plan for the town centre , night-time economy in particular , we used to have quite a lot of resources , a lot of officers in the town centre being highly visible . <p> " The older model was way more high visibility , officers were out on foot wearing high-vis jackets , staggered along the high street . <p> " But that we can only maintain for so long , especially when there are other things going on in the borough , ultimately where there are stabbings and gangs . <p> " The idea was we were there early and throughout the night we would speak to people as they leave the clubs . It was n't just about preventing crime but it was also about getting people home safely . " <p> " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile patrols responding to calls as they come out . " <p> But he added : " That does n't mean we ca n't up the numbers during the night , if the town centre becomes really quite busy and the officers that are down there are busy and are arresting people then we can call up another sergeant and they can send the team down to help . <p> " It does n't mean we are less concerned about what is going on in the town centre . Figures wise , violence with injury has fallen so that in itself is a good thing , but ultimately this comes down to resources . " <p> Sgt Brown said in the past 18 months the rate of serious crimes had fallen in the town centre but minor arrests still took up officers ' time . <p> He said : " If you look at the types of arrests there tend to be a lot of drunk and disorderly arrests and assaults . <p> " In terms of officers I would most likely lose two officers if there was one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they go to custody it is at least two and a half hours that I lose officers for , now if that is half one in the morning that is pretty much the shift and I wo n't see those officers again . " <p> Croydon police have previously come under fire from nightclub and venue owners who believed heavy-handed policing was deterring people from visiting the town centre . <p> Following the force 's failed application to tighten restrictions on Croydon High Street 's Dice Bar , where police claimed " patrons are regularly put at risk of harm " , venue owners spoke out against the force saying there had been a complete breakdown in their relationship with officers . <p> But Louise Sainsbury , co-owner of Club 88 degrees in High Street , said her patrons felt safer when the police were more visible . <p> " I 've worked in Croydon for the last five years and in the last 18 months it is the best it has been . In the last six weeks we have seen it get a bit worse because people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connor Lawton , manager of SLVR bar and club in Surrey Street , also said a higher police presence was better for the area . <p> " The main problem we have are people we do n't let in hanging around outside the area . <p> " I 'm happy to have more police , it gives me peace of you can contact IPSO here <p> She posted a 
 of hunky men from ladies toilets at One Inn the Wood pub <p> An award-winning Petts Wood micropub has been targeted by a picture thief with an eye for hunky men after steamy photos of Tom Hardy and Brad Pitt were stolen from the ladies toilets . <p> The female WC at The One Inn the Wood features a wall adorned with framed photographs of several famous bods , from David Beckham in his underwear to smouldering Aidan Turner , aka Poldark . <p> About six months ago Pitt mysteriously disappeared , prompting theories of a thief with a penchant for saucy pictures . <p> Legend star Tom Hardy was the most recent victim , after he too was nabbed from the ladies loos . <p> Landlord Barry Bridge , 49 , and wife Sarah , 45 , posted a picture on Facebook of the empty space where Hardy used to belong , alongside the caption : " Sad to report the picture thief has taken Tom Hardy . Really tacky " . <p> Mr Bridge said Beckham had been " snubbed " , adding : " He 's old hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry and Sarah Bridge receiving their Camra award last year . <p> He told News Shopper : " About two/three weeks ago the Tom Hardy one we had replaced the Brad Pitt one with was gone . <p> " Tom Hardy and Brad Pitt have gone , but Beckham and Aidan Turner have n't . <p> " It 's a bizarre crime . We have had a lot of suggestions of how to stop it which were quite funny . " <p> Some of the suggestions include taking topless photos of the local brewers used by the micropub , which last year was named Camra 's Pub of the Year . <p> One Inn the Wood also beat off competition from 7,000 other boozers to take the title of Best Pub in Greater London . <p> Replying to the Facebook post , some pubgoers were just relieved to see Poldark had survived the thief 's grasp . <p> Charley Gordon wrote : " Oh my god !

 raise awareness of cancer in memory of ' generous ' mother <p> A " generous and giving " mother who died from breast cancer has inspired her son to warn people of the dangers of waiting too long to get checked out . <p> Patricia Hudson kept her symptoms secret for at least six months before her son , Stephen Hudson , " dragged " her to a doctor and she was diagnosed with the disease in June last year . <p> Ms Hudson , who lived in East Barnet , told her son that she " did n't want to put worry " on him and was in denial that something was wrong , despite rapid weight loss . <p> She died this year on April 6 , aged 69 . <p> Mr Hudson now wants to increase awareness about early and regular check-ups for cancer using money donated to him by the people whose lives his mother touched . <p> Mr Hudson , 34 , of Rushdene Avenue , East Barnet , said : " My mum had a stern nature and was always putting others before herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on . <p> " I want to make sure as many people as possible do n't avoid getting checked out .

" <p> According to Mr Hudson , his mother was very popular in the area and a lot of people turned out for her funeral on April 27 , which would have been her 70th birthday . <p> Much of the money Mr Hudson has raised came from donations at the service in New Southgate Crematorium , East Barnet . <p> Ms Hudson was a fan of popular sitcom Only Fools and Horse and her funeral procession was led by a replica of Del Boy 's distinctive three-wheel yellow van . <p> She raised her son on her own and eventually started work as a court usher at the Old Bailey , where she continued working until she died . <p> Her bosses -- manager David Moorecroft , High Court Judge Gerald Gordon and Recorder of London Nick Hilliard threw a quiz night at the court in her name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He intends to donate the ? 1,200 to donate to Breast Cancer Awareness , part of Cancer Research UK , and Barnet Hospital . <p> Mr Hudson , who works as an actor , said : " I want to thank all three of them .

 Lions ' third signing of the summer on Saturday following the deals to bring midfielder David Worrall and defender Shaun Hutchings to the Den . <p> An energetic winger who has previously played for Rangers and Scotland U21s , Wylde made over 50 appearances last season as Argyle reached the League Two play-off final . <p> Wylde impressed against Millwall in a Football League Trophy clash in November and Harris revealed the club sent scouts to track his progress over the course of the season . <p> The Lions boss said : " Gregg came to light last year when we played down there in the JPT and he gave us a bit of a torrid time for the first half hour . <p> " We watched him another seven or eight times and every time he was highly recommended . He is an out and out left winger , likes to get down the flank and get crosses into the box . <p> " He is an old fashioned type of player who Millwall fans will enjoy watching . <p> " It is great to have him on board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pitch . " <p> Millwall finished fourth last season , surpassing the 80-point mark , before being beating by Barnsley in the play-off final at Wembley . <p> They scored 73 goals during the regular campaign the third most in the league with strike partners Steve Morison and Lee Gregory both enjoying excellent seasons . <p> And Harris insists the arrival of Wylde bolsters his attacking options for next season . <p> " I felt at times last year maybe we did not have as much of an attacking potent threat coming off the bench that I wanted and we relied quite heavily on Aiden O'Brien to be that lone threat , " he said . <p> " Bringing in a couple more attacking players in David Worrall and Gregg wo n't harm opportunities young players have as they can slide into positions left by other people who left the club . <p> " I am delighted with our attacking options , we have players who you can contact IPSO here <h> Masters of the 
 Bradley Pritchard has admitted how studying for his legal career has helped him cope with the highs and lows of the beautiful game . <p> Pritchard , who last season played for League Two side Leyton Orient , is currently in the first year of a part-time Legal Practice Course at BPP University Law School 's Holborn site in London . <p> And , despite the demands of juggling two incredibly important factors in his life , Pritchard does insist that his studies have given him a certain kind of perspective . <p> " It can be very challenging because football is a profession that does n't allow for a great deal of future planning , " said the 30-year-old from Beckenham who is now a free agent . <p> " My preparation for classes is a great contrast to the weekly work pressure of playing in front of thousands of people every weekend . <p> " Football is an absorbing world to be a part of . Every win can be euphoric , while every loss is disastrous . And it 's so important to be able to cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , studying law gives me that perspective . Whatever happens after the final whistle is irrelevant when I go to my next class or revise for an exam . <p> " I enjoy the change in approach because it helps to refocus my mind and consider things much clearer , " said the former Stevenage Borough loanee . <p> Taking on further study is a challenge for anyone regardless of profession , age or abilities . <p> But it 's one which Zimbabwean-born Pritchard would recommend , especially to his fellow professionals if they see their futures heading away from football . <p> " You need to find what you enjoy outside of the game , " the former Addicks man said . <p> " If you have an interest in law , then I definitely think you should go for it . However , studying is n't the only way to create a future career , and the investment - financially and time-wise - should always be considered before making the commitment . <p> " I decided to study law because I wanted make a difference to current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I was quite intimidated to do . I did n't think it was for me , but I am glad I took the risk .

We spoke to Ofsted and they said they would not register us . <p> " We asked the council officer if a nursery would be included in the new plans .

 Martin , of Sylvan Hill , Upper Norwood , claimed he had pulled out his knife and tried to ward off Mr Darko in self-defence after the supermarket worker had attacked him with a baseball bat . <p> The court heard he had been recruited to provide " muscle " for his friend Joshua Asante , also 19 , who had arranged to meet Mr Darko to sell him cannabis . <p> Mr Asante , of Atlee Close , Thornton Heath , was cleared of both murder and manslaughter yesterday . <p> Sentencing Martin this morning , His Honour Judge Paul Worsley told the teenager : " You were there to provide the muscle if it was needed . <p> " When things went wrong you produced the knife and stabbed him to death ... a single , terrible blow . " <p> The judge acknowledged there was evidence that supermarket worker Mr Darko , of Canal Walk , Addiscombe , and his friend Ferron Fletcher had conspired to rob Mr Asante of cannabis worth ? 800 . <p> He also accepted the teenager had not intended to kill Mr Darko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account his learning difficulties and the fact he had a " much lower " IQ than Mr Asante . <p> But he rejected Martin 's claims to have acted in self-defence . <p> Judge Worsley said : " It was never any case of saying his was an accidental blow . <p> " When will young people learn , if they go out with knives at night , the prospect of injury or death will follow . It 's something the courts have had to deal with over and over again . " <p> The court also heard that , in his original defence statement , Martin denied stabbing Mr Darko and tried to pin the blame for carrying the murder weapon on Mr Asante . <p> Speaking after seeing her son 's killer jailed , Mr Darko 's mother Ivy Darko said : " I just ... what can I do ? At least some sort of justice has been served . " <p> David Darko <p> During the sentencing hearing this morning , prosecutor William Boyce read from impact statements provided by Mr Darko 's parents . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lit every room and warmed the hearts of those around him " , and described him as a " hard worker " who was intent on fulfilling his dream of going to university to study railway engineering . <p> She said her son 's death was " almost outside her reality , " adding his younger brothers " still found it hard to deal and come to terms with the fact he has gone " . <p> Mrs Darko had been preparing to go to bed on the night of her son 's murder when police officers accompanied by some of the 21-year-old 's friends knocked at the door . <p> Against the advice of officers she went to South Norwood Recreation Ground and " the trauma of what she saw there - David lying dead in the park - is something she will live for ever " , Mr Boyce told the court . <p> Mr Darko was found by a passer-by at about 7.45pm suffering " catastrophic injuries " having staggering from the spot where he was stabbed to another part of the park . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene , " he was pronounced dead from his injuries an hour later after suffering shock and haemorrhaging from a single wound to the abdomen . <p> During the trial Mr Boyce described how Mr Darko was found " slipping in and out of consciousness and groaning " while holding a small rounders bat in his left hand emblazoned with the words " baseball star " . <p> The knife used to kill Mr Darko has never been recovered . <p> A police forensics officer at South Norwood Recreation ground following the murder of Mr Darko in January <p> Mrs Darko 's biggest regret , her statement read , was that her son had no " opportunity to say goodbye " to his family . <p> She " despaired about how David must have felt and the fear he must have experienced , " and was distraught by the prospect that he had " died alone " . <p> It was " an inexplicable pain " that his family " were not there to protect him or to comfort him , " Mrs Darko added . <p> Since her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health has deteriorated , Mr Boyce said , while the cost of his funeral had caused their family financial difficulties . <p> She felt " numb " and " no joy " since David 's death , with " no happy memories " , her statement read , adding the trial of his killer had deepened her stress and grief . <p> In his impact statement , Mr Darko 's father Lawrence said he had " not known what to do with his time " since David 's murder , adding : " I just think about him lying in the park . " <p> He recalled how his son , " who only ever wanted me to be proud of him , " would meet him in Thornton Heath High Street before going to work " just so he could say , ' Hi Daddy ' " . <p> Mr Darko , who is separated from his son 's mother , said he also had experienced difficulty sleeping and struggled to accept the fact of his son 's death . <p> Before sentencing Martin , the judge praised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they conducted themselves during the trial . <p> He also ordered that Emma Bashford , the member of the public who phoned 999 after finding Mr Darko lying in the park as she walked her dogs , should be paid ? 250 in public money as a " small token " of her public service . <p> In his mitigation before the sentencing , Martin 's lawyer Jeremy Dean told the judge that his client " did not take the knife to the scene to commit any offence " . <p> But Judge Worsley revealed that , even before the jury had returned their guilty verdict yesterday , in his mind " there was no question of self-defence arising at all - let alone it being reasonable " . <p> Martin , who had remained silent and staring straight ahead throughout the sentencing , bowed his head as the length of his jail term was read out . <p> He showed little emotion as he was led away from the dock . <p> Detective Inspector Pete Timms , from the Metropolitan Police 's murder squad , said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 ' could be saved ' by Adopt a Kiosk scheme to put defibrillators in Merton 's phone boxes <p> Placing defibrillators in phone boxes in Merton could help save lives according to a new report . <p> Last year , 129 people suffered cardiac arrests in Merton and although the London Ambulance Service had some of the best performance times in the country , the London-wide survival rate was just nine per cent . <p> A report is now suggesting using phone boxes to store defibrillators , giving quick access to the life-saving equipment while the ambulance makes its way to the scene . <p> Conservative London Assembly member Shaun Bailey , author of the Never Miss a Beat report ? <p> Quick access to a defibrillator doubles likelihood of survival from 27 to 58 per cent . <p> Research in the report ' Never miss a beat - improving London 's response to cardiac arrest ' suggests no public location is as visible as a phone box . <p> The report calls on the Mayor of London to encourage communities to take up the scheme created by the Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables communities to purchase their local phone box for ? 1 and install a defibrillator , has already been taken up in some areas of the UK . <p> The defibrillators are stored in tamper-proof boxes and unlocked with a PIN code given over the phone by a 999 operator . The intelligent machines can not be misused as they only deliver a shock if they can not detect a heart rate in the patient . <p> Conservative London Assembly member Shaun Bailey , said : " There is no question we should be making these life-saving devices as widely available as possible and where better to put them than highly-visible and easily-accessible phone boxes ? <p> " The Adopt a Kiosk scheme is a fantastic way of getting more defibrillators into our communities . <p> " Better access to the right equipment and better education among the general public could ensure victims get life-saving support until the paramedics can arrive . <p> " This simple idea as the potential to save lives in Merton and across the capital and I will be urging the Mayor to adopt the recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defibrillator is approximately ? 1,000 . The report suggests the Mayor could offer match funding to communities who wish to take up the scheme . <p> Martin Render , chairman of the Community Heartbeat Trust , which backs the report , said : " We fully support the recommendations in this report . It is recognised worldwide that early CPR and defibrillation are the key to improving the survival chances of a patient who has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) . <p> " It is so important we get more easily accessible defibrillators into the community and better educate people in CPR techniques . If we can teach more people to recognise what has happened , summon the ambulance service and perform basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation many SCA victims can be saved . " <p> 1st .

 a proposed expansion of the Ham Close estate , arguing it will reduce the density of social housing and ' poor transport links ' will not support an additional 200 homes . <p> Over the past two years Richmond Housing Partnership ( RHP ) and Richmond Council have worked with residents to design the redevelopment of the area in which there are currently 192 housing association homes . <p> The first in a series of consultations was on the financial viability of the project , which was followed by workshops on transport infrastructure , open space and landscaping . <p> Resident Sean Parsons said the density of social housing is 75 per cent , but this would fall ' considerably ' if RHP builds 400 homes to replace the current 192 . <p> He said : " The current density is 192 units . <p> " About 25 per cent of those are leasehold so there are 75 per cent social housing units . <p> " Of the new 400 or 500 units , there will be no more than 140 social housing units meaning that the density of social housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . " <p> " The entire project is a huge money-making scheme by RHP . The local infrastructure can not support this density . " <p> Richmond Council countered by saying a commitment has been made to ensure at least one-third of the added homes will be ' affordable homes ' , meaning the borough 's stock of affordable properties will increase . <p> A Richmond Council spokesman said : " These additional homes will be a mixture of shared ownership and affordable housing for rent . <p> " Affordable housing includes social housing for rent , housing for rent at below market rates and shared ownership properties . " <p> Councillor Penelope Frost said she is unconvinced by RHP 's explanation of the financial viability of the project , while resident Sean Parsons said neighbours have since moved out due to uncertainty around the project . <p> But RHP said the workshops were ' very successful ' with residents showing a lot of interest , and transport viability studies are being undertaken by ' independent experts ' . <p> Cllr Frost said : " It is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete facts .

 of public consultation into raising council tax to fund adult social care <p> Merton Council has been criticised for launching a public consultation into whether it should raise council tax next year in order to fund adult social care services without any input from affected groups or other councillors . <p> The Labour-run council controversially pushed through ? 5million worth of cuts to adult social care during this year 's budget setting meeting in March , after refusing the option to increase council tax by two per cent a year to raise ? 1.7 million to fund the sector . On average , this increase would have cost 5p extra a day for those in the lowest band and 15p for those in the highest . <p> The option to take the tax no longer collected by the Greater London Authority for the Olympic precept and so raise ? 1.3 million for adult social care without an actual raise in council tax was also refused , as Merton Labour stuck fast to their election promise to keep council tax frozen . <p> As part of the fall-out of this decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the resignation of Councillor Peter Walker and suspension of Councillor Jeff Hanna -- Council Leader Councillor Stephen Alambritis said a public consultation would be held to decide whether Merton residents would agree to pay more council tax ahead of next year 's budget . <p> And , although the consultation is due to be launched on Friday , September 9 , the Merton Centre for Independent Living ( MCIL ) have complained that they and other affected groups were involved at all in its creation . <p> In a letter to Cllr Alambritis on Wednesday , September 7 , the chair of MCIL , Roy Benjamin , said : " I am deeply disappointed that you have not kept to the commitment you made to involve us in this consultation . From the initial publicity is appears that the issues are not properly explained to the public , and I have grave concerns about the biased nature of the explanation , which risks negatively influencing the result . <p> " It is extremely concerning to see that Merton Council , under your leadership , does not fully acknowledge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detrimental impact on the lives of disabled people . " <p> Councillors have also expressed concerns with the new consultation , with chair of the scrutiny panel Councillor Peter Southgate saying he was " very disappointed " that the consultation had not been through any scrutiny process before its launch . <p> Cllr Southgate said : " From what I can see , it does n't appear to deal at all with the cuts that we have already had to make , and the different groups that have had to suffer the costs of that . <p> " Those groups , and the scrutiny panel , should have had some input in what this consultation looked like . " <p> Conservative spokesman for finance , Councillor David Williams , added that the consultation had not had any input from cabinet and said : " It 's not been through any process because cabinet do n't want their finger prints on it after Labour promised to keep council tax frozen at the last election . <p> " We of course want a consultation with the public . But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Labour group . " <p> However , Cllr Hanna , who has been pushing for a consultation ever since the budget meeting , said : " I 'm absolutely delighted that a consultation is taking place . Anyone who cares about our borough has to respond to this consultation . " <p> Cabinet member for finance , Councillor Mark Allison said : " Residents know we want to keep council tax low , and because we have taken a business-like approach we are one of only a few councils in the country to have frozen it every year . In Merton we have tightened our belts and reduced our spending in all service areas to reflect the severe cuts in government funding councils like ours have experienced . <p> " However , we need to save a further ? 20m in the next four years , with more cuts to come . So , as it is five years since we agreed our priorities , we want to find out residents ' views on these difficult decisions and how we keep Merton a great place for our families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who resigned in protest to the cuts after breaking ranks to vote against them in March , said : " I 'm surprised Merton Council are even considering not raising the council tax next year . <p> " If the council go ahead with another freeze , it will make Merton one of the worse boroughs in London for their provision for adult social care , which is a travesty considering this is supposed to be a Labour council . <p> " I hope the good people of Merton take the opportunity to ask that the savage cuts in adult social care are lessened in the coming year through a small raise in council tax .

 Park Festival displaying sculptures made of junk <p> The Highams Park Festival is showcasing an array of exhibitions and events curated by a range of artists across the area this week . <p> The theme of this year 's festival is Home and there will be a yarn bob trail , where creative knits and pom poms will be displayed in shop windows and on trees and street furniture . <p> The Wood Street Wall artists , famous for their Owl On River Walk , will be creating a work of art to transform the boards around the building site at the back of the local Tesco . <p> Artist and sculptor Michelle Reader , who lives in Highams Park , is displaying three of her sculptures in Hale End Library , in Castle Avenue , throughout the festival and for a few weeks afterwards . There will be a life-size postman made from junk mail , a portrait sculpture of a 10-year-old girl and a giant bumble bee made from materials including a gas mask , umbrella , plastic cutlery and a yellow bucket . <p> On the afternoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Wood , where she ran a workshop building a giant nest out of bicycle wheels , sticks , electrical cables and other found materials . The nest will stay in the woods for the duration of the festival . <p> The 41-year-old explains how sculpting gives her work an extra dimension and why she finds inspiration through used materials ... <p> Can you tell readers a bit about your work ? <p> I like to make figurative sculptures of people , animals , plants , vehicles or buildings , which are made from everyday objects that are often discarded . The materials used in each piece tell a story , for instance the postman made from junk mail is a comment on the excess advertising that comes through our letterboxes . Also , Oriana , the portrait sculpture of a ten year old girl , was made from her family 's recycling so is an insight into her life . You can see what food she eats , the wrapping paper from a recent birthday , and her handwriting on the scraps of paper I 've used for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love using found objects as inspiration and find them a rich material with a multitude of textures , colours , shapes and stories . Recognising objects within a sculpture gives an extra dimension to the work , and the recognition of something familiar draws people in for a closer look . <p> What is your favourite sculpture that you have made ? <p> My favourite is a life size jaguar I was commissioned to make for BskyB as part of their Rainforest campaign . I went to their recycling warehouse near Coventry to pick out materials to make it with , including satellite dishes , remote controls , metal brackets and electrical cable . <p> Is your work always made with household items or objects found in charity shops and reclamation yards ? <p> Always from some kind of found material . What I use for each sculpture will depend on what it is and what I 'm making it for . For instance , when I 've made sculptures in shopping centres as part of an event I used the materials from their skips , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use materials relevant to them . <p> Is being an artist your day job or is this your hobby ? <p> It is my day job . My work consists of a mix of commissions and running recycled art workshops in schools or at events . <p> I also read you create props , sculptures and models for theatre , product launches , events and photo shoots ? <p> I 'm often approached by PR companies to create sculptures or installations for their clients . I made a five metre tall sculpture of Big Ben using wheat for Shredded Wheat and a food waste picnic for Ocado . <p> How long does it take to make a sculpture ? <p> It depends on the size and materials I 'm using . The junk mail postman took me about a week , the bumble bee a couple of weeks and the jaguar about a month . <p> When did your passion for art and sculpture begin ? <p> At school I loved drawing and making things out of clay . <p> Where did you study ? <p> I did my BA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , graduating in 1997 . I moved to London in 2002 to do an MA in Scenography ( design for performance ) at Central St Martins , which I completed in 2003 . <p> What 's next for you after the festival- any other exhibitions ? <p> We are having an open studio event at our studios in Walthamstow on the weekend of October 1 and 2 . The exhibition will run from 12pm until 6pm each day at Blackhorse Lane Studios , in Higham Mill and there will be 28 artists in the building and a silent auction you can contact IPSO here <h> Join the Conversation 
 by Surrey Police has said the failure to investigate the hacking of murdered Walton schoolgirl Milly Dowler 's phone remains a matter of " deep regret " and that it should have been scrutinised . <p> The Operation Baronet report , released yesterday by Surrey Police , concludes that the interception of Milly 's voicemails by News of the World staff in April 2002 should have been investigated by senior officers but was not . <p> Milly , 13 , a pupil at Heathside School in Weybridge , had been abducted as she walked home from Walton station after school . <p> Serial killer Levi Bellfield was convicted of her murder in June 2011 , and Surrey Police revealed earlier this year that he had finally admitted to her abduction , rape and murder , though this was later contested by Bellfield in a letter to The Sun . <p> In the report , internal investigators said diverting resources from the hunt for Milly to an investigation of the News of the World would have been " difficult to justify at the time " , but added police could have deferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Press Complaints Commission . <p> In a statement alongside the report , A Surrey Police spokeswoman said : " When it became apparent that messages on Milly 's phone had been intercepted in April 2002 , the primary focus of the investigation team was rightly on finding Milly and then bringing her killer to justice . <p> " However , senior officers would or should have been aware of the News of the World 's illegal actions and the matter of phone hacking should have been revisited and investigated at a later stage .

 If you think Europe is having a crisis now , go back to 1946 when the entire continent was blasted back to medieval times , " says Sinclair McKay , author of The Spies Of Winter , which delves into the lives of The GCHQ codebreakers , who fought the Cold War and knew the darkest secrets of British Intelligence at that time . <p> After World War Two had ended , the devastation left across Europe was tremendous , as hundreds of people were displaced and millions had been slaughtered . <p> There was also a lingering fear that the war was n't really over and would break out again at any second .

 partner of EastEnders actress Sian Blake , to die in prison after murdering her and two young sons at home in Erith <p> The partner of EastEnders actress Sian Blake from Erith has been jailed for life for the " horrific " murders of her and the couple 's two young sons . <p> Arthur Simpson-Kent , 49 , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing Ms Blake , their eight-year-old son Zachary and four-year-old Amon . <p> Mr Justice Singh , sentencing Simpson-Kent at the Old Bailey , ordered that he should serve a ' whole life ' prison term for his barbaric crimes . <p> The Killings <p> Simpson-Kent murdered the actress , 43 , who was terminally i 'll with motor neurone disease , overnight on December 14 . <p> The court had previously heard that Ms Blake 's condition meant she would have been physically incapable of defending herself from a violent attack . <p> The judge said she planned to leave him and take the boys with her - they were set to start at a Greenwich school in April this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being stabbed in the neck or throat by Simpson Kent , who painted over bloodstains in their bungalow . <p> He wrapped and buried each of them in the back garden of their home in Pembroke Road . <p> Following the murders , Simpson-Kent sent texts from his dead partner 's phone to cover his tracks including one to Ms Blake 's sister Ava on December 16 saying she and the boys needed to " get away for a while " . <p> The killer hairdresser and cannabis dealer was visited by police at 4pm that day following reports from Ms Blake 's family that he was poisoning his partner and cutting her hair in order to hide his mistreatment of her . <p> The court heard how Simpson-Kent told officers Ms Blake had gone to visit a friend in Cambridge with the children . <p> Shortly after the police visit , Simpson-Kent vanished and fled to Accra , Ghana . <p> Murder detectives travelled to Ghana following an international appeal and Simpson-Kent was subsequently arrested on January 9 , then extradited on February 12 to the UK where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sentencing , Mr Justice Singh explained that due to the exceptional seriousness of the case early release provisions do not apply . <p> He said : " The manner in which the defendant killed his victims was truly horrific . <p> " Even though the defendant is adamant he was going to take his own life , I do not accept this contention . <p> " This is inconsistent with the actions taken after the murder in the following months . " <p> As the impassive looked on , the judge told the court : " Nothing I say can begin to compensate for the family 's tragic loss but I offer them all my sincere sympathies . <p> " In my judgment this was indeed a case where each murder involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning . <p> " At the very least that must be true of the murder of each of the two little boys individually , and in turn after the defendant had already killed Sian Blake . <p> " Further , and in any event , there were serious aggravating features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was particularly vulnerable because of age or disability . There was an abuse of position of trust . There was concealment of the bodies .

He lied to the police and others about the whereabouts of the family . " <p> He wrote , " There is no evidence Simpson-Kent was depressed for example , either before or after the killings , and he has not provided any convincing explanation as to why he did not kill himself as planned despite the long period of time following the killings and his subsequent arrest . " <p> He concluded Simpson-Kent had a narcissistic personality , " which affect about one per cent of the population , which include a grandiose sense of self-importance , requiring excessive admiration , has a sense of entitlement , is interpersonally exploitative , puts his needs over those of others , lacks empathy and shows arrogant , haughty behaviours or attitudes .

 teenager Myron Yarde was ' brutal culmination of brawl started after rivals stole his bike ' <p> The fatal stabbing of a Deptford teenager in New Cross was the " brutal culmination " of a brawl sparked by a bike theft earlier that day in an ongoing turf war , a court heard today . <p> Aspiring rapper Myron Yarde , 17 , also known by the stage name MDOT , was killed in Camplin Street on April 3 this year after a fight that started in New Cross Road . <p> Richards , 19 , of Camplin Street , and two 16-year-olds who can not be named for legal reasons are on trial for the student 's murder . <p> Opening the trial , prosecutor Lisa Wilding QC told the court New Cross Road was a " notional and physical divide " between different groups in that part of the borough . <p> The court heard a group of Myron 's friends had crossed that divide and entered rival territory , an area known among the youths as Monson , where one of them had been stabbed before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MDOT <p> During this trip to get a pizza from Domino 's , there was a confrontation which led to Myron 's bike , that one of his friends had borrowed , being stolen . <p> The fight that left Myron stabbed five times , severing his femoral artery and leaving him collapsed on the street where Fauz Richards lived , happened later that day when the young rapper and his friends returned to the area . <p> Ms Wilding said : " You may think it was no accident that the fight ended up on Camplin Street . <p> " The prosecution suggests that one of the unnamed defendants , in effect , lured the group to Camplin Street where he knew he would find ready assistance and backup .

 London Mayor to protect ' historic ' view of St Paul 's Cathedral from Richmond after tower built in the distance in Stratford <p> A conservation group has called on the Mayor of London to preserve the " historic " view of St Paul 's cathedral from Richmond after developers in Stratford erected a 42-storey building behind it . <p> The Friends of Richmond Park , a conservation charity , complained that the " historic " view of St Paul 's had been " desecrated by a giant development that appears to break planning guidelines " . <p> The cathedral can be seen from King Henry 's Mound in the 900 acre park through some woodland . <p> Plans for the Manhattan Loft Gardens , by property developer Harry Handelsman for the Manhattan Loft Corporation , were introduced in 2012 . <p> The tower comprises of 248 apartments , three sky gardens , a 145-room design hotel , two restaurants and a 200 acre park in Stratford . <p> But representatives for the Friends of Richmond Park say they are " saddened and outraged " that the view has been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in construction of the tower and an " urgent " review by the Greater London Authority . <p> Chairman Ron Crompton said : " It 's a tragedy that such a wonderful and iconic protected view , between two of London 's most historic landmarks and created over 300 years ago , should be destroyed not just for today but for many years to come . <p> " We know thousands of people are very upset by this and that a view so important to Londoners will be spoilt for many generations .

 <h> Leyton Orient Fans Trust set out their test guidelines for any new owner at Brisbane Road <p> The Leyton Orient Fans Trust ( LOFT ) have released their own set of guidelines in their ' fit and proper test ' for any new owner at Brisbane Road to adhere to . <p> It comes after it was revealed last week that owner Francesco Becchetti was set to meet two potential buyers of the club this week . <p> LOFT feel ' that simply having faith in an owner to do the right thing for the club 's wellbeing is not sufficient ' . <p> Orient are once again at High Court on June 12 and the fans trust admitted they will push for administration as a last resort if a deal is not in place . <p> Centre Circle Events Management are still owed money and it is believed Barry Hearn is also due rent for the stadium . <p> Within their test they will check the potential buyers financial openness , their willingness to have meetings , representation and heritage . <p> They also pledged to ' remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> The full statement reads as follows : " One of the striking features of the past three years of Francesco Becchetti 's ownership of Leyton Orient , has been that the ' Owners and Directors Test ' is not in any way adequate to test the suitability of a club owner . <p> " Those three years have also shown without question that simply having faith in an owner to do the right thing for the club 's wellbeing is not sufficient , especially where that owner will not engage with supporters . <p> " It is already clear that the club must change ownership soon in order to move forward and plan for next season . Once that happens , any new owner -- whoever that may be -- will have LOFT 's initial welcome . That owner must however expect to come under scrutiny from all supporters -- not just LOFT -- about their reasons for purchasing Leyton Orient , their intentions and their plans . <p> " Given the way Leyton Orient has been grossly mismanaged since 2014 , the Board of LOFT wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective buyer of the club should be able to commit to , to show that it is ' fit and proper ' to own and manage the club in the interests of all supporters . <p> " Financial - Honesty , integrity and reputation - the buyer should have a clear track record of running their businesses honestly and in a clear way , with respect for their clients , suppliers and the wider community <p> " Competence and capability - the buyer should be able to demonstrate a proven track record of success in running a business of at least comparable size and profile in a sustainable way , to ensure legacy going forward . <p> " Financial soundness - the buyer should be able to demonstrate financial capability such that the club can be run in a competent and competitive manner for the foreseeable future . <p> " Financial openness -- the buyer should be able to publish the source of their funding , make a commitment to pay all creditors , wages and taxes on time , and not take any money out of the football club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit to hold open AGMs with shareholders and regular meetings with supporters , going beyond the minimum requirements . <p> " Representation -- the buyer should commit to discussing whether and how supporter representation on the board can be achieved * Location -- the buyer should commit to keeping the club in the London Borough of Waltham Forest and not to move away from Brisbane Road without full consultation with all supporters . <p> " Heritage -- the buyer should commit not to change the club 's name , home kit colour , badge or other features of the club 's identity without full consultation with all supporters . <p> " Having suffered the tragic and entirely avoidable decline of their football club in the past 3 years , Orient fans simply will not tolerate another owner whose actions do not match their words .
