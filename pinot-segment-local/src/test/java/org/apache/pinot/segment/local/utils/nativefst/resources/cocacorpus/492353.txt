@@27561306 @1261306/ <p> This Frequently Asked Questions lists includes common questions about the Cloud Sync option with the eWallet- SyncPro- engine . <p> Q : Do I need to have the Dropbox client installed on my PC , Mac or mobile device ? A : No , although you may find it handy for other reasons , eWallet neither uses nor requires the Dropbox client software . <p> Q : Do I need to store my local wallet file ( . wlt ) on Dropbox ? A : No , your cloud wallet file ( . cwlt file extension ) is stored on Dropbox and that file is then used as the master file to sync against the local wallet files ( . wlt file extension ) on your device(s) and/or PC(s) . <p> Q : Do I need a new Dropbox account just for eWallet ? A : You do not ; you can use your existing Dropbox account for eWallet too . If you do n't already have a Dropbox account , eWallet will help you signup as part of the sync setup process . <p> Q : Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A : In addition to eWallet 's file encryption , Dropbox and iCloud provide their own security for their services . Please note that using the cloud for sync or backup is optional though ; you can still use the Mac or PC versions of eWallet to sync with iOS devices directly , and the PC version to sync with Android directly . Please see this article for more information on using Dropbox to store cloud wallet ( . cwlt ) files . <p> Q : Can I open my cloud wallet file ( . cwlt ) directly ? A : No , the cloud wallet file ( . cwlt file extension ) is considered the master file for syncing ; to use it , you sync it from Dropbox to a local wallet ( . wlt file extension ) on your device or PC . <p> Q : Can I sync with more than one Dropbox account ? A : Yes ! Although you can not sync the same wallet to more than one Dropbox account , you can sync different wallets to different accounts . One example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your own Dropbox account , and a separate shared wallet with a different Dropbox account . <p> Q : Do I have to use Cloud Sync to synchronize ? A : No , Cloud Sync is an option within eWallet 's SyncPro synchronization engine . If you have the PC or Mac version of eWallet , you can use that to sync with the iOS or Android versions using a local WiFi network ; in that case there is no use of cloud services . <p> Q : Do I have to use either iCloud or Dropbox to sync data on my iPhone , iPad or iPod touch ? A : No , you can set the Cloud Storage Service within eWallet on your iOS device to None if you do n't want to use iCloud or Dropbox for some reason . If you have the PC or Mac version of eWallet , you can use that to sync with the iOS version using a local WiFi network ; in that case there is no use of cloud services . <p> Q : Do I have to use Dropbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No , you can set the Cloud Storage Service within eWallet on your Android device to None if you do n't want to use Dropbox for some reason .

A : Yes , you can . Think of your cloud wallet as the master wallet for syncing , and then each of your devices gets its own local version of that wallet for offline access to the information . <p> Q : With the Registered Trial version of eWallet for Mac , can I use iCloud for syncing ? A : No , Apple restricts iCloud services to applications delivered through the Mac App Store . Note that the Trial version does include all the other sync methods including sync via Dropbox , local WiFi sync , and folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant Internet connection to use Cloud Sync ? A : Not at all . Internet access is required to sync your local wallet file with the master cloud version of the file , but you can still use the local version with no Internet connection at all .

You can also copy lists from another file using Import Lists on the Tools menu . <p> You can sort the items in your lists by any column , just by clicking the column header . <p> Use the Notes Pane to see and edit longer notes or add information to items . You do n't need to have the Note column selected for display in the list ; the Notes pane will show this information for the selected list item . <p> To quickly enter information into lists , display only the columns for which you 'll be entering information . You can always choose to show other columns later , but they 'll be out of the way while you 're doing data entry . <p> To easily copy or paste just the information you want , hide some columns using the List Properties window , use your clipboard to copy the remaining information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , first move all columns that you want to copy to a position ahead of the ones that are turned off . <p> You can use the column header context menu to do all your column rearranging . Right click on the column header above a column to see the context menu , then pick Hide Column to hide the column or pick Show Column to show a column after the current one . Drag a column header to the right or left to order the columns . <p> Use the user-defined Yes/No columns to make your to-do list into a useful table . For example , if you need to do a multi-step cleanup on several different computers , you can make each step a list item and each computer a flag column . Then you can easily mark each step as it 's complete for each machine . This is also useful for releasing several products , testing on several platforms , etc . <p> Note that category values do not have to be just one word . For example , if you have a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Category for where to get them , you might be able to get batteries at either a drugstore or a hardware store . You could make an additional Category column , or just put drugs , hardware in your main Category column . Then , if you Filter your list by either drugs or hardware , batteries will appear . <p> Make your lists more readable by changing the fonts in each column . <p> Choose Hide Checked Items ( or its button on the tool bar ) to hide items you 've checked , if you only want to see what you still need to do . <p> Check Ilium Software 's website for new sample and useful lists . You can use the Import List Wizard to easily import these lists into your ListPro file ( choose Import Lists from the Tools menu ) . <p> A simple way to make it easy to tell which items in a list have been completed is to set a different color for checked items . Open the List Properties window and go to the Color tab . Press the Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new color . Setting checked items to a gray color is a good choice because it makes the completed items look like disabled choices . <p> Use the Make Backup menu item from the File menu to easily make a backup of the current ListPro file . It 's a good idea to do this regularly , especially if you 're using File Synchronization to synchronize with a mobile device . You never know when you might want to retrieve something you deleted accidentally . <p> To start ListPro with a specific file open , double-click on the file in Windows Explorer . <p> New lists that you create can have the columns , fonts and settings you 'd like -- and to make the choices automatically available every time , just make the appropriate changes to the lists in the Templates file . <p> Highlight your most important items in Item View or by right-clicking on a list item . 94681 @qwx294681

@@27561442 @1261442/ <p> To sort a list by the values in a column , click on the column header . Clicking once sorts in ascending order ; clicking a second time sorts in descending order . If you edit an item in your list after sorting , clicking the column header will reapply that sort again rather than switching between ascending and descending orders . <h> Sorting Modes <p> Each list can be configured to operate in one of two modes when maintaining the order of your list items . These two modes are controlled by the Ordered List option in the Settings Tab of the List Properties window . These two modes operate as described below : <h> Ordered List is Off <p> This is the default mode for new lists . When you sort your list , the items are rearranged into the new sorted order and the previous order is lost . In this mode , the Remove Sorting menu function is never available . This mode is useful for lists in which preserving the order of items is n't important . <h> Ordered List is On <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual order of the items ; instead , it causes ListPro to display a sorted view of your list , temporarily . The items remain in their original order , but they will be displayed in sorted order . If you want to make the sorted order permanent , you can select Reorder List from the Ordered List submenu of the View menu . Or you can remove the temporary sorting by selecting Remove Sorting from the Ordered List submenu of the View menu . <p> While a temporary sort is in effect , you ca n't reposition the items by dragging them or using the move buttons ( if you try to reposition them , you 'll see an alert ) . New items added to the list are automatically displayed in their sorted position . <p> In versions of ListPro prior to 3.0 , this mode was always used . <h> Choosing a Mode <p> If you want to see the temporary and permanent ordering more clearly , turn on the Show item numbers option in the Settings Tab of the List Properties Window . This option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item number , which is just the numerical position of the item in the list . If the list is not sorted , the item numbers will be in order . If you sort the list using a temporary sort ( Ordered List is on ) , the item numbers may no longer be in order . If you make the sort permanent by picking Reorder List , you 'll see that the items continue to be displayed in the same order , but the item numbers are now in order . If you sort the list using a permanent sort ( Ordered List is turned off ) , the item numbers always remain in order even though the order of the items is changed by the sort . <p> In most cases you 'll probably want to leave Ordered List off . You may want to turn it on , however , if the items in your list have an inherent order that you want to control . Examples of this type of list might be a recipe where the steps must be done in a certain order or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a specific order . Sorting may still be useful with such lists because you may want to use it to temporarily group items by category , to view items from highest to lowest by some column or to find a specific step in a process by viewing the steps alphabetically . <p> Another consideration for very large lists is that turning Ordered List off may slow down sorting noticeably because the items must be moved as well as sorted . In this case you can speed up the sorting by turning Ordered List on and manually reordering the list when necessary by picking the Reorder List menu function . <h> Sorting by Multiple Columns <p> Often you want to sort your list by one column , but within items having the same value of that column you 'd like to sort by a different column . For example , if your list has Project names as its Category values , you may want to sort by Category in order to group the items by Project , but within each Project you 'd like to sort the items by Priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the View menu or use the Sort By button on the tool bar . You 'll see the Sort window , which will allow you to choose three columns to sort by . For each column you can also choose whether to sort in ascending or descending order . For the example above , you 'd choose Category for the first column , Priority for the second column and leave &lt;None&gt; for the third .

@@27561482 @1261482/ <p> If you have a list where you have used indenting to group items , you may sometimes want to sort the indented items independently of their parent items . The way to do this is to Flatten the list by choosing Flatten Outline from the Tools menu . Flattening your list will remove all indentation from all items , allowing you to sort them as equals . A common example of this is a To Do list in which Priority numbers are assigned to indented items , which are grouped under parent items that represent different projects or tasks . You would sometimes like to just sort all the indented items by priority , so you can see the highest priority items together , independent of project or task . <p> When you Flatten your list , a new column is created called the Parent column . If you have more than one level of indentation in your list , a Parent column will be created for each level . These columns will usually be named Parent , Parent1 , Parent2 and so on . The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring the original hierarchy . For each item that was originally indented , the Parent column will hold the value of the Item column of its original parent item . Normally , you can just ignore the Parent columns . <p> Flattening your list does not simply produce a temporary flat view of your items . The list is actually changed to a flat list , with information about the original hierarchy stored in the new Parent columns . This means that there are no restrictions on the type of changes you can make to your list after it has been flattened . You can sort , rearrange items , edit their contents , delete items or add new ones . The only thing you need to keep in mind is that any changes to the values in the Parent columns , or to the Item columns of the original parent items , may affect the ability of ListPro to restore the original hierarchy of the list . <p> In most cases you will eventually want to restore the original hierarchy of the list . You can do this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use the information in the Parent columns to restore the outline . Note that the changes you have made while the list was flattened may affect how the unflattened list actually looks . For example , if you have changed the order of the parent items , the unflattened list would reflect the new order . If you deleted items or changed the order of items that were indented under a common parent , the unflattened list would contain these changes , too . <p> It 's also possible that you do n't want to unflatten a list , but have decided you want to leave it flattened permanently . In that case , you can delete the Parent columns that were created when you flattened . Please be aware , however , that if you delete the Parent columns ListPro will not be able to unflatten the list . <p> Certain lists may not be possible to restore exactly after they have been flattened . For example , if any of the original parent items have a blank Item column , or if two or more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation would not necessarily have enough information to restore the list exactly . ListPro will always warn you if this is the case before Flattening , however , so you can avoid flattening a list that ca n't be unflattened exactly . <h> Flatten Window <p> The Flatten Outline window appears when you choose Flatten Outline from the Tools menu . Use this window to enter the name of a Parent column to use for flattening the outline . <p> When you flatten a list , all indented items are shifted all the way to the left . This allows you to sort the indented items independently of their parent items . In order to restore the list to its previous state where all items are properly indented under their parent items , ListPro saves the name of the parent items in a new column . <p> You can choose Unflatten Outline from the Tools menu to restore the list to its original state . <h> Unflatten Window <p> The Unflatten Window appears when you choose Unflatten Outline from the Tools menu . Use this window to unflatten a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously flattened , the original outline is restored using the Parent Columns . Unflattening a list causes each item with a value in the Parent Column to be shifted right one indent level . Each indented item is moved after its parent item , which is located by finding the item whose " Item " column matches the Parent Column of the indented item . <p> Please note that unflattening the list is done using only the information in the Parent Columns . If you have changed the content of the Parent columns in any items or have changed the Item column of any former parent items , the unflattening operation may result in a list that is not exactly the same outline as the original . 94681 @qwx294681
