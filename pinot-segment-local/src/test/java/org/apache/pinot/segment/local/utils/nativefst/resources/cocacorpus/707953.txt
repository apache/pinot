We sing it each year and it has been translated to various languages making it a universal song . Here is a brief history of how the song came about . <p> History of the Happy Birthday Song The melody and lyrics were written by two sisters - Mildred J. Hill ( born 1859 ) and Patty Smith Hill ( born 1868 ) . Patty was a schoolteacher who developed the " Patty Hill blocks " and was a faculty member at Columbia University Teachers College . Mildred was also an educator who later on became a composer , organist and pianist . The melody was composed by Mildred and the lyrics were written by Patty but it was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All . " The song " Good Morning to All " was part of the book Song Stories for the Kindergarten which the sisters co-wrote and published in 1893 . <p> From then on the lyrics were changed from its original form to " Good Morning to You " and then to " Happy Birthday to You " . It is still unclear who changed the lyrics that turned it into a birthday song , but it was first published in 1924 on a book edited by Robert H. Coleman . Since then , the song became popular and in 1934 , Jessica Hill , another Hill sister , filed a lawsuit because of the unauthorized use of the " Happy Birthday to You " melody which clearly resembles the melody of " Good Morning to All , " the song her sisters originally wrote . In 1935 , Jessica , who was working with publisher Clayton F. Summy Company , copyrighted and published " Happy Birthday " . <p> In the 1930 's the Clayton F. Summy Company was bought by John F. Sengstack and renamed it Birch Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn bought by Warner Chappell for $25 million . The company is now known as Summy-Birchard Music . It is reported that the birthday song brings in about $2 million a year in royalties with half going to Summy-Birchard and the other half to the Hill Foundation .

This fact and many others are outlined below as we clear up some myths , provide facts and offer some useful information on this popular but misunderstood image format . <p> JPEG is the proper spelling . True . Although the files often end in the three-letter extension JPG ( or JP2 for JPEG 2000 ) , when referring to the file format it is spelled JPEG . JPEG is an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the organization that developed the JPEG format . <p> JPEGs lose quality every time they are opened and/or saved . False . Simply opening or displaying a JPEG image does not harm the image in any way . Saving a JPEG repeatedly during the same editing session ( without ever closing the image ) will not accumulate a loss in quality . Copying and renaming a JPEG will not introduce any loss , but some image editors do recompress JPEGs when the Save As command is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rename JPEGs in a file manager rather than using " Save As JPEG " in an editing program . <p> JPEGs lose quality every time they are opened , edited and saved . True . If a JPEG image is opened , edited , and saved again it results in additional image degradation . It is very important to minimize the number of editing sessions between the initial and final version of a JPEG image . If you must perform editing functions in several sessions or in several different programs , you should use an image format that is not lossy ( TIFF , BMP , PNG ) for the intermediate editing sessions before saving the final version . Repeated saving within the same editing session wo n't introduce additional damage . It is only when the image is closed , re-opened , edited and saved again . <p> JPEGs lose quality every time they are used in a page layout program . False . Using a JPEG Image in a page layout program does not edit the source JPEG image , therefore no quality is lost . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their native document files , you may find your layout documents are considerably larger than the sum of the embedded JPEG files . <p> If I compress a JPEG at 70% , then later reopen it and compress it at 90% , the final image will be restored to a quality setting of 90% . False . The initial save at 70% introduces a permanent loss in quality that ca n't be restored . Saving again at 90% quality only introduces additional degradation to an image that has already had considerable loss in quality . If you must decompress and recompress a JPEG image , using the exact same quality setting each time seems to introduce little or no degradation to the unedited areas of the image . However , the same setting rule just explained does n't apply when cropping a JPEG . JPEG compression is applied in small blocks , typically 8 or 16 pixel increments . When you crop a JPEG , the entire image is shifted so that the blocks are not aligned in the same places . Some software offers a lossless cropping feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choosing the same numeric quality setting for JPEGs saved in one program will give the exact same results as the same numeric quality setting in another program . False . Quality settings are not standard across graphics software programs . In other words , a quality setting of 75 in one program may result in a much poorer image than the same original image saved with a quality setting of 75 in another program . It 's also important to know what your software is asking for when you set the quality . Some programs have a numeric scale with quality at the top of the scale so that a rating of 100 is the highest quality with little compression . Other programs base the scale on compression where a setting of 100 is the lowest quality and the highest compression . Some software and digital cameras use terminology like low , medium , and high for the quality settings . See screen shots of JPEG save options in various image editing software programs . A quality setting of 100 does not degrade an image at all . False . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in quality , though the loss at a quality setting of 100 is barely detectable by the average naked eye . In addition , using a quality setting of 100 compared to a quality setting of 90-95 or so will result in a considerably higher file size relative to the degree of image loss . If your software does n't provide a JPEG preview , try saving several copies of an image at 90 , 95 , and 100 quality and compare file size with image quality . Chances are , there will be no distinguishable difference between the 90 and 100 image , but the difference in size could be significant . Keep in mind , though , that subtle color shifting is one effect of JPEG compression--even at high quality settings--so JPEG should be avoided in situations where precise color matching is important . <p> Progressive JPEGs download faster than ordinary JPEGs . False . Progressive JPEGs display gradually as they download , so they will appear initially at a very low quality and slowly become clearer until the image is fully downloaded . On a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster download , but usually a progressive JPEG is larger in file size and requires more processing power to decode and display . Also , some software is incapable of displaying progressive JPEGs , most notably , the free Imaging program bundled with many versions of Windows . JPEGs require more processing power to display . True . JPEGs not only need to be downloaded , but decoded as well . If you were to compare display time for a GIF and a JPEG with the exact same file size , the GIF would display marginally faster than the JPEG because its compression scheme does not require as much processing power to decode . This slight delay is barely noticeable , except perhaps on extremely slow systems . <p> JPEG is an all-purpose format suitable for just about any image . False . JPEG is best suited for large photographic images where file size is the most important consideration , such as images that will be posted on the Web or transmitted via email and FTP . JPEG is not suitable for most small images under a few hundred pixels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , images with text , images with sharp lines and large blocks of color , and images that will be edited repeatedly . <p> JPEG is ideal for long-term image archival . False . JPEG should only be used for archival when disk space is the primary consideration . Because JPEG images lose quality each time they are opened , edited and saved , it should be avoided for archival situations where the images require further processing . Always keep a lossless master copy of any image you expect to edit again in the future . <p> JPEG images do n't support transparency . True . You may think you 've seen JPEGs with transparency on the Web , but in fact the image was created with the intended background incorporated into the JPEG in such a way that it appears seamless on a Web page with the same background . This works best when the background is a subtle texture where seams are indistinguishable . However , because JPEGs are subject to some color shifting , in some cases , the overlay may not appear totally seamless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with JPEG . Let 's wait and see . JPEG2000 was initially proposed in 1996 . More than a decade later , JPEG2000 is still not a fully published standard . It can take years before graphics software and Web browsers are able to support a new format and that ca n't happen until the format is finalized and accepted as a standard . Although most photo editors now support JPEG2000 ( JP2 ) files , the major Web browsers still do n't , and few ( if any ) digital cameras can write to this format . For more information on JPEG2000 , see The JPEG2000 Source . I can save disk space by converting my GIF images to JPEGs . False . GIF images have already been reduced to 256 colors or less . JPEG images are ideal for large photographic images with millions of colors . GIFs are ideal for images with sharp lines and large areas of a single color . Converting a typical GIF image to JPEG will result in color shifting , blurring , and loss in quality , and often the resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any benefit to convert GIF to JPEG if the original GIF image is more than 100 Kb . PNG is a better choice . <p> All JPEG images are high resolution , print-quality photos . False . Print quality is determined by the pixel dimensions of the image . To print a 4 by 6 inch photo , the image must have at least 480x720 pixels for an average quality print , and 960x1440 pixels or more for a medium to high quality print . Because JPEG is often used for images to be transmitted and displayed via the Web , these images are typically reduced to screen resolution and do not contain enough pixel data to get a high-quality print . When saving JPEGs from your digital camera , you may wish to use your camera 's higher quality compression setting to reduce the damage done by JPEG compression . I 'm referring here to the quality setting of your camera , not resolution ( which effects pixel dimensions ) . Not all digital cameras offer this option .

You normally do this by using the ' Titles and Credits ' option in Movie Maker . The ' title screen ' is simply the screen that is displayed behind the title or credits text . Perhaps the best description for the title screens is ' title screen backgrounds , ' as their main function is to provide an interesting background for the title or credits text you are displaying . Using title screens such as those included in our title packs add interest , provide a polished touch and give your videos an exciting edge over those plain , boring videos you see on sites such as YouTube all the time .

If you know how to add images or video clips to the Timeline or Storyboard ( which anyone must do to use Movie Maker ) you will be able to use the title screens . They are added and used the same way as any other video clip or picture . <p> Q Will the title screens work with any other video editing / movie making software besides Windows Movie Maker ? A Yes , the animated title screen backgrounds will work with most video editing software designed for the Windows operating system . The screens are video clips in WMV format ( *. wmv ) and are often compatible with Windows based video editors / movie making software . If your favorite video editing software does not accept WMV files ( some may require AVI or MPEG for example ) the clips can be easily converted to those or other formats with most video conversion software . ( Conversions to a format suitable for the MAC operating system can also probably be done but we have not confirmed this to date . ) There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another - from WMV to AVI for example . <p> Q In your preview video there is a Nifter.com logo in the bottom right corner . Will that logo be on the title screens that I purchase ? A No . The logo is only used for the online preview videos to help protect the integrity of the title screens . The title screens you receive are the same as the previes but without the text and logo that are displayed in the preview video . In other words , blank title screens . They are also of a higher quality since the previews have been futher compressed for lower bandwith internet display . <p> Q How long is each title screen ( video clip ) ? A Each animated title screen is about 45 seconds in length . Most title sequences are completed in less time than that ; however , if you need a longer time the screens can be merged together . They can also be split or adjusted in the timeline of Movie Maker for shorter needs . The static screens are images so the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just adjust the length to your requirments as with any other picture in a Movie Maker project . <p> Q The title screens with abstract designs look really cool . Why do n't you make all the video clips like that ? A There is a specific reason for keeping title screen backgrounds to a more subtle level . Remember that title screens are really about the title , that is , the text that you are displaying over the screens . Animated title screen backgrounds add interest and give the video a nice , eye-catching appeal ; abstract designs are not always desirable for every type of video or movie . No doubt , the abstract type animations do look great and they certainly have many uses , but subtle title screen backgrounds also have an important place , probably even more so than the video clips / title screen backgrounds with abstract animations . We are currently offering title background animations of all varieties as that is what most people are looking for .

A Yes you can and no you do n't need any special license . The title screens can be used in both personal projects and commercial ventures . No special license or fee is required to do so . You can not re-distribute the title screens ( see next question ) but otherwise you can view them as royalty free animated video backgrouds . <p> Q Can I sell the title screens on my website or give them to other people ?

It is still unclear who changed the lyrics that turned it into a birthday song , but it was first published in 1924 on a book edited by Robert H. Coleman . Since then , the song became popular and in 1934 , Jessica Hill , another Hill sister , filed a lawsuit because of the unauthorized use of the " Happy Birthday to You " melody which clearly resembles the melody of " Good Morning to All , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jessica , who was working with publisher Clayton F.

Some like to dress their snowmen in clothing ( scarves , jackets , hats ) . Dressing a snowman in clothing insulates the snowman by keeping out the heat , which means a longer life for the snowman . However , some may prefer not to risk leaving supplies out doors where they could easily be stolen if someone were so maliciously inclined .

Even before that time computer operators found ways to dress up their monitor screens , some experimenting with what would eventually be today 's computer wallpaper , but it was the period around 1994 - 1995 when home computers - both PC 's and Macs - and the internet began their surge in popularity that scores of desktop wallpaper pictures became available to anyone with an internet connection and used by nearly everyone regardless . It was the color monitor that made all the difference to the use and enjoyment of desktop wallpaper . Let 's go back a little and see how it all started . <p> The History of Computer Desktop Wallpaper The first use of a distinguishable background in conjunction with overlapping windows was in an experimental office system , Officetalk , developed in 1975 at Xerox PARC on the Alto computer . Prior to that , the white backgrounds to overlapping windows ( for example , in Smalltalk ) could be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officetalk produced a 25% gray , using dots two pixels high to avoid flicker on the Alto 's interlaced screen . The same pattern was adopted for the Xerox Star . <p> Apple ( Mac ) used a similar gray background for their Lisa and Macintosh computers . However , since these machines had non-interlaced screens it was possible to use a less noticeable background pattern , formed from a simple 2x2 repeating pattern that gave a 50 percent gray . The introduction of color monitors for personal computers led to non-patterned , single-color backgrounds and then to arbitrary ' wallpapers ' . <p> Computer Desktop Wallpaper Dimensions Many screen resolutions are proportional in a 4:3 ratio , so an image scaled to fit in a different-sized screen will still be the correct shape , although that scaling may impact quality . Common desktop wallpaper resolutions are 800x600 , 1024x768 , 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 . <p> Users with widescreen ( 16:9 or 16:10 ) monitors have different aspect ratio requirements for computer wallpaper , although pictures designed for standard ( 4:3 ) monitors can often be scaled or cropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer wallpapers are sometimes available in double-width versions ( e.g. 2560+1024 ) for displaying on multi-monitor computers , where the image appears to fill two monitors . <p> Some display systems allow unconventionally proportioned images ( 1:1 , 2:1 , or even 1:3 ) to be scaled without change of proportion , to fit the screen , whether it be 16:9 or 4:3 . The image would be sized just large enough that one pair of edges touch the edges of the screen , but not all four , as this would unduly distort the wallpaper image . In these cases , the system 's ' default ' background color is visible around the other two sides of the desktop wallpaper picture . <p> Another common option , particularly for wallpaper images much smaller than the resolution of the display , is having the computer wallpaper image displayed multiple times like a series of tiles . This avoids the distortion of scaling .

After all , no one really invented the music , it was a culmination of decades of blues and other influences molded by a musicians personal touch . Chuck Berry did indeed have a unique way of performing the music he had loved all his life ; with his innovative guitar playing , catchy licks and musical phrases , it 's no wonder he is touted as the inventor of rock and roll . Whether you agree or disagree , naming Chuck Berry the godfather of modern rock and roll is an honor he has earned and deserves .

Rock and roll was inherited by white singers , such as Elvis Presley , who often performed songs composed by obscure black musicians . White rockers became gentler and gentler , thereby muting rock and roll 's very reason to exist . Buddy Holly was the one of the most prominent white rock and roller of the 1950 's ; his style , plus others and the integration with country music led to the vocal harmonies of the Everly Brothers and the instrumental rock sound of Duan Eddy . <p> Rebellious youth soon reappeared as much of popular music transcended into the rebellious chantings of folk music in the 1960 's .

Enjoy ! <p> History and Facts About the 1960 's Rock Group , The Animals The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s known in the United States as part of the British Invasion . Known for their gritty , bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon , as exemplified by their signature songs " The House of the Rising Sun " and " We Got ta Get Out Of This Place " , the band balanced tough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes and emerged as an exponent of psychedelic rock before dissolving at the end of the decade . They had a comeback in 1983 and started a world tour . In early 1984 the band disbanded . <p> History of the British Rock Group , The Animals <p> In the Beginning Formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo , the original line-up comprised Eric Burdon ( vocals ) , Alan Price ( organ and keyboards ) , Hilton Valentine ( guitar ) , John Steel ( drums ) , and Bryan " Chas " Chandler ( bass ) . <p> They were dubbed " animals " because of their wild stage act and the name stuck . The Animals ' moderate success in their hometown and a connection with Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky motivated them to move to London in 1964 , in time to be grouped with the British Invasion . They performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm and blues repertoire ( Jimmy Reed , John Lee Hooker , Nina Simone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of EMI , a rocking version of the standard " Baby Let Me Follow You Down " ( retitled " Baby Let Me Take You Home " ) was their first single . It was followed in June 1964 by the transatlantic number one hit " House of the Rising Sun " . Burdon 's howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement created arguably the first folk rock hit . Whether the arrangement was inspired by Bob Dylan 's version of the song ( which in turn was inspired by folk singer Dave Van Ronk ) or by blues singer Josh White 's ( who recorded it twice in 1944 and 1949 ) or by singer/pianist Nina Simone ( who recorded it in 1962 on Nina at the Village Gate , predating Dylan 's interpretation ) remains a dispute , as does whether all five Animals deserved credit for the arrangement and not just Price . <p> The Animals ' two-year chart career , masterminded by producer Mickie Most , featured intense gritty pop-music covers such as Sam Cooke 's " Bring It On Home To Me " and the Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , their album tracks stayed with rhythm and blues , with Hooker 's " Boom Boom " and Ray Charles ' " I Believe to My Soul " as notable examples . Burdon 's powerful , deep voice and use of keyboards as much as or more than guitars were two elements that made The Animals ' sound stand out from the rest . <p> In November 1964 , the group was poised to make their American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show and began a short residency performing everyday in theatres across New York City . The group arrived at New York City 's Kennedy Airport in a motorcade which featured each member of the band riding in the back seat of a Cadillac with a model . The group drove to their hotel with the occasional shriek of girls who realised who they were . The Animals sang " I 'm Crying " and " The House of The Rising Sun " to a packed audience of hysterical girls screaming throughout both performances . <p> By May 1965 the group was starting to feel internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a fear of flying on tour ; he went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set . Mick Gallagher filled in for him on keyboards for a short time until Dave Rowberry replaced him and was on hand for the hit working-class anthems " We Got ta Get out of This Place " and " It 's My Life " . Around that time , an Animals Big Band made a one-time appearance . Many of The Animals ' hits had come from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Most ; the group , and Burdon in particular , felt this too restrictive . As 1965 ended , the group switched to Decca Records and producer Tom Wilson , who gave them more artistic freedom . In early 1966 MGM Records , their American label , collected their hits on The Best of The Animals ; it became their best-selling album in the US . In February 1966 Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins ; a leftover cover of Goffin-King 's " Do n't Bring Me Down " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single " See See Rider " they changed the name into Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals . In September they disbanded and Burdon recorded a solo album , called Eric Is Here . <p> By this time their business affairs " were in a total shambles " according to Chandler ( who went on to manage Jimi Hendrix ) and the group disbanded . Even by the standards of the day when artists tended to be financially nanve the Animals made very little money , eventually claiming mismanagement and theft on the part of their manager Michael Jeffery . <p> Second incarnation A group with Burdon , Jenkins , and new sidemen John Weider ( guitar/violin/bass ) , Vic Briggs ( guitar/piano ) , and Danny McCulloch ( bass ) were formed under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals ( or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals ) in December 1966 and changed direction . The hard driving blues was transformed into Burdon 's version of psychedelia as the former heavy drinking Geordie ( who later said he could never get used to Newcastle " where the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a spokesman for the Love Generation . <p> Some of this group 's hits included " San Franciscan Nights " , " Monterey " ( a tribute to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival ) , and " Sky Pilot " . <p> Their sound was much heavier than the original group . Burdon screamed more and louder on live versions of " Paint it Black " and " Hey Gyp " . In 1968 they had a more experimental sound on songs like " We Love You Lil " and the 19 minute record " New York 1963 - America 1968 " . The songs had a style of being silent at the beginning and then becoming psychedelic and raw straight to the end with screaming , strange lyrics and ' scrubbing ' instruments . <p> There were further changes to this lineup : George Bruno ( also known as Zoot Money , keyboards ) was added in April 1968 , and in July 1968 Andy Summers ( guitar ) - later of The Police - replaced Briggs and McCulloch . <p> By February 1969 these Animals had dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Deep Mountain High " were internationally released . <p> Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from Long Beach , California , called War . <p> Reunions of the Original Group ( The Animals ) The original Animals line-up of Burdon , Price , Valentine , Chandler , and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968 . <p> Between 1970 and 1972 several bands toured under the name " The Animals " . So they reformed in late 1975 to record again . Burdon later said , nobody understood why they did this short reunion . While the album was recorded at his house , Chandler did not play bass for years . They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like " Lonely Avenue " and " Please send me someone to Love " . They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted .

The following tour included also a Wembley Stadium concert on December 31 which was released on the " Rip it To Shreds " live album in 1984 when they disbanded . The last concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in April 1984 was released on February 27 2008 as " Last Live Show " . They also shot a rare video of the reunion . <p> The first single " The Night " reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts . It was also a big hit in Greece .

Comic strips have also appeared in US magazines such as Boys ' Life . Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed at least since the ancient Egyptians . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Examples in print form exist in 19th century Germany , and in 18th century England , where some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see William Hogarth . <p> The American comic strip developed this format into the 20th century . It introduced such devices as the word balloon for speech , the hat flying off to indicate surprise , and specific typographical symbols to represent cursing . The first comic books were anthologies of newspaper comic strips . <p> As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , " gag-a-day " strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father and Pearls Before Swine ) . Starting in the early 1930s , comic strips began to include adventure stories . Buck Rogers , Tarzan and The Adventures of Tintin were some of the first . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , " comic strips " , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that " sequential art " would be a better name for them . <p> The Newspaper Comic Strip The first newspaper comic strips appeared in America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and pictures evolved gradually , and there are many examples of proto-comic strips . Newspaper comic strips are divided into daily strips and Sunday strips . Most newspaper comic strips are syndicated ; that is , a syndicate hires people to write and draw the strip , and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee . A few newspaper strips are exclusive to one newspaper . For example the Pogo comic strip by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the New York Star in 1948 , and was not picked up for syndication until the following year . <p> Daily Comic Strips Daily strip from 1913 from Mutt and Jeff by Bud FisherIn the United States , a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays , Monday through Saturday , as contrasted with a Sunday strip , some of which only appear on Sundays . Daily strips are usually in black and white , though a few newspapers , beginning in the later part of the 20th century , published them in color . The major formats are strips , which are wider than they are tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taller than they are wide . Strips usually , but not always , are broken up into several smaller panels , with continuity from panel to panel . Panels usually , but not always , are not broken up and lack continuity . The daily Peanuts is a strip , and the daily Dennis the Menace is a panel . J. R. Williams ' long-run Out Our Way continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip , " Out Our Way with the Willets " . <p> Early daily strips were large , often running the entire width of the newspaper , and were sometimes three or more inches in height . At first , one newspaper page only included one daily strip , usually either at the top or the bottom of the page . By the 1920s , many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together . Over decades , the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller , until by the year 2000 , four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly with a two-tier daily strip , Star Hawks , but after a few years , Star Hawks dropped down to a single tier . <p> In Flanders , the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like Spike and Suzy and Nero . They appear Monday through Saturday , as until recently there were no Sunday papers in Flanders . In the last decades , they have switched from black and white to color . <p> The Sunday Comic Strips Sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section . Early Sunday strips , such as Thimble Theatre and Little Orphan Annie , filled an entire newspaper page , a format known to collectors as full page . Later strips , such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates , were usually only half that size , with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers , such as the New Orleans Times Picayune , or with one strip on a tabloid page , as in the Chicago Daily News . When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dropped panels . During World War II , because of paper shortages , the size of Sunday strips began to shrink . After the war , strips continued to get smaller and smaller , to save the expense of printing so many color pages . The last full-page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for 11 April 1971 . Today , most Sunday strips are smaller than the daily strips of the 1930s . <p> Origins of the Comic Strip Early proto-comic strips exist from the time of ancient Egypt , and include medieval manuscript illumination , the medieval Bayeux Tapestry which is a visual narrative embroidered on a 70 meter ( 230 feet ) cloth strip with captions in Latin , and William Hogarth 's English cartoons from the 18th century , which include both " single panel " work and also narrative sequences such as A Rake 's Progress . <p> The Biblia pauperum ( " Paupers ' Bible " ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips . <p> The Swiss teacher , author and caricature artist Rodolphe Toepffer ( Geneva , 1799-1846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as " The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck " , or " Histoire de Monsieur Jabot " ( 1831 ) are believed to have inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , the German painter , author and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children 's stories such as Struwwelpeter ( " Shockheaded Peter " ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese .

Hearst promptly hired Harold Knerr to draw his own version of the strip . Dirks renamed his version Hans and Fritz ( later , The Captain and The Kids ) . Thus , two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades .

This question is raised in the interview , but unfortunately , the answer is still not clear .

However , there is a major problem with that statement : Casey Anthony rarely tells the truth . Annie Downing flatly denies ever giving and/or selling Xanax pills to Casey Anthony or any other person . If the comments we receive on our YouTube channel are any indication , people are torn on whether or not Casey Anthony accessed Xanax pills from Annie Downing , but of course these comments are mere speculation .

As horrid as it may be , the evidence indicates that this poor child was drugged often and left in the trunk of the car while Casey Anthony went out partying and so forth .

Light is an electromagnetic wave , and its photons can move as a wave through air or as particles through a vacuum . Sound , however , is a pressure wave , which must produce a vibration to be heard . That can only occur when the wave encounters a particle of some kind , such as an air molecule . <p> The Doppler Effect is the change in the perceived frequency of sound waves .

Following this short he was given the name " Bugs " by the Termite Terrace animators in honor of Ben " Bugs " Hardaway .

The best part of all is that it is easy to do . Note that we are assumming you have at least a beginners understanding of Movie Maker for this article . If you 've never used the program before , give it a try . It will most likely be on your computer as it ships with newer versions of Windows ( XP / Vista ) and is an easy program to learn . <p> You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and took plenty of photos . You love showing them off to friends and family and they love seeing them - those crisp images of beautiful sunsets , beaches , interesting places and people - not to mention finding out what you were up to down there . ( At least the parts you took pictures of anyway ! ) Displaying your pictures in a standard slideshow is fine , but it certainly does n't have the effect , nor the appeal , a nice presentation with audio can offer . Get those pics into Movie Maker , add some cool transitions and music that relates to the slideshow and you 'll have a presentation you can be proud of when family and friends come to take a look . You 'll be able to save the entire trip as one movie file and remove all those pictures from your computer , opening up new space in the process . You just ca n't lose ! <p> How to Proceed With Your Movie Maker Slideshow The first thing to do is decide how long you would like each picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker is five seconds , but you should give that some thought . If you want to add transitions between the pictures ( which you most certainly will ) the length of the transition will cut into each picture 's display time by about half . For example , if two pictures are being displayed for five seconds each and there is a one second transition between them , each picture will acutally be clearly shown for about 4-1/2 seconds each . This is because , at one second for the transition to to take place , the two pictures will overlap each other ( displaying the transition ) for that one second thus reducing the display time for each picture by half a second . Sounds confusing , yes , but it 's really not of up up give it a second to sink in . Just remember that the transitions you add will cut down on the total length of time the picture is actually clear to the viewer . Adding a few photos with transitions and testing it out - seeing if you like the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a good idea . <p> To set a faster moving slideshow while still leaving time to get a decent look at the pictures , a four second image duration with one second transitions works well . To create a slideshow that allows more time to look over each image ( without dragging it out too long ) a six second picture display with a 1-1/2 second transition time frame looks very nice . Bottom line , choose what you like best while keeping in mind that your friends and family will probably not want to linger over each picture the same way you might . You have memories attached to those pictures ; they are just looking at photographs . Show off your pics , but do n't make them wish they had n't come over to visit . <p> The Audio Track Selecting the appropriate audio track is more important than you might think . Imagine to going to a friend 's house to view a slideshow of their trip to Australia . As images of eye-popping ocean sunsets and serene evenings by the campfire in the outback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - C - A ' the disco song from the seventies . Kind of puts an edge on an ocean sunset does n't it ? That may be an extreme case , but to others , music that is harsh to their ears will be just as irritating , in fact , you 'll probably find that they come down with the flu just before your next slideshow . <p> When you come home from the Movie Theatre , could you list all the different types of music that were played in the film ? Unlikely , because the music is not the focus of the event , even though its importance is immense . The film would not be the same without it , but for much of the time , it lays softly in the background creating and shifting moods with never the need to lift its immense head into view . The same can work for your slideshow . You may not want to take the time to find just the right music , but trust in it , as the extra time you take to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view your slideshow will go home with a great impression of both your trip , and how you managed to create such a cool display . They may not know why it made them feel good , but you will . <p> Tip:Calculate the rough length of your video / slidehow using the number of pictures x 's the approximate length each will be shown for . ( For example , 20 photos at 5 seconds each = 100 seconds . ) With that calculation in mind , try to find music that is about the same length then adjust the slideshow to fit the music . It creates a much more professional feel and having the music and photographs fade away at the same time is definitely a moment that will be remembered . <p> Do n't Be Irritating One of the most irritating things about home-made videos ( which is what your slideshow will actually be ) is the fact that so many people have no problem abruptly cutting off the end and bringing the movie to a close in a jarring fashion . No matter how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated , and your impression of the video as a whole - not to mention the video creator - is less than stellar , to say the least . A video that starts in the same fashion is equally annoying . The number of videos on YouTube that begin with someone speaking - in the middle of a sentence ! - is astounding . This problem is not going to bring the world crashing down , but if it 's your video slideshow that begins like that , no doubt your viewers will be snickering before they see the first good shot of the bikini girl on the beach someone 's husband or boyfriend ' accidentally ' took . <p> One of the advantages of using Movie Maker to create a slideshow is that you can add a nice introduction and ending sequence , before and after the slideshow . This is especially nice if you 're creating a video of important events , such as weddings . The point here is to do your best to create a video with a start , middle and end that presents reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will argue that fussing for weeks over a slideshow of your vacation may be considered a little extreme , but at the same time , taking the time to do it right is always worth it . Remember that you may be watching the video 30 years from now , and when that time comes , you 'll be happy you did it right . <p> Article Reprint Information This article may be reprinted on your website under the following conditions : 1 .

Icons have been used to supplement the normal alphanumerics of the computer . Modern computers now can handle bitmapped graphics on the display terminal , so the icons are widely used to assist users . <p> Icons were first developed as a tool for making computer interfaces easier for novices to grasp in the 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center facility . Icon-driven interfaces were later popularized by the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating environments . <p> A computer icon usually ranges from 16 by 16 pixels up to 128 by 128 pixels . Some operating systems feature icons up to 512 by 512 pixels . When the graphical output device has a smaller size , the icon size is small . Vision-impaired users ( due to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright backgrounds , or color blindness ) may need to utilize the self-selected icon size options . <p> The Icons Rold in Interaction with the User Icons may represent a file , folder , application or device on a computer operating system . In modern usage today , the icon can represent anything that the users want it to : any macro command or process , mood-signaling , or any other indicator . User friendliness also demands error-free operation , where the icons are distinct from each other , self-explanatory , and easily visible under all possible user setups . <p> Icons may also be found on the desktop , toolbars and in the menus of computer application software such as Microsoft Word . Icons are made more user-friendly by being very distinct from every other icon . Each icon set may also have unifying features that reveal that similar icons are related to each other . Icons commonly show those traits in manners such as these : <p> Virtually every major computer operating system has the ability to use an icon-based graphical user interface ( GUI ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usage of the term " icon " in the WIMP computing paradigm ( for Windows , Icons , Menu , Pointers ) . <p> Function or Program Icons On this screen , icons are used in many ways : to represent files , folders and disk drives , as toolbar buttons , and to illustrate menu items and taskbar items . <p> Most computer functions in a GUI are represented by a function icon . Placing the cursor on the icon , and clicking ( or double-clicking ) a mouse , trackball or other button starts the function or program . <p> The creation of a good function icon can be considered an art form in itself , comparable to that practiced in the past in the domain of miniature painting by old masters such as Joseph Severn and Charles-Francois Daubigny . <p> The icon must be original , distinctive and tiny . It must be useful on a wide variety of monitors set at different resolutions . This work is further complicated by the need to create several sets of function icons for several types of views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , the GUI guidelines in one operating system might specify the need to create sets of 16 , 32 , and 48 pixel icons for any program while the GUI guidelines in another system might specify sets of 16 , 24 , 48 and 96 pixel icons .

Typically a game project requires two jobs to be completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sound engine must be programmed so that those sounds can be incorporated into the game 's interactive environment . <p> In earlier computers and video game systems , sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis . In modern systems , the increases in storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used . The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio , often with hardware acceleration , and real-time audio post-processing , which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development . Based on the internal state of the game , multiple different calculations can be made . This will allow for , for example , realistic sound dampening , echoes and doppler effect . <p> Historically the simplicity of game environments reduced the required number of sounds needed , and thus only one or two people were directly responsible for the sound recording and design . As the video game business has grown and computer sound reproduction quality has increased , however , the team of sound designers dedicated to game projects has likewise grown and the demands placed on them may now approach those of mid-budget motion pictures .

The legend may have its basis in hagiographical tales concerning the historical figure of Saint Nicholas . <p> The modern depiction of Santa Claus as a fat , jolly man ( or elf or gnome ) wearing a red coat and trousers with white cuffs and collar and black leather belt and boots , became popular in the United States in the 19th century due to the significant influence of caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast . This image has been maintained and reinforced through song , radio , television and films . In the United Kingdom and Europe , his depiction is often identical to the American Santa , but he is commonly called Father Christmas . <p> Some cultures state that Santa Claus lives in the far north in a land of perpetual snow .

Other details about our jolly friend Santa state that he is married and lives with Mrs. Claus , makes a list of children throughout the world to deliver toys to , categorizing them according to their behavior . Also , Santa Claus delivers presents , including toys , candy , and other gifts to all of the good boys and girls in the world - and sometimes coal or sticks to the naughty children . Santa Claus , with his magical mysterious ways , manages to perform these tasks all in one night . He is not without help , however ; Santa has the aid of magical elves who make toys throughout the year for delivery at Christmas and has eight flying reindeer who pull his sleigh - nine , of course , when Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer participates.

@@110556537 @5956537/ <p> iFact #2 - Video Game Sound Effects The principles involved with modern video game sound effects ( since the introduction of sample playback ) are essentially the same as those of motion pictures . Typically a game project requires two jobs to be completed : sounds must be recorded or selected from a library and a sound engine must be programmed so that those sounds can be incorporated into the game 's interactive environment . <p> In earlier computers and video game systems , sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis . In modern systems , the increases in storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used .

Read on to learn more and watch a preview video of this exclusive , Nifter.com special effects package ... <p> 80+ Zoom Effects for Windows Movie Maker - Vista VersionAre you ready to rock ? ! ! This is quite possibly the most exciting effects pack for Movie Maker anywhere ! Special zoom effects are a staple of professional , eye-catching videos ; now you too can easily add outstanding zooming features to your own projects using only Windows Movie Maker and the Nifter Zoom Effects package . You can imagine the pride you 'll feel showing off your impressive videos to an awe-struck audience . And if you like to upload videos to YouTube or other video sharing websites , you can expect your viewers to start raving about your outstanding videos with their awesome new effects ! <p> Installation takes only seconds and is fully automated for you . <p> About the Zoom Effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker effects . You simply add them to images or video clips the same way you add effects to Movie Maker clips now . Each zoom effect begins its zoom , or movement , at the beginning of a clip and reaches its end position at the end of a clip . This allows you to adjust the speed of a zoom effect by changing the length of the clip . A short clip will have a fast zoom effect . A long clip will have a slower zoom effect . There are also " Hold " effects that will keep a clip in any of the available positions without zooming in or out . This keeps a clip in the position you have zoomed to , or , can be used for non-zooming close-up shots . <p> After installing the Nifter Zoom Effects pack , over 80 new zoom effects plus 6 bonus effects will be available in Movie Maker 's effects list . Installation takes only seconds and is fully automated for you . You can have all of the special effects listed below in your copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nifter Zoom Effects - Explanation of Categories and List of Effects The Zoom Effects are divided into three categories : Zoom , Pan and ClipZoom . Here is an outline what each category of zoom effects does . We will use the word " clip " to signify an image or video clip used in Movie Maker : <p> 1 - Zoom <p> This collection of effects allows you to zoom in and out within the boundries of a clip proper . You can move in for close-up shots , zooming in just a little ( 1/8 ) to all the way into the center of the clip ( Zero ) where the viewer sees virtually nothing at all . ( Zooming all the way in , or visa versa , creates a very cool effect when changing from one clip to another . ) There are six positions used for zooming in and out towards the center of a clip : Full ( full clip ) , 1/8 , 1/4 , 1/2 , 3/4 and all the way in , or Zero . You can zoom in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and match them any way you please . For example , you could zoom from Full to 3/4 , then zoom from 3/4 to 1/8 , then jump to 1/2 and zoom to Zero and so forth . Each ' zoom ' is a separate effect so they can be arranged in any order you please . <p> Each position also has a " hold " effect where the zoom is held in that position without moving . 1/2 Hold , for example , would display a clip zoomed in at 1/2 for a static close-up shot , without any moving zoom effect . The " Hold " effects are used to maintain a position after you have zoomed into it , ( if that 's what you want ) , or , can be used for close-ups of a clip without any moving zoom effect . ( Very handy ! ) You can easily perform multiple zooms on the same clip by adding the clip to Movie Maker as many times as you need and creating a different zoom effect for each clip . <p> 2 - Pan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clips and some focused zoom effects . Pan in from the top , bottom , left or right , panning into a full clip view with a smooth , sweeping motion . <p> The focused zoom effects will let you zoom into the top , bottom , left and right of your Movie Maker clips . There are five Zoom Top effects , each moving into the top of a clip closer than the previous one , two Zoom Bottom effects and the left and right focused zooms . These effects are amazingly handy to have around , especially for close-up shots of people where the head is usually near the top of the picture . With 5 Zoom Top effects you can frame the head perfectly , and even zoom in for close-ups of the eyes ! <p> 3 - ClipZoom <p> ClipZoom moves the entire clip as a whole object out of and into full view of the video player . As with the Zoom Effects ( #1 above ) , ClipZoom uses specific positions that you can move ( zoom ) the clip into and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , 3/4 , 1/2 , 1/4 and Zero , or all the way out until the clip disappears . This is probably best understood by watching the preview video below , but if you can imagine a clip moving away from full screen , getting smaller as it goes , you should understand how this works . For example , at the 3/4 position , the clip takes up about 3/4 of the video player screen , having zoomed from a full clip to a 3/4 sized clip to acheive this awesome effect . <p> Using " Zoom " and " ClipZoom " together gives you complete control over clip zooms . A clip can be taken from a full-on close-up shot to a clip that disappears into the center of the screen - taking advantage of the many positions in between or not . This is also true in reverse , of course , where a clip can be zoomed from a tiny mark in the center of the screen until it comes into full view and then on to a close-up , as deep as you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this better if it is not clear . Just remember that you will have some very cool zooming features giving you a ton of options for clip zooms once this package has been added to your Vista version of Movie Maker . <p> All of the above effects are included in the Nifter Zoom Effects Pack . Over 80 special zoom effects plus a bonus of 6 more special effects for your Vista version of Windows Movie Maker ! <p> Nifter Zoom Effects Preview Video <p> This video provides a quick demonstration of many of the effects included in the package . Please keep in mind that the video has been compressed for low-bandwidth internet use and is therefore of lower quality than the real thing . <p> Useful in So Many Ways The Zoom Effects are useful in so many ways it 's impossible to describe them all . One handy feature that is sometimes missed is the fact that zoom effects can be used to change the focus of images and video clips into close-ups without zooming at all . For example , imagine that you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the picture . You do n't want to use a moving zoom effect but you want a closer image of the car . Using one of the zoom effects that holds a specific position , " 1/2 Hold , " for example , ( part of the effects package ) you can show a close-up of the car in a video without having to do any editing of the picture . Alternatively , of course , you could also zoom into the close-up with a moving zoom effect , but there are times when both methods are useful . Nifter Zoom Effects give you both options . The images below show an example of what is being described : <p> Picture example of " holding " a zoom position for close-up shots without editing photos . <p> Ready to Rock ?

The pictures in this section have all been created so that they can be used in the web page background tiles fashion . The tiled pattern is created by repeating an image over and over , both horizontally and vertically until it fills the entire web page . The tiling action - repeating the image - is performed automatically by your web browser when it is ' told ' to use a specific picture as a background image . If you want to gain more control over the tiled design ( tiling only horizontally or tiling only vertically for example ) you need to use Cascading Style Sheets , or CSS . With standard HTML coding / scripting , your only option is to displayed the tile image in both directions . <p> How to View and Download the Free Image Tiles Web Page Backgrounds The sample images ( below ) may not all be displayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same dimension to provide a clean browsing experience .

We 'll also explain how you can prevent an image from tiling when you do n't want it to and how to transform any image into one that will look decent when tiled . <p> How to Transform Any Image Into One That Looks Good When Tiled Not all images look good when tiled as a background . Pictures such as those in our Web Page Backgrounds That Can Be Tiled section ( above ) are already set up for tiling purposes , and so are perfect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not specifically designed to be used as a tiled background , then there is a trick you can do to make it look better when tiled . <p> Perhaps we should first explain what makes an image good for tiled backgrounds . In a nutshell , the image should match up on all four sides to itself . That may sound a little strange , so let 's take a look at an image to help explain . <p> If you look closely at this picture you will see that the pattern on the left side of the image matches up with the pattern on the right side , and the same with the top and bottom . Therefore , when this image is tiled the pattern will join , so to speak , and create a seamless design . <p> Here 's what the above image looks like when tiled . You can see that an even pattern is created because of the image design : <p> Now we 'll look at the same image again , only this time it has been edited ( cropped smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer match up . This is the image that was used : <p> And here is the image tiled : <p> Obviously the design that was created by tiling the second image is not one most people would want on their website . The point is , not all images look good tiled , but there is a method for fixing that problem . <p> How To Make Any Image Look Good When Tiled Okay , so you have a picture that you really want to use as a web page background , but when you tile it , it looks horrible . Here 's the solution : <p> With this method we 're going to use our example image that looked horrible when tiled and turn it into one that looks decent . It 's not hard to do but requires some editing with image editing software . We 'll have to assume you have some basic skills with image editing software to accomplish this . Follow these steps to proceed : <p> Open the picture in your favorite image editing software . <p> Copy the picture to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most programs . <p> The next step is to enlarge the canvas ( not the picture , the canvas ) so that the new dimensions equal twice the width and twice the height of the picture 's original size . For example , if the image you are working with is 50x50 , enlarge the canvas to 100x100 . When enlarging the canvas , make sure the original picture is in the top-left corner . Your image editing software should allow you to choose where the original image is placed on the new canvas size . Again , it should be in the top-left corner . Your picture should now look like something this : <p> Select Edit &gt; Paste in your graphics software to paste the original image that you copied to the clipboard into the new canvas . Flip the pasted portion horizontally then move it into the upper-right corner . Your picture will now look something like this : <p> We now repeat the same process for the bottom-left corner and the bottom-right corner , but with some differences . For the bottom-left corner , the pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the bottom-right corner , the pasted portion must be lipped both horizontally and vertically . These steps will give you images that looks something like these do , respectively : <p> You 're done ! The finished image will now match up on all sides to itself and can be tiled as a web page background . <p> Now , when tiled , the new image produces a pattern like below . The background is now seamless with each picture matching up to the next , which is at least better than the unsightly mess we saw earlier . <p> To help you remember how to do this , here is a picture that you can download ; it is marked with the proper ' flips ' to create an image that can be tiled . Just remember to copy the original image before you start working with it , then resize the canvas so that it is twice the width and height of the original . Here 's the picture : <p> It 's time to outline some popular methods used to create seamless , tile web page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page Background Image There are three common methods used to tile images on web pages : code applied to the Body tag , code applied to the table data ( TD ) tag and with the use of style sheets ( CSS ) . We 'll look at all three here and outline the advantages and disadvantages of each . <p> Using the Body Tag to Tile an Image This is a very simple method that is easy to implement . A ' normal ' body tag used in simplified HTML documents will usually make reference to the background of the web page . For example , the following body tag displays a web page with a white background . We 've included the text and link properties so that the tag appears more complete . ) <p> &lt;body bgcolor= " #FFFFFF " text= " #000000 " link= " #0000FF " &gt; <p> To change the background property to reference a picture , the tag would be written like this : <p> &lt;body background= " ImageName.jpg " text= " #000000 " link= " #0000FF " &gt; <p> When an image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture will be tiled over the entire background of the web page . <p> Advantages It 's a simple way for those not familiar with CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) to create a tiled web page background . Different foreground colors and/or tiled patterns can still be used in table cells to add a more pleasing look to the website . Bottom line , it can be useful in certain situations . <p> Disadvantages You have no control over the display . The entire page will be covered with the tiled image excepting those areas where table cells over-ride it . This also means that you are forced to over-ride the design if you do n't want it shown on some areas of the web page which can turn into quite a hassle . Also , the image will be tiled both horizontally and vertically and you can not change that fact . <p> Tiling Images With the Table Data Tag The most basic table data tag looks like this : <p> &lt;td&gt; <p> The most basic table data tag that specifies a color for the background looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To create a tiled background with an image in a specific table cell we use the same code as we would in the body tag : <p> &lt;td background= " ImageName.jpg " &gt; <p> This will cause ' ImageName.jpg ' to be tiled horizontally and vertically in the specific table cell the ' background= ' code was added to . It should be noted here that if you do not specify any background for a table data ( td ) cell , the main background of the web page will be shown . <p> Advantages Again , it 's easy to do , plus , using table cells ( tables ) allows you more control over the look of your web page . You could , for example , tile one image pattern in the body tag for a main background , then use tables to display overtop the main background with other colors and/or tiled designs . This needs to be done carefully , however , or you may end up with a web page that appears ' unruly ' and cluttered . Tiled backgrounds in general need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some glaring , wild design obscuring the text of your web pages . <p> Disadvantages As with the body tag , the image will be tiled both horizontally and vertically whether you like it or not . <p> Using Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) to Control Image Tiling The use of Style Sheets will give you full control over any image tiling you wish to do on your web pages . Pictures can be tiled horizontally only , vertically only , both directions , or an image can be displayed with no tiling at all . <p> If you are unfamiliar with CSS you can find a good Style Sheets Tutorial here . For this article , we 'll show you the code used to tile images any way you would like . <p> This is an example of a style sheet class that could be used to set properties for a web page : <p> We 've included the ' font ' and other properties just to make it look more complete . In the above example , any part of a web page ( or the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the properties shown in the example . The background color would be white ( #FFFFFF ) , the text black ( #000000 - specified by ' color ' in the element ) and so on . <p> To add a background image that is tiled , we add the ' background-image ' element like so : <p> As shown above , the background image would be tiled horizontally and vertically because no other instructions have been included in ' MyCss . ' ( Tiling horizontally and vertically is the default . ) We can control how the image is tiled , however , by adding more instructions . To have the image tile horizontally only we insert the ' repeat-x ' property like this : <p> Advantages There are many ; if you 're not using Style Sheets with your website you are missing out on a lot . CSS is much easier to learn than you might imagine , so if you 're only slightly familiar with it , or not familiar at all , take the time to read a good Style Sheets Tutorial . The use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image is tiled , and you ca n't beat that . With full control , there is little else to say . CSS is the way to go . <p> Disadvantages None <p> We just want to add that in the examples above , the image to be tiled was always referenced directly , for example , background= " ImageName.jpg " That works fine if your images are in the same folder as your web pages , but most websites are not set up like that . To reference an image from the folder it resides in , you simply add the path to the image starting from the location the web page is in . For example , if the image is in a folder called ' images ' it would be referenced like this : background= " images/ImageName.jpg "

Vendors may provide images in both formats , or just one . Delivery options vary from retail packages to instant online downloads . Vendors typically market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty and the marketing method often goes hand in hand with the art style of the clip art sold . <p> Clip art vendors produce or license new and old clip art collections in volume to compete on quantity . Marketed this way , clip art is usually less expensive but more simple in structure and detail , as is typified by cartoons , line art , and symbols ( e.g. Nova Development , Clipart.com and GraphicsFactory.com ) . Smaller and specialized Clip art tends to be more complex , modern , detailed , and spendy ( WeddingClipart.com , GoodSalt.com ) . <p> Clipart File Formats Electronic clip art is available in many different file formats . Understanding the difference between the individual formats is important for users so that image files , resolutions , and details are correct for the needed results . <p> Major Formats of Cliparts The two different types of clip art file formats are bitmap or vector graphics . <p> Bitmap ( rasterized ) file formats are used to describe rectangular images made up of a grid of multicolored or black and white pixels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitmaps are limited in quality by their resolution , which is fixed at the time of creation . If a bitmap is not rectangular , it is saved on a default background color defined by the smallest bounding rectangle in which the image fits . <p> Clipart Resolution Due to the fixed resolution in bitmaps , printing them can result in produce grainy , jagged , or blurred results if the resolution is not suited to the printer resolution . Bitmaps also become grainy when scaled larger than their intended resolution . Some bitmap file formats , such as Apple 's PICT format , support alpha channels , that allow bitmaps to have transparent backgrounds or an image selection which uses antialiasing . Most common web-based file formats ; GIF , JPEG , and PNG are bitmap file formats . The GIF file format is one of the simplest , low-resolution bitmap formats and only supports 256 colors per image . GIF files can be extremely small in size . Other common bitmap file formats include BMP ( Windows bitmap ) , TGA , and TIFF . Most clip art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not good for scaling , transparent backgrounds , or quality printed materials . Bitmap file formats are ideal for photographs , especially when combined with lossy data compression algorithms such as those available for JPEG files . <p> In contrast to the grid formatted bitmaps , Vector file formats use geometrics to define an image as a series of points , lines , curves , and polygons . Because the image is described using geometric data instead of fixed pixels , it can be scaled to any size while retaining " resolution independence " , meaning that the image can be printed at the highest resolution a printer supports , without any loss of detail or quality . Vector file formats are usually superior to bitmaps due to resolution how easy it is to edit them , but are not as widely supported by software and are not well-suited for storing pixel-specific data such as scanned photographs . During the early years of electronic clip art , vector illustrations were limited to simple line art representations . By the early 2000s , vector illustration tools were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still providing all of the advantages of vector file formats . The most common vector file format is Adobe 's EPS ( Encapsulated PostScript ) . Microsoft has a simpler and less sophisticated vector format called Windows Metafile ( WMF ) . The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a new , XML-based vector file format called SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) which may be supported by all web browsers in the future ( Firefox and Opera support the format now ) . Vector provides the most flexible , highest quality images for those with image-editing experience or the interest to work with vector file formats . <p> Clip Art Image Rights Clip art usage is governed by the terms of individual copyrights and usage rights . It is important to understand copyright and usage rights of a clip art image so that the image is used in a legal , permitted manner . The most categories of image rights are royalty free , rights managed , and public domain . <p> Royalty Free Clipart Images Royalty free clipart images are often sold with royalty free licenses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to use the images personal , editorial or commercial purposes . These royalty free image rights do sometimes vary from vendor to vendor and may have restrictions at certain companies . <p> Sometimes fine art clip art is licensed on a rights managed basis , meaning that the image is priced for a certain use for a certain amount of time , basically an image rental . Rights managed licensing of clip art has greatly declined within the past 20 years due to the preference of customers of royalty free licensing . <p> Public Domain Clipart Images Public domain images are one of the most popular types of clip art since they are available at no cost if you know where to find them . Many images that are labeled as being in the public domain actually are not and are sometimes under copyright , making it illegal to use them without proper permissions from the copyright holder . The main cause for this confusion is due to the fact that once a public domain image is redrawn or edited in any way , it becomes a brand new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images that have been edited are found available for purchase with royalty free or rights managed licenses by the editor . <p> In 1999 , the United States District Court ruled as part of Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp that exact copies of public domain images were not protected by US copyright law , however this ruling applies to currently only to photographs . It is not skill , experience or effort but originality that affects copyrightability of derivative images . The US Supreme Court in Feist v. Rural ruled that the difficulty of labor and expenses must be rejected as considerations in copyrightability . It is generally accepted that the creativity required to reproduce an illustration by hand is intrinsically original , and protected by copyright law . <p> As an example : The large clip art libraries of Dover Publications or the University of South Florida 's Clipart ETC project are based on public domain images , but because the images have been scanned and edited by hand , they are again copyrighted images and are subject to very specific use policies . In order for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly in the public domain , you must have the proper rights granted to you by the individual or organization which digitized and edited the original source of the image ( an original book is one example ) . <p> Internet popularity made the widespread copying of pirated clip art ( which is then sold or given away as free clip art ) very common . In reality , most clip art titled as free is usually illegally distributed . Almost all images published after January 1st 1923 still hold copyright protection under the federal laws in most countries . Images published before 1923 need to be researched to ensure that they are in the public domain . <p> The exception for images created after 1923 are images which are donated to the public domain by the artist or publisher . The open source community established the Open Clip Art Library in 2004 as a clearinghouse for images which are placed in the public domain directly by their copyright owners . This library contained over 6,500 images by 2006.

The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house . Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show 's content . Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called ' the mainstream trash ' that they were watching . The half-hour series premiered on December 17 , 1989 with ' Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire ' , a Christmas special . <p> The series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode ' Some Enchanted Evening ' , which was meant to introduce the main characters .

The Simpsons was the Fox network 's first TV series to rank among a season 's top 30 highest-rated shows . <p> The show was controversial from its beginning . The rebellious lead character at the time , Bart , frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior , which led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children . Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts , such as one featuring Bart and the caption ' Underachiever ( ' And proud of it , man !

Typically a game project requires two jobs to be completed : sounds must be recorded or selected from a library and a sound engine must be programmed so that those sounds can be incorporated into the game 's interactive environment . <p> In earlier computers and video game systems , sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis .

Do n't miss out on this special offer ! <p> History of Windows Movie Maker Windows Movie Maker was introduced in 2000 with Windows Me , but suffered from poor reviews due to its modest feature set in comparison with the year-old iMovie product on the Apple Macintosh . Version 1.1 was included in Windows XP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AVI and WMV 8 files . Version 2.0 was released as a free update in November 2002 , and added a number of new features . Version 2.1 , a minor update , is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 . Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 introduced a new version of Windows Movie Maker , 2.5 , with more transitions and support for DVD burning . A WPF version was included in some builds of Windows " Longhorn " ( now Windows Vista ) , but was removed in the development reset . <p> Windows Movie Maker in Windows Vista includes new effects and transitions , and support for the DVR-MS file format that Windows Media Center records television in . The HD version in Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista adds support for capturing from HDV camcorders . The capture wizard will create DVR-MS type files from HDV tapes . However , the Windows Vista version of Windows Movie Maker no longer supports importing video from an analog video source such as a VCR or from a webcam . <p> Some systems might not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , Microsoft has also released an updated older version 2.6 for Windows Vista on the Microsoft Download Center . This version includes the old effects and transitions , and is basically the same as Windows Movie Maker 2.1 , but without the ability to capture video . It requires Windows Vista and is only intended for use on computers where the hardware accelerated version can not be run . <p> Layout The layout consists of a storyboard view and a timeline view , collections for organizing imported video , and a preview screen . When in Storyboard view , the video project appears as a film strip showing each scene in clips . The storyboard/timeline consists of one ' Video ' ( with accompanying ' Audio ' bar ) , one ' Music/Audio ' bar , and one ' Titles/Credits ' bar . In each bar , clips can be added for editing ( e.g. , a . WAV music file will belong on the ' Music/Audio ' bar ) . Still images can also be imported into the timeline and " stretched " to any desired number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut " to any number of short segments , which will play together seamlessly , but the individual segments are isolated editing-wise , so that for example , the music volume can be lowered for just a few seconds while someone is speaking . <p> Importing Footage / Video Clips / Pictures / Audio Clips When importing footage into the program , a user can either choose to Capture Video ( from camera , scanner or other device ) or Import into Collections to import existing video files into the user 's collections . The accepted formats for import are . WMV/.ASF , . MPG ( MPEG-1 ) , . AVI ( DV-AVI ) , . WMA , . WAV , and . MP3 . Additionally , the Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Movie Maker support importing MPEG-2 Program streams and DVR-MS formats . Importing of other container formats such as MP4/3GP , FLV and MOV , MIDI , AIFF , AAC and SWF is not supported unless you have the correct codec installed . <p> When importing from a DV tape , if the " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker automatically flags the commencement of each scene , so that the tape appears on the editing screen as a collection of short clips , rather than one long recording . That is , at each point where the " Record " button was pressed , a new " clip " is generated . However , the actual recording on the hard drive is still one continuous file . This feature is also offered after importing files already on the hard drive . In the Windows Vista version , the " Make clips on completion " option has been removed the clips are now automatically created during the capture process . <p> The efficiency of the importing and editing process is heavily dependent on the amount of file fragmentation of the hard disk . The most reliable results can be obtained by adding an extra hard disk dedicated for scratch space , and regularly **27;61;TOOLONG it , rather than simply deleting the files at the end of the project . Fragmented AVI files result in jerky playback on the editing screen , and make the final rendering process much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cameras through the USB interface , most older cameras only support USB version 1 and the results tend to be poor " sub VHS " quality . Newer cameras using USB 2.0 give much better results . A FireWire interface camera will allow recording and playback of images identical in quality to the original recordings if the video is imported and subsequently saved as DV AVI files , although this consumes disk space at about 1 gigabyte every five minutes ( 12GB/Hr ) . Alternatively , most DV cameras allow the final AVI file to be recorded back onto the camera tape for high quality playback . Some standalone DVD recorders will also directly accept DV inputs from video cameras and computers . <p> Editing and Output After capture , any clip can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the timeline . Once on the timeline , clips can be duplicated or split , and any of the split sections deleted or copied using the standard Windows keyboard shortcuts or clicked and dragged to another position . Right-clicking any clip brings up the range of editing options .

Thus , several different versions of the same video can be simultaneously made from the original camera footage . <p> Windows Movie Maker can only export video in Windows Media formats or DV AVI . It includes some predefined profiles , however , users can create custom profiles which utilize newer codecs using Windows Media Profile Editor ( part of Windows Media Encoder 9 Series ) and copy those profiles to the %Program Files%Movie MakerSharedProfiles folder for them to be used in Windows Movie Maker . In order for the custom profiles to show up , go to File &gt; Publish Movie . Tasks &gt; Publish Movie will not show any custom profiles . <p> Earlier versions of Windows Movie Maker did not support direct burning of DVDs . The project had to be first saved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce and burn the DVD . ( Limited but adequate authoring software was often bundled free with DVD drives ) . The Windows XP Media Center Edition version , bundled the Sonic DVD Burning engine , licensed from Sonic Solutions to author and burn the DVD . The Windows Vista version of Windows Movie Maker passes the video project to Windows DVD Maker to burn DVD-Video discs . <p> Video can be exported back to the video camera if supported by the camera . Movie Maker also allows users to publish a finished video on video hosting websites . <p> Windows Movie Maker can also be used to edit and publish audio tracks . If no video or image is present , then you can just export the sound clips you have as a . wma file . <p> Effects and Transitions Versions 2. x included in Windows XP includes 60 transitions , 37 effects , 34 title and 9 credits animations . The Windows Vista version includes a different set of transitions , effects and title/credits animations while dropping a few older ones . There are in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a drag and drop interface from the effects or transitions folders . Titles and credits can be added as stand alone titles or overlaying them on the clip by adding them onto the selected clip . Titles range from static ( non-animated ) titles to fly in , fading , news banner , or spinning newspaper animations . Due to the flexible interface , programming custom effects and other content is possible for version 2.0 and higher using XML . The Windows Vista version supports Direct3D-based effects . Microsoft also provides SDK documentation for custom effects and transitions . Since the effects are XML based , users can create and add custom effects and transitions of their own with XML knowledge . <p> Reception and Criticism of the Windows Movie Maker Product Movie Maker 1.0 , introduced with Windows Me , was widely criticised for being " bare bones " and suffering " a woeful lack of features " and saving movies only in Microsoft 's ASF file format . However , critical reception of versions 2.0 and 6.0 has been more positive . <p> In June 2008 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated on the Internet in which he heavily criticized the downloading process for Movie Maker at the time .. The memo was originally made available online as part of the plaintiffs ' evidence in Comes vs . Microsoft , an antitrust class-action suit , and was submitted as evidence in that case on January 16 , 2007 . <p> Another note of concern is Windows Movie Maker lacking the ability to export movies at a framerate higher than 30.

The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house . Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show 's content . Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called ' the mainstream trash ' that they were watching .

The Simpsons was the Fox network 's first TV series to rank among a season 's top 30 highest-rated shows . <p> The show was controversial from its beginning . The rebellious lead character at the time , Bart , frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior , which led some parents and conservatives to characterize him as a poor role model for children .

' The slogan had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of every Looney Tunes cartoon . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the late 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series . ( When Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , ' And Dat 's De End ! ' ) He is also known for his severe stutter . He often changes his words mid-sentence to correct his stutter . For example , a line like ' what 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - what 's happening ? ' <p> Porky Pig in the Early Films The character was designed by animator Bob Clampett and introduced in the short I Have n't Got a Hat ( first released on March 2 , 1935 ) , directed by Friz Freleng . Studio head Leon Schlesinger suggested that Freleng do a cartoon version of the popular Our Gang films . Porky only has a minor role in the film , but the fat little stuttering pig quickly became popular . Porky 's name came from two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng 's , nicknamed ' Porky ' and ' Piggy . ' <p> Since Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had left the studio in 1933 , taking the studio 's star character Bosko with them , Looney Tunes had been kept afloat by cartoons featuring the bland Buddy .

Tex Avery was hired to the studio in 1936 , and his film Gold Diggers of ' 49 reused much of the cast from I Have n't Got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a shy little boy to an immensely fat adult . Though he was still in a supporting role , Porky got most of the laughs . The directors realized they had a star on their hands . <p> Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him , Joe Dougherty , who actually did have a stuttering problem . Because Dougherty could not control his stutter , however , production costs became too high . The versatile Mel Blanc won the audition for the character in 1937 . Blanc continued the stutter ; however , it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect ( such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty . ) Porky 's Duck Hunt was released in 1937 , and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989 . In later interviews , Blanc often made the claim that he intended Porky 's stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs ( although other cartoon pigs do not have such a severe stuttering problem ) .

Clampett 's Porky was an innocent traveler , taking in the wonders of the worldand in Clampett 's universe , the world is a very weird place indeed . This principle is perhaps best demonstrated in Porky in Wackyland , a film that sends Porky on a quest to find the last of the Dodos .

On Tuesday , 21 February 1961 , they made their first lunchtime appearance at The Cavern Club in Liverpool . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club , culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963 , a month after the band recorded " She Loves You " and just six months before the Beatles ' first trip to the United States . <p> Whilst playing at The Cavern Club they met Brian Epstein who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Cavern Club Whilst playing golf with Dr. Joseph Sytner , Nigel Whalley - a friend of Lennons who was an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Club - asked Dr. Sytner if his son , Alan , could book The Quarrymen at The Cavern Club in Mathew Street , which was one of three jazz clubs he managed . Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first , so as to assess their talent . The band set up in the downstairs lounge of the golf club , and were surprised when nearly one hundred people filed in to listen . The performance was a success , and a hat was later passed around that held almost 15 pounds , which was much more than any other bands were paid . Alan Sytner phoned Whalley a week later and offered the band an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at The Cavern . <p> Before The Cavern Club performance , the band argued amongst themselves about the set list , as rock ' n roll songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tolerated . After starting with a skiffle song , Lennon called for the others to start playing " Do n't Be Cruel " , but banjo-player Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would " eat you alive " , which Lennon ignored and started playing it himself , forcing the others to join in . Halfway through , Sytner pushed his way through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read , " Cut out the bloody rock ' n roll " . <p> Brian Epstein The Beatles ' name was first noticed by Brian Epstein in issues of Mersey Beat ( which he sold in his NEMS music store ) and on numerous posters around Liverpool , before he asked Bill Harry who they were . The Beatles were featured on the front page of its second issue . <p> On 9 November 1961 , Epstein saw The Beatles for the first time in The Cavern Club . Epstein 's version of the story was that a customer , Raymond Jones , walked into the NEMS shop on Saturday 28 October 1961 and asked Epstein for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sheridan . Alistair Taylor later claimed that he used the name of Jones ( a regular customer ) to order the single and paid the deposit himself , knowing that Epstein would notice it , and order further copies . Harry and McCartney later repudiated this story , as Harry had been talking to Epstein about The Beatles for a long time ( being the group he promoted the most in the magazine ) and by McCartney saying , " Brian knew perfectly well who The Beatles were - they were on the front page of the second issue of ' Mersey Beat ' . " Two girls requested the record the following Monday , and this sparked Epstein 's interest . It was the policy of the NEMS shop to look into every request that was made , so Epstein talked to contacts of his . He was told that they were playing The Cavern , having just returned from Hamburg , so he went to see them perform . <p> The Beatles - John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , and Pete Best - were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 9 November 1961 . Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch The Beatles perform , so Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing , with a welcome message being announced over the club 's public-address system by Bob Wooler , who was the resident DJ . Epstein later talked about the performance : " I was immediately struck by their music , their beat , and their sense of humour on stage - and , even afterwards , when I met them , I was struck again by their personal charm . And it was there that , really , it all started . " <p> After the performance , Epstein and Taylor went into the dressing room , which he later called " as big as a broom cupboard " , to talk to them . The Beatles , all regular NEMS customers , immediately recognised Epstein , but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance , George Harrison said , " And what brings Mr. Epstein here ? " <p> The Beatles played at The Cavern over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch them . Epstein contacted their previous manager , Allan Williams , to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them , but Williams advised Epstein " not to touch them with a barge pole " . In a meeting with the group at NEMS on 10 December 1961 , he proposed the idea of managing them . <p> At first , he failed to connect with them , so the band refused to let him manage them ; however , they relented after a short while . The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24 January 1962 , which gave Epstein 25% . He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises . McCartney 's father had encouraged his son to find a Jewish manager , so Epstein fitted perfectly . Epstein had told his mother and father that managing The Beatles was only a part-time occupation and would never interfere with the family business . <p> Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management , he had a strong influence on their early dress-code and attitude on stage . When Epstein discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , performing at rowdy rock ' n ' roll shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it , or when an audience member requested a certain song . Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties , insisted that they stop swearing , smoking , drinking or eating onstage , and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances . McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein 's ideas , believing it was - in part - due to Epstein 's RADA training . Lennon was against the idea of suits and ties , but later said , " Yeah , man , all right , I 'll wear a suit . I 'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody 's going to pay me " . Epstein also began seeking publicity by " charming and smarming ... the newspaper people " ( as John Lennon would put it in 1972 ) . According to McCartney , " The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit , it did go up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . " Another improvement Epstein made was that the group was now far more organised - having a single diary in which to record bookings , rather than using whoever 's diary was to hand . <p> The Beatles Recording Contract The Beatles were still under contract to Polydor following their Hamburg work with Tony Sheridan for Bert Kaempfert . As Kaempfert was only interested in The Beatles as a back up group for Sheridan , he agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract . This left the band with no recording contract so Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies , but was rejected by many , including Columbia , Pye , Philips , Oriole , and most famously , Decca . The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan ( ex-drummer of the Shadows ) to produce the studio recordings . While Epstein was negotiating with Decca , he also approached EMI marketing executive Ron White , who later contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley , and Norman Newell , but they all declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth staff producer ( George Martin ) as he was on holiday . <p> On 8 February 1962 , Epstein visited an HMV store in Oxford Street , London , to have the Decca audition tape transferred to disc . An HMV technician named Jim Foy liked the recordings , and suggested that Epstein should contact Parlophone 's George Martin . The Beatles were signed by EMI 's small Parlophone label after the group had been rejected by almost every other British record company , and without Martin ever having seen them play live . Martin later explained that Epstein 's enthusiasm , and his conviction that The Beatles would one day become internationally famous , convinced him to sign them . <p> Martin scheduled an audition at Abbey Road Studios which convinced Martin that they were good enough , but with one exception : He felt the recording would be better served by an experienced session drummer in place of Pete Best . When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer , John Lennon , McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision , and asked Bob Wooler if it was a good idea , to which Wooler replied that Best was very popular with the fans and they would not like it at all .

Comic strips have also appeared in US magazines such as Boys ' Life . Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed at least since the ancient Egyptians . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Examples in print form exist in 19th century Germany , and in 18th century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced , see William Hogarth . <p> The American comic strip developed this format into the 20th century . It introduced such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying off to indicate surprise , and specific typographical symbols to represent cursing . The first comic books were anthologies of newspaper comic strips . <p> As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , " gag-a-day " strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father and Pearls Before Swine ) . Starting in the early 1930s , comic strips began to include adventure stories . Buck Rogers , Tarzan and The Adventures of Tintin were some of the first . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , " comic strips " , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that " sequential art " would be a better name for them . <p> The Newspaper Comic Strip The first newspaper comic strips appeared in America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the first newspaper comic strip . However , the artform combining words and pictures evolved gradually , and there are many examples of proto-comic strips . Newspaper comic strips are divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are syndicated ; that is , a syndicate hires people to write and draw the strip , and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee . A few newspaper strips are exclusive to one newspaper . For example the Pogo comic strip by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the New York Star in 1948 , and was not picked up for syndication until the following year . <p> Daily Comic Strips Daily strip from 1913 from Mutt and Jeff by Bud FisherIn the United States , a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays , Monday through Saturday , as contrasted with a Sunday strip , some of which only appear on Sundays . Daily strips are usually in black and white , though a few newspapers , beginning in the later part of the 20th century , published them in color . The major formats are strips , which are wider than they are tall , and panels , which are square , circular , or taller than they are wide . Strips usually , but not always , are broken up into several smaller panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not always , are not broken up and lack continuity . The daily Peanuts is a strip , and the daily Dennis the Menace is a panel . J. R. Williams ' long-run Out Our Way continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip , " Out Our Way with the Willets " . <p> Early daily strips were large , often running the entire width of the newspaper , and were sometimes three or more inches in height . At first , one newspaper page only included one daily strip , usually either at the top or the bottom of the page . By the 1920s , many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together . Over decades , the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller , until by the year 2000 , four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip . <p> NEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip , Star Hawks , but after a few years , Star Hawks dropped down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like Spike and Suzy and Nero . They appear Monday through Saturday , as until recently there were no Sunday papers in Flanders . In the last decades , they have switched from black and white to color . <p> The Sunday Comic Strips Sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section . Early Sunday strips , such as Thimble Theatre and Little Orphan Annie , filled an entire newspaper page , a format known to collectors as full page . Later strips , such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates , were usually only half that size , with two strips to a page in full-size newspapers , such as the New Orleans Times Picayune , or with one strip on a tabloid page , as in the Chicago Daily News . When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format , it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged , cropped or dropped panels . During World War II , because of paper shortages , the size of Sunday strips began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller and smaller , to save the expense of printing so many color pages . The last full-page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for 11 April 1971 . Today , most Sunday strips are smaller than the daily strips of the 1930s . <p> Origins of the Comic Strip Early proto-comic strips exist from the time of ancient Egypt , and include medieval manuscript illumination , the medieval Bayeux Tapestry which is a visual narrative embroidered on a 70 meter ( 230 feet ) cloth strip with captions in Latin , and William Hogarth 's English cartoons from the 18th century , which include both " single panel " work and also narrative sequences such as A Rake 's Progress . <p> The Biblia pauperum ( " Paupers ' Bible " ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths - which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips . <p> The Swiss teacher , author and caricature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of the modern comic strips .

Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as " The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck " , or " Histoire de Monsieur Jabot " ( 1831 ) are believed to have inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , the German painter , author and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children 's stories such as Struwwelpeter ( " Shockheaded Peter " ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese .

Known for their gritty , bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon , as exemplified by their signature songs " The House of the Rising Sun " and " We Got ta Get Out Of This Place " , the band balanced tough , rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material . The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes and emerged as an exponent of psychedelic rock before dissolving at the end of the decade . They had a comeback in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band disbanded . <p> History of the British Rock Group , The Animals <p> In the Beginning Formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo , the original line-up comprised Eric Burdon ( vocals ) , Alan Price ( organ and keyboards ) , Hilton Valentine ( guitar ) , John Steel ( drums ) , and Bryan " Chas " Chandler ( bass ) . <p> They were dubbed " animals " because of their wild stage act and the name stuck . The Animals ' moderate success in their hometown and a connection with Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky motivated them to move to London in 1964 , in time to be grouped with the British Invasion . They performed fiery versions of the staple rhythm and blues repertoire ( Jimmy Reed , John Lee Hooker , Nina Simone , etc ) . Signed to the UK Columbia subsidiary of EMI , a rocking version of the standard " Baby Let Me Follow You Down " ( retitled " Baby Let Me Take You Home " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 by the transatlantic number one hit " House of the Rising Sun " . Burdon 's howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement created arguably the first folk rock hit . Whether the arrangement was inspired by Bob Dylan 's version of the song ( which in turn was inspired by folk singer Dave Van Ronk ) or by blues singer Josh White 's ( who recorded it twice in 1944 and 1949 ) or by singer/pianist Nina Simone ( who recorded it in 1962 on Nina at the Village Gate , predating Dylan 's interpretation ) remains a dispute , as does whether all five Animals deserved credit for the arrangement and not just Price . <p> The Animals ' two-year chart career , masterminded by producer Mickie Most , featured intense gritty pop-music covers such as Sam Cooke 's " Bring It On Home To Me " and the Nina Simone number " Do n't Let Me Be Misunderstood " . In contrast , their album tracks stayed with rhythm and blues , with Hooker 's " Boom Boom " and Ray Charles ' " I Believe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep voice and use of keyboards as much as or more than guitars were two elements that made The Animals ' sound stand out from the rest . <p> In November 1964 , the group was poised to make their American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show and began a short residency performing everyday in theatres across New York City . The group arrived at New York City 's Kennedy Airport in a motorcade which featured each member of the band riding in the back seat of a Cadillac with a model . The group drove to their hotel with the occasional shriek of girls who realised who they were . The Animals sang " I 'm Crying " and " The House of The Rising Sun " to a packed audience of hysterical girls screaming throughout both performances . <p> By May 1965 the group was starting to feel internal pressures . Price left due to personal and musical differences as well as a fear of flying on tour ; he went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with the Alan Price Set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time until Dave Rowberry replaced him and was on hand for the hit working-class anthems " We Got ta Get out of This Place " and " It 's My Life " . Around that time , an Animals Big Band made a one-time appearance . Many of The Animals ' hits had come from Brill Building songwriters recruited by Most ; the group , and Burdon in particular , felt this too restrictive . As 1965 ended , the group switched to Decca Records and producer Tom Wilson , who gave them more artistic freedom . In early 1966 MGM Records , their American label , collected their hits on The Best of The Animals ; it became their best-selling album in the US . In February 1966 Steel left and was replaced by Barry Jenkins ; a leftover cover of Goffin-King 's " Do n't Bring Me Down " was the last hit as The Animals . For the single " See See Rider " they changed the name into Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals . In September they disbanded and Burdon recorded a solo album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business affairs " were in a total shambles " according to Chandler ( who went on to manage Jimi Hendrix ) and the group disbanded . Even by the standards of the day when artists tended to be financially nanve the Animals made very little money , eventually claiming mismanagement and theft on the part of their manager Michael Jeffery . <p> Second incarnation A group with Burdon , Jenkins , and new sidemen John Weider ( guitar/violin/bass ) , Vic Briggs ( guitar/piano ) , and Danny McCulloch ( bass ) were formed under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals ( or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals ) in December 1966 and changed direction . The hard driving blues was transformed into Burdon 's version of psychedelia as the former heavy drinking Geordie ( who later said he could never get used to Newcastle " where the rain comes at you sideways " ) relocated to California and became a spokesman for the Love Generation . <p> Some of this group 's hits included " San Franciscan Nights " , " Monterey " ( a tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sky Pilot " . <p> Their sound was much heavier than the original group . Burdon screamed more and louder on live versions of " Paint it Black " and " Hey Gyp " . In 1968 they had a more experimental sound on songs like " We Love You Lil " and the 19 minute record " New York 1963 - America 1968 " . The songs had a style of being silent at the beginning and then becoming psychedelic and raw straight to the end with screaming , strange lyrics and ' scrubbing ' instruments . <p> There were further changes to this lineup : George Bruno ( also known as Zoot Money , keyboards ) was added in April 1968 , and in July 1968 Andy Summers ( guitar ) - later of The Police - replaced Briggs and McCulloch . <p> By February 1969 these Animals had dissolved and the singles " Ring of Fire " and " River Deep Mountain High " were internationally released . <p> Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from Long Beach , California , called War . <p> Reunions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animals line-up of Burdon , Price , Valentine , Chandler , and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968 . <p> Between 1970 and 1972 several bands toured under the name " The Animals " .

While the album was recorded at his house , Chandler did not play bass for years . They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like " Lonely Avenue " and " Please send me someone to Love " .

Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first , so as to assess their talent .

The performance was a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 15 pounds , which was much more than any other bands were paid . Alan Sytner phoned Whalley a week later and offered the band an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at The Cavern . <p> Before The Cavern Club performance , the band argued amongst themselves about the set list , as rock ' n roll songs were definitely not allowed at the club , but skiffle was tolerated . After starting with a skiffle song , Lennon called for the others to start playing " Do n't Be Cruel " , but banjo-player Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would " eat you alive " , which Lennon ignored and started playing it himself , forcing the others to join in . Halfway through , Sytner pushed his way through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read , " Cut out the bloody rock ' n roll " . <p> Brian Epstein The Beatles ' name was first noticed by Brian Epstein in issues of Mersey Beat ( which he sold in his NEMS music store ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry who they were . The Beatles were featured on the front page of its second issue . <p> On 9 November 1961 , Epstein saw The Beatles for the first time in The Cavern Club . Epstein 's version of the story was that a customer , Raymond Jones , walked into the NEMS shop on Saturday 28 October 1961 and asked Epstein for the " My Bonnie " single the group had recorded with Sheridan . Alistair Taylor later claimed that he used the name of Jones ( a regular customer ) to order the single and paid the deposit himself , knowing that Epstein would notice it , and order further copies . Harry and McCartney later repudiated this story , as Harry had been talking to Epstein about The Beatles for a long time ( being the group he promoted the most in the magazine ) and by McCartney saying , " Brian knew perfectly well who The Beatles were - they were on the front page of the second issue of ' Mersey Beat ' . " Two girls requested the record the following Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the NEMS shop to look into every request that was made , so Epstein talked to contacts of his . He was told that they were playing The Cavern , having just returned from Hamburg , so he went to see them perform . <p> The Beatles - John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , and Pete Best - were due to perform a lunchtime concert in The Cavern Club on 9 November 1961 . Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch The Beatles perform , so Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing , with a welcome message being announced over the club 's public-address system by Bob Wooler , who was the resident DJ . Epstein later talked about the performance : " I was immediately struck by their music , their beat , and their sense of humour on stage - and , even afterwards , when I met them , I was struck again by their personal charm . And it was there that , really , it all started . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dressing room , which he later called " as big as a broom cupboard " , to talk to them . The Beatles , all regular NEMS customers , immediately recognised Epstein , but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance , George Harrison said , " And what brings Mr. Epstein here ? " <p> The Beatles played at The Cavern over the next three weeks , and Epstein was always there to watch them . Epstein contacted their previous manager , Allan Williams , to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them , but Williams advised Epstein " not to touch them with a barge pole " . In a meeting with the group at NEMS on 10 December 1961 , he proposed the idea of managing them . <p> At first , he failed to connect with them , so the band refused to let him manage them ; however , they relented after a short while . The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on 24 January 1962 , which gave Epstein 25% . He then formed the management company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a Jewish manager , so Epstein fitted perfectly . Epstein had told his mother and father that managing The Beatles was only a part-time occupation and would never interfere with the family business . <p> Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management , he had a strong influence on their early dress-code and attitude on stage . When Epstein discovered the band , they wore blue jeans and leather jackets , performing at rowdy rock ' n ' roll shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it , or when an audience member requested a certain song . Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties , insisted that they stop swearing , smoking , drinking or eating onstage , and also suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances . McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein 's ideas , believing it was - in part - due to Epstein 's RADA training . Lennon was against the idea of suits and ties , but later said , " Yeah , man , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody balloon if somebody 's going to pay me " . Epstein also began seeking publicity by " charming and smarming ... the newspaper people " ( as John Lennon would put it in 1972 ) . According to McCartney , " The gigs went up in stature and though the pay went up only a little bit , it did go up " , and that the band was " now playing better places . " Another improvement Epstein made was that the group was now far more organised - having a single diary in which to record bookings , rather than using whoever 's diary was to hand . <p> The Beatles Recording Contract The Beatles were still under contract to Polydor following their Hamburg work with Tony Sheridan for Bert Kaempfert . As Kaempfert was only interested in The Beatles as a back up group for Sheridan , he agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract . This left the band with no recording contract so Epstein made numerous trips to London to visit record companies , but was rejected by many , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famously , Decca . The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan ( ex-drummer of the Shadows ) to produce the studio recordings . While Epstein was negotiating with Decca , he also approached EMI marketing executive Ron White , who later contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley , and Norman Newell , but they all declined to record the group . White could not contact EMI 's fourth staff producer ( George Martin ) as he was on holiday . <p> On 8 February 1962 , Epstein visited an HMV store in Oxford Street , London , to have the Decca audition tape transferred to disc . An HMV technician named Jim Foy liked the recordings , and suggested that Epstein should contact Parlophone 's George Martin . The Beatles were signed by EMI 's small Parlophone label after the group had been rejected by almost every other British record company , and without Martin ever having seen them play live . Martin later explained that Epstein 's enthusiasm , and his conviction that The Beatles would one day become internationally famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audition at Abbey Road Studios which convinced Martin that they were good enough , but with one exception : He felt the recording would be better served by an experienced session drummer in place of Pete Best . When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer , John Lennon , McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein to fire Best from the band . Epstein agonised about the decision , and asked Bob Wooler if it was a good idea , to which Wooler replied that Best was very popular with the fans and they would not like it at all . Ringo Starr took his place , as Starr had previously played with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had previously stepped in to drum with them when Best was i 'll or unable to play .

The basic premise of the automobile is simple ; choose a wheeled vehicle from the many types typically pulled by horses or oxen , add a motor and create a self-propelled , personal transportation vehicle . The earliest ancestor of the modern automobile is probably the Fardier , a three-wheeled , steam-powered , 2.3-mph vehicle built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . This cumbersome machine was never put into production because it was much slower and harder to operate than a horse-drawn vehicle . <p> Amedee Bollee , also a Frenchman , built an improved 12-passenger steam car in 1873 , but the steam engine proved impractical for a machine that was intended to challenge the speed of a horse-and-buggy . The invention of the practical automobile had to await the invention of a workable internal combustion engine . First Automoblie Patent - 1886 The milestone vehicle was built in Germany in 1889 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach . Powered by a 1.5 hp , two-cylinder gasoline engine , it had a four-speed transmission and traveled at 10 mph . Another German , Karl Benz , also built a gasoline-powered car the same year . The gasoline-powered automobile , or motor car , remained largely a curiosity for the rest of the nineteenth century , with only a handful being manufactured in Europe and the United States . The first automobile to be produced in quantity was the 1901 Curved Dash Oldsmobile , which was built in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , and its use of the modern industrial assembly line , is credited to Henry Ford of Detroit , Michigan , who had built his first gasoline-powered car in 1896 . Ford began producing his Model T in 1908 , and by 1927 , when it was discontinued , over 18 million had rolled off the assembly line .

Even after he was supplanted by later characters , Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and , more importantly , the Warners directors , who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles . He is known for his signature line at the end of each short , ' Th-th-th-that 's all folks ! ' The slogan had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of every Looney Tunes cartoon . In contrast , the Merrie Melodies series used the slogan : So Long , Folks ! until the late 1930s when it was replaced with the same one used on the Looney Tunes series . ( When Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , ' And Dat 's De End ! ' ) He is also known for his severe stutter . He often changes his words mid-sentence to correct his stutter . For example , a line like ' what 's going on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - what 's happening ? ' <p> Porky Pig in the Early Films The character was designed by animator Bob Clampett and introduced in the short I Have n't Got a Hat ( first released on March 2 , 1935 ) , directed by Friz Freleng . Studio head Leon Schlesinger suggested that Freleng do a cartoon version of the popular Our Gang films . Porky only has a minor role in the film , but the fat little stuttering pig quickly became popular . Porky 's name came from two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng 's , nicknamed ' Porky ' and ' Piggy . ' <p> Since Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had left the studio in 1933 , taking the studio 's star character Bosko with them , Looney Tunes had been kept afloat by cartoons featuring the bland Buddy . Porky 's introduction ushered Buddy out the door and pointed to things to come . Tex Avery was hired to the studio in 1936 , and his film Gold Diggers of ' 49 reused much of the cast from I Have n't Got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a shy little boy to an immensely fat adult . Though he was still in a supporting role , Porky got most of the laughs . The directors realized they had a star on their hands . <p> Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him , Joe Dougherty , who actually did have a stuttering problem . Because Dougherty could not control his stutter , however , production costs became too high . The versatile Mel Blanc won the audition for the character in 1937 . Blanc continued the stutter ; however , it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect ( such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty . ) Porky 's Duck Hunt was released in 1937 , and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989 . In later interviews , Blanc often made the claim that he intended Porky 's stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs ( although other cartoon pigs do not have such a severe stuttering problem ) .

The directors still did not have a grasp on the character , however ; his appearance , age , and personality all varied from picture to picture . One such cartoon , Porky the Rainmaker , features both a Porky Jr . and a Porky Sr. Bob Clampett finally pinned Porky down , making him cuter , slimmer , smarter , and less of a stutterer . Clampett 's Porky was an innocent traveler , taking in the wonders of the worldand in Clampett 's universe , the world is a very weird place indeed . This principle is perhaps best demonstrated in Porky in Wackyland , a film that sends Porky on a quest to find the last of the Dodos . This cartoon was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry in 2000 . <p> In his commentary as part of the 1970s documentary film , Bugs Bunny : Superstar , Clampett discussed the fact that his early version of Tweety Bird had to be redesigned after his first picture because the producers thought he ' looked naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made of the fact that ' all those years , Porky never wore any pants !

A small telescope resolves these clouds as either black regions on the sky where background stars are blocked out or as glowing nebula in the case of those clouds that are illuminated by very bright stars .

Perhaps a supernova shockwave or the wind from a massive star triggers it off , but once it starts the collapse proceeds until something stops it .

Click on a clipart sample picture to view the clipart at its full size and proper dimensions . <p> Computer Keyboards - The Invention , History and How Keyboards Work The invention of the modern computer keyboard began with the invention of the typewriter . Christopher Latham Sholes patented the typewriter that we commonly use today in 1868 . The Remington Company mass marketed the first typewriters starting in 1877 . <p> Inventions Leading to the Computer Keyboard A few key technological developments created the transition of the typewriter into the computer keyboard . The teletype machine , introduced in the 1930s , combined the technology of the typewriter ( used as an input and a printing device ) with the telegraph . Elsewhere , punched card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keypunches . Keypunches were the basis of early adding machines and IBM was selling over one million dollars worth of adding machines in 1931 . Early computer keyboards were first adapted from the punch card and teletype technologies . In 1946 , the Eniac computer used a punched card reader as its input and output device . In 1948 , the Binac computer used an electromechanically controlled typewriter to both input data directly onto magnetic tape ( for feeding the computer data ) and to print results . The emerging electric typewriter further improved the technological marriage between the typewriter and the computer . <p> Video Display Terminals By 1964 , MIT , Bell Laboratories and General Electric had collaborated to create a computer system called Multics ; a time sharing , multi-user system . Multics encouraged the development of a new user interface , the video display terminal . The video display terminals ( VDT ) combined the technology of the cathode ray tube used in televisions and electric typewriters . Computer users could now see what text they were typing on their display screens making text easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and use . <p> Computer Keyboards Send Direct Electronic Impulses Earlier computer keyboards had been based either on teletype machines or keypunches . There were many electromechanical steps in transmitting data between the keyboard and the computer that slowed things down . With VDT technology and electric keyboards , the keyboard 's keys could now send electronic impulses directly to the computer and save time . By the late 70s and early 80s , all computers used electronic keyboards and VDTs . Nevertheless , the layout of the computer keyboard still owes its origin to the inventor of the first typewriter , Christopher Latham Sholes who also invented the QWERTY layout . However , the computer keyboard does have a few extra function keys .

Icons have been used to supplement the normal alphanumerics of the computer . Modern computers now can handle bitmapped graphics on the display terminal , so the icons are widely used to assist users . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfaces easier for novices to grasp in the 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center facility . Icon-driven interfaces were later popularized by the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating environments . <p> A computer icon usually ranges from 16 by 16 pixels up to 128 by 128 pixels . Some operating systems feature icons up to 512 by 512 pixels . When the graphical output device has a smaller size , the icon size is small . Vision-impaired users ( due to such conditions as poor lighting , tired eyes , medical impairments , bright backgrounds , or color blindness ) may need to utilize the self-selected icon size options . <p> The Icon 's Role in Interaction with the User icons may represent a file , folder , application or device on a computer operating system . In modern usage today , the icon can represent anything that the users want it to : any macro command or process , mood-signaling , or any other indicator . User friendliness also demands error-free operation , where the icons are distinct from each other , self-explanatory , and easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be found on the desktop , toolbars and in the menus of computer application software such as Microsoft Word . Icons are made more user-friendly by being very distinct from every other icon . Each icon set may also have unifying features that reveal that similar icons are related to each other . Icons commonly show those traits in manners such as these : <p> Virtually every major computer operating system has the ability to use an icon-based graphical user interface ( GUI ) to display information to end users ; this is evident in the usage of the term " icon " in the WIMP computing paradigm ( for Windows , Icons , Menu , Pointers ) . <p> Function or Program Icons On this screen , icons are used in many ways : to represent files , folders and disk drives , as toolbar buttons , and to illustrate menu items and taskbar items . <p> Most computer functions in a GUI are represented by a function icon . Placing the cursor on the icon , and clicking ( or double-clicking ) a mouse , trackball or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of a good function icon can be considered an art form in itself , comparable to that practiced in the past in the domain of miniature painting by old masters such as Joseph Severn and Charles-Francois Daubigny . <p> The icon must be original , distinctive and tiny . It must be useful on a wide variety of monitors set at different resolutions . This work is further complicated by the need to create several sets of function icons for several types of views in several types of operating systems , for any given program . For instance , the GUI guidelines in one operating system might specify the need to create sets of 16 , 32 , and 48 pixel icons for any program while the GUI guidelines in another system might specify sets of 16 , 24 , 48 and 96 pixel icons .

( When Bugs Bunny was the closing character , he would break the pattern by simply saying , ' And Dat 's De End ! ' ) He is also known for his severe stutter .

Because Dougherty could not control his stutter , however , production costs became too high . The versatile Mel Blanc won the audition for the character in 1937 . Blanc continued the stutter ; however , it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect ( such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty . ) Porky 's Duck Hunt was released in 1937 , and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989 .

Client demands , changing customer preferences and desire to present a " fresh face " for pre-existing content often result in the need to dramatically modify the public appearance of web content while disrupting the underlying infrastructure as little as possible . <p> The distinction between " presentation " ( front end ) and " business logic " ( infrastructure ) is usually an important one , because : the presentation source code language may differ from other code assets ; the production process for the application may require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; different workers have different skill sets , and presentation skills do not always coincide with skills for coding business logic ; code assets are easier to maintain and more readable when disparate components are kept separate and loosely coupled . <p> The Importance of Reusability in Website Templates Not all potential users of website templates have the willingness and ability to hire developers to design a system for their needs . Additionally , some may wish to use the web but have limited or no technical proficiency . For these reasons , a number of developers and vendors have released web templates specifically for reuse by non-technical people . Although website template reusability is also important for even highly-skilled and technically experienced developers , it is especially critical to those who rely on simplicity and ready-made website templates / web solutions . <p> Such ready-made , pre-made or ' instant website ' web templates are sometimes free , often made by an individual domestically . However , specialized web templates are sometimes sold online . Although there are numerous commercial sites that offer web templates for a licensing fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Nifter.com , for example , provides a large selection of website templates that can be downloaded and used in website designs absolutely free . For many people this is the ultimate solution . <p> Open Source Website Templates The rise of the open source design movement has seen a slow but steady rise in the community of open source designers . Some sites offer open source templates in addition to other content . For the vast majority of people who do not have the time , desire or skills to create their own templates , a site offering free downloadable website templates such as Nifter.com is not only a viable , but easy and highly useful solution .
