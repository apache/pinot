@@105435449 @835449/ 98118 @qwx958118 <h> The Importance of Anti-Allergy Vacuum Cleaner <p> Professional carpet cleanings are the most effective solution to minimizing allergy symptons . However , the quarterly cleanings alone are not enough . You will want to find a reliable anti-allergy vacuum cleaner for your daily cleaning to help keep your allergy symptons at bay in between professional cleanings . You should also purchase household items that have anti-allergy materials , as well . The process will help make your home as comfortable as possible for those that suffer from seasonal and year-round allergies . <h> How to Choose the Best Vacuum Cleaners for Allergies <p> Allergies and breathing problems are common among people in the United States . Approximately 55 percent of the people in the U.S. have either asthma or allergies . Some of the most common allergies that people have are allergies to pet dander , dust mites and ragweed . Ragweed is commonly found outside , but pet dander and dust mites are household allergens . <p> Part of the solution to keeping one 's allergies at bay is purchasing equipment and products that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner with a HEPA filter is one of the most important items that an allergic person can have in the home for their daily cleaning routine because it can reduce the number of allergens in the air significantly . Therefore , if you or someone in your household suffers from allergies , you will benefit from researching to find the best possible vacuum cleaner . <p> There are many different vacuum cleaners on the market , all with different features and prices . Determining your budget will be the first step in the process of narrowing down the choices . Allergy-friendly vacuum cleaners can be basic , or they can cost several hundred dollars . The qualities and features you would look for in a vacuum cleaner for allergies are as follows : <h> A HEPA Filter <p> The acronym HEPA stands for high-efficiency particulate air . The HEPA filter is a microporous filter that traps small particles of dust , dander and debris . Vacuum cleaners that are unequipped with HEPA filters tend to circulate these particles back into the air . The HEPA filter can trap and store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aggravate an allergic person 's immune system . - - <h> Anti-Allergen Seals <p> Anti-allergen seals are a special technology that goes well with HEPA filters . They keep the canister locked tightly as to trap all the dust , debris and particles . A shopper will want to look for units that have the filters and good seals because the combination can decrease the number of asthmatic or allergic reactions . <h> Strong Suction Technology <p> The amount of suction that a vacuum cleaner has is highly important to its ability to lift the allergens from the carpet . You will want to look for a unit that has suction controls . Units with suction control usually have more power than ones that do not come with such a control . Another option is to read the description of many units and look for ones that boast about the suction strength . Manufacturers measure suction strength by Airwatts . <h> Low Emissions <p> You will want to search for a vacuum cleaner that has low emissions . This rating relates back to the HEPA filter and the seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner while the person is vacuuming . A unit must have tight craftsmanship and high-tech seals to reduce the amount of emissions that it produces . <h> Using a Comparison Tool to Choose a Vacuum Cleaner <p> A comparison tool is a website that offers a side-by-side look at several units . You can compare characteristics of a vacuum cleaner such as the price , consumer ratings , voltage , tools , exhaust filter , sizing , suction power and the like . Consumer ratings and reviews are important when evaluating a range of vacuum cleaners . You will want to pay close attention to any negative complaints and not purchase a unit that has several of them . Taking the time to explore and find the best unit for the job will keep the whole family healthier in the end . <h> Professional Carpet Cleaners for Allergic Reaction Deduction <p> While vacuuming regularly can help those with allergies , you will want your carpet cleaned by a reliable professional carpet cleaner to extract deeply embedded dirt , bacteria and allergens that regular vacuuming ca n't reach . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , draperies and blinds also . <p> When choosing a professional carpet cleaner , it 's important to know that not all cleaning methods are the same or provide the same results in removing household allergens . Chem-Dry , for example , uses a proprietary Hot Carbonation Extraction cleaning process that has been independently tested by a leading air quality laboratory and proven to remove an average of 98% of common household allergens from the carpets and upholstery we clean . And when a sanitizer was added , Chem-Dry removed an average of 89% of the bacteria in the air. * <p> So for the best way to keep allergy symptons at bay , vacuum daily with a good quality anti-allergy vacuum cleaner and have your carpets professionally cleaned every 3-4 months . And remember , Chem-Dry 's proprietary Hot Carbonating Extraction ( HCE ) cleaning process provides a deeper , longer-last clean for a healthier home . 98114 @qwx958114 98119 @qwx958119 98125 @qwx958125 <p> Email * <p> - 98121 @qwx958121

They even use up to date payment processing with their ipads ! <p> Lea J. <p> Called them prior to Yelp , we were weary because we got the money mailers and were afraid of scams . Used them the first time and they were so good ( and honest ! ) that we have had them come back ever since , especially when we see the same guys coming to our house- it feels so much better when that happens . I hate when you call any company and they send different people out every time . Carpets turned out good as new ! Used them for the business as well since they did so good at our house . One huge recommendation : Ask for Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and professional too ) He is the best guy they have ! They have done an awesome job and they take on every project we give them , including scotch guarding our trailer couch and cushions- totally worth the extra money for the upgrades of stain protection and such . The carpets stay clean long after , and they have even given us little stain remover canisters too so we can clean up little spots easier in between . Highly recommend ! <p> Had Todd and rudy come out and clean my 2 story house house in laguna . They did a awesome job . Price was great , carpet and tile look brand new .

However , these products can be toxic , overwhelmingly pungent , in addition to leaving behind a slick , oily residue of their own . You do n't want to have to clean off your cleaning products , right ? - Instead of using these products , use vinegar .

Afterwards , run the machine with plain water two or three times to ensure that there is no trace of the vinegar left over . Not only will this keep your machine running smoothly , but your coffee will taste fresher . <h> 7 .

But , just like an air filter , carpets become full over time and must be properly cleaned to remain most effective at trapping particulates as they settle from the air . <p> You can ensure healthier indoor air in your home by keeping your carpets clean and in good condition through regular vacuuming and having your carpets , rugs and upholstery professionally cleaned every 3 " 4 months to clean out the trapped allergens . However , not all carpet cleaning services are alike. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chem-Dry wanted to find out how effective our cleaning process is in eliminating allergens from your home . So we commissioned a leading independent air quality laboratory to conduct a study using Chem-Dry 's Hot Carbonating Extraction ( HCE ) process in multiple homes . The lab found that Chem-Dry removes an average of 98.1% of common household allergens from the carpets and upholstery we clean . The common allergens we tested include cat and dog dander and dust mite allergen . <p> This means there are less allergens in your home to trigger an attack . And because we use 80% less water than typical steam cleaning , there is no excess water left behind to cause mold or mildew issues and a shorter dry time of only a few hours .

Yet ..... it got better ! Kathy sent an amazing technician ( Eric ) , who was not only professional ( so timely , nice to my doorman , won me over instantly ) , but this guy explained every step he was taking , showing me ' before and after ' and was just SO nice and smiley .

She reassured me the price would n't change unless I added on other things to be cleaned . Sure enough when the workers arrived they asked me to show them what I wanted cleaned , confirmed it was all listed on their invoice , got my signature and started working .
