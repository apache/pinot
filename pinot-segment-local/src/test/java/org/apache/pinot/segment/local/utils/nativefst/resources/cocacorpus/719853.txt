The Natchez Trace Parkway , which runs 444 miles from Natchez to Nashville , is more than 8,000 years old . Originally " traced out " by buffalo , the road was then traveled by traders , missionaries , early settlers , and Indians . Our Civil War history comes alive in Vicksburg , Port Gibson , and Natchez .

It begins in prehistoric times , when vast herds of buffalo trampled and " traced " out a route known as the Natchez Trace .

The Magnolia State continued to leave its imprint on America , playing a pivotal role in the Civil War and later serving as the setting for some of the landmark events in the struggle for Civil Rights . Today , Mississippi is regarded as a unique and rich intersection of history , architecture , commerce , culture , and the arts . <h> African-American History <h> African-American History <p> African-American history in Mississippi is older than the state itself . The earliest African-Americans were brought here as slaves before statehood in 1817 . <p> Less than a half-century after Mississippi was granted statehood , the nation erupted in Civil War .

William Grant Still of Woodville , a prolific and respected classical composer , became the first African-American to conduct a major American symphony orchestra and the first to have a symphonic composition performed by a major orchestra .
