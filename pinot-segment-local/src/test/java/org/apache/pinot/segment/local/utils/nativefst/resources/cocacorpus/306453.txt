But the good news is that endorphins , also known as the " feel-good " chemicals in the brain , are naturally produced and regulated by the body , that is when the body is functioning in proper balance . If your body feels out of balance and you need a good pick-me-up , here are eight ways to naturally boost your endorphin levels : <p> 1 ) Look for ways to laugh every day . They say laughter is the best medicine , and studies have confirmed that people who laugh more tend to feel less stressed and anxious .

It seems to pop up on almost every list of ways to improve health , but nothing gets those endorphins flowing like exercise , and particularly group exercise . A 2009 study found that college crews who rowed together had a significantly increased rush of endorphins compared to those rowing alone . The same is true for other activities , like weight-lifting , dancing , aerobics and swimming . <p> 4 ) Touch and be touched .

A popular herb in traditional Chinese medicine , ginseng helps regulate the production of stress hormones by supporting the health and vitality of the organs that produce them .

Spicy peppers contain a chemical compound known as capsaicin that binds to the pain receptors of nerve cells in both the nose and mouth , sending special nerve signals to the brain that trigger the release of endorphins . This would explain the " high " that many people feel when eating spicy foods , and what keeps them continually coming back for more . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

As reported by- Health Magazine:2 " A Spanish study , published in the- International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism , 3- found that trained athletes who took in caffeine pre-exercise burned about 15 percent more calories for three hours post-exercise , compared to those who ingested a placebo . <p> The dose that triggered the effect was 4.5 mg of caffeine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 kg ) , that 's roughly 300 mg of caffeine , the amount in about 12 ounces of brewed coffee , a quantity you may already be sipping each morning .

Besides providing you with a temporary metabolic boost , other functional benefits of a pre-workout cup of coffee include : <p> Improved micro-circulation . According to- Health Magazine , Japanese researchers recently discovered that people who were not regular coffee drinkers experienced a 30 percent boost in capillary blood flow after drinking five ounces of regular coffee , compared to those drinking decaf . Improved blood circulation typically equates to improved oxygenation of your tissues , which may boost your- exercise- performance . <p> Pain reduction. - The featured article notes research from the University of Illinois , which found that a caffeine dose equivalent to two or three cups of coffee taken one hour prior to a half-hour-long workout reduced the participants level of perceived muscle pain . This pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder , which is important during high intensity exercises . <p> Research from the University of Georgia , published in the March 2007 issue of- The Journal of Pain , 4- reported very similar findings .

A 2005 meta-analysis5- concluded that caffeine can reduce your perceived level of exertion by more than five percent " effectively making your exercise feel " easier . " Moreover , caffeine improved exercise performance by more than 11 percent , which appears to be related to the reduction in perceived level of exertion . <p> Muscle preservation .

Besides the brain , BDNF also expresses itself in your muscles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your muscle . Without the neuromotor , your muscle is like an engine without ignition .

In that study , they found that caffeine helped offset age-related loss of muscle strength , again suggesting that caffeine may help preserve your muscles as you age , and reduce your risk of injuries . <p> Improved memory . BDNF also activates brain stem cells to convert into new neurons in your brain , which can have definitive benefits for your brain function .

You can easily eliminate any health benefits that coffee might provide by adding milk , creamer , sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , while some of the studies noted above used caffeine opposed to coffee , I agree with experts like Ori who warn that caffeine in isolation could be quite toxic . <p> Its important to remember that the natural blend of polyphenol- antioxidants- ( including chlorogenic acids ) , bioflavonoids , vitamins and minerals in coffee beans all work together to help neutralize the harsher effects of the caffeine.7 <p> Recent research from the University of Oslo , Norway , reveals that whole coffee possesses potent anti-inflammatory chemo-protective and anti-aging properties . Coffee has shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatory pathway NFk+ , which has been directly linked to inflammation , certain cancers and accelerated muscle aging . <p> Note that NFk+ is inhibited by certain phenols in coffee rather than caffeine . This indicates again the superior health and muscle preserving qualities of whole coffee over caffeine alone . <p> There are literally thousands of different natural chemical compounds in your brew , and science now suggests the synergy between them can pack a nice nutritional punch . You 're not likely to get this synergetic effect from caffeinated supplements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the primary considerations and caveats will be discussed in the following sections . <h> Limit Your Consumption to One or Two Cups Per Day <p> Ori recommends having just one cup of coffee or one shot of espresso in the morning or before training , perhaps another cup during work and that 's it for the day . Coffee is a potent substance , and can have an adverse effect on your adrenal glands if consumed in excess . If you 're stressed , coffee can actually help you resist fatigue , hunger and hardship but you can overdo it ; drinking a whole pot of coffee is going to put you at risk for adrenal exhaustion . Also make sure you 're properly hydrated , as coffee has a diuretic effect . <p> Caffeine can also cause a process in your brain called glutamate re-uptake inhibition , meaning it inhibits the cellular re-uptake of glutamate " an excitoneurotransmitter essential for keeping you alert . Like other neurotransmitters , glutamate must be tightly regulated.If your caffeine intake is too high and chronic , such as due to ingestion of caffeinated energy drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Morning , Before Exercise , Not After <p> When used- before- exercise , coffee will give you a good boost , and will work to accelerate the benefits of exercise ; stimulating energy production and fat burning . However , - after- exercise your body needs a recovery meal , - not- caffeine , which will inhibit the mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) ; the mechanism that increases protein synthesis in your muscle . You do not build musclewhile- exercising . Muscle building occurs afterward , so if your goal is to gain muscle mass , you do- not- want mTOR to be inhibited by caffeine <p> That being said , if your main goal is to lean down and maximize fat burning , having coffee after exercise might be exactly what you need , as it will keep you burning fat while breaking down fat stores for energy . The post exercise coffee will continue mimicking the effects of exercise on your body for as long as you continue fasting ; that 's until your next meal . If you exercise in the evening , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it can seriously disrupt your sleep cycle by keeping you alert well into the night . <p> Freshly ground organic coffee beans can be viewed as a nutritionally valuable whole food with neuroprotective properties . Decaffeinated coffee will not provide you with all these whole food benefits , as the antioxidant bioflavonoids are largely lost in the processing . So opt for " regular " if you 're going to drink coffee . <p> Also , opt for whole coffee beans and grind them just prior to brewing your coffee . Most coffee available today is already rancid , or close to it , by the time you get it home . This is because the rate of rancidity increases dramatically once you grind the beans . A coffee that does n't  have a good aroma or taste is most likely stale and nutritionally useless . <p> Last but not least , choose organic coffee , as conventionally grown coffee beans are among the most heavily sprayed crops on the market , and pesticides will certainly not do your health any favors . To ensure compliance with organic industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have trouble finding organic coffee in your local grocery store , check online , as there are many organic coffees available .

Here , making any definitive recommendations becomes quite tricky <p> In general , it has been shown that when it comes to the health benefits of organic whole-bean black coffee , the darker the roast , the better.8- Its often the case that foods with the darkest pigments offer the most robust benefits to health , and- dark roast coffee , such as French or Italian Roast , or roasts used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exception . <p> Roasted coffees are higher in neuroprotective agents than green ( unroasted ) coffees . For example , a study in- Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research9- found that dark roast coffee restored blood levels of the antioxidants vitamin E and glutathione more effectively than light roast coffee . The dark roast also led to a significant body weight reduction in pre-obese volunteers , whereas the lighter roast did not . Other studies have shown that dark roast coffee produces more of a chemical called N-methylpyridinium , which helps prevent your stomach from producing excess acid , so darker roast coffee may be easier on your stomach than lighter roast coffee.10 <p> That said , the process of roasting will also produce- acrylamide " a toxic byproduct created when you expose a food to high heat .

The bright white ones , which most people use , are chlorine bleached and some of this chlorine will be extracted from the filter during the brewing process and they are also full of dangerous disinfection by products like dioxin . Also be careful about the coffee container and coffee cups you use .

One of the most effective tools for making coffee is good old French press . All you need is to put the freshly ground coffee inside , add hot water and press down . The coffee that you get is highly aromatic and pure with no plastics or chemicals involved . <h> Avoid Coffee While Pregnant <p> For all the potential health benefits of coffee , it is- not- advisable to drink- coffee during pregnancy , even if its organic . Caffeine easily passes through both the blood brain barrier and the placenta , and its also transferred through breast milk .

It has many functions which include helping the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses . Zinc also plays a role in the synthesis of proteins and DNA , the genetic material in all cells . During pregnancy , infancy , and childhood , the body needs zinc to grow and develop properly . Zinc also helps wounds to heal and is important for proper senses of taste and smell . <p> Copper Taking large quantities of zinc ( 50 mg/day or more ) over a period of weeks can interfere with copper bioavailability . High intake of zinc induces the intestinal synthesis of a copper-binding protein called metallothionein . Metallothionein traps copper within intestinal cells and prevents its systemic absorption .

One study showed that increasing the calcium intake by 890 mg/day in the form of milk or calcium phosphate ( total calcium intake , 1,360 mg/day ) reduced zinc absorption and zinc balance in postmenopausal women , but increasing the calcium intake of adolescent girls by 1,000 mg/day in the form of calcium citrate malate ( total calcium intake , 1,667 mg/day ) did not affect zinc absorption or balance .

Determine Your Personal Sleep Quotient ( PSQ ) <p> Pick a bedtime when you 're likely to fall asleep quickly , and make sure its at least eight hours before you need to get up . Keep to this bedtime for the next week and note when you wake up each morning . If you need an alarm to wake up , if its difficult to get out of bed or if you 're tired during the day , eight hours is n't enough sleep for you . Move your bedtime up by 15 or 30 minutes the next week . Continue doing this each week until you awaken without an alarm and feel alert all day . When you determine what you think is an ideal bedtime , cut 15 minutes off it to see if you 're sleepy the next day . If so , add those 15 minutes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attention to What You Eat and Drink <p> Do n't  go to bed either hungry or stuffed . Your discomfort might keep you up . Also limit how much you drink before bed , to prevent disruptive middle-of-the-night trips to the toilet . <p> Nicotine , caffeine and alcohol deserve caution , too . The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine which take hours to wear off can wreak havoc with quality sleep . And even though alcohol might make you feel sleepy at first , it can disrupt sleep later in the night . <p> 3 . Limit Daytime Naps <p> Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep especially if you 're struggling with insomnia or poor sleep quality at night . If you choose to nap during the day , limit yourself to about 10 to 30 minutes and make it during the mid afternoon . <p> If you work nights , you 'll need to make an exception to the rules about daytime sleeping . In this case , keep your window coverings closed so that sunlight which adjusts your internal clock does n't  interrupt your daytime sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Routine <p> Exercise raises endorphin levels to deepen sleep and make it more efficient and restful . Timing is important , though . The best time to exercise is n't " early morning " an extra hour of sleep does more for your health than running around in a half-awake state . The best time to work out is 5-7 p.m . Exercising at these times is more likely to enhance your nighttime sleep . But avoid strenuous exercise ( except pleasurable sex ! ) within three hours of bedding down . That 's because exercise elevates core body temperature for five to six hours . In order to feel drowsy and stimulate the release of melatonin , body temperature needs to be dropping . <p> 5 . Manage Stress <p> When you have too much to do and too much to think about your sleep is likely to suffer . To help restore peace to your life , consider healthy ways to manage stress . Start with the basics , such as getting organized , setting priorities and delegating tasks . Give yourself permission to take a break when you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before bed , jot down what 's on your mind and then set it aside for tomorrow . <p> 6 . Stick to a Sleep Schedule <p> Go to bed and get up at the same time every day , even on weekends , holidays and days off . Being consistent reinforces your bodys sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night . There 's a caveat , though . If you do n't  fall asleep within about 15 minutes , get up and do something relaxing . Go back to bed when you 're tired . If you agonize over falling asleep , you might find it even tougher to nod off . <p> 7 . Create a Bedtime Ritual <p> Do the same things each night to tell your body its time to wind down . This might include taking a warm bath or shower , reading a book , or listening to soothing music preferably with the lights dimmed . Relaxing activities can promote better sleep by easing the transition between wakefulness and drowsiness . <p> Be wary of using the TV or other electronic devices as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or other media use before bedtime interferes with sleep . <p> 8 . Get Comfortable <p> Create a room that 's ideal for sleeping . Often , this means cool , dark and quiet . Consider using room-darkening shades , earplugs , a fan or other devices to create an environment that suits your needs . <p> Your mattress and pillow can contribute to better sleep , too . Since the features of good bedding are subjective , choose what feels most comfortable to you . If you share your bed , make sure there 's enough room for two . If you have children or pets , set limits on how often they sleep with you or insist on separate sleeping quarters . <p> 9 . Give Yourself Time to Wake Up <p> Even with adequate rest , do n't  expect to wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed , as the cliche goes . Your body is designed to gradually become more alert , reaching a high point in late morning and again in the late afternoon or early evening . So if you need to be at your best first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 10 . Make Up for Lost Sleep As Soon as Possible <p> Every two hours of wakefulness requires a repayment of one hour of sleep . Catch up on sleep by going to bed earlier rather than sleeping later . Do n't  try to make up for large sleep losses during the week by sleeping in on the weekend . This is like trying to get fit or lose weight by doing all your exercising or dieting on Saturdays and Sundays . If you sleep until noon on Sundays , you wont be very tired come your regular bedtime and you 'll have to crawl to work with the Monday-morning blahs . <p> 11 . Buzz Off : Avoid Caffeine After 2 p.m . <p> Its the magic bullet that allows " sleepy you " to make it through the day the most widely used drug in the world . Unfortunately , its also a major cause of insomnia . Any coffee ( or caffeinated tea , soda , energy drink or chocolate bar ) after 2 p.m. will probably disrupt your sleep . Caffeine has a half-life of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half the caffeine is still in your body . <p> 12 . Last Call : Avoid Alcohol Three Hours Before Bed <p> Many people believe that a nightcap facilitates sleep , but that 's a tired old wives tale . Alcohol is not a sedative . A drink after work or with dinner is fine because your body will have plenty of time to absorb the alcohol . But if you drink within three hours of bedtime , it will damage the quality of your rest . <p> 13 . Cool Off : Set the Thermostat at 65 Degrees <p> This is the ideal sleeping temperature . If you 're used to it being sauna-like , reduce the temperature gradually . A bedroom that 's too warm can even induce nightmares . If 65 degrees feels frigid , add a blanket , night cap , pair of socks , a special friend or a warm puppy . <p> 14 . Dim the Lights : Use 45-Watt to 65-Watt Bulbs <p> Light is one of the most powerful cues for initiating and maintaining wakefulness . The lighting in your bedroom should provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures . Choose low-wattage , tungsten bulbs . Use a small lamp with a dimmer for reading in bed . Gradually lowering the brightness will fatigue your eyes and promote drowsiness . <p> 15 . Shut Out the Light <p> Once the lights are out , make sure your bedroom is as dark as possible . If city lights are shining through a curtain or shade , try blackout drapes . If light from a bathroom or hall is sneaking under the door , cover the crack with a rolled-up towel . Wearing an eye mask is another alternative . <p> 16 . Dress for Rest or Wear Nothing at All <p> Soft , loose-fitting , breathable garments are ideal . Do not wear nightclothes that are too light or heavy for the season . Cotton is a great choice for nightwear because its comfortable and it breathes . When the weather ( or the situation ) warrants , by all means try sleeping in the nude . Its conducive to great sleep . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Depending on where you live , there are still , at least , a few months left of cold , dreary weather and for too many people that means a few more months of cold and flu season . <p> I often used to get sick every month and get completely knocked out by colds and flu .

This post from The Mind Unleashed creates awareness about the features of this matrix and unveils six steps for you to free yourself from the Matrix of your daily life . <p> The virtual reality introduced in the Matrix films is generated by a computer , and the people live in this artificially created reality . If you spend some time and pay attention to the reality of your everyday life , you will find a stunning discovery . Because our everyday reality shows a great deal of resemblance to movie 's virtual reality . Our virtual reality may not be generated by a computer , but by our mind , our constantly flowing thoughts and emotions . And so we are living in the imprisonment of our thoughts and feelings ' matrix . Let 's see what features this matrix has and how to get rid of them . <h> 1 . Step . The World of Permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are attracted by money , power , prestige , a wholesome , happy life . All this lies there hidden behind the powerful iron gate that is towering in front of us . <p> Spurred by our ambitions , we pursue various goals all through our lives . We aspire for something all the time , we always want to achieve something . This restless rush is instigated by our fear that we are still not what we want to be . We are never satisfied , we always want something else , we would like to be better , more beautiful , richer than we are at present . <p> That is how we pursue our goals until death , when we realize how meaningless the whole thing has been . But why are these goals meaningless , we begin to protest immediately . The protest is caused by the vary nature of the forms and shapes , as in their world every form and shape is subject to permanent change , birth and death . Whatever we attract to us , we are going to lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who pursue their goals , live in the spell of past and future . <h> 2 . Step . The spiritual Seeking <p> We , however , wish to find the security of permanence in our life . We would like to find what is beyond the world of constant change . In order to do so , we become spiritual seekers . <p> As a first step of spiritual seeking we start to look for enlightenment , Self-recognition in the world of shapes and forms ( that is , outside ourselves ) in the hope of thus reaching the state of permanent happiness . We intend to find a dogma , a great Master , an elevating spiritual experience that expands our Consciousness . If it is not found here on Earth , we will be looking for it in the other world , in the heaven of a religion . <p> We use the mind as a mean of spiritual search . It is through the mind that the Ego intends to understand what is beyond mind and forms . The mind in this way prepares the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The mental images are born through the comprehensive process of the mind . For comprehension , we also require information , so we shall gather bits of information like a busy ant . From books on religion and spirituality , lectures heard and conversations attended , we are attempting to screen information , ideas , opinions and experience necessary for them . The same takes place with spiritual experience . We assume that if we gather a sufficient amount of experience , as a result we will reach a certain point , we will increase their spirituality . <p> These mental images motivate us to make efforts at implementing the mental images at the level of daily life , to make these images the cornerstones of our life . Achieving spiritual objectives , however , affords only momentary satisfaction for us , so after achieving one specific goal , relentlessness returns , urging us to start working for new objectives . The mind produces new mental images , and seeking starts all over again . <h> 3 . Step . The Stop <p> We then go on seeking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally recognize its true nature.We stop and abandon spiritual seeking . We recognize that all the objectives we have so far been looking for outside ourselves , are only found within ourselves . <p> We will stop when we recognize the activities of the mind and refuse to follow it any longer . We realize that with the help of the mind we will not be able to surpass the mind . We will experience that stopping is the inactive moment of the mind , the silence between thoughts . In that silence , we will experience the Consciousness without forms , and recognize that we are in fact the Presence without thoughts . We then leave behind the spiritual seeker , with all the accumulated knowledge and lofty spiritual experience . <h> 4 . Step . The Inner Journey <p> This is the beginning of an inner journey which takes us out from the matrix , beyond the mind . Once we have started our journey , we leave the world behind and abandon everything that has hampered us in our progress . We give up unimportant things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important ones . That is possible by means of a major mental clean-up . <p> When- we begin doing that clean-up in earnest , we will soon face the vast multitude of our thoughts , opinions , ideas and the emotions attached to all these . After a period of time , we realize that we need to abandon all the unimportant things and trivialities , since these things will be found false in the light of our inner journey . Then we find ourselves all alone , and realize , that we still have not finished . We are still to she 'd the shadow that we believed to be ourself . <p> But if we examine that space closer , we find that it is full of Consciousness , which is the inner peace , quiet and tranquility . We then realize that we are at home . Whatever now happens in that internal space , we must experience that . We must experience whatever life has to offer , there and then in that specific moment . The next moment does not need to bear the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question then arises : have we already got rid of the matrix ? The emptiness is perfect , but we still must take the last step in order to be completely free . <h> 6 . Step . Comeback <p> That step will take us to the point where our entire journey began . We return to the Matrix , to the world of daily life . We , however , return in a state different from the one in which we departed , since we have undergone considerable changes during our journey . The Mind , the Ego and , together with it , selfishness vanished from ourselves . The emptiness , pulsating with life , and the Consciousness , awakened to its own existence , continue to stay with us . <p> In this way the world will be entirely different for us . We no longer feel en urge to run away from it , and we do not submerge in the swamp of identifying with the world . We are now free from all that , and the world is now a new adventure for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we merge with the Universe . In the meanwhile , we help others in awakening and we share the joy of existence and sympathy with everyone we encounter during our spiritual journey . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

TV dinners and prepackaged chicken nuggets are so convenient and " perfect " for the kidsright ? Cute little cupcakes , crunchy doodles , sprinkles on ice cream look so dainty and fun , but these may contain ingredients that add no nutritional value , and can actually harm us . <p> 1 . Refined Flour and Other Grains <p> Eliminatewhite flour as much as possible . Let 's not get religious . If more than half of the grains in your diet are whole grains , your body will be able to handle a taste of French bread dipped in olive oil with your salad . But do n't  be fooled . The modern process of making wheat to white flour renders it nutritionally empty , with a fraction of a fraction of its life force remaining . <p> White bread along with other refined grains such rice , converts rapidly to sugar in the body , spiking insulin levels , and can leave you crashed and hungry soon after . Further , manufacturers actually add small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , benzoyl peroxide or potassium bromate . <p> Along comes alloxan , a byproduct of the chemical processing . You should know that alloxan is used in research labs to induce diabetes in healthy mice . <p> Eating lots of white flour and refined grain products is associated with diabetes , heart disease , obesity , the development of gluten intolerance and vitamin deficiencies . Some bread makers color white bread brown by adding molasses or other colorants , so check the numbers and read the ingredients . <p> 2 . " Health " Foods &amp; Snacks <p> Always check the label.In this wild world we live in , there is such a thing as healthy food imposters. 1 This is what Gussow was talking about . The package looks so earthy and appealing , but the fine print confesses : its a food that lies . <p> Consider cereals advertised as a good source of fiber and enriched with vitamins and minerals . With all that healthy-hype , most of us take it at face value and bite . But look past the fatade to the label and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined sugar , sucralose , high fructose corn syrup , modified corn starch and BHT , too . <p> Be careful of so-called nutritional snack bars . These are the candy bars in the nutrition aisle claiming to be high in protein , **27;0;TOOLONG , packed with vitamins and minerals , and the like . Some of them are great . Some popular bars are packed with chemical additives , artificial flavors , unhealthy fats , and weird chemical compounds . I do n't  want us to be overly crabby , just wise . Know what you are and are n't  looking to put in your beautiful body , and check the labels . <p> 3 . Processed or Deli Meats <p> " Avoid . " If the meats been smoked , salted , cured or contains any other preservatives , its a processed meat . That includes deli meats like ham and bologna ; hot dogs ; and bacon . According to the AICR , " Research shows that any amount of processed meat is linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer . " The AICR recommends that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food suggestions to replace processed meats . 2 <p> 4 . Artificial Coloring <p> Eliminate . Studies have shown a linkage between children with ADHD and artificial food coloring . Most agree that there are other factors , with some more vehemently demanding further studies , believing that food dyes have more impact than we yet understand . Research has shown a decline in ADHD symptoms when children switched to a diet free of artificial colors. 3 <p> Encyclopedia Brittanica weighs in on the discussion about dyes , which " became the focus of controversy in the 1950s because the excessive use of certain dyes produced illness . " Since then the FDA has " disallowed " at least 9 artificial colors due to proven toxicity , and more are under review . Red 3 , for instance , has been proven a thyroid carcinogen and is banned from cosmetics , but is permitted in internal drugs as well as foods . Red 40 may be causing immune-system tumors in mice . Yellow 6 has caused adrenal tumors in animals . It seems this is an unnecessary risk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion <p> Rather than trying to negotiate how much toxicity we can handle in our bodies , its probably best to avoid potential hazards . While scientists and manufacturers hash out whether a health risk is substantial enough to warrant banning , you and I can just put down the skittles and have a little crystallized ginger or a steaming cup of green tea . The less we " demand " these dicey comestibles , the less manufacturers will supply them . The fact is , this is a choice we the people have to make , and then well see things change . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

We grew up on Twinkies , for crying out loud ! <p> But now we are at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become exceedingly simple to get the most powerful foods in the world into your body for creating a world-class , amazing brain. - I 'm going to share with you- 3 critical nutrients upgrade your mental hardware . <p> #1 Neurotransmitters. - Neurotransmitters are commonly thought to only be endogenous chemicals ( generated from within ) , when in actuality significant neurotransmitter activity has been demonstrated to exist in various foods that are only now becoming known to the popular culture. - Again , we grew up in the Twinkie , Dorito , diet cola era , so- obviously research into the neurotransmitter activity in our popular foods is n't going to turn up much of anything as a matter of fact , many experts believe that these foods actually suck the smarts right out of you . <p> Neurotransmitters are CRITICAL chemicals that transmit signals from neurons to your cells. - This is basically the " communication " of one cell to another , in an IMMEASURABLE amount of neuro-communications happening in your system while you are alive So , yes , its pretty important . <p> The days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum as a new class of foods has risen to the forefront called- Superfoods. - One of the most potent superfoods that really stack up in the neurotransmitter department are- hemp seeds . <p> Hemp seeds are gaining HUGE attention as a superfood that 's giving people a new found edge. - They are tiny seeds that pack a tremendous amount of nutrition. - Hemp seeds are the highest source of- edistin , which is the #1 most usable protein by the human body ( an important structural building block of your brain ) . <p> Hemp seeds provide the added nutrients needed to enhance the cellular communication that you are looking for. - Things like magnesium , zinc , iron , manganese , and antioxidants like vitamin E . - This is a superfood par excellence. - I share a lot more about hemp seeds and 20 other cutting-edge superfoods in my book- The Key to Quantum Health . <p> #2 EFAs- ( Essential Fatty Acids ) . - Your brain is mostly FAT and WATER. - Now this information is CRITICAL for you to understand. - Fat has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered criminal how so-called experts have tried to profit off of peoples misunderstandings of fat by advocating low-fat and even NO-FAT diets , without sharing the important distinction between processed , denatured , rancid , oxidized fats and oils , and the vital , life-giving , energizing , fat-burning EFAs that are literally what the name implies ( they are- ESSENTIAL- for good health and well-being ) . <p> So the key here is to pick up excellent sources of Omega 6 and Omega 3 fatty acids , in the right balance for the human body , which has been found to be 4:1 Omega 6 to Omega 3. - Omega 3s are essential for building your cell membranes which allow them to regenerate and protect your cells from damage. - The home run hitter to look to again here is hemp seed and hemp seed oil. -

Your body uses water as the pathway for your entire nervous system to transfer neurotransmitters throughout your entire perimeter of your body. - Your nervous system is essentially how you experience the world and interact with your environment , so it is of CRITICAL importance to be well hydrated with clean , highly structured water. - There is a great video posted on my website about where to get the best water ( Spring Water LIVE ) . <p> The basic amount to start with is to take your body weight , and divide it in half , and the number that you come up with is the base number of ounces in water that you need to be consuming everyday to ensure proper hydration for your brain , nervous system , and metabolism. -

There are SO MANY things going on all the time , literally an infinite amount , and now more than ever it is critical that you gain mastery over being able to focus your mind on those things that are most important to you Or you will find that with even the slightest suggestion , your attention will be thrown off , and you will find yourself thinking about a purple elephant standing on a chair ( see there you go again ) , and losing track of what matters most and your ability to radically improve your productivity and get more done then you ever thought possible . <p> You see , your brain operates in patterns , you can call them- patterns of influence. -

And if your predominant actions/ habits are to be " multi-tasking " and caught up in a bunch of inefficient , stressful , - away-from-the-objective work , then your amazing brain will look for opportunities , situations , and circumstances to back that up. - Its all in what you have knowingly OR unknowingly programmed it to do . <p> Your brain is there to keep your reality attuned to what you are used to . This is basically to master the level that you 're at so that you can effectively survive. - And from there ( if you are aware of this ) , you can reach to the next stage of your development with more ease and grace . <p> To strengthen your mental muscles , you have to first become aware of the ability to program it the way that you want to , and then to incite a practice to begin to retrain your mind to become more streamline in its ability to focus. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the beginning of documented human history , and that 's the power ofmeditation. - Meditation can be defined as undistractible attention to the present. - You are actually tuning in to life. - Where so often we have been caught up in the distraction , and missing out on enjoying the experiences of peace and clarity , which only happen in the nowness of life ( Not in the past , and Not in the future ) . <p> Start with 5 minutes a day , preferably first thing in the morning ( after you have your morning water and use the restroom , of course ) . - Sit with closed eyes , and your back straight , and focus on your in-breath and out-breath. - Breath in for a count of 5 , breath out for a count of 5. - You will find this to be very relaxing. - Just follow your breath , and this will begin to train your brain to focus like a laser beam. - This powerful practice will be able to be carried with you more and more throughout the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incredible meditations and visualization exercises in Chapter Seven of my book- The Key to Quantum Health- that would be incredibly valuable to you if you really wanted to take the express lane to improving your memory , productivity , and your ability to achieve greater success . <p> 3. - Intelligently providing circulation to the circuitry everyday . <p> Notice how the words- circuitry- and- circulation- are so similar Your body is literally an immense myriad of intelligent wiring and energy circuitry. - From your muscular system , your circulatory system , your lymphatic system , your nervous system , and beyond , your entire body is wired up and transmitting energy at astonishing levels , and its very noticeable when your " wattage is low " . <p> Enhanced circulation is such a powerful game-changer for many people. - To move stagnant energy , to allow a powerful energy flow in your system , is- KEY- to having a better brain and better health over all . <p> This is THE reason why exercise is so important. - Intelligent exercises that get your blood flowing , your lymphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body , pays off- big- dividends in your life. - The added benefit is you get a more attractive appearance , but the real money-maker is the increased mental clarity , focus , stamina , and feeling of well-being. - This is all a result of the release of life-giving endorphins and enkephalins. - And its what your brain pays you as a reward for taking action to take better care of it . <p> Truly , almost any exercise is great. - But if you want to target improving the circulation of blood , oxygen , and nutrients- to your brain , then an exercise that involves inversions is where its at. - This is one of the greatest benefits of yoga. - Yoga develops your body , mental acuity , stamina , balance , and increases the flow of energy in your body. - The results- are in , and yoga is one of the best ways to up-level your body AND your brain . <p> What all of these incredible tips translate to is more energy , more clarity , more creativity , the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved intellectual capacities , and much more .

@@24920606 @4920606/ <h> Foods That Aid Your Digestion <p> Digestion is one of the most complicated processes in the human system . It has to deal with all that we care to put in our mouth . A brief idea of what digestion is all about will tell us a lot about foods that aid digestion and the why 's and how 's of eating . <p> The food we eat has to be broken down into small particles so that our system can absorb them and send them on to do their job . This process of breaking down the food in to molecules is a broad definition of digestion . <p> This breakdown is chemical and mechanical in nature . The only things that our body can absorb without breaking down are water , salt , and simple sugars like glucose . There are special proteins called enzymes in our body that help this breakdown process . <p> The digestive process <p> This starts when you put food in your mouth . Chewing is very essential , as the saliva in our mouth provides the enzymes that aid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the stomach . <p> The walls of the stomach are muscular and churn the food into even tinier particles . Gastric acid is released along with an enzyme called pepsin , which boosts the food breakdown . The food is now converted into a semi-fluid called chyme when it gets sent to the start of the small intestine or duodenum . <p> Here , enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver break down the fats and proteins . From here , food gets pushed , and absorption takes place . Undigested food , fiber , etc. is sent to the large intestine and colon for exit from the body . <p> This entire process can take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending on the person 's constitution and metabolic rate . <p> Different rates for different foods : <p> Simple sugars digest in minutes , as no breakdown is required <p> Starch needs an hour plus <p> Fat takes 4-6 hours <p> Meat takes longer and is dependent on how much you eat .

As long as we know what to look for , we can detect and even prevent serious condition . Blood test , urine color , body aches can all give us valuable information about what 's really going on inside . <p> Normal urine color is pale or straw yellow , however , it can have a range of hues from dark yellow to brown . Dehydration , foods/drinks consumed , medications , supplements , illnesses and injuries can cause urine color to change . So let 's explore this deeper . <h> Normal Urine <p> The yellow pigment found in urine is called urochrome . Researchers believe that the yellow color of urine is due to urobilin . Urobilin is formed when hemoglobin , the red pigment responsible for transporting blood throughout the body through red blood cells , breaks down . When the old red blood cells die , hemoglobin is formed . <p> Dehydration is usually the cause of dark yellow urine . Typically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people do n't drink water in the night . If the color of urine is dark during the day time , it means that the person is not drinking enough water .

Great way to fix it is by adding Emergen-C electrolytes to your water . <h> Fluorescent Yellow Urine <p> The color of the urine will be fluorescent yellow when a person ingests more riboflavin than through vitamin B2 supplement which is also present in every multivitamin . <h> Orange Urine <p> If a person consumes a lot of carrots , then the urine can be yellow-orange in color . The skin of the person may also have a yellow-orange color . This condition is referred to as carotenemia and the pigment that changes the color is beta-carotene . Vitamin C also changes the color of urine to dark yellow or orange . Warfarin ( brand name : Coumadin ) is an anticoagulant . This medication can change the color of urine as well . Same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pink/Red Urine <p> Consumption of beets , rhubarb or berries like blueberries and blackberries can change the color of urine to pink or red . Presence of blood ( red blood cells or hemoglobin ) in urine can also give a red color to it . Release of myoglobin ( a red pigment responsible for storing oxygen in muscles ) caused by muscle cells damage can turn urine red . The reason for the presence of blood in urine could be due to an injury caused to the kidney or urinary bladder or tract . Mercury or lead poisoning can also turn- urine color red . <p> For females , the openings of the urinary , reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts are very close to each other . Therefore , medical tests may have to be done to find out where blood is coming from . <p> People who take laxatives containing phenolphthalein can pass pink urine . This is because phenolphthalein turns pink in alkaline urine . <h> Green or Blue Urine <p> If a person consumes large quantities of asparagus , then urine can be green in color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria can change the color of urine to green or blue too . <p> Metabolic disorders can also cause the urine to be blue in color . Indicanuria , inability of the body to absorb tryptophan , an amino acid , gives a blue color to urine . This disorder in children is also referred to as blue diaper syndrome . Hypercalcemia , a genetic disorder which causes elevated calcium levels , is also responsible for blue diaper syndrome . <h> Brown/Black Urine <p> People who eat a lot of aloe or fava beans ( broad beans ) , or cascara as well as senna laxatives can pass brown urine . Methyldopa , high blood pressure drug , turns urine black when it comes into contact with bleach used to clean the toilet . Dark urine can also be caused by the antibiotic metronidazole . <p> Alkaptonuria is a genetic condition . It makes urine appear brown-black when exposed to air .

This leads to the collection of homogentisic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urine . <p> Liver diseases like cirrhosis and hepatitis , kidney stones and kidney disease can cause the color of urine to be brown . <h> Porphyria <p> People suffering from porphyria excrete red-purple/red-brown urine . A deficiency in one or more enzymes required for the production of the iron-containing part of hemoglobin molecule causes porphyria . The precursor molecules are colorless , but when exposed to light the color of these molecules change . There are a minimum of eight different types of porphyria . Whereas some types affect the skin , some others affect the brain , internal organs and nervous system . <p> So next time you have to pee , pay attention to your urine color as it might be telling you important information . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Each group evolved some specific characteristics that influenced their diet preferences , the best method of exercise , and potential health risks .

Exercise is suggested as the best way to keep stress at bay for AB blood types and through this release , it should be easier to maintain a healthy emotional balance . A combination of aerobic and low impact exercise ( some examples are tai chi or yoga ) in a 3:2 ratio is suggested for the best results . <h> The Best Diet for AB Blood Types <p> AB blood types have a mixed inheritance in their digestive abilities too .

Although saliva is supposed to cleanse the mouth , many people often suffer from dry mouth and therefore can not properly clear it of these tiny bacteria .

Do n't forget to swallow , as parsley is chock full of essential nutrients that would be a shame to simply spit out . <h> Lemon Juice <p> Another benefit to drinking lemon water in the morning ( there are dozens ! ) , is that lemon water is a great way to target bad breath . Its acidity is able to cut through the bacteria and make your mouth an inhospitable place for smelly breath .

Fenugreek has also been known to relieve mucus build up caused by catarrhal infections , which targets the back of your throat and nasal cavity . It 's actually a reaction by the immune system to an oral infection which causes a massive amount of mucus to be produced . Oral infections can trigger even worse breath , so treatment with fenugreek tea can target both the buildup of mucus and the bad breath . <h> Fennel Seeds <p> Fennel seeds have been used for centuries to cure bad breath .

However , if you are underweight , it is imperative that you increase your weight , as being underweight increases your risk to various health conditions . <p> Why do some people have a hard time gaining weight in the first place ? According to scientists , ectomorphs find it tough to gain weight because of the following reasons : <p> Low food intake <p> More physical activity <p> Presence of a particular gene <p> Surprisingly , scientists do not consider a higher metabolic rate as one of the causes of being underweight . <p> Study expels the myth that some people are thin because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people believe they are ectomorphic because of a faster metabolism .

@@24920636 @4920636/ <h> 10 Amazing Functions of the Prostate Gland <p> Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in men in the United States . It is very important to maintain a healthy prostate . <p> The Prostates Purpose : <p> 1 . Gland : The primary job of the prostate is to produce and secrete some of the alkaline seminal fluids during ejaculation ( about 30-35% of the semen ejaculate ) . Being alkaline , the prostate fluid , which is milky whitish in color , helps the sperm survive in the acidic vaginal environment . The prostate is considered to be a gland since glands secrete something . <p> 2 . Mix Master : The prostate mixes its fluids with those from the seminal vesicles to transport the sperm made in the testicles . Together these fluids surge through the prostate into the urethra during ejaculation . The urethra doubles as the semen tube during ejaculation and as the urine tube from the bladder , both fluids exiting the tip of the penis . The section of the urethra that runs through the prostate gland is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) long . <p> Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) is a fluid produced in the prostate , playing a key role in enabling the sperm to swim into the uterus by keeping the semen in liquid form . It counteracts the clotting enzyme in the seminal vesicle fluid , which essentially glues the semen to the womans cervix , next to the uterus entrance inside the vagina . PSA dissolves this glue with its own enzyme so that the sperm can dash into the uterus and impregnate an egg if it is there . <p> It is this same PSA that is tested during the PSA blood test , a very controversial test because of the many factors that can cause the results to vary widely . <p> 3 . Muscle : The prostate is also a muscle that pumps the semen out through the penis with enough force to enter into the vagina to help the sperm succeed in reaching the cervix and ensuring procreation of the species . <p> 4 . AH ! : An added bonus for males , the pumping action of the prostate sure feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5 . G : The prostate is the male G-spot . Prostate stimulation can produce an exceptionally strong sexual response and intense orgasm in men that are receptive to this sexual technique . The ability to control ejaculation at the prostate can also lead to prolonged orgasms and " injaculations " where no semen is expelled . This is done in advanced Taoist and Tantric sexual practices to contain the sexual energy internally . <p> 6 . Filter : The prostate also filters and removes toxins for protection of the sperm , which enhances the chance of impregnation and ensures that men seed with the optimum quality of sperm . This is perhaps the prostates most important function and , at the same time , can be one of the main reasons there is a growing epidemic of prostate disease and cancer as men deal with more and more toxins in food and the environment . <p> 7 . Erections : The prostate erection nerves are responsible for erections . These nerves trigger the penis to swell and harden with extra blood flow into it , producing an erection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the prostate , get damaged then erectile difficulties are guaranteed . That is why many medical prostate procedures ( surgery or radiation ) have an unwanted side effect of erectile difficulties or impotence . <p> 8 . Secretions : Prostatic secretions also play a valuable role by protecting the urethra from urinary tract infections , which seem to be much more rare in men than women . <p> 9 . Valves : The prostate , which surrounds the upper part of the urethra tube just below the bladder ( the prostatic urethra ) , controls the flow of urine . It prevents urine from leaving the bladder , except when released by urination . It also prevents urine from damaging ejaculate during orgasm . <p> It does this with two small prostatic muscles called sphincters . They act as gatekeepers with shut-off valves to control and regulate the dual-purpose urethra tube . These gatekeepers ensure the right fluids flow at the right time urination or ejaculation . Not a bad design ! <p> One sphincter is located where the bladder and the upper part of the prostate meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it prevents urination until its time to go and stops seminal fluid from shooting backwards into the bladder during ejaculation . When damaged , semen is forced back into the bladder and eventually exits with normal urination . This is known as retrograde ejaculation and is another possible side effect of prostate surgery no chance of seeding a woman then ! <p> The second , external lower sphincter is at the base of the prostate and is subject to our control . It prevents dribbling after peeing and is how we voluntarily can delay urination when inconvenient to go . Incontinence occurs when control of either sphincter is damaged and urine leaks or flows uncontrollably , thus forcing many men with prostate problems to wear adult diapers . <p> Its easy enough to voluntarily control the lower sphincter and to stop urine or semen from exiting if you have enough Kegel muscle control , the ability to squeeze the flow shut . Either one of these sphincter muscles will block the urine until the urge to pee happens and the timing is right to release and let the urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prostatic urethra tube and the upper or lower sphincter , making urination difficult with a host of unpleasant , uncontrollable symptoms . BPH surgeries that remove part of the prostate can easily have side effects of incontinence or retrograde ejaculation . <p> 10 . Hormones : The prostate gland contains a crucial enzyme , 5-alpha-reductase . This enzyme converts the hormone testosterone in the body to DHT ( dihydrotestosterone ) , which is at least ten times more powerful than simple testosterone . This potent hormone DHT has several purposes including male sexual drive and function . Over time , a build-up of toxins in the prostate may affect the production of this enzyme , which is then responsible for the declining sex drive in men as they age . <p> DHT and testosterone have mistakenly been targeted as guilty hormones in prostate problems rather than the excessive rise in modern male estrogen levels , leading often to medical interventions with serious side effects including lack of libido . Estrogen levels rise because of the prevalence of estrogens in factory foods , commercial meats and dairy , and estrogen-mimicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in municipal water and some plastic food packaging . <p> With such a complex gland having so many functions , prostate disease can wreak havoc on a mans health .

@@24920640 @4920640/ <h> How To Cope With Stress Without Eating <p> Eating does much more for our mind and body than simply provide vitamins and nutrients . Eating is a way by which we celebrate the good times , soothe ourselves during the bad times and more generally have learned to express our feelings . <p> As a child , many of us have extremely fond memories of food during holidays or of being given a lollipop after a visit to a doctor , and have learned to associate food with positive feelings and comfort . For many people this association between food and comfort has led to unhealthy eating cycles in our adult life . As stress levels rise , we immediately turn to food to soothe ourselves . <p> Eating often gives us a quick release from stress , whether it is related to work , relationships or something more serious . <p> Falling into unhealthy eating during periods of stress does n't have to be the norm , but as with all life changes it does require a bit of practice to make the switch . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us to develop such strong associations between ice-cream and stress-relief ! Before we dive into how to cope with stress without food , let 's first come to understand what stress does to our body and why food offers a quick fix . <h> What is Stress ? <p> Stress is your body 's natural response to a threat within the environment . In the distant past , this was likely an approaching predator or a rival tribe . In more recent times , humans continue to have a fight or flight response to stress , but now we react to non-life threatening stressors like in relationships , dealings with a coworker , or lack of sleep . <p> The body will still be triggered to react in the same way ; by increasing the heart rate , anxiety , muscle tension and shallow breathing it activates the sympathetic nervous system . In times of chronic stress , these symptoms can continue without fluctuation over extended periods of time . <h> Why Do We Eat to Cope with Stress ? <p> Often , when trying to manage stress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden , insatiable craving for sugary , fatty foods . Ice cream and potato chips ! Eating is a way to turn off the over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system by activating the parasympathetic system . <p> Simply put , eating is a method to distract the mind and body away from the stress and associated symptoms . For example , blood flows towards the digestive organs , the breathing becomes slower , and the heart rate returns to normal . Unfortunately , this is only a quick fix , as food does not address route cause of your emotional reaction . <p> How do you tell if you are emotionally eating , or simply eating because you are hungry ? Some tell-tale signs are mindlessly eating without focusing on how much or what you are consuming ; craving sugary , fatty foods which will give you an instant rush ; and afterwards there are often feelings of shame or guilt associated with eating such unhealthy food in such high quantities . <p> Because stress eating does n't solve any of the underlying issues , and often causes more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress soothing technique . There are many other positive , healthy , and just as soothing methods to cope with stress . <h> Zero-Calorie Replacements <p> In the beginning as you start to establish better stress reduction routines , an easy first step is to simply satiate the craving without the fatty foods or calories . Try chewing gum , making a cup of tea , or using a toothpick . These have zero calories , and will provide a distraction from the cravings which will eventually subside over time as the stress subsides . <p> It will also give you a moment to focus on the reasons behind the stress and anxiety , and take away the mindlessness of automatically reaching for food . Instead , mindfully choose to try alternatives in the first five minutes of your stress related craving . <h> Mindfulness with Food and Emotions <p> This brings us to the second step in coping with stress without food , mindfulness . Half the battle with emotional eating is eating without focus and while distracted . Most of the time , finishing an entire tub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you barely remember eating the entire tub ! <p> If you slow down when you eat , focus on each bite , each chew , you will not only eat slower but pay more attention to what you are eating .

To take a moment to focus on what is triggering the anxiety , and then to also focus on exactly what you are feeling allows you time to process and perhaps come to a solution beyond food . Feeling powerless in the face of your craving is actually feeling powerless in the face of your emotions . This is why it is vital to stop , breathe and focus on each feeling as it passes .

Once you learn how to use your emotions to help you understand your life experiences , achieving your goals and finding happiness will be much easier . <h> What Are Emotions ? <p> Most dictionary defines emotions as states of consciousness in which joy , love , sorrow , fear , hate , or the like is experienced . In other words , emotions are expressions of consciousness that help you understand and relate to what you are experiencing . Like the mind , emotion has its own ways of helping you understand your world .

The key here is to learn how to unify your mind and emotion , so that they can work together instead of fighting each other . <p> In general , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " emotions are either the result of a judgment of any current situation or a perception of changes taking place within our bodies . " In simpler terms , when we experience fear or joy , it could be the result of how we view the situation .

The problem with these two views of emotion is that they tend to create conflict and separation . To understand our emotions better , we need to combine these two views . <p> Each of us emotionally respond to certain situation differently . For example , some people may experience fear when they see a snake and other people may feel excitement . Because of this , we need to study emotions from a subjective , physiological , and expressive point of view .

For example , when we are happy , it is because our opinion of certain necessities and needs are being satisfied . On the other hand , we feel sad when our opinion of certain necessities and needs are n't  being satisfied . <p> As for the method based on physiological changes , emotions are perceptions of physiological changes in the body , such as hormone levels , heart rate , perspiration , and breathing rate .

Supporters of this method argue that the state of being happy is the result of physiological perception , not because of a judgment . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do n't  explain how emotions are generated at the fundamental levels .

To understand how emotions truly work , we need to study how they function at the quantum level , because this is one of the fundamental levels where emotions " pop " into existence . <h> Why Do We Have Emotions ? <p> The main reason why we have emotions is to help us understand life beyond logic . Without emotions we would see the world as a dull and lifeless place due to the fact that we would act like robots .

The development and maintenance of all these systems is based on intricate and precise working conditions of biological catalysts called enzymes . All human bodies are capable of producing all the enzymes they require that are vital to the smooth running of the splendid show called life . <p> What are enzymes ? <p> Every simple or complex process in our body is possible because of a series of chemical reactions . These reactions are governed by enzymes which either hasten the speed of the reaction by exponential rates or make otherwise impossible reactions take place in its presence . Essentially all enzymes are made up of proteins . What is amazing about these enzymes is that even though they participate in a reaction , they remain unaltered in terms of their chemical composition while they convert biological reactants ( substrates ) into the required products . Because of this property , they can be reused multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many benefits of digestive enzymes . <p> What are the main properties of enzymes ? <p> As we have established , enzymes are proteins that take part in a reaction without changing their own chemical properties . Besides this , it is important to understand other properties of enzymes . <p> Enzymes are highly specific : An enzyme is not only function specific but substrate specific . <p> Enzyme catalysed reactions are reversible : They can catalyse the both the forward reactions ( substrate to product ) and backward reactions ( product to substrate ) <p> Enzymes are reactive : As proteins , enzymes have a temperature and pH at which they denature and lose their activity . In most cases , denaturation is an irreversible process . The functionality or the activity of the enzyme is greatly affected by the prevalent temperatures and pH of the reaction . Therefore , every enzyme has an optimum temperature and pH at which the activity of the enzyme is the highest . Consequently , minimum activity is also evident at a particular point of these parameters . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid smooth digestion of food . These enzymes are strategically secreted and present in various parts of the alimentary canal . The food we eat is systematically broken down from complex to gradually simpler compounds before they are absorbed and then distributed throughout the body . Digestive enzymes are present in the mouth , stomach , pancreas and the small intestine . <p> There are 4 categories of digestive enzymes : <p> Proteolytic enzymes : Catalyse the breakdown of proteins to amino acids . <p> Lipolytic enzymes : Catalyse the breakdown of fatty acids and glycerol . <p> The digestive enzymes especially in the stomach take some time to get secreted and act on the food . Besides this , our growing sedentary life-style causes the food to remain undigested for longer than required . Digestive enzyme supplements help speed up digestion .

It is a remarkable enzyme capable of digesting protein . <p> What are the main benefits of digestive enzymes ? <p> Now , the question lingers as to why digestive enzyme supplements should even be considered taking , since our body produces all the enzymes required . One must understand that the more enzymes that the body uses for digestion is proportional to the exhaustion of the same .

@@24920647 @4920647/ <h> How to Increase Metabolism and Lose Weight <h> What is Metabolism ? <p> Before you begin trying to tweak the speed of your metabolism , it 's important to understand the vital role it plays in every aspect of your bodily functions . It is also important to understand what causes a slow metabolism , in order to understand what can be done to begin the shift towards a high metabolism . <p> Metabolism is the term used to describe the series of chemical processes taking place within an organism to maintain the living state of the said organism . - In essence , metabolism is the basis of life . The two primary aspects of the process are catabolism and anabolism . <p> Catabolism : The process of converting nutrients into energy . It is responsible for- giving us the energy we need to perform cardiovascular activities . <p> Anabolism : Using energy created through catabolism , anabolism creates complex- molecules from simple ones . This process is a series of chemical reactions that let 's your body maintain and create new tissues and cells . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anabolism ) lead to differences in body weight ? Essentially metabolism is a mathematical equation , of catabolism minus anabolism . In other words , body weight is whatever energy remains once our body uses up whatever energy it needs . Excess energy is subsequently turned into fat and stored away for another day . If you produce more energy than you consume , it will eventually increase your body weight . <p> Although there may not be much we can do to instantly and dramatically change our resting metabolic rate , there are many small lifestyle changes that can begin to shift it over time . First it is important to gain a good understanding of your own body 's calorie requirements vs your typical calorie expenditure . Different body types and different lifestyles will all have different requirements . Obviously , a larger body with an active lifestyle , will need a much higher calorie intake than a small body who may sit in front of a computer screen all day . <h> How to Increase Metabolism <p> Increasing metabolism safely and for long term requires a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and small . <h> 1 . - Lift Weights and Build Muscle <p> Do n't think you can get away with increasing your metabolism without changing your workout routine ! After all , metabolism is essentially about how much energy your body eats up on a daily basis . One way to increase your body 's energy consumption is to shift your workout focus to muscle building activities . Muscles , even when resting , require much more energy than fat tissue . Healthy strength training will slowly change your resting metabolic rate . Especially for people on a diet , which technically slows down metabolism because there are fewer calories to be consumed , it 's important to also build muscles at the same time in order to ensure that once your diet is done , your metabolism is still strong and still working ! Studies have shown that weight is kept off even when the diet is done when study participants also maintain a routine of building muscle mass. <h> 2. - Drink Green Tea <p> Okay , admittedly green tea has been touted as a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weight loss and other bodily processes , it is n't a quick fix . However , in combination with healthy diet and exercise , green tea has been found to increase metabolism and boost energy . When consumed as a tea ( be wary of miracle ' extracts ) , green tea has high levels of antioxidants and flavonoids . It also has been shown to increase metabolic rates for a few hours after consumption . When combined with moderate exercise green tea gives an added boost to your metabolism over time . <h> 3. - Increase Workout Intensity <p> More exercise ? Yes , you need to increase the sweat to increase your metabolism . However , it does n't mean you need to dedicate hours a day to the treadmill , even adding short bursts of exercise to your routine three times a week has been proven to reduce fat and in association increase metabolism . One study showed that over a 12-week period , men were able to reduce their belly fat by 17% and lose 2 kg of fat mass when they committed to 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's only one hour a week total , and has many more benefits for your mind and body than just weight loss . <h> 4. - Many Small Portions <p> Instead of eating three hearty meals a day , try spreading out your calorie intake over many smaller portions throughout the day . The idea behind splitting up your meals into many smaller portions is that it prevents your body from converting excess energy into fat . After a large meal , your body does n't expect more food immediately , and proceeds to convert excess energy into fat . However , if you begin to train your body to expect food every few hours it will continually burn off the energy much more quickly instead of storing it for later . An added bonus , is that you will likely not get extremely hungry between your small meals , and then avoid overeating as a consequence . - <h> 5. - Get a Good Night 's Rest <p> On top of diet and exercise , a good night 's sleep is the third major activity all healthcare professionals recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep has been found to be related to much more than simply energy levels . People who struggle to get a good nights sleep are more likely to be obese , and have also been found to be hungrier more often while also feeling less full . Lack of sleep is also directly related to decision making , and self-control . If you get a full night of uninterrupted sleep , you are much more capable of resisting poor food choices , and committing to that 20 minute workout . <p> There is no miracle pill to swallow to change your metabolism , but through small , easy-to-make changes , primarily focused around diet , exercise , and sleep , it is possible to begin to shift your metabolic rate and thereby lose more weight and keep it off . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Meaghan Murphy , executive editor of Good Housekeeping magazine , stopped by Studio 1A this to show some of the filthiest items we own " and to share some tips on how to properly clean them . <h> 1 . Earbuds <p> What you need : Alcohol wipes , vinegar and bleach <p> What you need to know : Earbuds come in contact with body oil , sweat and makeup " and it probably does n't  help that they 're hanging out inside your ears . Believe it or not , a study from the Online Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from frequent users contained bacteria , including staph bacteria .

If the buds have removable silicone covers , place those in white vinegar for five minutes or use a bleach/water solution . You can also use sterile alcohol pads to wipe them down . <h> 2 . Keyboards <p> What you need to know : A study from Kimberley Clark and the University of Arizona found that 27 percent of office keyboards and over half of computer mouses are contaminated with mold , yeast and bacteria .

Make sure the setting is on " cool " so that you do n't  damage your keyboard . <p> Another idea : Dip a Q-tip in alcohol ( gently wring out to make sure it does n't  drip ) and wipe the individual keys to disinfect them without harming the electronics . Remember , you do n't  want moisture to get into the openings and crevices , so its best not to spray the keyboard directly with any liquids . <h> 3 .

The best ones have partitions , but no cover , and are dishwasher-safe . Your best bet is to store it inside your medicine cabinet . Then simply wash it as often as you run the dishwasher . <h> 4 . Coffee reservoir <p> What you need : White vinegar and water <p> What you need to know : According to the 2011 NSF study , in the homes with yeast and mold present , 50 percent were found to have it in the coffee reservoir , second only to the dishrag and sponge . <p> What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances like coffeemakers and blenders .

The AOA recommends washing glasses every morning , paying special attention to the frames and earpieces , where hair product and makeup tend to rub off . Still , instead of reaching for a specifically-designed product that promises to wipe away streaks , just run your glasses under warm water and wipe dish soap on the lens using your finger .

This post from Harper 's Bazaar has put together a list of 15 foods to avoid , most of them being highly processed foods containing toxic ingredients and food additives . <p> We know we should stay clear of hard-and-fast food but some foods can seriously mess with your health . <p> " It does n't  mean you 'll get sick , get cancer , or die if you eat a dangerous food once , " says Nneka Leiba , deputy director of research at the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) , which catalogs studies on potential toxins found in specific brand-name foods and ranks their safety in a massive database . " But there are certain foods you should avoid as much as possible if you have a choice . " <p> With that in mind , do your best to steer clear of the foods that scare Leiba , Harvest , and other registered dietitians : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American cheese is not cheese at all , " says Beth Warren , a New York-based registered dietitian and the author of Living a Real Life With Real Food . Depending on the brand , " its a factory creation of a cheese-like food made from a blend of milk fats , solids , some whey protein , emulsifiers , and food coloring . " Its high in sodium , and so high in fat that one regular slice more closely resembles high-fat meat than anything considered dairy , Warren adds . <p> 2 ) Processed Meats Made With Nitrates or Nitrites : Step away from the deli counter . Processed meats in the U.S. such as ham , salami , hot dogs , and bacon are n't  just full of unhealthy fats . They can have up to 400 percent ( ! ) more sodium and 50 percent more preservatives than unprocessed red meats . The worst part : Some contain nitrites and nitrates , chemical additives that have been linked to various cancers , but are still used to enhance color , promote taste , and prevent spoilage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so look out for them and opt for meats that do n't  contain them . <p> 3 ) Margarine : Because margarine is made from vegetable oils and has less cholesterol and saturated fat than butter , its long been considered the healthier option . But now that experts saydietary cholesterol is n't as harmful they thought , margarine , which is high in salt and contains artery-clogging trans fats , is n't looking quite so healthy . " Trans fat , like saturated fat , increases blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease , " explains Melissa Rifkin , a registered dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center in New York and a Rise nutrition coach . Margarines sold in tubs tend to contain less trans fat than margarine sticks " the softer the spread , the better for you " but olive oil ( or another source of monosaturated fat ) is still a better bet . Real butter is a close second , according to Rifkin . <p> 4 ) Regular Soda : Everyone knows that soda is Very Bad for your health . In case you missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . When you consume that much , your body responds by creating excess insulin , which typically helps the body absorb sugar from the bloodstream and use it for energy . Over time , though , this over-the-top response can increase your risk of developing diabetes and some forms of cancer . If sodas sugar content does n't  still does n't  scare you , its other ingredients might : The amount of caramel coloring you 'd consume in one can of soda per day was recently linked to a 58 percent greater risk of cancer , according to a new study . <p> 5 ) Diet Soda : While there 's no straight-up sugar in this stuff , there are artificial sweeteners , and they 're not necessarily any better . Not all artificial sweeteners are equally offensive . However , most have a more intense flavor than plain old sugar . Over time , the extra-sweet sweeteners can dull your senses to naturally sweet foods like fruits , Rifkin says . So yes , your Diet Coke could , theoretically , make a perfectly sweet apple taste worse . <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised as " sugar-free " tend to contain artificial sweeteners too . ( See no. 5 above . ) Also : The digestive system does n't  do a great job at breaking down sugar substitutes and sugar alcohols , Harvest says . When you overdo it ( and the threshold is different for everyone ) you could incur some serious stomach pains . <p> 7 ) Conventionally Grown Apples : While a recent study found that conventionally farmed produce is n't nutritionally inferior to the stuff grown on organic farms , there 's no question that pesticides used to grow regular produce can damage the brain and nervous system , lead to cancer , disrupt your hormones , and lead to skin , eye , and lung irritation , according to dataassembled by the EWG . And pesticides tend to stick around on some fruits and veggies " even after you wash and peel them . <p> That said , there 's one exception : When your only food options are a conventional apple or a processed snack like a bag of chips . In this case , Leiba says , the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Conventionally Raised Chicken and 9 . Eggs : Some crazy shit goes down on non-organic farms , where chicken feed could include traces of caffeine , Tylenol , Benadryl , banned antibiotics , and arsenic , according to some reports . Now that McDonalds and Costco are phasing out chicken raised with antibiotics , conventional-chicken suppliers are likely to shift toward safer and more natural practices . Eventually , this could make it easier to find ( and afford ) the safest poultry and eggs . Until then : Organic eggs and organic chicken ( which may be less likely to carry salmonella , according to some research ) really are your safest bets , Rifkin says . <p> 10 ) Bread and 11 ) Crackers Made With Potassium Bromate : This chemical is used to help bread and cracker dough rise during the baking process " even though its been linked to certain cancers in animal studies and its banned in many other countries . That 's good enough reason for Leiba to recommend against eating it . Look for the ingredient on baked good labels or ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breads " then choose a potassium-bromate-free option , when you can . <p> 12 ) Microwave Popcorn : " Its not healthy eating out of a bag anymore , " Rifkin says . Microwave popcorn bags , in particular , are often lined with a chemical called perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) , which has been shown to affect fertility , cancer risk , and kidney functioning in animal and some human studies . Because microwave popcorn bags are n't  labeled " toxic , " its best to avoid them altogether . Another thing : Some brands of microwave popcorn add unhealthy trans fats to their products , and vaguely list " artificial flavors " or " natural flavors " on their labels " so there 's no way to know exactly what 's in there , Warren warns . In the worst case scenarios , the recipe could contain MSG , which can cause headaches or nausea , or diacetyl butter flavoring , which may cause respiratory damage when inhaled .

Unfortunately there are n't  a ton of studies done on cumulative exposure , so researchers do n't  know whether your penchant for tacosand propylparaben containing lotions could compound your risk , says Leiba , who tends to dodge such foods and products ( just in case ) . <p> 15 ) Any Packaged Food With More Than Two Ingredients You Ca n't I 'd . Like " butylated hydroxyanisole " ( BHA ) and " butylated hydroxytoluene " ( BHT ) . These ingredients are antioxidants used as preservatives in foods like chips , preserved meats , and cereals .

BHT is no angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and lung and liver tumors . While ingredients can affect animals and humans differently , you might not want to be the guinea pig , Leiba says .

@@24920659 @4920659/ <h> The 4 Effects of Air Pollution That You Need to Know <p> Air pollution has been on the rise since the beginning of the industrial revolution , when people initially began burning fossil fuel in large quantities as a primary energy source . At its essence air pollution is a buildup of harmful particulates within the earth 's atmosphere , including carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , volatile organic compounds , and compounds emitted from gaseous primary pollutants ( smog ) just to name a few . While it is true that natural causes can lead to harmful air pollutants ( ex : volcanic eruptions ) , these natural sources are minimal in comparison to the rising problem of human-caused air pollution . <p> Air pollution takes a huge toll on the productivity of the economy . It 's estimated that each year $5 trillion dollars is lost worldwide due to increasing air pollution . This is strictly calculated by the amount of lost time , and reduced productivity due to illnesses caused by poor air quality . However , the cost would likely be even higher if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the dramatic reduction in crop yield since 1980 . <p> Not surprisingly , smog does n't just affect humans . It has been linked to black lung disease in dolphins who live in ecosystems near larger population centers . The toxic particulate in the atmosphere creates acid rain , which can destroy entire ecosystems . There is also an increase in the occurrence of algae blooms , historically an entirely natural process , which is now being influenced by the release of nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere by heavy industry . This release of excess nitrogen eventually is collected into waterways and triggers an explosion of nitrogen feeding lifeforms algae . This bloom is extremely damaging to the environment , as it kills off all other aquatic life . <p> The statistics around health problems related to air issues are staggering . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , air pollution was responsible for roughly 7 million premature deaths in 2014 . This study was conducted both within cities and in rural areas , ensuring that the myth of breathing in clean country air is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of York found that in parts of the world with the worst air pollution ( East Asia , the Middle East , and South Asia ) , poor air quality led to 2.7 million premature babies . <p> How exactly does air pollution affect human health ? There is an unending stream of well documented and proven linkages between poor air quality and serious health concerns , most dramatic of which is death . Some of the most serious effects are explored in further detail below . <h> 4 Major Effects of Air Pollution on Health <h> 1 . - Mortality <p> Some of the scariest statistics are about the global mortality rates associated with air pollution . According to the WHO , they attribute one in eight deaths globally to exposure to air pollution . This is linked to both indoor and outdoor air quality issues , with the most deaths happening in Southeast Asia and Western Pacific nations . Air pollution is a major impetus behind a long list of serious diseases such as cancer , cardiovascular disease , as well as lung diseases such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even been linked to fatal stroke and heart attacks , especially among women . <h> 2. - Lung Disease <p> Air quality has been unequivocally linked to lung disease . It is estimated that- approximately 80% of lung diseases are caused by poor air quality . The higher the amount- of poisonous particulate matter in the atmosphere , the higher the instance of reduced lung function experienced by the local population . Common illnesses , such as emphysema and asthma , are directly linked to traffic pollution from exhaust pipes . In one long term study after the infamous Great Smog of London in 1952 , the health of truck drivers was compared to those who lived in urban areas and those who lived in rural areas . Those who lived within the city , experienced a higher restriction of lung capacity , more mucus production and overall more severe respiratory issues .

Specifically , this has been linked to increased nitrogen oxide and traffic exhaust common to urban and industrial neighborhoods . According to a- study published in 2015 , cancer was nearly entirely attributed to environmental factors , - and not simply caused by bad luck . Prolonged exposure to toxins in the atmosphere , - both indoors and outdoors , will gradually but continuously increase the risk for cancer in otherwise healthy people . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Just by practicing small acts of restraint , you can begin to increase your capability to control yourself . By building on this skill , you are sure to be able to kick even the toughest habits . <h> 2. - Baby Steps <p> When designing your 2017 New Year 's resolution , it 's important not to go too big . The smaller the resolution , the easier it will be to accomplish . For example , instead of committing to a work out everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin ? That way , the target it closer and easier for to reach . As you accomplish the smaller goals , you can then set the target farther away . No use setting yourself up for a giant failure , when smaller goals will give you the confidence boost you need to keep going . <h> 3. - Break up Big Goals into Small Wins <p> Following on the idea of not going too big , why not break up your resolution into easy to handle parts . For example , trying to lose ten pounds is actually a series of smaller decisions such as exercising more , buying healthier food , and avoiding take out . Why not then make a few smaller goals for yourself , like avoiding takeout food for an entire week ? Or only buying healthy groceries during your weekly shopping trip . That way , as you conquer each small win , you will also take steps towards your larger goal . <h> 4. - Reward yourself Along the Way <p> Just because you have committed to getting healthier in the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Studies have shown that when we feel good , we also have stronger willpower . So why not reward yourself after a week of exercise to a spa day ? Or going out to see a movie ? Pick a reward that will motivate you to reach your goals but not compromise them . <h> 5. - Boost your Blood Sugar <p> Despite the fact that many people kick sugar in the new year , there are some statistics out there that show how restraint over an extended period of time can actually lower blood sugar levels , which in turn diminish the restraint . It 's a good idea to have an apple , or a glass of orange juice handy just in case you are tempted by that bad habit . That way , you have all the available tools in your belt to avoid triggers . <h> 6. - Focus on Today <p> What is something you can do right now to accomplish your resolution ? Try not to stress about next week , or next month . Today , you can work on small steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad habits ( or start good ones ) . <h> 7. - Remember your Wins <p> Habits take 40 days to stick , therefore on your journey this year do n't lose sight of the goal even if you take a few steps in the wrong direction . Two steps forward and one step back is still great progress , always keep reminding yourself of just how well you have done so far . Positive thoughts go a long way in terms of self motivation and do much more for you ( and your resolution ) than negative energy . <h> 8. - Understand Triggers <p> Typically New Year 's resolutions revolve around kicking bad habits like junk food , wasted time on social media , or smoking . Bad habits also tend to have triggers that set us off . Before kicking off your resolution , why not write down all the associated triggers ? By knowing your triggers in advance you can avoid them , or at least be ready to confront them when they appear . <h> 9. - Inspire yourself Through your Senses <p> Inspiration boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what you are striving for is a good tool to add to your repertoire . Are you are saving money for a new home ? Why not post a picture of your dream home on your fridge ? If you are trying to eat healthier , why not sign up for daily recipes sent directly to your inbox ? Anything to help you keep the goal in sight . <h> 10. - Avoid Temptations <p> Finally , temptation is everywhere , learn to avoid it . If you are working on cutting back on alcohol , why not suggest other fun social activities to your friends before they suggest going out for drinks ? If you are trying not to spend money , freeze your credit cards in the freezer so they are not within easy reach ! Be creative ! <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654 
@@24920662 @4920662/ <h> 10 Thoughts To a Happy and Healthy Life <p> ( BeWellBuzz ) Are you moving full throttle , but achieving less each day ? Instead of pushing the accelerator harder , take your foot off it for some time and check the direction in which you are going . You may find that you are going down a path you did n't  intend to walk in the first place . <p> Life is simple , but we often complicate it . Here are a few thoughts to help you unlearn the old ways and start fresh and in the right direction . <p> 1 . Life is a mystery that needs to be lived . It is not a problem awaiting a solution <p> Life is neither a problem , nor a philosophy . It is simply a mystery that should be lived moment by moment . <p> The present is the only moment which we have control over . Instead of making the best of the present , we put it on autopilot mode while continuing thinking of either the past or the future . Do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by or what is yet to come . If you do this , your life will be more limited than it ought to be . The present offers limitless opportunities . You can become aware of them and choose the best one only if you let go and give full attention to the present moment . Live today to the fullest . <p> 2 . Gratitude is the art of appreciation . Develop it and practice it if you want to be at peace with yourself and your life <p> Gratitude is an important virtue to have , more so if you find yourself in tiring circumstances . It can not change reality , but can make it more livable . <p> There are two root causes of our sufferings : the feeling of " not being good enough or not having enough " , and the notion that we will be satisfied once we become something or get something . These two causes are interrelated they feed off and on each other . <p> The feeling of " something is lacking either in me or in my life " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming something or attaining something . We believe we can eradicate this deep-rooted , but self-planted feeling of inadequacy through external sources . However , the more we achieve , the greater the discontent grows . The object which we believe will relieve us from our sufferings once and for all never shows up . We are unable to attain it no matter what we do . This is because no such thing exists . It is simply a figment of our imagination , much like the feeling of inadequacy . <p> External sources can not give us inner satisfaction . They , at best , can give us a fleeting moment of happiness . If you want to be really happy , you have to shift your focus . The real happiness lies inside you and not outside . Gratitude helps you realize this . It allows you eradicate all the negativity and appreciate what you have . It allows you to be at peace with yourself and with the world around you . <p> Replace the feeling of inadequacy with that of gratitude . Make it a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , and you soon will find yourself getting better results . With practice , the habit gets stronger and enriches every aspect of your life . <p> 3 . Do n't  take the mirror too seriously . Its how you feel inside that matters more <p> The mirror does not lie , but then , it does n't  tell you the whole truth either . You are a few pounds heavier or lighter , and the mirror says the same to your face . However , that 's all the mirror can tell you . It can not dig deeper and tell you what really matters , and that is how do you feel . <p> How you feel matters more than how you look . At least , that 's the way it should be , not the other way around . <p> Of course , you want to look like a million bucks . Who does n't  ? However , if you are making yourself miserable in the quest to look good , you need a reality check . Ask yourself what you prefer an unhappy person trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a not-so-perfect body . <p> 4 . Do n't  miss an opportunity to have a meal with your friends or family <p> Life is busy , but you should never miss out on an opportunity to eat together with friends and family . A meal eaten with your loved ones feeds not only the body , but also the soul . <p> The reality of our lives is that we have more activities and less time to do them . While these activities are important , they are not as important as the people we love . Each meal shared with the family and friends gives us an opportunity to spend quality time with them and create stronger bonds and richer memories . <p> So , take some time out from your busy schedule to spend more time with people who mean the world to you . <p> 5 . Travel for travels sake if you do n't  have a destination in mind <p> Pack up your bags every now and then and go to new places , especially if you 've been drifting farther and farther from your old self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you amidst a new environment , buildings , and faces . <p> Travelling allows us to meet new people and learn about new cultures . It allows us to learn new things and to let go of the emotions , fears , and mental blocks that hold us back . Travelling is like oxygen to the free spirit which resides in each of us . It opens our mind to new perspectives , makes us more carefree , and allows us to love ourselves and others with greater freedom . <p> 6 . If you are restless , it is a good sign . You are restless because you want something more than what you have <p> Do n't  think restlessness is a sign that you are lost . On the contrary , it means you want something better , but have not just figured out yet exactly what it is . Or you may know exactly what you want , but the path is not clear to you at this moment . Do n't  worry . The secret will unravel itself in due course of time . <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rainbow without rain . <p> If it was not for pain , we would never have learned the true worth of happier moments . Accept pain just as you accept happiness . Do n't  resist pain , because that can not be done . You only insulate yourself from happiness when you try to resist pain . <p> Feel the pain just as you feel happiness , but do n't  let pain overwhelm you . If it threatens to get the better of you , take comfort in the fact that such moments eventually pass . Pain , much like everything else , is temporary . <p> 8 . Rejection measures the strength of your resolve . It is not a statement of your capabilities <p> When you come face to face with rejection , you can either pick yourself back up and continue on your journey with your head held high , or walk back with your head and spirit drooping . Success may be just around the bend a few steps further where you are . If you quit , you will never know this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think you must , and you will find what you seek probably sooner than you imagine . <p> 9 . Live in the present <p> The present is a gift . Do n't  waste it by thinking of the past or future . The past is gone . You cant relive it . The future is an unfulfilled promise and will come when it comes . Take a minute and thank yourself for being YOU . <p> 10 . Think and talk less , listen more <p> We often have a never-ending self talk on what to do , what to say , etc . Recognize when it starts and just listen .

@@24920664 @4920664/ <h> 3 Awareness Secrets To Increase Productivity <p> ( BeWellBuzz ) Awareness is the key to improving productivity . The term productivity in this context is not just work-related . It refers to every activity you enjoy doing and is beneficial to you in one way or another . Unproductivity , which is the other end of the same spectrum , refers to activities that you do not intend to do in the first place , and those you invariably regret doing afterwards . <p> With some conscious effort , you can curb the unproductive moments in a day and proportionally increase the productive moments . In that light , three distinct types of awareness can help significantly . They are : <p> Time Awareness <p> Most of us go through a major portion of our normal days on auto-pilot . For instance , while driving to your office or on a route that you 've taken innumerable times before , you usually do n't  pay attention to the route . Instead , you are lost in thought while driving . This same principle of doing things on auto-pilot applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem with working on auto-pilot is that it does not provide any opportunity to boost productivity . This is because you are hardly paying any attention to the task at hand . The end result is that you feel you did n't  do anything productive at the end of the day . However , it is too late to do anything about it by then . <p> Noting your daily activities regularly gives you valuable insight on how you spend your day . This , in turn , allows you to reverse the old habit of wasting time unintentionally . Reducing unproductive moments gives you the time , energy , and freedom to doing things you love , such as taking a walk in the park with your companion or playing video games with your children . <p> Task Awareness <p> You need to be aware not only of what you are doing , but also why you are doing something . Are the things you do really important ? Does the things you do take you a step closer toward your bigger goal ? Are you spending more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which you must find answers if you want to become more productive . <p> Some may think that rigorous , extensive , in-depth introspection is required for unearthing answers to the above seemingly difficult questions . This is actually not true . While introspection is indeed crucial if you are to find the right answers , it is hardly of the demanding kind . All you need to do is keep a record of what you are doing ( covered in time awareness ) and why you are doing what you are doing . You do n't  have to write an elaborate explanation on why you are doing something . One or two sentences stating the reason for doing a particular task is more than enough . <p> When writing the reasons , you may find yourself analyzing them as you jot them down . Try to avoid doing this . Initially , you should only be concerned with developing a habit of writing the reasons . After a couple of weeks of writing , take some time out from your busy schedule and analyze the reasons you listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , be truthful and brutal . Ask yourself if the listed reasons make any sense . Are they in sync with your bigger goal ? Do the listed reasons cover most things , if not all , that you think can help you improve your life ? Are your reasons valid or just a cover-up for doing things under societal or peer pressure ? <p> Result Awareness <p> All of us invariably do innumerable activities in a day , but what is the quantitative benefit of these activities ? Or , simply put , what is that you are achieving ? <p> You need time to achieve most things , but if you are perpetually in transit , your goal is either unreasonable , or , more likely , your approach is flawed . For instance , a normal healthy person should take anywhere between 12-15 months to be ready for a 21 km race . If you start training right now , you should be able to run 21 km or close to 21 km by the end of the year . This figure is the end result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fortnightly , or monthly . In case you have a big project , it is essential that you break it into smaller goals . Taking the above example , your first goal could be running 5 km without having to take a break . The next goal could be running 8 km , and so on . <p> While you need to , and must , enjoy the process , you must also keep an eye on the big picture . Stay aware of your goal and your current positioning vis-a-vis the smaller milestones you need to achieve to fulfill your big goal . Speaking of the above example , you can break your big goal of running 21 km in a years time to smaller goals of running 5 km within 2 months , 10 km within 5 months , 15 km within 8 months , and 21 km by the end of 12 months . Defining a timeline for your goals , breaking your goal into smaller milestones , focusing on details , and regularly analyzing your results is the key to achieving success . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

This post from Motherboard turns the spot light on the cookbook meant for people who want to live forever . <p> For many scientists , a lifelong love of learning is just that " lifelong . But for Russian biologist Maria Konovalenko , the average human lifetime is n't enough . That 's why she 's writing a cookbook for people who want to live forever . <p> Konovalenko learned about aging research from Mikhail Batin , head of the Science of Life Extension Foundation , which led her to apply and later enter the Biology of Aging partnership program between USC and the Buck Institute in Northern California , were she is working on her PhD . <p> As with many smaller scientific fields , the most significant hindrance to progress in aging research is the lack of funding and resources , Konovalenko says . Even though there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very difficult time raising money for their tests and experiments in traditional ways . Konovalenko is constantly searching for new ways to spread the gospel of aging research and find new ways for her colleagues to fund their work . <p> That brings us to The Longevity Cookbook , a collection of recipes and lifestyle recommendations backed by research , which Konovalenko and her colleagues recently raised over $50,000 for on Indiegogo . The goal is to scientifically identify which ingredients have been shown to increase human lifespans , and then create recipes built around those ingredients . <p> House musician and producer Steve Aoki has even become involved in the project , as he has a noted interest in the Singularity and life extension . Aoki will even be contributing a section to The Longevity Cookbook , focusing on the motivation behind life extension research . <p> I first came across Konovalenko and The Longevity Cookbook after she did a Reddit AMA . I knew little to nothing about the field and was more than a little skeptical , but Konovalenkos ideas and infectious optimism were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to live forever ? <p> What prompted you to start The Longevity Cookbook project , and what are you trying to achieve by publishing it ? <p> Well , besides the fact that it 's better to live well now and feel good and be healthy in the present , our main goal is to buy time until we can develop the necessary technologies that will enable us to live on indefinitely . <p> I 've been fighting aging for seven years now and I 'm also part of the Science For Life Extension Foundation , a small nonprofit based in Moscow . The group does all kinds of work in the life extension field , but much of it involves fundraising and getting the word out about our research . These are our main goals right now , because any progress we can make depends directly on the amount of funding we can procure . <p> We 've tried talking to the media , we 've tried all these ways to get our name and life extension research out there . After coming up short so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a book ? <p> We thought that writing something that could appeal to a larger audience would be a good way to get longevity research to as many people as possible . A cookbook sounded like an obvious way to combine very practical things like recipes with explanations that allow the reader to have a deeper understanding of the science behind life extension . <p> What will be included in the book ? <p> We were fully funded on our Indiegogo campaign recently , which was really great , and we 're already underway with the first parts of the book . <p> The first chapter will focus not on food , but on life-extending drugs and geroprotective drugs , some that have already proven to be life-extending in lab animals . These will include both pharmaceuticals and supplements , some of which people are already taking for other medical or biological reasons . <p> It 's also important to note that we are n't giving medical advice with this " we are n't doctors , but scientists . Our goal is to get all of the research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Are there any specific ingredients that you know will be used ? <p> I ca n't mention too many right now , just because we have n't run full analyses on many of them yet .

It 's definitely a little premature to name too many , simply because the research does n't exist yet . But by the time the book comes out , we should have a very strong list together . Olive oil and avocado are the only two that I could honestly recommend right now . <p> Would you say your diet has been optimized for longevity at this point ? <p> No , not really . I can guarantee that it will be once we have done the research and created the recipes . <p> Are you developing the recipes yourself ? Or do you have some people who specifically work on them ? <p> I 'm developing the information and coming up with our list of potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients and collaborate with food specialists and chefs . <p> We have n't identified many potential collaborators yet , but our focus will be on those that can maximize the flavor and create the tastiest recipes possible based on our ingredients . <p> What other sorts of information will we find The Longevity Cookbook ? <p> Another major part of the book will go deeper into the scientific side and explain specific studies , looking at things like caloric restriction and various types of dietary restriction . This involves taking out a particular nutrient , like say , amino acids . <p> We 'll talk about experiments performed on lab animals as well as some human data . We 'll explain how dietary restriction works and mention the experiments that show how removing a particular item from lab animals ' diets caused them to live longer . <p> I 'll be explaining a particular item " mTOR , which is a major pathway for aging . In this section , I will focus on specific foods and substances that inhibit mTOR , like caffeine and olive oil , once we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can you elaborate on mTOR and its effects on aging ? <p> It 's too complicated to go fully in-depth , but mTOR is implicated in many different processes in the cell . When active , it makes the cells grow and prevents autophagy , which is cleaning out damaged molecules . Our cells do n't  need excessive growth when we age , they just need maintenance . Suppressing mTOR pharmacologically using rapamycin has been shown to extend the lifespan in all lab animals it 's been tested on , from yeast to mice . <p> Why do you think people are n't interested in aging research ? <p> In my opinion , people just do n't think rationally . Our brains are not wired in a way that focuses on long-term issues like aging and death . And actually , people have a lot of barriers up around thoughts of death . Which makes sense , to an extent " if we went around thinking about death all the time , we would be constantly paranoid and our brains could n't handle it . <p> Aging is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unaware of any significant research regarding aging .

At the current rate of research , our near-future prospects just are n't that bright . <p> What specific efforts on aging research are interesting to you right now ? <p> I just started my PhD thesis about the genetic pathways that regulate the behavior of stem cells while they 're aging . My goal is to identify the interventions that would maintain the regenerative capacity of these tissues . The intersection of regeneration and aging has always fascinated me , because if we find a way to replace or replenish damaged tissue , we would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is there a way to do that yet ? <p> Identifying the genes that are responsible for age-related decline and applying drugs that would either activate or inhibit the genetic pathways . That 's a very straightforward approach . It depends on the types of cells and system that you 're looking at , but that 's probably the best way to go right now . In general , it applies to the stem cells themselves , but also to all cells in the body . <p> We 'd like to understand what changes genetic expression , what genes are turned on or off , what genes are becoming more or less active during aging , and the idea would be to figure out ways that we can bring the activity of the genes back to youthful levels . <p> Aging research is really diverse , because it 's so complicated . Some people approach it by looking at genetic interventions , some apply cell therapy , some are investigating the mechanisms of aging and cancer and how they 're related , some people are looking at circadian rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other aspects of aging research , beyond what you 've already mentioned , that you find particularly intriguing ? <p> We 've put together something that we call the Roadmap to Immortality ; it has seven major parts to it , and each of those has even more sub-topics . Basically , these technologies are being developed and researched in parallel ; some are far more advanced than others . The timeframe of bringing each aspect to life is different , and so that 's why I 'm focusing my research just on the biology of aging . Once more of these sections gets developed , we could be looking at potentially game-changing technologies ; artificial intelligence , once it 's created , could be the key to unlocking more technologies that would make radical life extension possible . <p> What do you see happening in the research of aging in the next ten years ? <p> One area that is advancing very quickly right now is the ability to regrow certain tissues and organs . Hopefully within the next ten years , we 'll be able to grow kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs in labs . The research and technology is advancing even now , but it 's just not completely there yet . Just like much of our research in aging , it 's not going to happen if we do n't find some sort of private money or a large government grant to fund it . <p> How do you think that could be possible within that timeframe ? <p> What I would really like to see is a large-scale government initiative aimed at curing aging , where there would be a lot of people working together to achieve this specific goal . We 've seen examples of this kind of initiative in the past : the Apollo Project , the Manhattan Project , the Large Hadron Collider . These were complicated tasks that were completed in a short amount of time after an injection of this vast amount of resources and manpower . I would also love to see an initiative to create a large , open-access scientific database that would allow every scientist on earth to share information , not just with other scientists , but with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific research , not just aging . If something like this were to be put together in the next ten years , we could accelerate our research exponentially . <p> I believe that curing aging is not a scientific task , but a technological task . Scientists know what they need to be doing , they just do n't have the means to do so yet . Humanity has a pretty good track record with technological advances that solve big problems , so I have faith that we can make it happen . But just like with the Apollo and Manhattan Projects , world-changing technology ca n't be accelerated without the necessary resources . <p> Why do you personally want to extend your life indefinitely ? <p> I think having an indefinite amount of time in the world for exploring it , for learning different sciences , languages , how to play various music instruments , spending time with the loved ones , meeting a lot of new friends , tapping into your creativity , and doing tons of other different things on Earth and maybe someday even in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that and more . Life is beautiful , I do n't  see the reason why it must end . <p> How long do you think you personally can live ? <p> I think that I personally have a good chance of living radically longer , even indefinitely . That 's the desirable scenario , of course . Right now the science does n't have a ready solution , but we do know that it 's possible . If something happened to me right now , like a car accident , my best chance would be cryopreservation . That 's plan B , though . Plan A is to continue pushing the research forward that would allow me to extend my life without such methods . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

The ants have woken up from their long winter 's sleep and suddenly they have moved into your kitchen , drawn in by the warmth and sugary crumbs . But before resorting to the commercial insect repellents found on the hardware store shelves that will simply spread dangerous chemicals throughout your house , there are many equally effective natural solutions . These natural solutions are much less expensive than anything available in the store , they are environmentally friendly , and safe to use around children and pets . Better yet , you likely have many of these solutions in your kitchen pantry . <h> What 's Wrong with Residential and Commercial Insecticide ? <p> Although many people realize the trickle-down effects of using harsh agricultural insecticides , this often does n't translate to acknowledging that residential use of similar chemicals can also cause environmental damage .

The Food and Drug Association ( FDA ) , has clear evidence linking these chemicals to cancer , nervous system disorders , and reproductive issues . Although they have n't made their use illegal they have definitely put regulations in place that monitor and restrict their use . When these chemicals are used indoors , they are far less likely to disperse and far more likely to be absorbed by the body , or settle onto the soft material surfaces to be absorbed later .

First the earth may cling to the small hairs and scales on the insects and slowly suck the moisture out of their bodies , killing them . Alternately it may also get between the scales on their body and cut them microscopically . Either way , it can be sprinkled inside cupboards , around doorways , and other high traffic ant areas and kill any ant that happens to wander across it .

Most people assume the most effective way to deal with pain is to turn to prescription drugs , or over-the-counter pain medications such as Advil and Tylenol . However , prescription pain medications can be extremely harsh on your system , and hard on your budget . They can often even come with risk of addiction . Also , using these pharmaceuticals to treat pain in children can be a difficult balancing act and sometimes dangerous . <p> The good news is that finding safe , natural and effective pain relief is easy ! People have been treating their pain with plant derived traditional methods since the origins of modern medicine , and these alternatives are still around today . Some modern-day pharmaceuticals are even derived from these herbal alternatives . Most importantly , these alternative medicines are better understood and backed up by solid scientific studies which prove their effectiveness . <h> 1 .

Its required for the formation of cortisol to regulate inflammation , aid in digestion , and control blood sugar . <p> Furthermore , recent studies show that diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol do not cause heart disease . Experts today are considering that insulin resistance is the greater culprit , perhaps among mitigating factors . While cholesterol does n't  need to be eliminated or considered the enemy of our hearts , it does need to be optimized . To promote heart health , prolific writer and health-activist Dr. Mercola recommends switching out the low-fat/low-cholesterol diet for a reduction in sugar , simple carbs and artificial fats ; adding regular exercise ; plenty of vitamin D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 <p> Read on to learn more about the truth and the benefits of body-essential cholesterol . <h> Dietary Cholesterol Does n't  Cause Heart Disease <p> The observations of a few researchers in the early 20th century " concluded " that cholesterol and a high fat diet caused heart disease . These studies have been more than sufficiently debunked . One epidemiological study , called the Seven Countries Study , reportedly used the data from 7 countries to support the hypothesis that a high fat diet led to high blood serum cholesterol , which then led to heart disease and increased risk of mortality from the disease . Fascinatingly , the data from 15 other nations was omitted . These unnamed nations showed opposing data . One report affirms , " The findings of the Seven Countries Study do not prove that saturates in the diet cause increased mortality " 2 Results in the omitted nations showed that the majority of subjects with a high fat diet had a low incidence of heart disease ; and others with a low-fat diet had a high incidence . <p> Although this study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coronary heart disease , the 7 countries report gained publicity and took ground , causing people to renounce foods such as organic eggs , milk and other healthy fats , unnecessarily . <h> Cholesterol Makes You Think <p> You need cholesterol for healthy brain function . The human brain averages about 2% of body weight , but contains 25% of its cholesterol . Research in 2001 revealed that cholesterol plays a vital role in the forming of synapses . A synapse is a connection or communication point between brain neurons . All of cognition including thinking , remembering and learning depend upon the function of synapses . If synapses are malformed or performing poorly , poor mental function follows . The study found that neurons with little or no cholesterol constructed few and weak synapses . When adequate cholesterol was reintroduced , the neurons again produced healthy synapses. 3- According to scientist Christ Masterjohn reporting on the study , when the neurons were treated with a concentrated solution of cholesterol , synapse formation increased by 12 times ! 4 <p> Thus , sufficient cholesterol must be present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Perhaps this is why scientists have lately suspected that statins and low-fat/low-cholesterol diets may be linked to cognitive decline and even Alzheimers Disease . <h> Cholesterol Forms Healthy Cells <p> The human body requires cholesterol in order to build healthy cells . The plasma membrane separates the inside of a cell from the outside . Its " selectively permeable , " meaning it allows certain substances to pass through , and blocks others . If this protective layer of the cell is lacking , then the wrong stuff can get in and the wrong stuff will be lost from the cell . Cholesterol makes up a significant and crucial portion of the cell membrane . Without it , the cell is in danger . <p> Cholesterol also plays a role in cell communication . As Masterjohn puts it , cell communication is vital so that " you function as a human , rather than a pile of cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounds funny .

This macromolecule has key factors that are crucial in fighting viruses . First , it 's able to attract viruses towards itself using electrostatic charges .

Increase your magnesium intake <p> The human body needs magnesium , but it cant make it , so it depends on a steady intake of this vital mineral for proper functioning . Its been estimated that 3 of every 4 Americans are suffering from some level of magnesium deficiency . Magnesium is a requirement for proper nerve functioning . Since migraines are a result of improper nerve impulses , more magnesium in the diet should help .

Foods that are high in magnesium include dark leafy greens like spinach , kale , turnip and mustard greens , sesame seeds , almonds , peanuts , cashews , pecans , walnuts , Brazil nuts , mackerel , tuna , pollock , halibut , soy beans , white beans , pinto beans , chick peas ( Garbanzos ) , green beans , kidney beans , black-eyed peas , millet , quinoa , Bulgar wheat , buckwheat , wild rice , oats , pasta barley , whole-grain breads and baked goods , avocados , cheeses , yogurt , kefir , bananas , apricots , dates raisins , currants , figs , and ( my favorite ) dark chocolate . <h> 4 . Take 5-HTP supplements <p> There is strong evidence that 5-Hydroxytrytophan has a strong preventative effect on migraines . This substance is manufactured in your body and increases the secretion of serotonin , a neurotransmitter that helps regulate circulation .

CoQ10 is readily available as a supplement , as well as in fish , organ meats like liver , and whole grains . <h> 6 . Feverfew <p> Feverfew is a bushy herb widely used for over 100 years in Chinese Medicine for prevention of migraines and other ailments .

This post from Harper 's Bazaar has put together a list of 15 foods to avoid , most of them being highly processed foods containing toxic ingredients and food additives . <p> We know we should stay clear of hard-and-fast food but some foods can seriously mess with your health . <p> " It does n't  mean you 'll get sick , get cancer , or die if you eat a dangerous food once , " says Nneka Leiba , deputy director of research at the Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) , which catalogs studies on potential toxins found in specific brand-name foods and ranks their safety in a massive database . " But there are certain foods you should avoid as much as possible if you have a choice . " <p> With that in mind , do your best to steer clear of the foods that scare Leiba , Harvest , and other registered dietitians : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American cheese is not cheese at all , " says Beth Warren , a New York-based registered dietitian and the author of Living a Real Life With Real Food . Depending on the brand , " its a factory creation of a cheese-like food made from a blend of milk fats , solids , some whey protein , emulsifiers , and food coloring . " Its high in sodium , and so high in fat that one regular slice more closely resembles high-fat meat than anything considered dairy , Warren adds . <p> 2 ) Processed Meats Made With Nitrates or Nitrites : Step away from the deli counter . Processed meats in the U.S. such as ham , salami , hot dogs , and bacon are n't  just full of unhealthy fats . They can have up to 400 percent ( ! ) more sodium and 50 percent more preservatives than unprocessed red meats . The worst part : Some contain nitrites and nitrates , chemical additives that have been linked to various cancers , but are still used to enhance color , promote taste , and prevent spoilage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so look out for them and opt for meats that do n't  contain them . <p> 3 ) Margarine : Because margarine is made from vegetable oils and has less cholesterol and saturated fat than butter , its long been considered the healthier option . But now that experts saydietary cholesterol is n't as harmful they thought , margarine , which is high in salt and contains artery-clogging trans fats , is n't looking quite so healthy . " Trans fat , like saturated fat , increases blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease , " explains Melissa Rifkin , a registered dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center in New York and a Rise nutrition coach . Margarines sold in tubs tend to contain less trans fat than margarine sticks " the softer the spread , the better for you " but olive oil ( or another source of monosaturated fat ) is still a better bet . Real butter is a close second , according to Rifkin . <p> 4 ) Regular Soda : Everyone knows that soda is Very Bad for your health . In case you missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . When you consume that much , your body responds by creating excess insulin , which typically helps the body absorb sugar from the bloodstream and use it for energy . Over time , though , this over-the-top response can increase your risk of developing diabetes and some forms of cancer . If sodas sugar content does n't  still does n't  scare you , its other ingredients might : The amount of caramel coloring you 'd consume in one can of soda per day was recently linked to a 58 percent greater risk of cancer , according to a new study . <p> 5 ) Diet Soda : While there 's no straight-up sugar in this stuff , there are artificial sweeteners , and they 're not necessarily any better . Not all artificial sweeteners are equally offensive . However , most have a more intense flavor than plain old sugar . Over time , the extra-sweet sweeteners can dull your senses to naturally sweet foods like fruits , Rifkin says . So yes , your Diet Coke could , theoretically , make a perfectly sweet apple taste worse . <p> 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised as " sugar-free " tend to contain artificial sweeteners too . ( See no. 5 above . ) Also : The digestive system does n't  do a great job at breaking down sugar substitutes and sugar alcohols , Harvest says . When you overdo it ( and the threshold is different for everyone ) you could incur some serious stomach pains . <p> 7 ) Conventionally Grown Apples : While a recent study found that conventionally farmed produce is n't nutritionally inferior to the stuff grown on organic farms , there 's no question that pesticides used to grow regular produce can damage the brain and nervous system , lead to cancer , disrupt your hormones , and lead to skin , eye , and lung irritation , according to dataassembled by the EWG . And pesticides tend to stick around on some fruits and veggies " even after you wash and peel them . <p> That said , there 's one exception : When your only food options are a conventional apple or a processed snack like a bag of chips .

Eggs : Some crazy shit goes down on non-organic farms , where chicken feed could include traces of caffeine , Tylenol , Benadryl , banned antibiotics , and arsenic , according to some reports . Now that McDonalds and Costco are phasing out chicken raised with antibiotics , conventional-chicken suppliers are likely to shift toward safer and more natural practices . Eventually , this could make it easier to find ( and afford ) the safest poultry and eggs . Until then : Organic eggs and organic chicken ( which may be less likely to carry salmonella , according to some research ) really are your safest bets , Rifkin says . <p> 10 ) Bread and 11 ) Crackers Made With Potassium Bromate : This chemical is used to help bread and cracker dough rise during the baking process " even though its been linked to certain cancers in animal studies and its banned in many other countries . That 's good enough reason for Leiba to recommend against eating it . Look for the ingredient on baked good labels or ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breads " then choose a potassium-bromate-free option , when you can . <p> 12 ) Microwave Popcorn : " Its not healthy eating out of a bag anymore , " Rifkin says . Microwave popcorn bags , in particular , are often lined with a chemical called perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) , which has been shown to affect fertility , cancer risk , and kidney functioning in animal and some human studies . Because microwave popcorn bags are n't  labeled " toxic , " its best to avoid them altogether . Another thing : Some brands of microwave popcorn add unhealthy trans fats to their products , and vaguely list " artificial flavors " or " natural flavors " on their labels " so there 's no way to know exactly what 's in there , Warren warns . In the worst case scenarios , the recipe could contain MSG , which can cause headaches or nausea , or diacetyl butter flavoring , which may cause respiratory damage when inhaled .

Unfortunately there are n't  a ton of studies done on cumulative exposure , so researchers do n't  know whether your penchant for tacosand propylparaben containing lotions could compound your risk , says Leiba , who tends to dodge such foods and products ( just in case ) . <p> 15 ) Any Packaged Food With More Than Two Ingredients You Ca n't I 'd .

BHT is no angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and lung and liver tumors . While ingredients can affect animals and humans differently , you might not want to be the guinea pig , Leiba says .

Even at 95 , her cognition was far from softening or slowing . <p> Which , of course , would be fascinating to any neuroscientist . The typical human brain shrinks over time , with neural connections atrophying and thick brain matter literally thinning .

In fact , dementia sets in for 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How can we all have what Kotelko had ? That question has put her extraordinary achievements at the center of Aga Burzynskas career . And that 's a good thing , because Burzynska is uncovering secrets about aging , memory , andhow to maintain a youthful mind . What she 's found suggests that Kotelkos edge was not in what she was born with , but what she did . Which means we all have a shot at the same incredible advantage . <p> Kotelko was an ordinary grandmother from West Vancouver , and those who met her were struck by her warmth and hooked on her legendary pierogi . For much of her life , she was too busy raising two girls as a single mother , teaching elementary school , and volunteering at her church to have any time for sports , save for bowling once a week . But when she retired in 1984 , she discovered her inner jock . First she joined a coed slow-pitch softball team . She loved the sport and played until she was 77 , but after crashing into a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to quit . At the suggestion of a friend , she switched to track and field . Kotelko went on to become a superstar in international masters competitions , winning 750 gold medals and setting 37 world records in sprinting , the long jump , the javelin throw , and other events . She competed for the final time in 2014 , in Hungary , just weeks before she passed away . Ever the self-deprecating charmer , she was quick to point out that she likely set so many records because no one else her age could even do the events . But in truth she was throwing and running farther and faster than much-younger women . ( here 's how much exercise you need to seriously lower your Alzheimers risk . ) <p> When Kotelko was 93 , she agreed to let scientists at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois study her brain . The night before her day in the lab , she had a conversation with Beckman Institute director Arthur Kramer , a cognitive psychologist and one of the worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The students conducting the study are excited , " Kramer told Kotelko , " but if you get tired , take a break . " <p> " Art , " she said , " I do n't  get tired . " <p> PHOTOGRAPH BY SCIENCE SOURCE <p> The Beckman researchers tested Kotelkos memory , problem-solving abilities , processing speed , and other cognitive skills . They also placed her in an MRI machineand scanned her brain . Although the team that conducted the study wrote a preliminary analysis of its findings , it did n't  publish the research immediately . A month later , Burzynska turned up at Beckman to start her new job as a postdoctoral researcher . As she began talking with her new colleagues about what kinds of research projects she might undertake , she heard about Kotelkos visit and the trove of data that awaited deeper analysis . " Could I take a look ? " she asked . <p> That was late summer 2012 , only a month after Kotelkos visit and tests . The two women " who , despite being decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood experiences " would never meet . <p> Kotelkos brain was not pristine . MRIs revealed a large number of tiny white dots , or hyperintensities , in her white matter , representing the kind of age-related changes commonly detected in the elderly . And her brain appeared to have shrunk slightly over time , but that 's also a given with aging , says Burzynska . Overall , though , Kotelkos brain was extraordinarily youthful for a woman just a few years shy of the century mark . " Looking at the structure of her brain , I would not have been able to say she was 93 , " Burzynska says . " I would have placed her in her 60s . " <p> For perspective , Burzynska and Kramer decided to compare Kotelkos data with the results of similar tests that the Beckman Institute had collected from a group of women ages 60 to 78 . For Burzynska , that meant spending long days working with MRIs , which needed to be refined and processed using special software .

Burzynska shared Kotelkos Eastern European heritage , having grown up in Poland , which borders Ukraine . The stories she heard from colleagues about Kotelkos childhood reminded her of her own upbringing . As she pondered the ghostly images of Kotelkos brain , Burzynska couldnt stop wondering : Did all that running , jumping , and , perhaps most crucially , learning at that late age help keep Kotelkos brain strong well into her tenth decade ? <p> The answer seems to be yes , though the explanation is more complex than the standard " exercise is good .

The neurons in the brain communicate with one another via axons , fibers that act like transmission lines . These are coated with a fatty substance called myelin . Together , axons and myelin form white matter . Myelin acts like an insulator , similar to plastic coating on electrical wires , and greatly increases how quickly and efficiently nerve signals travel from one region of the brain to another . This essentially defines cognitive abilities . People with intact white matter " college students , say " do best on all types of cognitive tests . <p> Myelin can become loose or degrade altogether in the aging brain . Some axons simply die off . As a result , signal transmission from one part of the brain to another " vital for clear thinking and solid memory " deteriorates and becomes less efficient . <p> After spending months poring over Kotelkos results , Burzynska discovered what made her brain unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thick swath of fibers that transfer nerve signals between the brains left and right hemispheres " transmitting thoughts , movement , and memory " was off the charts .

The bigger problem is that weight gain is not an end in itself . It sparks off a number of other serious health ailments including diabetes , arthritis , and cardiovascular problems . <p> It is a fact that major cause of rapid weight gain lies in sugar cravings . It is also not difficult to guess that what you eat translates to how you look and feel . <p> Gymnema Sylvestre is an herb that is known to traditional medicine for ages now . With its naturally diuretic , anti-inflammatory , and laxative properties , Gymnema Sylvestre puts a cap on sweet cravings effectively . <p> Gymnema Sylvestre is a plant native to tropical Australia and Africa . It is also found in the central and western parts of India . The herb has gradually found many takers also due to its anti-diabetic properties . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available sugars .

Gymnemic acids , which are bioactive constituents found in the herb , help in reducing sweetness experienced inside the mouth . <p> Moreover , there is evidence that this could have some link to appetite suppression as well . For example , a Behavior and Physiology study done in the 80s carries testament that Gymnema could actually have the power to reduce appetite .

This prevents glucose from latching on to the receptors , as a result , stopping the system from absorbing sugar . <p> The herbs ability to block sugar absorption is good news especially for diabetics . According to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the National Library of Medicine , Gymnema Sylvestre can help in controlling blood sugar levels in both Type 1 as well as Type 2 diabetics . <p> Improves insulin production Diabetes is a disease that commonly affects insulin production .

However , there could be certain exceptions to this , such as : <p> Pregnancy Not a lot is known about how this herb reacts when consumed by pregnant women . You may want to avoid use even when you are lactating . <p> Diabetes While Gymnema Sylvestre is known to help the diabetic condition , it may be important to keep an individual under monitoring . Since the herb controls the blood sugar levels in diabetics , it is necessary to watch out for low blood sugar or hypoglycemia . <p> Surgery Gymnema Sylvestre is known to affect blood glucose levels .

If you prefer capsules , take a 100 mg capsule three to four times daily . If you prefer it in powdered form , take about two to four grams daily .

" <p> Good sleep hygiene consists of a batch of behaviors that can help improve sleep efficiency " that is , the percentage of time in bed spent asleep as opposed to trying to sleep " as well as sleep duration and quality . Consistent wake times , exercise , and exposure to daylight promote healthy sleep , as does cutting down on naps , stimulants , light exposure , and screen time in the evenings .

A number of gene variations including hDEC2 and BHLHE41 have been found in short sleepers , people who do not seem to suffer from sleep deprivation even when they sleep six hours or less .

" <p> Another slippery concept at the heart of the science of snoozing is sleep quality . Measuring quality often means assessing whether a person has sleep onset insomnia ( trouble getting to sleep ) , sleep maintenance insomnia ( fragmented sleep ) , or early awakenings . " How does a person feel when they wake up in the morning ? " says Watson . " Do they have residual grogginess , fatigue during the day , night-time awakenings , those sorts of things ?

Nevertheless , they could be helpful , say Zandieh and Watson " in some cases . <p> Sleep Cycle <p> Motion Tracking Sleep Apps <p> Motion tracking apps like Sleep Cycle or bracelets like Actiwatch or Fitbit use an accelerometer to detect your movements in bed , in order to determine whether you are awake or are in lighter or deeper sleep . " Really none of those things ( like movement ) are measuring sleep , " says Watson , who treats all kinds of clinical sleep disorders . ( One study in the journal Sleep and Breathing found that movement-based activity monitors , " consistently misidentify wake as sleep and thus overestimate both sleep time and quality . " ) " They would be considered to be indirect measures of sleep . " Sleep specialists like Watson , in contrast , use an EEG to detect changes in brain activity that indicate different stages of sleep . <p> Also , most consumer devices have n't been tested rigorously by the scientific community . Orfeu Buxton , an associate professor at Penn State University who studies sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology tends to make questionable claims . " While there may be some science underlying it , rarely is it peer-reviewed and shared and evaluated " by independent researchers , he says . <p> Smart Alarm Clock <p> Sound-Recording Sleep Apps <p> Some sleep-related applications record nighttime sounds like snoring or external noise in order to help identify sleep issues . " Let me direct you to another articlewhere the app only worked well in a soundproof environment , " says Zandieh . This study found that a variety of recording sleep apps had difficulties in telling snoring sounds apart from other noises . <p> The Aura by Withings <p> Smart Alarms <p> Sleepers cycle through four sleep stages where brain waves gradually slow and sleep deepens . After the final stage of deep sleep comes a spurt of REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep , where your eyes dart back and forth and during which you are most likely to dream . Using various sensors , smart alarms claim to use the aforementioned sleep measuring systems to rouse you during lighter , non-REM sleep . One device , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and activity through a sensor placed under the mattress , and wakes you up with a blue light designed to suppress the body 's production of the hormone melatonin , which regulates our bodies internal clocks . <p> But Zandieh issues a caveat : " All of these apps try to work on physiologic processes of our sleep-wake cycle , which is complicated and often can not be captured through algorithms . " While people awakened from deep sleep often feel groggy and disoriented , she does n't  see evidence for avoiding waking during REM sleep . " To this day , I have not found any research articles that report that waking up from REM sleep is any different than waking up after NREM ( non rapid eye movement ) sleep with regards to feeling more refreshed or not , " says Zandieh . " There is literature stating that this may affect parasomnias ( abnormal sleep behaviors such as sleepwalking , nightmares , sleep paralysis and sleep aggression ) but not overall sleep efficiency . " Somneo Sleep Trainer <p> An experimental mask designed to help soldiers reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambient noise and visual distractions and carries a heating element around the eyes , based on the finding that facial warming helps send people to sleep . It also has an EEG monitor . <p> " We do know that the ideal sleep environment is cool , dark , and quiet , " says Watson . " And quiet , yes , but really what you want to avoid are spikes in noise from the background . " <p> The masks warming aspect is interesting , he says : " There 's some research out there that taking a warm bath before going to sleep can increase deep non-REM sleep . " Some more recent research suggests that a cool cap can help insomniacs . " Whether or not heat or cold applied to the head area is conducive to sleep may depend on the person and what their issues are , " says Watson . Dietary Supplements <p> Omega-3 fatty acids , such as those found in fish oils , are being used by the military to help soldiers to sustain performance over 48 hours without sleep as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oxford have shown thatchildren who receive omega-3 experience fewer sleep disturbances . <p> Watson has another well-known dietary suggestion for more sleep : " There 's some evidence that the tryptophans in some foods can be sedating . " Tryptophan is a precursor of serotonin that is thought to produce healthy sleep and a stable mood . High tryptophan foods include nuts , seeds , cheese , tofu , some meats and fish , oats , beans , lentils , and eggs . Drugs For Alertness <p> Provigil is a prescription medicine that helps to elevate levels of hypothalamic histamine , a wakefulness-promoting agent . Its usually prescribed to patients who experience excessive sleepiness due to sleep disorders . <p> " The military are using medication like Provigil to help soldiers stay more alert when they are awake , which are not stimulants like Ritalin and thus less addictive , " says Zandieh . Studies are also underway in police and fire departments to see whether Provigil can help personnel working night shifts .

The thinking is that with these particularly intense slow waves induced by TMS , people could . <p> Watson says its hard to offer a conclusive assessment . " Sleep is really a complicated physiology which is driven by areas which are deep within the brain : the hypothalamus and the pons ( it plays a key role in REM sleep and dreaming ) and the medulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I would imagine that those are areas more difficult to influence with transcranial magnetic stimulation than some of the more cortical areas that you might stimulate for mood . " Sleep Schedules <p> Polyphasic and segmented sleep schedules , both of which advocate sleeping in several blocks during a 24-hour cycle , have been proposed as alternatives to the more traditional eight hours a night . <p> " We know that shift workers sleep less than those who sleep during nighttime and we know that there are a lot of untoward consequences to shift work , including increased risk for cardiovascular disease , cancer , motor vehicle accidents , and things of that nature , " says Watson . " We evolved a light-dark cycle and our bodies are most efficient at performing the critical activities of sleep at nighttime in our normal circadian rhythm . " <p> Optimizing sleep through technology , Zandieh emphasizes , does not mean reducing sleep duration .

This is because some that are acidic outside of the body , become alkaline forming when digested . Further , different bodies may show different results because each persons inner chemistry is somewhat unique , and- foods will differ in acid/alkaline balance based on various factors such as freshness , conditions of soil or , if animal foods , quality of feed . Dairy products , for instance , are often assumed acid forming because they contain lactic acid . However , this is a " weak " acid , and the more fresh the milk , the lesser the level of lactic acid .

There are many books available with guidelines and instructions ; and most healthcare professionals today are not only familiar with , but also proponents of the alkaline diet . Here are some simple guidelines to help you begin to make changes that will assist your body in achieving overall disease resistance , health and longevity . <h> 1 . Get To Know Your pH <p> If your fluids are overly acid or alkaline , it indicates the same condition in the blood , which is trying to release either acid or alkaline compounds through bodily fluids in order to keep pH normal and maintain life . Therefore , many will test their saliva and/or urine in order to determine whether their diet is imbalanced and weakened to dis-ease ; or balanced and strengthening for life . <p> You can purchase pH test strips in most drug and even grocery stores . Be sure to take morning samples before consuming any food or drink ; and evening samples at least two hours after intake of any food or drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both saliva and urine even before you make any dietary changes . That way you can measure the difference as you move into the alkaline diet . In the beginning , taking a few samples throughout the day may help you to calculate an average , which is a good way to determine the overall pH value , as well as become familiar with the effects of certain meals upon your pH. <h> 2 . Aim For a Healthy pH Balance <p> Opinions differ but the healthy pH measurement of saliva is typically a bit more acidic , necessary for digestive processes , at about 6.4 up to 7.0 <p> For urine , a good pH would range from 6.5-8.0 , depending on proximity to meals and time of day . A value of- 6.5-7.0 in the morning is normal for the urine , but should become more alkaline at 7.5-8.2 by evening . Anything outside of these parameters may be an indication of health imbalance . <p> If you are to far on either end of the scale , adjust diet , and talk to your healthcare professional about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know What You 're Eating <p> In general , alkaline diet pros recommend we eat about a 4:1 ratio of veggies to meat , alkalizing foods to acidifying foods . The idea is a familiar one . <p> There are tons of acid/alkaline food charts available to the public. 1 Here are some initial notes to run with . <p> All fresh , raw veggies are alkaline forming foods . Some are more alkalizing than others , such as avocado , broccoli , sweet potatoes and cucumber . Examples of slightly alkalizing veggies are artichokes and onions . <p> Fruits differ widely.Citrus fruits such as grapefruits , lemons and limes are surprisingly alkalizing in the body , along with young bananas ( not overripe ) , watermelon and coconut . But apples , blueberries , cranberries , peaches and strawberries are slightly acidifying . <p> Beans and legumes are mostly alkalizing , but chickpeas and red beans can also be slightly acidifying . <p> Dairy foods such as fresh cheese and fresh buttermilk , or raw whole milk are wonderfully alkalizing . <p> Cultured dairy such as fresh yogurt and kefir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet in the case of candida , which thrives in an alkaline environment . <h> 4 . Be Familiar With the Tenets of Food Combining <p> In general , there are no hard and fast rules that best suit every " birthday suit . " But there are strong guidelines concerning which foods ought not to be consumed together , in order for optimal digestion ; thus , absorption ; thus , nourishment ; thus , health and longevity . These are some general tenets of food combining : <p> Avoid combining proteins with starch and sugars . That means skip the bun with your hamburger . You also want to avoid sugary foods . Both of these can prevent digestion of proteins , as the body work on carbohydrates first , causing the meat to sit around for far too long , impeding nutrient absorption and causing fermentation . <p> Eat fruit by itself . Fruit tends to digest faster than all other foods . If ingested with slow metabolizing foods such as meat , the fruit will tend to remain in the stomach for too long , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours following your meal . The sugars will immediately attract the digestive processes <p> and slow or stop digestion of foods already eaten . <p> This can be way more fun and easy than it at first seems .

Your own body will ultimately tell you which foods and food combinations help to maintain healthiest pH for you . If you 're feeling called to an alkaline diet , many nutritionists and health professionals including doctors and naturopaths can assist you in your new goals , and you can also check the local bookshelves for everything from cookbooks to personal testimonies of how eating an alkaline diet has changed peoples lives . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Although traditionally used to alleviate constipation and stimulate labor in pregnant women , it is now being used for its many other potential health benefits . Castor oil uses go far beyond traditional applications , including beauty treatments , lubricating everything from the kitchen scissors to bicycle pumps , and even pest control . Everyone should have a bottle of castor oil in their cupboards at home , you never know when it might come in handy ! <h> 1 . - Hair and Skin Health <p> Castor oil benefits cover many home beauty routines . For example , did you know that castor oil stimulates hair growth ? Slowly rub a small heated amount of oil into the roots of your hair ( or even your eye brows ) . Be careful that it is n't overly hot , just warm to the touch . This warm oil is thought to stimulate circulation , which then triggers hair growth .

It will alleviate the persistent itchiness and reduce dandruff . <h> 2. - Soothes Joint and Muscle Pain <p> Long used by homeopaths and within traditional medicines , castor oil targets inflammation when applied topically . Castor oil contains roughly 90% ricinoleic acid , which has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties . Castor oil , even when applied topically , is able to penetrate deep into the tissues and loosen up any toxins , wastes and other clogging substances trapped within your lymphatic system . For people suffering from arthritis , try mixing cayenne pepper with castor oil , warming it up gently between the palms and massaging it into the joints .

There is no cure , and no known specific cause but there are some theories mainly around issues with gas and bloating as their digestive tract is still in development when so young . Because colic is so hard to manage , there are many home remedies mothers have developed over the course of history to help soothe newborns who suffer from it . One such remedy is castor oil . When a small amount is rubbed on their abdomen it soothes their colic and helps put them to sleep without unnecessary disruption . <h> 4. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castor oil works as a natural sleep aid for adults as well . By rubbing small amounts on your eyelids , or onto your temples before bed , easily soothe yourself into a deep nights sleep .

It also helps people who have difficulty falling asleep initially . What 's important is that for people who seem to never get a full seven hours of rest , or have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep cycle during the night , castor oil is a great natural and safe sleep aid . Get a good night 's rest without resorting to potentially addictive sleeping pills . <h> 5. - Pest Control <p> A final great tip for using castor oil around the home is its use for garden pest control , aimed towards furry creatures . In the spring and summer months , gardens become infested with burrowing creatures such as moles , voles , skunks , racoons , and rats . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a perfectly manicured lawn , or in a bed of roses . A natural and safe alternative to other pest control methods , castor oil is also cheap and easy to apply .

When applied a few times during the week , this oil should keep the critters away without resorting to harsh chemicals or kill traps . <h> Precautions <p> When trying any herbal remedy for the first time , it is important to always be on the lookout for possible side effects . If you are using castor oil topically , always test a small patch of skin to check for allergies . If taking orally , start with the very minimal dosage .

Some might just like to relax on the beach , go for a walk in nature or just be quiet and still for a length of time , concentrating on their breathing . All these activities clear our hearts and minds of negativity . <p> SELF ACCEPTANCE I find this to be an important step to finding inner peace . We need to know who we are , accept who we are and love who we are . If we seek to be someone else , or live outside of our own personality or character , we loose our identity . We were created to be the unique person we are , with our own unique gifts and talents . Sure , we might have a lot of singers out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . Love who you are and appreciate your own uniqueness . <p> DISCIPLINE This is something we often reject , for we find it confining . When we fail to accept discipline , we reject true freedom . Freedom is not found in doing what we like , when we like or how we like . Although this sounds like freedom , freedom is found in being disciplined to make the right choices in life . Rebellion is not freedom , unless it is to rebel against unrighteousness . Discipline is having an organized mind and a steadfast heart , to know the truth and act upon it . This gives us peace . <p> A GENEROUS SPIRIT When we know that God is our provider , we can be inspired towards generosity . We live our lives not seeking what we can get out of life , but what we can give to life . We see others ' needs beyond our own . It is in giving that we receive . If we show patience towards others , we receive patience back . It is the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positivity . It can be applied in our finances , in our love or in our faith . This gives us inner peace . <p> OUR FAITH Our faith also plays an important role in finding our inner peace . When our faith is placed on what we can do and achieve in our own strength , we misplace our faith . When we experience God 's faithfulness and grace , our faith in God grows . Then we realize our faith is based on our trust in God , and His strength to help us achieve the impossible . Then our confidence is based on what God can do in and through us . We have inner peace in this knowledge . <p> IN CONCLUSION Inner peace is obtainable in many ways , but the true source of our peace derives from our love ; our love for God and for others . Mostly it derives from God , who is love .

Much of the iron in the body is found in red blood cells which are responsible in carrying oxygen to every cell in the body . Iron also is involved in producing the bodys energy source called the ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) . The extra iron is not excreted ; instead it is stored in the liver , bone marrow , spleen , and muscles . Iron deficiency results in poor oxygen-carrying capacity of the red blood cells , which results to fatigue , poor work performance and decreased immunity .

Well , the answer here lies in the health of your gut flora . Before we go any further and see how you can bring out the best of your gut flora for a healthy body , first let 's take a quick look at what this concept is all about . <p> The gut flora is basically a collective term given to the group of microscopic organisms which live in your intestinal system . Also referred to as your microbiome , such bacteria and other microorganisms in your gut play few very important functions in your body , such as : <p> Regulating the absorption of nutrients <p> Strengthening your immune system <p> Enhancing your disease fighting abilities <p> Influencing the pace of brain development and memory <p> Facilitating weight gain or loss <p> Fat absorption How does it matter ? <p> Recent research points towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to absorb more calories from diet and thus , have a direct link with obesity .

Test strips are crucial for ensuring your water levels are correct or , if not , for helping you determine which chemical to add . You always should make sure you have chemicals on hand to balance out the alkalinity , pH and sanitizer levels , along with performing a shock treatment on your spa . <p> Alkaline Balance <p> The most difficult part of testing the alkalinity of your hot tub is retrieving the test strip from the container .

Ideal hot tub pH levels are between 7.2 and 7.8 . When they fall below this , the water becomes very acidic and can cause eye irritation and put your hot tub at risk for corrosion . If the numbers are too high , the water becomes dirty , cloudy and unsafe .

It 's recommended you use dichlor shock when replacing the water in your hot tub and non-chlorine shock for regular maintenance . <p> Sanitizers <p> Three types of sanitizers are used in hot tubs : chlorine , bromine and salt . Of the three , chlorine and bromine are the least expensive , which is why they are most commonly used . Salt water systems , which ultimately generate chlorine and bromine from salt , typically are not found in hot tubs because salt easily can corrode any metal parts within the tub . Sanitizing chemicals are essential to the safety of your hot tub . Too much or too little of these chemicals makes the water unsafe . It is important to check the levels of sanitizer daily and make adjustments as needed . Caring for a hot tub can be a lot of work , but is well worth it when you 're able to relax in the warm , bubbly water at the end of a long day .

After all , the reason that underwires are incorporated in some bras is to provide extra lift and support , and bra fit and comfort is a very personal and individual issue . So , some women find that they benefit from the fit of a bra with a metal underwire , but there are all kinds of worrying rumors about the safety of these bras . The question is , are bras with metal underwires dangerous ? If they are dangerous , what are the risks ? <p> The most common problems that women have with underwire bras come from direct contact with the metal of the underwire . This is only possible when the bra is very worn or threadbare , or when the metal underwire breaks , because the underwire is enclosed in a channel of cloth at the base of the bra . Furthermore , metal underwires are always coated in plastic , so that direct contact with the metal is less likely . Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause injury or health problems , which means that wearing a bra with a metal underwire is never perfectly risk-free . <p> Exposure to underwire metal can result in immediate health problems in two different ways , which are cuts and punctures , and rashes and skin irritation . When a metal underwire breaks , it can have a very sharp point or edge , which can easily poke through the surrounding fabric . Given the right timing or positioning , that sharp edge can cause serious cuts , or even penetrate deep into the skin and surrounding tissue . Alternatively , if the metal of the underwire is exposed by wear and thinning of the material that surrounds it , the metal itself can cause varying degrees of skin problems . Sometimes , this is due to an allergic reaction to a metal that is in the underwire , especially if the underwire contains nickel . <p> Recently , with the increasing use of Automatic External Defibrillators ( AEDs ) in emergency situations where someone has gone into cardiac arrest , there has been growing concern about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal underwire bra . Specifically , there are rumors that the electric shock delivered by the defibrillator will be conducted through the metal of the underwires , causing severe burns , or even lighting the bra on fire . However , the actual risk of being injured in this way is very small . For there to be any risk at all , the metal of the underwire must be exposed , so that it can make contact with the skin , and that means that the bra must be damaged . Also , an exposed underwire will only conduct electricity from the defibrillator if the paddles are placed in the wrong location , making them closer to the underwire than they should be if the defibrillator is to function properly . Finally , although AEDs are now common in public places and may sometimes be used by people who are not medical personnel , the majority of AED use is by paramedics , who are trained to cut away a womans bra before using the defibrillator . <p> Even when there is no damage or breakage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they fit . This is because underwire bras often fit more tightly around the breasts , and put more pressure on the breasts , than bras without an underwire . For women who have recently had a mastectomy , who are nursing , or who have sensitive breasts , the pressure caused by an underwire can be uncomfortable or painful . In fact , the issue of the pressure caused by an underwire bra has created some medical myths of its own , which need to be addressed . <p> There is a pervasive myth that says that wearing an underwire bra will give you breast cancer , and it remains firmly a myth , without basis in medical fact . The origin of this misunderstanding comes from the book Dressed to Kill , published in 1995 by Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer , a couple of anthropologists . The authors , who are not medical doctors , claim that wearing an underwire bra restricts drainage of fluid in the breast tissue through the lymph nodes , and therefore marinates the breast tissue in toxins . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of any medical study , and they exhibit a fundamental lack of understanding of the lymph system . The lymph nodes that handle drainage of bodily fluids from the breasts are located in the armpits and so drainage is upward and toward the arms , not downward past the underwire . In other words , a bra underwire ca n't prevent your body from draining toxins from your breast tissue , because an underwire does n't  cut off or restrict anything relevant to lymph function . <p> Another rumor making the rounds of the Internet suggests that the pressure from bra underwires has a negative effect on the wearer on the basis of acupuncture or acupressure . This belief is fueled primarily by ideas from an article called " Chinese Lessons For Modern Chiropractors " by Dr. George Goodheart , who was a Doctor of Chiropractic , and not an MD . Essentially , the idea that the pressure from a metal underwire is problematic for reasons of acupressure assumes a belief in bodily " meridians " and an insubstantial life force called qi , or chi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not recognized by mainstream medical science .

If such a common , basic item could hurt you , and especially if it could somehow put your life at risk , it would be horrifying .

This post from Esquire shows how to get in , and then get the hell out . <p> Exercise too often goes toe-to-toe with free time for space in our schedules . Who has the flexibility to spend 80 minutes at the gym , not including the time it takes to get there and back home again ? If you feel like your workouts take too long , you can make adjustments . Read on for seven tips that will shave minutes " a lot of them " off your workout so you can squeeze more exercise into your week . <h> Tip 1 : Have a Concrete Plan <p> Imagine going to the grocery store with a shopping list : " I 'm going to get these things , and then I 'm going to get the hell out . " The same goes for workouts . People usually walk into the gym without any clue of what they 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pick ? Suddenly , aimless wandering turns what was supposed to be a 30-minute workout into an hour . <p> Walk into the gym with a plan ready to rock . Heres what you should know in advance : your warmup drills , your exercises , the number of sets and reps , and what weight you will use . <h> Tip 2 : Use Supersets <p> A " superset " is a circuit of a few exercises done consecutively . Use it instead of " straight " sets , where you finish all the sets and reps of one exercise before moving onto the next . <p> For example , with a straight set you would do five heavy squats , rest your legs for about two minutes , do another five heavy squats , etc . With a superset , however , you can target a different body part that is n't tired by knocking out other exercises while resting your legs . <p> Try this total body superset , resting for 30 to 45 seconds between exercises : <p> With this sequence , you can hit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tip 3 : Do Fewer Exercises <p> here 's a common newbie mistake : If someone wants to strengthen their chest , theyll do a barbell bench press , a decline bench press , an incline bench press , dumbbell chest flyes , pushups , cable flyes , and God knows what else . Not only does that waste time , its also useless . <p> Instead of doing a dozen exercises to strengthen one muscle group , pick one or two key lifts " like bench presses and pushups for your chest " and use a heavier amount of weight . Then , the next time you go to the gym , try to use slightly more weight . Your muscles will grow " I promise . <h> Tip 4 : Warm Up Better <p> What do you do to warm up when you get to the gym ? Jog on the treadmill for 15 minutes ? Stretch ? Flirt with the people at the front desk ? You can do better by simplifying your workout . <p> Start by foam rolling for two to three minutes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Youll save time and prepare your body better than any treadmill or jump rope routine could . <h> Tip 5 : Eliminate Distractions <p> Too often , people sit around the gym and kill time by scrolling through Facebook and sending life-changing texts like " k . " Instead of wasting time , no texts , no social media , and no books or magazines . Just get to the gym , keep your head down , and do your workout . By the way , if you 're exercising at the right intensity , you should be focused on catching your breath between sets , not tweeting . <h> Tip 6 : Give Yourself a Time Limit <p> Isnt it funny how if you only have 10 minutes to do something , you 'll get it done in exactly 10 minutes ? If your workouts last too long , set a timer and force yourself to race against the clock ; once your timer goes off , finish those last few reps and leave the gym guilt-free . It might seem too fast at first , but you 'll get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tip 7 : Know Your Substitutes <p> Despite your best efforts to stay busy at the gym , you might find yourself waiting for a bench press , T-bar row , or squat rack . ( Just kidding " the squat rack is always empty . ) Instead of waiting , do a substitute . Want the barbell bench press ? Grab some dumbbells and find a bench or do floor presses . Want T-bar rows ? Use cables or do inverted rows on a Smith Machine . And on the off-chance that the squat rack is taken , grab a heavy dumbbell and do goblet squats . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

@@24920742 @4920742/ <h> Get regular bowel movements with these herbs <p> Having irregular bowel movements can be a sign of numerous health issues . Getting to the point where one is having regular bowel movements is one of the best forms of feedback one can get in determining that their diet and digestive tract are operating properly and efficiently . The body excretes what it consumes and a lot can be learned from irregularities in bowel movements . Additionally , in Chinese Medicine we often ask many questions about the stool as it is a clue to the health of the inside of the body . Luckily , having regular bowel movements is not too difficult , as it is the natural way the body is meant to work . Outlined below are a few simple tips for helping restore the natural rhythm of your digestive system . <p> One method for helping to have regular bowel movements is to try to have a bowel movement at a regular time . Even if the urge is not there , sitting down and trying to have a movement at a predetermined time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time at which it should be having a bowel movement . For many people , having a bowel movement in the morning before showering is the optimal time to do so . Therefore , sitting down and attempting to have a bowel movement before bathing in the morning is a good choice ; however , it does not matter at what time one tries to have a bowel movement as long as it is consistent . Attempting to have a movement in the morning one day only to attempt one in the afternoon the following day will not help with improving the regularity of the movement . <p> In addition to regularity in terms of frequency , having a regular and proper consistency is vital . If the stool is too hard or too soft , it is a sign of poor movement through the large intestine . For example , if the stool is too soft or is watery it means that the stool passed through the large intestine too quickly and enough water was not absorbed back into the body . This is getting you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watery stool can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance . On the other hand , an extremely dry and hard stool means that it took too long to pass through the large intestine and too much water was absorbed back into the body . Hard stools can cause many issues with your health . Dry stools often cause pain and bearing down which lead to hemorrhoids , anal fissures , and pain . Pain will often make you put off eliminating your stool even more . Worst of all , the large intestine is mainly an organ of absorption . This means there is fecal matter in there that is beginning to rot and overgrow with bad bacteria , these toxins can then start to absorb into your body . <p> One of the best things to do for maintaining proper stool properties is to have a diet with plenty of fiber . Fiber can be found in many foods including whole grain breads , crackers , cereals , and pasta . Additionally , many food products are fortified with fiber . Another popular choice for people are supplements like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber and are great at absorbing toxins and such in order to be eliminated . Flax seed also contains essential Omega-3 fatty acids . This makes flax seed itself a double action supplement that is great for daily use ! <p> Maintaining a well balanced diet and eating regularly is vital to having regular bowel movements . If eating is sporadic and inconsistent , the body will be digesting foods at different times . For example , if you happen to eat a big meal late at night some days but not others , the food that is eaten late at night will be moving through the digestive tract at a different time than on days when you eat at regular intervals throughout the day . In addition to eating at consistent times , maintaining a balanced diet will do wonders for maintaining regular bowel movements . Skewing a diet too far in one direction will have an adverse affect on the entire digestive tract . For example , eating too much dairy and fats will result in a tight , soft , and oily stool when compared to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits ( especially when time is taken to sit and enjoy your food , not eating while driving or working etc. ) and eating a wide diverse amount of foods . <p> Let 's talk about some herbs and various usages . There are a few different categories for herbs when it comes to producing regular stools . Here are the different ways you can categorize the herbs : <p> Purgatives : Purgatives are herbs that we use to induce bowel movements . Herbs have different ways of doing this like : strongly stimulating peristalsis or flooding the large intestine with water . Purgatives are commonly used for short term issues and should be prescribed by herbalists or used only when needed and for short term use . Purgatives can cause dependency and other issues if used incorrectly . When used in balanced formulas in small amounts some purgative herbs can be used long term . <p> Non-dependant Laxatives : Non-dependant laxatives are just as the name says . Unlike purgatives , non-dependant laxatives provide help to the bowel to help keep you regular . These herbs have a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducing peristalsis , providing bulk and more . When used correctly these herbs can be used to create a regularity of the bowel . <p> Moistening Herbs : Moistening herbs are the safest of all the herbs . Most of these herbs are seeds and therefore many foods do the same actions as the herbs . These seeds and herbs have oils and other properties to them that moisten your large intestine . This is the most important category for elderly people . <p> These 3 categories can typically categorize all the different herbs used for constipation and promoting bowel movements . Here are some popular herbs for each category : <p> Rhubarb Root / Da Huang : Rhubarb root is a strong purgative and is very effective at promoting bowel movements . This is the number one herb used in Chinese Medicine for excess constipation that needs a quick remedy . When the problem is related to dryness with the stool , then more herbs need to be used to increase water in the large intestine for a bowel movement to avoid pain , like Mang Xiao . Da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with few herbs . As this herb has other good functions it is used in smaller amounts in formulas for bowel health for longer periods of time and is often an ingredient in colon cleansers . <p> Cascara Sagrada : Cascara Sagrada is a famous western herb used as a laxative . I categorize this as a non-dependant laxative . Cascara Sagrada effectively moistens the bowel , provides some bulk and light peristalsis to be a reliable herb for bowel movements and creating regularity . This herb is easily found and should be a main ingredient in most formulas . Since it is n't as strong it is a perfect fit to be a main ingredient when taking a formula longer term . <p> Huo Ma Ren / Canabis Seed : I am using Huo Ma Ren as an example for moistening the large intestine herbs because it is by far the most prescribed medicinal herb for this purpose . In my opinion Flax Seed would be the closest food that people take on their own . These herbs are important in long term stool regularity and should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are the most important herbs for the elderly as dryness is the issue here . <p> A note on Senna Leaf / Fan Xie Ye : I would like to put a note in here regarding Senna Leaf as it is widely used and popular . Senna is a very dependant herb and a strong laxative . Additionally , Senna has recent research showing it has cancerous properties . Although this is also a Chinese Herb it is highly discouraged from use due to recent research on the herb . I highly recommend not taking this herb , ESPECIALLY long term . <p> Remember that bowel movements are the major way that your body gets rid of waste out of your body . Not only can a daily bowel movement encourage the removal of toxins from your body , but also prevent the stool from actually adding toxins into the body . <p> For those looking for quality premade formulas on the market . Whether you have any kind of issue with bowel movements you want to correct , taking pain medication that is causing constipation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a well balanced formula with proven results and is safe , I recommend a Bowel Tonic . Additionally , a bowel flush or colon cleanser may be needed to clear the intestines of old waste so you can start fresh . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Every year nearly 50 percent of people make a New Year 's resolution , but most people struggle to keep them . In fact most people give up after only two weeks , and only 8 percent of people actually achieve their New Year commitments . This does n't mean that 2017 has to fall into the same old rut of failure , because there are many easy ways to not only set yourself up for success but to actually surpass your original New Years goals . <p> The helpful advice available for the most common resolutions is unlimited , which is why we 've taken the time to synthesize some of the best bits for you . This is the one-stop-shop for the top 5 New Year 's Resolutions , including great advice on how to stick to them . <h> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who make a New Year 's Resolution aim to get in shape , it also should n't be surprising that its also the least achieved . Losing weight and getting fit is a long term , and all-encompassing goal . It can be a complete lifestyle adjustment for some , and therefore extremely hard to stick to . So what can you do to make this easier on yourself ? <p> Consider each aspect of getting in shape : diet , exercise , lifestyle changes , then break each aspect down into tiny goals such as eating more greens each day , exercising 3 times a week , or quitting junk food .

@@24920749 @4920749/ <h> The Ultimate Guide to Companion Planting <p> Companion planting is the methodology of growing certain plants together in order to increase yield , reduce pest infestations and allow one plants characteristics to benefit others . The idea of planting certain plants together has been practiced by farmers around the world since the development of early agriculture , around 8,000 BC . <p> Through trial and error , farmers discovered that some plants flourished next to others , while alone they languished . These traditions were passed down from generation to generation , applied by farmers hoping to avoid unnecessary crop failure due to pests , drought and disease while at the same time increasing crop production . Although these primitive farmers may not have understood the science behind why certain combinations worked , inevitably different cultures around the world developed their own sets of winning companion plants that improved the chances of success . <p> There are a few extremely well known examples of companion gardening which have been well proven even in modern times , to increase yield and mutual plant protections .

If ever there were three plants meant to grow in unison , it is this famous trio . They represent one of the best examples of how well companion planting can work . <p> Shockingly , due to the monoculture farming practices of the past century , companion planting is becoming a long-forgotten practice . Industrial farms these days rely on fertilizers to replace lost nitrogen , or pesticides to reduce insects .

The prevalence of higher rates of colon and pelvic disease in populations of western countries places the blame on chair-like toilets . <p> Is the Western toilet in part responsible for problems like hemorrhoids , constipation , IBD ( Inflammatory Bowel Disease ) , appendicitis , and even heart attacks ? <p> If you examine the data , there is a great deal of evidence this is true . The modern toilet has required us to change the position we use to evacuate our bowels , which changes the anatomy of well , a poop , to put it bluntly . <p> Infants instinctively squat to defecate , as does the majority of the worlds population . But somehow the West was convinced that sitting is more civilized . <p> Sitting on the modern Thomas Crapper-style sit-down toilet is designed to place your knees at a 90-degree angle to your abdomen . However , the time-honored natural squat position places the knees much closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships of your intestinal organs and musculature , optimizing the forces involved in defecation.1 <p> Sitting to evacuate your bowel requires you to apply additional force ( straining ) , which has some unwanted biological effects , including a temporary disruption in cardiac flow . <p> Can the Toilet Be Blamed for Increasing Rates of Colon and Pelvic Disease ? <p> Squatting is the way our ancestors performed their bodily functions until the middle of the 19th Century . Chair-like toilets were reserved for the royals and the disabled . But the " progress " of westernized societies may be partly to blame for higher rates of colon and pelvic disease , as described by a report in the Israel Journal of Medical Science:2 <p> " The prevalences of bowel diseases ( hemorrhoids , appendicitis , polyps , ulcerative colitis , irritable bowel syndrome , diverticular disease , and colon cancer ) are similar in South African whites and in populations of prosperous western countries . Among rural South African blacks with a traditional life style , these diseases are very uncommon or almost unknown . " <p> As globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilets are being converted to sitters . For example , Thailands Health Ministry just announced it will replace squat toilets with the sit-down varieties at all public facilities.3 This may be a bad thing for public health , as a wide range of health problems have been associated with the transition from squatting to sitting . In fact , health problems potentially stemming from the sitting position include the 15 outlined in the following table . <p> Evidence suggests bowel and pelvic problems may be related to improper potty posture . Only with the traditional squat position is your body aligned in a way that promotes complete bowel emptying . As you can see from the diagram , squatting actually straightens and relaxes your rectum . <p> Reference : Tagart REB . The Anal Canal and Rectum : Their Varying Relationship and Its Effect on Anal Continence , Diseases of the Colon and Rectum 1966 : 9 , 449-452 . <p> According to Jonathan Isbit of Natures Platform : <p> " For safety , nature has deliberately created obstacles to evacuation that can only be removed by squatting . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why the conventional sitting position deprives the colon of support from the thighs and leaves the rectum choked by the puborectalis muscle.These obstacles make elimination difficult and incomplete " like trying to drive a car without releasing the parking brake . <p> Chronically incomplete evacuation , combined with the constant extraction of water , causes wastes to adhere to the colon wall . The passageway becomes increasingly constricted and the cells start to suffocate . Prolonged exposure to toxins will often trigger malignant mutations . " <p> He goes on to explain how the kink where your sigmoid joins your rectum ( refer to the colon diagram above ) serves an important function in continence . It " applies the brakes " to the flow of peristalsis , reducing the pressure on your puborectalis muscle . According to Isbits article , squatting offers seven advantages : <p> Protects the nerves that control the prostate , bladder and uterus from becoming stretched and damaged <p> Securely seals the ileocecal valve , between the colon and the small intestine ; in the conventional sitting position , this valve is unsupported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Relaxes the puborectalis muscle which normally chokes the rectum in order to maintain continence <p> Uses the thighs to support the colon and prevent straining .

Unfortunately , many people needlessly suffer because they are too embarrassed to broach the topic with their healthcare providers . Fortunately , these all-too-common problems can be resolved with similar strategies because they share the same causative factors , including the typical Western diet , inadequate exercise , chronic dehydration , and stress . Surveys suggest that , in westernized countries , as much as half the population over age 40 may suffer from hemorrhoids . <p> Hemorrhoids are veins in the wall of your rectum and anus that have become twisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ externally , and the resulting lumps can cause pain and bleeding . <p> Hemorrhoids are most often created by an increase in pressure , usually from straining to have a bowel movement . Hemorrhoids are common in people with chronic digestive disturbances " especially constipation . They are also seen in the elderly , and during pregnancy . If you 're pregnant , the additional pressure your growing baby places on your uterus can result in hemorrhoids . Childbirth can increase the problem , but fortunately , most hemorrhoids caused by pregnancy resolve after delivery . <p> There is research casting doubt on the theory that hemorrhoids are caused by insufficient dietary fiber , but instead by other factors such as the loss of the " ancestral diet , " and the straining associated with defecating from a sitting position.4 <p> Dr. Berko Sikirov , an Israeli physician who studied the health effects of squatting for elimination , found that hemorrhoids were virtually eliminated when hemorrhoid sufferers switched their toileting position from sitting to squatting.5 Sikirov concluded hemorrhoids result from continual aggravation and injury from excessive straining by defecating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rectum designed to maintain continence . <p> To prevent hemorrhoids , you should also stay hydrated with adequate water daily , seek to control your emotional stress , and get plenty of exercise . Make sure your diet includes plenty of probiotics , such as those present in traditionally fermented foods like sauerkraut and other fermented vegetables , which are important for maintaining optimal intestinal flora . For a complete discussion of hemorrhoid prevention and treatment , refer to my earlier article on this topic . <p> Occasionally a deficiency of bioflavonoids allow blood vessels to break easier and if this is the case a supplement called rutin is particularly helpful at correcting . If you bruise easily this is a strong suggestion that you would benefit from taking rutin . <p> Natural Constipation Relief Strategies <p> Constipation and hemorrhoids are two sides of the same coin . Your risk for hemorrhoids increases greatly if you have recurring episodes of constipation . One of the biggest hindrances to your success may be not realizing you 're constipated in the first place . Regular bowel movements are extremely important for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recirculated in your bloodstream . If elimination is not regular and complete , the wastes will dry and become cemented to the walls of your colon . <p> Constipation has been shown to increase your risk of colon cancer and has been implicated in diverticulosis and appendicitis . The cumulative lifetime use of commercial laxatives has been associated with increased risk of colon cancer.6 <p> Conventional medicine typically defines constipation as fewer than two or three bowel movements a week . But you should really be having one bowel movement a day , and preferably two or three . So if you are having less than one bowel movement per day , you should take steps to increase them . Some of the common causes of constipation include laxative abuse , hypothyroidism , IBD , and ignoring the urge to go . If you consistently ignore the urge to have a bowel movement " for instance , to avoid using a public toilet " eventually you may stop feeling the urge . <p> Laxatives are NOT a good option as your body may become dependent on them . Laxatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually damage your large intestines nerves , muscles , and other tissues . This applies to both pharmaceutical laxatives , as well as herbs like cascara . Fortunately , although constipation is very common , it is also usually temporary and relatively easy to resolve " without resorting to laxatives . Squatting is one of the best interventions , preventing constipation in four ways : <p> Gravity does most of the work . The weight of the torso presses against the thighs and naturally compresses the colon . Gentle pressure from the diaphragm supplements the force of gravity . <p> The ileocecal valve , between the colon and the small intestine , is properly sealed , allowing the colon to be fully pressurized . The pressure creates a natural laxative effect . In the sitting position the IC valve is unsupported and tends to leak , making it difficult to generate the required pressure . <p> Squatting relaxes the puborectalis muscle , which normally chokes the rectum to maintain continence . <p> Squatting lifts the sigmoid colon to unlock the " kink " at the entrance to the rectum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pressure off the puborectalis muscle . <p> Preventing and treating constipation is very similar to preventing and treating hemorrhoids . Pay attention to your diet , exercise , hydration and stress level .

However , if you 've been using a sit-down toilet your entire life and havent squatted since childhood , squatting may present somewhat of a physical challenge " to say the least ! <p> Various devices have appeared in the marketplace to assist with this problem , such as the Squatty Potty , developed by Robert Edwards , a 37 year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help his mother relieve her problems with constipation and hemorrhoids.7 You may wish to check out some of these contraptions on the Internet.8 Squatting involves strength and flexibility that adults tend to lose over time , but children have naturally .

@@24920758 @4920758/ <h> The 3 Life Lessons to Gain Through Experience <p> Life lessons come from hindsight , and usually a tad too late . Unless we learn from others . This post from Inc.com shares 3 insights that can help in business and life . <p> The writer and professor Morris Kline once said , " the most fertile source of insight is hindsight . " Its hard to dispute that . So taking a cue from Kline , here are three sources of insight I 'd like to tell my younger self . <h> Listen to your inner voice <p> There 's a lot of advice out there about being true to yourself and paying attention to your inner voice . There 's a lot of it for good reasonits really , really important in the pursuit of a happy and balanced life . My hunch is that this is the root cause of why so many people are unhappy in their jobs . They decided on a career path without really listening to their desires and preferences . Sometimes people just follow in the footsteps of their parents or they 're responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . Other times it is because its easier to copy what someone else has done rather than figure out what you really want . <p> I 'm very happy with my career now . But when I was starting out , I was actually very interested in advertising . I 'd grown up with a mindset that being a CPA is the best move you could make . So that 's what I did , and I never really thought about pursuing advertising . <p> On its face , advice to go into accounting was a good idea . There are a lot of great things about being an accountant and I have had a great career and taken advantage of many paths in the field . It was n't originally a decision that was based in what was natural for me . It was n't until I learned to really listen to myself and carve the path in my profession that was a better fit that I achieved a professional and personal balance that felt much more rewarding . <p> For the most part , I think it takes people ( and clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their own way of tuning into themselves and then listening to those cues . But once you do learn to listen to your inner voice , things flow better , which is why I wish I would have known how important it was to listen to myself earlier in life . <h> Invest in your tribe <p> Its just a factnot everyone is going to like you . You need to accept that and invest your time and resources into the relationships with people who are supportive of you and your growth . <p> When I was youngerand I think this is common with a lot of women because were conditioned to please othersId spend time being more concerned by the people who werent my biggest supporters and I 'd try to change their minds . In hindsight , this was a huge waste of time . I could have better spent my time seeking out the people who would help me along the way or furthering my relationships with people who were already supportive . <p> Of course , you will encounter people who act as roadblocks . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fruitful to learn to work around them and not let them hold you back . <h> Yoga is n't just for hippies <p> I 'm saying this sort of tongue-in-cheek , but it really gets at a point that hits close to home for me . Nowadays yoga is a $27 billion industry , which makes it pretty mainstream . It skews heavily towards womenmore than 80 percent of practitioners are femalebut attracts people from all walks of life , from students to CEOs . <p> As a Type-A person , I was quick to brush off yoga for most of my life . I thought it was soft . I was partial to bootcamps and high-impact activity . But after I gave birth to my second son , I got very sick with a thyroid condition and could n't exercise . I missed the physical activity so much and yoga was one of the only things my doctor would allow me to do . <p> I begrudgingly tried it . I did not exactly get hooked immediately , but slowly began to crave the calmness and clarity the practice brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , but the lessons I learned on the mat have spilled over into so many other areas of my life . My journey to the yoga mat was also a first-hand lesson in being open-minded . I was so quick to dismiss yoga , but once I gave it a chance , I benefited in ways I could not have foreseen . Now if only I would have realized that earlier . <p> Looking back provides such an interesting perspective of who we once were and how far we 've come . While I feel like I could have benefitted from knowing a lot of this stuff sooner , I also appreciate that the evolution of the lessons over time had a huge impact on me . So here 's a gentle reminder for everyone to not be too hard on yourself for the things that take you a while to learn . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

This post from MindBodyGreen.com unveils the top five tips from a 91-year old grandmother for leading a long , healthy , and happy life . <p> My 91-year-old grandmother is my last living grandparent , by a long shot . When I went to visit her on her 90th birthday , I asked her how she 's managed to live such a long , healthy , and happy life . Here are my grandmother 's top five secrets to longevity : <h> 1 . Be physically active every day . <p> My grandmother is more active than most people half her age , which ( unfortunately ) includes me . I drive everywhere I go , and she walks . Because she lives in a big city , most places where she would run errands are within easy walking distance of her apartment . <p> She does n't suffer from any of the physical ailments expected at her age . She does n't complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more muscular , and has more stamina than many 70-year-olds . And it 's not just the walking that keeps her active . My grandmother rarely sits still .

That 's just how she lives her life . While the rest of us are joining gyms and scheduling our exercise time , she just gets up in the morning and goes about her day . <p> The take-away : Find ways to be active within the existing framework of your life . You do n't  have to make exercise a separate part of your day . Just get up and move . <h> 2 . Keep your mind focused and sharp . <p> My grandmother 's favorite pastime has always been crocheting .

Provide for and care for others . <p> My grandmother is very close to her younger sister , and that is not just because they live in the same building . My great-aunt lost her sight several years ago . As a result , she needs my grandmother 's help with many day-to-day tasks . My grandmother knows she has a purpose and that her sister depends on her . <p> Just as Holocaust survivor Victor Frankl explains in his powerful book Man 's Search for Meaning , having purpose is one of the best sources of happiness and longevity that we can find . <p> The take-away : Find purpose in your life .

" <p> Innovators in psychiatry face another challenge , one that 's more unique to the field : stigma .

" The content of the app could very well be the same thing , but the way in which its presented , one in a less stigmatized way , can really make a difference in terms of whether or not people use it . " <p> Ultimately , the associations hope for the Innovation Lab is that whatever people come up with has life beyond the meeting . Rather than leaving with polished ideas , participants will theoretically use the time as a jumping off point for collaborating with colleagues and , from there , move forward to iron out challenges that arise . <p> " I do n't  think this experience is a one-off .

Many of the benefits associated with vegetables are due to the natural pigments in the food . <p> While its advisable to eat all the " colors of the rainbow , " purple foods tend to stand out above the crowd , courtesy of their potent antioxidants called anthocyanins.12 Research has linked anthocyanins to a reduced risk for a number of diseases , including cancer , cardiovascular disease , and neurological dysfunction and decline . <p> They also help prevent obesity and diabetes , in part by inhibiting certain enzymes in your digestive tract , and by supporting healthy blood sugar control .

According to Olga Azarenko , a scientist at the UC Santa Barbara laboratories , whose research shows how the healing power of these vegetables works at the cellular level:15 <p> " Breast cancer , the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women , can be protected against by eating cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and near relatives of cabbage such as broccoli and cauliflower . These vegetables contain compounds called isothiocyanates which we believe to be responsible for the cancer-preventive and anti-carcinogenic activities in these vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouts , contain the highest amounts of isothiocyanates . Other vegetables containing isothiocyanates include the following : <p> Brussel sprouts <p> Cauliflower <p> Cabbage <p> Arugula <p> Watercress <p> Horseradish <p> The isothiocyanates in these vegetables sparks hundreds of genetic changes , activating some genes that fight cancer and switch off others that fuel tumors.16 According to one recent study , 17 " research suggests that cruciferous vegetables are not only an important source of nutrients , but perhaps a key to eliminating cancer as life threatening disease . " Besides breast cancer , studies have confirmed the protective benefits of these vegetables for other types of cancer as well , such as : <p> Bladder cancer " Researchers found that the higher the intake of cruciferous vegetables , the lower the risk of bladder cancer in men by as much as 50 percent18 <p> Lung cancer " Researchers found that men with detectable amounts of isothiocyanates in their bodies had a 36 percent lower chance of developing lung cancer over 10 years19 <p> Prostate cancer " Just a few additional portions of broccoli each week was found to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests eating broccoli three to five times per week can lower your risk of liver cancer , and help prevent the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) 21,22,23 <h> The Trick to Maximizing Sulforaphane in Your Broccoli <p> One naturally occurring isothiocyanate known for its potent anti-cancer activity is sulforaphane , which is formed when you chop or chew broccoli ( this combines its precursor glucoraphanin and the enzyme myrosinase ) . Once swallowed , gut bacteria help release some of broccolis sulforaphane so your body can benefit , but its a tricky proposition because sulforaphane is attached to a sugar molecule with a sulfur bond . <p> In order for the sulforaphane to be released , an enzyme in the broccoli breaks off the sugar to release it . However , the sulforaphane can be easily inactivated by a sulfur-grabbing protein . <p> Researchers have found that one of the best ways to maximize sulforaphane your body can use is to heat the broccoli for 10 minutes at 140 degrees Fahrenheit ( or steam it lightly for three to four minutes until its tough-tender ) .24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which attaches to the sulfur and greatly depletes the amount of bioavailable sulforaphane . <p> Another option is to eat broccoli sprouts . Fresh broccoli sprouts- are FAR more potent than whole broccoli , allowing you to eat far less in terms of quantity . Tests have revealed that 3-day-old broccoli sprouts consistently contain anywhere from 10 to 100 times the amount of glucoraphanin " the precursor to sulforaphane " found in mature broccoli.25 <h> Luteolin " Another Important Anti-Cancer Compound <p> Luteolin is another important anti-inflammatory plant compound found in certain vegetables , including celery , peppers , and carrots . Its previously been linked with lower rates of age-related memory loss in mice , 26 but more recently , researchers discovered it may also slow the development of breast cancer27,28 " particularly cancer caused by hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . <p> According to the researchers , benign lesions in breast tissues may turn into tumors if they receive a " trigger " such as progestin , which attracts blood vessels and " feeds " the lesions , allowing them to expand . When this occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , which can make them harder to kill , " the studys lead researcher stated . <p> However , when breast cancer cells were exposed to luteolin in the lab , their viability markedly decreased . Not only did the blood vessels feeding the cells significantly decline , but their " stem cell-like properties " were also reduced , resulting in an anti-tumor effect . The researchers then tested luteolin on mice with breast cancer and similar benefits were observed . <h> Sprouts , a Living Food With Amazing Health Benefits <p> If you struggle getting enough vegetables into your diet , try juicing , and add sprouts . Sprouts are exceptionally packed with nutrients , including antioxidants , minerals , vitamins and enzymes that protect against free radical damage , so in terms of volume you can get away with eating far less . <p> The content of vitamins and essential fatty acids increase dramatically during the sprouting process . Sunflower seed and pea sprouts tend to top the list of all the seeds that you can sprout and are typically each about 30 times more nutritious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The quality of the protein and the fiber content of beans , nuts , seeds and grains also improve when sprouted because minerals , such as calcium and magnesium , bind to protein , making them more bioavailable .

Abundantly rich in oxygen , sprouts also help protect against viruses and bacteria that can not survive in an oxygen-rich environment . <p> Sprouts are the ultimate locally-grown food , and can easily be grown in your own kitchen , so you know exactly what you 're eating .

Some of the most commonly sprouted beans , nuts , seeds and grains include : <p> Broccoli : known to have anti-cancer properties , courtesy of the enzyme " sulforaphane " <p> Lentil sprouts : contain 26 percent protein , and can be eaten without cooking <p> Sunflower : contains , minerals , healthy fats , essential fatty acids , fiber , and phytosterols .

This is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was created by nature and therefore work with your body to satiate hunger and nutritional cravings . <p> As discussed in a previous article , junk food manufacturers have taken flavor science to extraordinary levels , and the artificial ingredients used to produce that sought after " bliss point " can seriously confuse and befuddle your bodys metabolism . <p> For example , the sweetness from non-caloric artificial sweeteners tends to disrupt your metabolic response to real sugar , 2 thereby exacerbating obesity and diabetes . Your body simply is n't fooled by sweet taste without calories , so it keeps signaling your brain to keep eating , as the point of satisfaction has not yet been reached . <p> Fortunately , there are solutions to unhealthy junk food cravings . One of the most effective strategies I know of is intermittent fasting , along with particular diet modifications that effectively helps reset your bodys metabolism . <p> Another helpful technique , which addresses the emotional component of food cravings , is the Emotional Freedom Technique , demonstrated in a video below . <h> What Makes Processed Foods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's take a quick look at what 's causing junk food cravings in the first place . You probably know that refined sugar is more addictive than cocaine , 3- but sugar is not the sole culprit causing food addiction . <p> Another part stems from the way food manufacturers combine various flavors and textures to produce truly addictive products . This science is used not just for chips , cookies , and sodas , but for ALL processed foods , from condiments to pasta sauce . <p> Food scientist Steven Witherly has studied taste and addictive flavors for the last two decades . In his report : " Why Humans Like Junk Food , " 4- he reveals what it is about a wide range of specific foods that stir our senses and taste buds . For example , the reason people love corn chips is because of the following combination of factors : <h> Other Tricks of the Junk Food Trade <p> Two primary factors make the experience of eating food pleasurable . The first factor involves taste , and how the food feels in your mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . <p> As previously described by investigative reporter- Michael Moss , author of the book- Salt Sugar Fat , food manufacturers go to great lengths to find the perfect blend of salt , sugar , fat , and additional flavorings to excite your brains reward center , thereby assuring you 'll be back for more . In addition to those basics , the food industry also employs other strategies to increase their products addictive nature . This includes : <p> Dynamic contrast . This is when a combination of contrasting sensations produces pleasurable sensations , such as biting through a crunchy chocolate shell , followed by a soft , creamy center filling <p> Rapid food meltdown and vanishing caloric density. - As noted in the featured Lifehacker6- article , foods that quickly melt in your mouth trick your brain into thinking you 're not eating as much food as you really are , despite the fact you 're stuffing in plenty of calories . A prime example of a snack food that has perfected this is Cheetos <p> Sensory specific response. - Repetitive flavors , or flavor overload , tend to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " get tired " of eating the same flavor again and again . Your palate can even tire of a flavor within minutes . <p> Calorie density. - As noted in the featured article:7- " Junk foods are designed to convince your brain that it is getting nutrition , but to not fill you up . " This is accomplished by combining the ideal ratio of calories to prevent satiety signals to go off <p> So how can you get yourself out of the trap set up by junk food manufacturers ? First of all , as with any other addiction program , the less of it you eat , the less you 'll crave it as your body gets " weaned " from all these addictive hooks . Boosting your nutrition is a key factor here . If your body is getting all the nutrients it needs , it will send the appropriate signals to your brain to stop eating when your bodys nutritional requirements have been met . <h> Intermittent Fasting " One of the Best Ways to Eliminate Sugar Cravings <p> One of the most effective ways I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intermittent fasting , as this will help reset your body to burning fat instead of sugar as its primary fuel . When sugar is not needed for your primary fuel and when your sugar stores run low , your body will crave it less . <p> There are many different- variations- of intermittent fasting . If you are like 85 percent of the population and have insulin resistance , my personal recommendation is to fast- every day- by simply scheduling my eating into a narrower window of approximately six to eight hours every day . I find this method to be easier than fasting for a full 24 hours or more , twice a week . <p> Once you are at your ideal body weight , and do not have diabetes , high blood pressure , or abnormal cholesterol levels , you can be less rigid with your fasting . However , it is probably best to resume some type of scheduled eating regimen once in a while , to make sure you do n't  slip back into old habits . <p> To understand how you can fast daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basic facts about your metabolism . It takes most people eight to 12 hours for their body to burn the sugar stored in your body as glycogen found primarily in your liver and your muscles . Most people never deplete their glycogen stores because they eat three or more meals throughout the day and are in constant " feast " mode . This teaches your body to burn sugar as your primary fuel and effectively shuts off your ability to use fat as a fuel . <p> Therefore , in order to work , the length of your fast must be- at least- eight hours . For example , you could restrict your eating to the hours of 11am and 7pm . Essentially , you 're just- skipping breakfast- and making lunch your first meal of the day instead . This equates to a daily fasting of 16 hours " twice the minimum required to deplete your glycogen stores and start shifting into fat burning mode . <p> Keep in mind that while most people will successfully switch over to burning fat after several weeks of intermittent fasting , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fat-burning enzymes that allow your body to effectively use fat as its primary fuel . So do n't  give up ! <p> Again , once youve become fat adapted and are of a normal weight , without high blood pressure , diabetes , or high cholesterol , you only need to do scheduled eating occasionally . As long as you maintain your ideal body weight , you can go back to eating three meals a day if you want to . I restricted my eating to a six- to seven-hour window each day until I got fat adapted and lost about 10 pounds . Now , I still rarely ever eat breakfast , but several days a week I will have two meals instead of just one . <h> Switch from Processed Foods to Unprocessed , Whole Foods <p> Replacing processed foods with homemade meals made from scratch using whole ingredients is an ideal and important way to ensure optimal nutrition . This will automatically cut out the vast majority of refined sugars , processed fructose , preservatives , dyes , other nasty chemicals , and many addictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend less on sugar and more on fat as its primary fuel " provided you eat enough healthy fat , that is . As a result , you will no longer crave sugar to keep you going . <p> Please keep in mind that proper nutrition becomes even more important when you 're fasting and/or cutting calories , so you really want to address your food choices- before- you try any form of fasting . The key elements for a healthy diet that can help kick your junk food cravings to the curb are the following . For a comprehensive guide , please see my free- optimized nutrition plan : <p> Eating a healthful diet of whole foods , ideally organic , and replacing the carbs you eliminate with : <p> As much high-quality healthful fat as you want ( saturated and monounsaturated ) . Many would benefit from getting as much as 50-85 percent of their daily calories from healthy fats . While this may sound like a lot , consider that , in terms of- volume , the largest portion of your plate would be- vegetables , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , tends to be very high in calories . For example , just one tablespoon of coconut oil is about 130 calories " all of it from healthful fat . Good sources include coconut and coconut oil , avocados , butter , nuts , and animal fats . Also take a high-quality source of animal-based- omega-3 fat , such as krill oil <h> Address the Emotional Component of Your Food Cravings <p> If you 're drawn to sweets or grains because of an emotional challenge , I highly recommend using a psychological acupressure technique called the Emotional Freedom Technique. - EFT- is simple and effective , and can rapidly help you control your emotional food cravings . Many people do n't  understand that emotional well-being is essential to their physical health . In fact , in terms of dieting for weight loss , not addressing emotional issues whether small or serious traumas from the past is the primary reason that most people who lose weight often fail at keeping the weight off . <p> If you maintain negative thoughts and feelings about yourself while trying to take physical steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine-tuning your brain to " positive " mode is absolutely imperative to achieve optimal physical health . Unfortunately , many people shun this notion , not because it does n't  make sense , but because the medical establishment has conned them into believing that it means theyll be shelling out many thousands of dollars for traditional psychological care . While traditional psychological approaches may sometimes work , EFT has shown to be a far better , not to mention inexpensive , solution . EFT can help you : <p> Relieve most emotional traumas <p> Abolish phobias and post-traumatic stress <p> Shatter food cravings that sabotage your health <p> Eliminate or significantly reduce most physical pain and discomfort <p> If you feel that your emotions , or your own self-image , may be your own worst enemy when it comes to altering your relationship with food , I highly recommend you read my- free EFT manual- and consider trying EFT on your own . A version of EFT specifically geared toward combating sugar cravings is called Turbo Tapping . For further instructions , please see the article , " Turbo Tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The video below with EFT practitioner Julie Schiffman also demonstrates how to use EFT to fight food cravings of all kinds . <h> Eating Real Food Is the Answer <p> The concerted effort by the processed food industry to make their products as addictive as possible has the unfortunate side effect of stimulating your metabolism to burn carbs as its primary fuel . As long as you are in primary carb-burning mode , you will strongly crave these types of foods . The solution is to decrease the amount of processed foods you eat , and replace them with high-quality whole foods . Remember , carbs need to be replaced with healthy fats in order to successfully achieve this metabolic switchover . <p> Again , intermittent fasting is one of the most effective ways to end junk food cravings , especially cravings for sugar and grains . No matter how cleverly enhanced these junk foods are , your cravings for them will dramatically diminish , if not vanish altogether , once your body starts burning fat instead of sugar as its primary fuel . <p> To protect your health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whole foods , and only 10 percent or less on processed foods . Unfortunately , most Americans currently do the opposite , which is in large part why so many struggle with junk food cravings . Remember , virtually ALL processed foods are to some degree designed to have a high " craveability " factor , and its really difficult to find products that do not contain high amounts of addictive sugar and carbs . If you 're on a budget , switching to a whole food diet may seem like a challenge . It can be done , however . Here are three strategies you may find helpful : <p> Become resourceful : - This is an area where your grandmother , if still alive , can be a wealth of information as how to use up every morsel of food and stretch out a good meal was common knowledge to generations past .

Thou shalt eat food that will nourish your body , rather than food that will harm it . <p> 2 . Thou shalt get enough sleep . ( I 'm one to talk as I thought I was surviving well on five hours of broken sleep for five years . I was an idiot . ) <p> 3 . Thou shalt take time out . From work , your chores , for yourself . Little and often . We all need to recharge . <p> 4 . Thou shalt exercise to gain strength , flexibility and to keep your heart healthy . Do n't overdo it and do n't make excuses not to do it . Make sure you do exercise that 's fun . <p> 5 . Thou shalt know what makes you happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that makes you smile from a nice bubble bath , reading a chapter of a good book , to having a night out . <p> 6 . Thou shalt focus on your breathing . ( The golden thread breath got me through my three labors along with a TENS machine the days I was running on empty , it helped me through my grief after the death of my Auntie and it helps me stay grounded when everything seems to be going wrong . To do the golden thread breath you just breathe in slowly , then out nice and slowly imagining that a golden thread is coming out of your mouth , bringing you closer to your goal . When I was in labour I imagined the golden thread bringing me closer to a healthy baby . When my kids are fighting , I imagine that the golden thread is bringing me closer to a quiet moment ! ) <p> 8 . Thou shalt meditate . ( There are numerous studies that show the massive benefits meditation can bring , including more control over stress , depression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from candle meditation , where you stare at the flame of a candle . Mantras are where you repeat a word over and over . Walking meditation is where you head outside and focus on each thing that you see , really living in the moment . ) <p> 9 . Thou shalt treat everyone with kindness , including yourself . Judging others and comparing yourself to others only makes you feel bad . You do n't know what each person you meet is dealing with , so give them a break . Give yourself a break too do your best in any given situation , learn from your mistakes and celebrate each success <p> 10 . Thou shalt believe in yourself and in others . We all put ourselves down , with the voices in our head saying I ca n't do that , I do n't have time for that , I 'm not good enough , I 'm too fat ' etc . Ban the words should ' and ca n't ' from your vocabulary and start telling yourself that you can do the things you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Thou shalt give thanks and be grateful . Always say thank you ' and think of at least three things you 're grateful for at the end of the day , no matter how bad it 's been . This simple act keeps you grounded and happy . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Its being studied and implemented as a treatment for Diabetes II , Peripheral Neuropathy and signs of aging on the skin such as lines and wrinkles . Its also being put to work to treat all forms of cognitive dysfunction , from common brain fog all the way to severe cases of Alzheimers Disease . here 's why the body loves ALA , and how you can beef up your brain nutrition using it . <p> What is ALA <p> ALA is a vital component in cellular metabolism . In that way , it acts like a vitamin . Its used in converting glucose to energy and is manufactured in every cell . <p> As a great defender , it acts as an antioxidant . Enthusiasts call it a " universal antioxidant " because , unlike others , lipoic acid is fat and water soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures . Whereas vitamin C is limited to aqueous cells , and vitamin E to lipid cells , lipoic acid works " universally " throughout the body , causing free radicals everywhere to tremble . <p> And get this . After an officer , such as vitamin E , neutralizes a free radical , it , too , becomes neutralized ( martyred/retired ) and must be replaced with a young buck . But if lipoic acid comes along , that ol vitamin E compound may have a second chance at life . Studies show that lipoic acid has the ability to resurrect neutralized antioxidants so they can report to duty once again . <p> To add to its universality , lipoic acid slips easily through the blood-brain barrier . Thus , it employs all its warrior-like vitamin and antioxidant power to maintain healthy cells , and to protect brain and nerve tissues from oxidative stress , a process that damages and causes mutated cells to replicate . You do n't  want damaged cells replicating in your hemispheres . Brain cell oxidation can basically leave your brain , and your cognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those players and guarding cognitive function . When taken by a reasonably healthy adult , RLA has been shown to reverse cognitive dysfunction , significantly improve concentration , memory , and response time , and protect the brain from neurodegeneration associated with age . <p> Two Types <p> Lipoic acid can be obtained both from outside the human body , such as from red meats and some vegetation , and within the body where its synthesized from octanoic acid into R-lipoic acid . Other references to the same are RLA , R ( + ) Lipoic Acid and R-ALA . <p> Before considering any ALA supplement you need to know that two types of ALA can be found on the earth and , specifically , in vitamin shops today . One is the aforementioned RLA . RLA is native to the body and ( probably ) the only one useful to your cells . <p> The other is S-ALA/SLA , an unnatural synthetic by-product created in the man-made production of ALA . RLA is proven to be more thanten times as effective as its man-made counterpart , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . When selecting a supplement look for 100% R ( + ) Lipoic Acid , otherwise you 're almost assuredly getting 50% RLA and 50% the bio-un--available SLA . <p> Studies <p> Because of the potency of ALA to promote brain health , concentration , focus and memory , scientists have been testing its effect upon people with Alzheimers Disease ( AD ) and related dementias . One study done on patients with AD found that a regular dose of 600mg/ day for 12 months " led to a stabilization of cognitive functions in the study group . " 1 It wasnt found to prevent or cure dementias but to delay the onset or slow progression . <p> Another study induced a progressive cognitive impairment in rats to imitate the neurodegenerative disorders particularly associated with aging . " The study demonstrated the effectiveness of alpha lipoic acid in preventing cognitive impairment and oxidative stress associated with age and age related neurodegenerativesuch as Alzheimers disease . " 2 <p> As mentioned earlier , ALA can be found in supplements , but be aware that packages do n't  always confess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so supplements that provide 100% bioavailable lipoic acid are likely to advertise it loudly as such . Look for 100% RLA or else assume its 50/50 . <p> A physician can also administer RLA intravenously . This is mostly for higher doses in people with serious disorders . <p> Side effects are rare but can include skin irritations , muscle cramps , headache and " pins and needles . " ALA effects blood sugar levels , so anyone taking medications for diabetes should only take ALA under supervision from their physician . It also may have effect on thyroid . If you 're on thyroid meds , consult with your physician before taking ALA . <p> Adequate testing on pregnant and nursing mothers , as well as children , has not been done . Avoid use unless directed by a qualified healthcare provider . <p> Synergy <p> Studies show that lipoic acid works in tandem and is most effective when supplemented with acetyl L-carnitine . Supplements are available both individually and together in synergistic blends . Red meats are the richest food sources of L-carnitine , followed by fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asparagus , avocado and- peanut butter . <p> Other nutrients that partner with lipoic acid are the B vitamins biotin and niacin . Food sources of biotin include chicken eggs ( with the yolk ) , halibut , goats and cows milk , almonds and walnuts , swiss chard and carrots . Niacin is found in chicken , turkey , tuna and halibut , spinach and green peas , salmon , spelt , peanuts and sweet potatoes . <p> May you live long , think deeply , and prosper in your spirit , soul and body . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

More you look into it , more you will find examples of how being grateful has helped various living things survive and prosper happily . <h> 4 .

Think positive to achieve the positive <p> You might not have heard this , but its true . Your thoughts can shape your life . Have you ever noticed that if you keep telling yourself that the present tough times shall pass and you are happy with what you have , you actually get the courage to deal with the crisis ?

@@24920817 @4920817/ <h> 8 Ways To Boost Your Brain Power <p> Most of us have experienced conditions such as depression , anxiety , memory problems and trouble focusing or just plain brain fog . We think these problems are all in our heads . However , in his pioneering new book , " The UltraMind Solution , " Mark Hyman , M.D. , explains how the real causes of these problems are in your body , not your head . By simply addressing the underlying causes of mood , memory and behavior problems you can boost your brain power and have a calm , confident , focused and happy mind . <p> The three-pound organ in your head is very sensitive . So if you want to feel happy , alert and focused , start being sensitive to its needs . Ditch the high fructose corn syrup and sugars , transfats , processed and packaged foods ( which contain up to 3,500 food additives and chemicals ) . Choose organic foods and grass-fed animal products to avoid hormones , antibiotics and the gallon of neurotoxic pesticides each of us consume every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing sports that put your head at risk . Stop or reduce brain-damaging medications ( acid blockers , statins and acetaminophen ) . <p> To boost your brain power , you need the right nutrition .

Become a fat head ( 60 percent of your brain is made up of omega 3 fats ) by eating sardines , wild salmon , herring , omega 3 eggs , flax seeds and walnuts . Eat protein for brain power every morning and with every meal . Include foods such as eggs , nut butters , protein shakes , beans , nuts and seeds and lean animal protein . Eat brain food , otherwise known as the right carbs : whole fresh vegetables , fruits , beans and whole grains .

And create a peaceful , sleepy environment , clear your mind , write down all your worries and tasks before bed and relax by taking a hot bath . <p> 5 . Find Your Pause Button : Relax <p> Finding our pause button is something we never learn . Healing , repair , renewal and regeneration all occur in a state of relaxation . So how do we find the pause button and activate the parasympathetic nervous system , otherwise known as the " relaxation response " ?

@@24920818 @4920818/ <p> Step 2 . Consolidate that memory . Do nothing else and that memory could soon fade away . Consolidation is the process of committing something to long-term memory so we can recall it later . Much of this process happens while were sleeping as our brains recreate that same pattern of brain activity and strengthen the synapses created earlier . <p> Step 3 . Recall that memory . Recall is what most of us think of when we talk about memory or memory loss . Recalling a memory is easier if it has been strengthened over time , and each time we do we cycle through that same pattern of brain activity and make the connection a little stronger . <p> While memory loss is a normal part of aging that does n't  mean we cant take action to slow it down . <h> Now let 's discover 7 powerful memory hacks : <h> 1 . Meditate to improve working memory . <p> Working memory , which is a little like your brains notepad , is where new information is temporarily held . When you learn someones name or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hang on to those details in working memory until you 're done with them . If they 're no longer useful you let them go entirely . If they are useful , you commit them to long-term memory where they can be strengthened and recalled later . <p> Working memory is something we use every day , so it makes our lives a lot easier when its stronger . While for most adults the maximum we can hold in our working memory is about seven items , if you 're not quite using your working memory to its maximum capacity meditation can strengthen it . <p> Research has shown that participants with no experience in mindfulness meditation can improve their memory recall in just eight weeks . Meditation , with its power to help us concentrate , has also been shown to improve improve standardized test scores and working memory after just two weeks . <p> So occasionally take a break to empty your mind . Not only will you feel a little less stressed , you may also remember a little more . <h> 2 . Drink coffee to improve memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before learning something new is debatable . Most research has found little to no effect from ingesting caffeine prior to creating new memories . <p> One recent study , though , found that taking a caffeine pill after a learning task actually improved memory recall up to 24 hours later . Participants memorized a set of images and were later tested by viewing the same images ( targets ) , similar images ( lures ) , and completely different images ( foils ) . <p> The task was to pick out which were the exact pictures they had memorized without being tricked by the lures ( which were very similar . ) This is a process called pattern separation , which according to the researchers reflects a " deeper level of memory retention . " <p> The researchers in this study focused on the effects of caffeine on memory consolidation : the process of strengthening the memories we 've created . That is why they believe the effects occurred when caffeine was ingested after the learning task rather than before . <h> So do n't  just drink a little coffee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to more of what you learn throughout the day . <h> 3 . Visualize reminders with the Palace Technique . <p> Whether its your home , an office , or some other place , there 's a space most of us can walk through in our minds . Turn that mental space into a list organizer by using the " Palace Technique . " The LiteMind Blog has a good overview of the technique , which has you associating each thing you need to remember with objects youd see in a walk-through " milk at the front door , printer paper on the floor mat , paper towels on the kitchen table , etc . When you need to remember , just stroll through your ( mental ) home , and you should recall the associations . <h> 4 . Exercise to improve memory recall . <p> Studies in both rat and human brains have shown that regular exercise can improve memory recall . Fitness in older adults has even been proven to slow the decline of memory without the aid of continued regular exercise . In particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so exercise may not necessarily be a way to improve all types of memory recall . <p> Of course the benefits of exercise are numerous , but for the brain in particular regular exercise is shown to improve cognitive abilities besides memory . So if you 're looking for a way to stay mentally sharp , taking a walk could be the answer . <h> 5 . Chew gum to make stronger memories . <p> Another easy method that could improve your memory is to chew gum while you learn something new . Contradictory research exists so its not a solid bet , but one study published last year showed that participants who completed a memory recall task were more accurate and had higher reaction times if they chewed gum during the study . <p> A reason that chewing gum might affect our memory recall is that it increases activity in the hippocampus , an important area of the brain for memory . ( Its still unclear why this happens , though . ) <p> Another theory focuses on the increase of oxygen from chewing gum and how that can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain as we learn new things . One study found that participants who chewed gum during learning and memory tests had higher heart rate levels , a factor that can cause more oxygen to flow to the brain . <h> 6 . Recall lists using dramatic imagery . <p> You 're heading out the door , and you 're absolutely sure you 're going to forget to drop off the mail , or buy the milk , or both . Blogger Bert Webb might suggest focusing on an image of dropping letters into a mailbox that looks like a giant milk jug , or perhaps a mailman made entirely of liquid milk . In other words , anything that pushes your list items past your brains boring/mundane filter is far likelier to stick . Use wild and crazy imagery plus- emotion- to allow the brain to really remember it . The crazier it is , the more emotion you feel , the easier it will be to remember the list . <h> 7 . Sleep more to consolidate memories . <p> Sleep is proven to be one of the most important elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of our memory consolidation process occurs it makes sense that without enough sleep we will struggle to remember things we 've learned . <p> Even a short nap can improve your memory recall .

After the break both groups were tested on their memory of the cards . <p> To the surprise of the researchers the sleep group performed significantly better , retaining on average 85% of the patterns compared to 60% for those who had remained awake . <p> Research indicates that when memory is first recorded in the brain ( specifically in the hippocampus ) its still " fragile " and easily forgotten , especially if the brain is asked to memorize more things .

You can , and should , do some vigorous cardiovascular exercise ; just do n't  do more than 8 to 20 minutes of it . And do n't  do it more than three days a week .

@@24920834 @4920834/ <h> 11 Ways to Slow Aging Process <p> There 's only one strategy that has been shown in experimental research to extend life span : calorie restriction . In rodents , fish , fruit flies , worms and monkeys eating less food makes you live longer . Of course the key to food reduction is making sure what you do eat is loaded with nutrients . Maintaining a healthy weight reduces all sorts of metabolic stresses on the body . A good place to start : try reducing calories by 25 percent a day . <p> 2 . Eat Less Sugar . <p> Sugar depletes the body of important minerals needed for a smoothly functioning metabolism . It depresses the immune system , making your body less able to mount an attack on health-robbing pathogens . High-glycemic diets high in sugar or high in processed and refined foods like bagels which convert to sugar almost instantly have now been found to be associated with several types of cancer . High sugar diets raise triglycerides and increase the risk for metabolic syndrome , diabetes and heart disease , all conditions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered a two-party system , the " good " and the " bad , " but its actually far more complex . LDL , so-called " bad " cholesterol , actually has a half dozen varieties some of which are not dangerous at all . Concentrating on cholesterol alone diverts our attention from the larger picture when it comes to heart disease risk . The ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol ( it should be under 5 ) is a far better predictor of heart disease than overall cholesterol . And basic lifestyle modifications ( giving up cigarettes , exercising and lowering your weight ) have a far more profound effect on mortality than your cholesterol ever did . <p> 4 . Quiet Your Mind . <p> Stress is a component of nearly every major disease . The stress hormone cortisol ages the brain by literally shrinking the hippocampus , which is essential to memory and thinking . High levels of cortisol also cause you to put on fat around the middle . The only thing that 's been consistently shown to bring down stress is meditation . Taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nervous system , lower your heart rate and oxygenate your brain with deep breathing can pay off in health dividends beyond your wildest dreams . <p> 5 . Eat Fish . <p> The omega-3s in fish are among the most heart-healthy nutrients on the planet . Eating fish is a big component of nearly every native diet that has been shown to be associated with lower rates of heart disease , the number one killer of Americans . Fish can help lower blood pressure , improve mood and feed your brain , things that are all associated with healthier ( and longer ) lives . Many health experts recommend at least -+ gram of fish oil a day from fish or supplements . You can meet the World Health Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( WHO-NATO ) recommendations by consuming two servings of fatty fish per week . <p> 6 .

Taking care of someone or something outside yourself is life-extending and health enriching . People who are connected to their extended families , or to their churches , synagogues or communities , or who spend some time volunteering and helping others rate themselves as happier , more satisfied and more fulfilled . <p> 7 . Check Your Levels . <p> Doctors do n't  routinely check homocysteine levels , but they should . According to some experts , the lower your homocysteine , the better off you are . A level of 9umol/L or less is generally considered optimal . Those with dangerously high levels of homocysteine have a 50 percent greater risk of heart attack . And 40 percent of deaths due to stroke are associated with high homocysteine . The good news is its a cinch to bring your levels down by supplementing with three B vitamins folic acid , vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 . <p> 8 .

The best anti-aging exercise program incorporates both cardiovascular and weight training to keep your muscles strong , toned and youthful , help control your weight and keep your metabolic rate humming . <p> 9 . Lower Inflammation . <p> When you stub your toe , chemicals in the body rush to the injured area , filling it with fluid and surrounding the injured areas with chemicals that can help fight infection .

Sensible Sunlight . <p> Vitamin D is one of the most underrated vitamins in the world . Your body makes it , but only when you 're exposed to sunlight . Vitamin D enhances performance , fights cancer and builds bones . Older adults who do n't  get enough are at increased risk for both poor physical performance and for disability . Its possible but difficult to get enough vitamin D from food . We need the sun . For most Caucasians who are living where there is sunlight , exposing 10 percent of your body a couple times a week is enough to get your vitamin D requirement .

The air inside your home may be polluted by lead ( in house dust ) , formaldehyde , fire-retardants , radon , even volatile chemicals from fragrances used in conventional cleaners . Some pollutants are tracked into the home .

The process of lipogenesis ( creation of fat by the liver ) is blunted by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers your body to secrete the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine which are shown to increase mobilization of stored fatty acids in fat cells . This enables your body to have easier access to use those stored fatty acids as fuel ( and not keep it on your belly ) . <p> Pu-erh has been clinically proven to enhance cellular levels of hormone-sensitive lipase ( HSL ) which effectively blocks visceral fat accumulation . HSL is a critical enzyme that " unlocks " fat cells so that their contents can be emptied out . HSLs function is paramount to any fat loss processes in the body . <p> What 's important to know about using Pu-erh <p> With consumption of Pu-erh , quality means everything . This tea needs to be cultivated , fermented , and stored properly to retain its benefits . This may be the most expensive tea to procure right now , but the benefits are definitely worth it . <p> Two cups of Pu-erh a day are ideal to maximize the benefits listed above ( if you 're not overly sensitive to caffeine ) . With all herbal stimulants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best results . <p> 2 . Shilajit ( pronounced shee-lah-jeet ) <p> Shilajit has been used in Ayurvedic Medicine for thousands of years to improve health and fitness . Its basically a concentrated mineral compound derived from mountainous regions like the Himalayas . <p> In the ancient Ayurvedic text Shilajit is known as the " Conquerer of Mountains " and the " Destroyer of Weakness " . Today Shilajit is being studied for its remarkable effects on fat loss and overall health . <p> One recent study showed that supplementation with Shilajit resulted in a 23.5% increase in serum testosterone levels . The study participants were quasi-infertile males , but something with these types of effects are potentially beneficial for anyone . <p> The Charles R.

You can simply add it to water , take capsules , or ( my favorite ) blend it into hot tea or coffee drinks to get the real essence of its rejuvenative effects . <p> 3 . Cordyceps ( pronounced cor-di-seps ) <p> Cordyceps is categorized as a " medicinal mushroom " with thousands of years of use in Chinese Medicine . Its growing acclaim in the world of health today due to its substantial benefits on athletic performance . <p> Cordyceps has been shown to increase physical stamina by improving overall blood circulation and the dilation of respiratory pathways .

Chinese herbs like this are traditionally combined with other herbs in a synergistic formula . Try adding cordyceps to your blended drinks with other herbs you enjoy .

@@24920865 @4920865/ <h> Your Waist Circumference May Be The Key To A Long Life <p> An informative article discussing the impact of a high waist circumference on health and- well-being . It also provides the most effective tip for managing your waist size . <p> The size of your waistline may be the key to a long life , according to an observational study conducted by the Mayo Clinic1 , involving nearly 13,000 Americans who were followed for about 14 years . <p> In a presentation in August at the European Society of Cardiology Congress , senior author Francisco Lopez-Jimenez said that people who are of normal weight , but who have a high waist-to-hip ratio ( i.e. belly fat ) , have an even higher risk of death than people who are considered obese , based on BMI alone . <p> The risk of cardiovascular death was 2.75 times higher , and the risk of death from all causes was 2.08 times higher in people of normal weight with central obesity , compared with those with a normal body mass index and normal waist-to-hip ratio . According to Dr. Lopez-Jimenez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obesity is bad , but what is new in this research is that the distribution of the fat is very important even in people with a normal weight . This group has the highest death rate , even higher than those who are considered obese based on body mass index . From a public health perspective , this is a significant finding . " <p> The increased mortality risk accompanying higher ratios of visceral fat " the fat that accumulates around your internal organs " is likely due , at least in part , to increased insulin resistance . As I 've stated in many previous articles , insulin and leptin resistance or signaling impairment , is one of the foundational problems underlying virtually all disease , and visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance and other risk factors . Insulin resistance also accelerates the aging process itself . <p> Your Waist Size May Also Help Assess Your Hypertension Risk <p> In related news , the importance of your waist-to-hip ratio was again highlighted in a study2 showing that your waist size may also be a more effective measure for assessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will drop 10-20 percent during nighttime sleep , compared to your daytime values . A lack of nighttime dipping has previously been observed in overweight and obese populations , suggesting a correlation between non-dipping nighttime blood pressure and an increased risk of hypertension . <p> The goal of the study was to evaluate the predictive ability of waist-to-hip ratio on nighttime blood pressure dipping , relative to BMI , and while both BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were significant predictors of nighttime dips in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , the waist measurement was more telling . So , if you have a high waist-to-hip ratio , i.e. you carry more fat around your waist than on your hips , you may be at greater risk for obesity-related hypertension , indicated by a reduction in nighttime blood pressure dipping . <p> Are You Carrying Dangerous Fat Around Your Midsection ? <p> Unfortunately , two out of three people in the U.S. are overweight and one out of three is obese , and the rest of the world is not far behind . It has been my experience that many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has become more or less the norm . But just because something is common does not mean its a " healthy normal . " And were not talking about aesthetics here . <p> Certain body compositions do tend to increase your risk of chronic disease , and carrying extra inches around your midsection has been repeatedly shown to increase cardiovascular health risks . Your waist size is also a powerful indicator of insulin sensitivity , as studies clearly show that measuring your waist size is one of the most powerful ways to predict your risk for diabetes . <p> Waist circumference is far better than BMI for evaluating whether or not you may have a weight problem , as BMI fails to factor in both how muscular you are , and your intra-abdominal fat mass . You can go about measuring your waist in two different ways . <p> The two featured studies used waist-to-hip measurement . This is done by measuring the circumference of your hips at the widest part , across your buttocks . Then measure your waist at the smallest circumference of your natural waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your hip measurement to get the ratio . ( The University of Maryland offers an online waist-to-hip ratio calculator3 you can use . ) The Mayo Clinic used the following waist-to-hip ratio designations : <p> Another even simpler method to figure out if you have a weight problem is to measure only your waist circumference ( the distance around the smallest area below the rib cage and above your belly button ) . Waist circumference is the easiest anthropometric measure of total body fat . A general guide for healthy waist circumference is as follows : <p> Hows Your Blood Pressure ? <p> According to the CDC , high blood pressure is the second greatest public health threat in the US . Insulin resistance and elevated uric acid levels are significantly associated with hypertension , so any program adopted to address high blood pressure needs to help normalize these two factors . <p> Fortunately , this can actually be easier than you might think , but it does require you to make some lifestyle changes . The good news is , if you 're carrying a little more weight around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you struggle with high blood pressure and/or elevated uric acid levels , altering your diet will address all of these issues simultaneously . <p> I recently updated my nutrition plan , which will help guide you step-by-step toward normalizing your insulin and leptin levels , which in turn will help normalize your blood pressure and help you she 'd excess weight . My plan summarizes all I have learned from treating over 25,000 patients and reviewing tens of thousands of articles on natural health . Its a free resource that can help you and your family radically improve your health , or take it to the next level if you 've already started making changes . <p> Ideally your blood pressure should be about 120/80 without medication . If you are on medication , you will be delighted to know that this nutrition plan tends to normalize elevated blood pressures in the vast majority of people to the point you may no longer need your blood pressure medication . According to the most recent report ( issued 2003 ) by the Joint National Committee ( JNC ) on Prevention , Detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following guidelines apply for determining whether you might suffer from hypertension : <p> Keep in mind that your blood pressure readings can vary significantly from day to day " even from morning to evening , and often within the same hour , so do n't  panic if you get one high reading here or there . It is when your blood pressure remains consistently elevated that significant health problems can occur . The following variables can also affect the va-lidity of your blood pressure reading : <p> If you 're overweight , a size average blood pressure cuff can lead to a falsely elevated blood pressure reading , so make sure your doctor or health care professional is using the right size cuff for your size . <p> Incorrect arm position : If your blood pressure is taken while your arm is parallel to your body , your reading can be up to 10 percent higher than it really is . Blood pressure readings should always be taken with your arm at a right angle to your body . <p> White coat hypertension , which is an elevation in blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and other medical personnel , can be a transient but serious concern . Stress reduction in this situation is key . To decrease your risk of being falsely diagnosed with hypertension in this situation , I 'd encourage you to take a moment to calm down , then breathe deeply and relax when you 're getting your blood pressure taken . <p> Although elevated insulin levels are one of the most potent contributors to elevated blood pressure , its also common for chronic stress , tension or anxiety to contribute to this problem . After you begin my nutrition plan and follow it for several months , if you do n't  see an improvement in your blood pressure I 'd recommend seeking out a health care professional who is well-versed in using stress-relief methods , such as the Emotional Freedom Technique ( EFT ) for example . <p> How to Take Control of Your Blood Pressure AND Your Waist Size <p> To address both of the issues covered in this article : a greater than ideal waist size and high blood pressure , first thing you need to do is remove all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until both your weight and your blood pressure have normalized . Again , following my comprehensive nutrition plan can help you take control of your diet in an incremental manner . <p> To emphasize how important this one action can be , consider the following : According to a 2010 study4 , those who consumed 74 grams or more per day of fructose ( the equivalent of about 2.5 sugary drinks ) had a 77 percent greater risk of having blood pressure levels of 160/100 mmHg . Consuming 74 grams or more of fructose daily also increased the risk of a 135/85 blood pressure reading by 26 percent , and 140/90 by 30 percent . <p> This is significant because the average American now consumes about 70 grams of fructose EVERY day ! Worse yet , about 25 percent of all Americans consume over 134 grams of fructose a day , according to research by Dr. Richard Johnson , chief of the division of kidney disease and hypertension at the University of Colorado , and author of two books on the dangers of fructose , The Sugar Fix , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strongly advise keeping your TOTAL fructose consumption below 25 grams per day . However , for most people " especially if you struggle with high blood pressure and insulin resistance " it would be wise to limit your fructose to 15 grams or less , as it is virtually guaranteed that you will consume " hidden " sources of fructose from most beverages and just about any processed food you might eat . <p> Fructose " the Primary Trigger of Your " Fat Switch " <p> To learn more about how fructose impacts your weight and health , I highly recommend reading Dr. Richard Johnsons new book The Fat Switch . In it , he reviews groundbreaking new research showing that eating too much and exercising too little are NOT solely responsible for why you keep gaining weight or have trouble shedding those excess pounds . <p> His research shows that metabolic syndrome ( characterized by central obesity or increased waist circumference , high blood pressure , and insulin resistance ) is actually a normal condition that animals undergo to store fat .

But once she reached adulthood , she was " distracted by everything , " she says . She could n't even dine out with a friend because the restaurant hubbub was too distracting . <p> " I had the wandering-eye thing that drives everyone crazy , " says Kensington , now a psychologist and ADHD lifestyle coach . <p> More than 4 million women in the U.S. have symptoms of adult ADHD . Often described as impatience or an inability to sit still , its a real medical problem that affects attention span . <p> Adults with ADHD have lower levels of the brain chemical dopamine , which is partially responsible for attention . <p> If you have it , you may be unfairly pegged as callous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other person often a spouse or family member feels unheard or minimized .

" <p> To quiet your mind , first see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment , which may include therapy and medication . After that , try these 14 tips to show others you 're all ears . <p> Listening Tip #1 : <p> In social settings , choose the right seat . Never mind all that hype about the best seat in a restaurant being the one facing out . <p> " It pulls your attention away from the person you 're supposed to be focusing on and you 'll miss important information and cues , " Rostain explains . <p> If , like Kensington , you 're easily distracted by people passing by , waiters hefting trays and conversation at other tables , ask for a table with a view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to sit side by side . <p> To cut down on background noise , select quieter meeting places or schedule meals at slower times ( after 2 p.m. for lunch , or 4-5:30 p.m. for dinner ) . <p> You can even ask for distracting music to be turned down or off . Most managers will accommodate those requests during slower shifts . <p> Listening Tip #2 : <p> Ask questions . One symptom of adult ADHD is the tendency to ramble on and then become deadly bored and disinterested in other peoples stories . <p> Instead of spewing long blocks of speech , force yourself to ask a lot of questions . " Blah , blah , blah , blah , " should sound more like : " Blah , blah What do you think about that ? " " Blah , blah Have you had a similar experience ? " <p> " This keeps you stimulated and listening because its a more active process , " Barkley says . " It also shows others you care about them , which is often a problem when ADHD is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mental brakes . Most people can control their emotions , including strong negative reactions , says Barkley . But with ADHD , your filter may be off-kilter . <p> That 's why you may blurt out thoughts and feelings , interrupt others , or have emotional outbursts . Some people with ADHD also like to argue , because it stimulates their brains . Stop yourself . " People without ADHD put their hands over their mouths in their minds ; you must do it literally , " Barkley says . So , periodically , hit the brakes and give the other person a chance to speak . That also gives you a chance to cool down and reconsider whether that point you want to make is really worth an argument . It also structures your speech and keeps your emotions in check . <p> Listening Tip #4 : <p> Watch out for " feeling " words . Because you 're easily distracted , keep an ear out for emotionally tagged words such as sad , angry , lonely , hopeless , depressed , anxious and happy in conversation . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or I 'm completely miserable , ' " says Melissa Orlov , who blogs about how his undiagnosed and misunderstood ADHD nearly destroyed their family . If you get nothing else from a conversation except an understanding of how someone feels , you 'll be a good listener , says Orlov . <p> Listening Tip #5 : <p> Schedule important conversations . No one should have a serious conversation while checking emails or sending tweets . But for someone with ADHD , its even more critical . <p> Not only could you send out public blunders , but you 're so distracted , your partner may be easily frustrated or offended . Instead , schedule time to just talk and listen . Silence your phone , shut down your email and hold a regular , distraction-free meeting with your spouse . Schedule this time to talk when you 're both fully awake and functioning not immediately before bed , when you 're sleepy . The half hour before or after dinner usually works best , Barkley recommends . <p> Listening Tip #6 : <p> Listen , reflect and repeat . Get in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just summarizing what they said shows you heard them . Doing this also helps you remember the conversation and shows you care . Plus , if you have n't caught everything , it gives the other person a chance to correct you . <p> Listening Tip #7 : <p> Always carry a notebook . Ever leave a conversation with a vague sense you were supposed to do something important , but cant remember what that was ? Always carry a notebook and pen . Jot down anything that anyone wants you to do no matter how certain you are that you 'll remember . <p> " We remember different things than many other people do , and we do n't  remember to-do lists very well , " Kensington explains . <p> Ask to change the subject . Bored with a conversation and unable to follow along ? If you 're talking to a friend and your minds getting foggy , you can say , I 'm sorry , I 'm having trouble following you right now . Can we talk about something else ? Rostain suggests . <p> If you ask sincerely particularly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms of adult ADHD it may be less rude than spacing out . <p> Listening Tip #9 : <p> Embrace fidgeting . Physical movement calms you down , says Orlov . If someone wants to have an important conversation , offer to take a walk together . Moving your body also gets you away from the computer , chores and other distractions . In meetings or phone conversations , playing with a paperclip or doodling are less-obvious forms of fidgeting . Both occupy your hands so your mind can concentrate . <p> Listening Tip #10 : <p> Change your breathing . People with ADHD can also suffer from social anxiety and may find it impossible to truly listen in social settings . <p> If you grew up with undiagnosed ADHD and social anxiety , youve probably encountered many problems at parties or work functions . A simple stress technique , such as breathing slowly through your nose , may ease anxious feelings . <p> " Just be in the moment instead of focusing on catching everything everyone says , " Rostain says . <p> Gradually , with less fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good listener . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

That 's why , when you get chicken pox , you typically do n't  get sick from it again " your body has already built up the antibodies necessary to fight it off . Even though our body remembers that it 's been exposed to a virus , we do n't consciously remember or even know what viruses we 've been infected with . <p> Researchers at Harvard University have whipped up a nifty new technique to essentially ask your immune system to identify every single virus you 've ever been infected with in your life . <p> The technique is called VirScan , and conceptually its quite simple . Researchers can look at the antibodies in our bloodstream and infer what viruses they are meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bit more complicated . <p> According to the researchers , there are 206 species of viruses known to infect humans , each of them with certain strings of specific DNA ( or RNA , in the case of retroviruses ) that can be used to identify them .

Needless to say , it took a very long time for the rest of the world to learn about mangosteen . The mangosteen fruit is sometimes referred to as the " Queen of Fruits .

Should you go for a glass of cold water when you are panting for your breath after that grueling workout ; the old dictum continues ! <p> As experts and science continue to debate over what 's better for your system , let 's try and take a balanced view of the same and know how to make a better choice for our body . <h> Why the debate ? <p> Well , there are scientific facts and experience-based inferences to support the use of both , cold water as well as water at room temperature . Let 's begin by looking at an athletes preference and the water he or she chooses to have . When you exercise vigorously , the core temperature of your body will rise beyond 98.6- F. In this situation , having cold water will lower your body temperature faster , helping it to settle back to its normal range quickly . Speaking from a scientific viewpoint , experts feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm water , which further helps prevent dehydration from sweating and keeps you duly hydrated . <p> Moreover , surprising as it might sound , cold water is believed to be helpful in weight loss since your body will work a bit harder to warm up the water and hence , burn a few calories in the process . Just consider the fact that you will burn up to 1 calorie for warming up 1 gram of water to 1- C ! <h> The Warm Water Crusade <p> However , the other side of the coin in appealing enough , if not more . Experts argue that when you have cold water after your meals , the blood vessels around your stomach shrink , slowing down the process of digestion . As the cold water will pass through your system , it will solidify the fats youve just consumed in your meals , which will make it harder to digest them and disperse through the waste .

We need to watch what we are doing , where we are and how we are feeling before choosing a glass of water that is cold or room temperature . <p> Here , we give you a few quick pointers that shall help you decide on what 's the best for you . <p> 1 . Watch your activity <p> Just give a quick thought to the activity you were doing a few moments back . That will tell how your body will react to the type of water you take .

This will help to keep your body temperature down . <p> 2 . Excess of all is bad <p> Nothing holds truer than this golden rule when it comes to your health . Having only warm water or ice-chilled water all the time can alter your bodys natural balance . Even if it goes against your taste or preference , have water at a temperature that your body will benefit the most in a particular situation . <p> 3 . Avoid extremes <p> This one is also another dimension of a balanced intake . Even if it is cold water , do n't  make it ice-chilled . A simple glass of refrigerated water should be enough .

@@24920910 @4920910/ <h> Health Benefits of the " Master Antioxidant " Glutathione And How to Increase It Naturally <p> Glutathione ( gloo-tuh-THIGH-own ) is - a powerful cell-protector , youth-defender and disease-preventer that 's been dubbed the " master " antioxidant . <p> Glutathione lives in every , single , cell of your body . It repairs , protects and sends out signals to trigger a healing response wherever there is severe oxidative damage . The antioxidant is actually a protein formed by the three amino acids glycine , cysteine and glutamic acid . We get the " tres amigos " three-amino-chain either directly from foods , or else our ingenious bodies synthesize it from precursors such as glutamine or cysteine . <h> What Does Glutathione Do ? <p> " Your body is under constant attack , and your health is at stake ! The enemy ? Toxins : environmental agents in our food , our water , our air and our bodies . The foot soldiers in the battle against toxins are antioxidant molecules in your cells called glutathione . " <p> He explains that vitamin C is present as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals from gaining access to our cells . Vitamin E is in the cell membrane and in lipoproteins , providing further protection so that toxins cant get inside the cell . But if free radicals get past these two defenders , glutathione is prepared inside the cell to neutralize the free radical , and recycle antioxidants . <p> Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E , as well as lipoic acid , are like bumble bees . They sting once , performing their duty to protect the hive , and then die . Once vitamin C has given up one of its electrons to neutralize a radical , it also becomes neutralunless there 's some glutathione around . The master antioxidant not only does its own protective work , but it can resurrect a used antioxidant in its midst , thus doubling its capacity . <p> Of course , if glutathione is scant , the cell is in a deeply precarious situation , and so is our health . <p> 2 . Detoxifies <p> The liver is your own personal detoxifying unit . A substance enters into the body . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver ; any toxins will be captured . Its no wonder that glutathione is especially concentrated in this heroic organ . The antioxidant contains sulfur , a sticky molecule which " chelates , " or attaches to toxic substances and heavy metals , and transports them through the bile out from the body . If glutathione is deficient in the liver , toxins accumulate . You can imagine why so many natural health professionals focus on increasing glutathione as a part of disease prevention and treatment . Glutathione is a major player in the bodys natural disease prevention , or wellness maintenance , whichever term you prefer . <h> Glutathione Deficiency : Cause and Effect <p> Deficiency is associated with cancer , arthritis , Alzheimers , Parkinsons , heart disease , chronic fatigue , seizures , diabetes , autoimmune diseases and more .

Although science did make an attempt to provide you with a supplement , it turns out this is a poor means for increasing the antioxidant in your body . Taking an oral supplement simply does not increase your blood levels of the antioxidant . Your best bet is going to be to eat foods that either contain it , or else contain its precursors . <p> Best foods to increase glutathione include : <p> Whey is your #1 source , cold-pressed from grass fed cows with no artificial anything .

@@24920915 @4920915/ <h> What You Need To Know About Farmed Fish <p> It seems that no one is ever happy . Groups complain about over-fishing , and depleted stocks , then gripe about farmed fish when industry tries to do something about the over-pressured wild species . Its just about like when people drive their cars to rallies protesting oil drilling , or complain about furs while wearing leather belts and shoes . There is so much mis-information and few-mongering out there that it is difficult to get any real information on the subject . Protesters skew or make up data regularly , or list issues that are n't  really issues at all , or at most , a minor problem that is already being addressed . Fisherman are trying to protect their industry until they can catch that last fish , and sell it for a million dollars . And no one listens to the real scientists and the fish-farming companies ( the correct term is actually aquaculture ... ) , because after-all , - they are just in it for the money ( so , tell me again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this is a bad thing . In this article , I am going to attempt to separate fact from fiction , and give you the real story about aquaculture . <p> To start with , aquaculture is nothing new . People have been farming fish , and other aquatic wildlife and plants as far back as 6000BC , especially eels . The ancient Egyptians , and Romans were particularly adept at farming carp , oysters , and other types of aquatic life . The Chinese , and Japanese have been raising fish , crustaceans and aquatic plants since 2500 BC . Fish have been farmed by many European and Asian cultures all through the Middle Ages . In the modern world , fish are routinely raised for food , such as carp , catfish , oysters , shrimp , tilapia , salmon , etc , for ornamental purposes , such as guppies , goldfish and other exotic ( to us ) species , and hatcheries raise game-fish so sportsman and sportswomen can have increased opportunities for their favorite pastime . So raising fish is a very old profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derogatory attitudes only concern salmon farms , which are relatively new technologies. - The main one is sea lice . The concentrated populations of caged salmon can result in an increase in the incidence of sea lice , and other diseases , in the immediate area . But this happens with livestock and poultry production on land as well , and the salmon issue can be treated the exact same way , by the use of antibiotics , which do not harm the environment , people , or the wild fish , as long as proper guidelines and laws are observed . Most of the derogatory attitude about antibiotics comes from a single incident in Nova Scotia in the 1990s , where an aquaculture farm used illegal pesticides to combat sea lice , resulting in the death of several million lobsters across the bay . The company was fined , - and ordered to pay damages to the lobster fishermen , which they did , as well as firing those responsible . Both the lobster fishery , and the salmon farms are still in operation . The system worked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same company is underway to prevent the company from acquiring an additional 208 acres in St. Marys Bay acres for expansion , that has already been approved by the government of Nova Scotia . The protesting group , mainly the lobster fishermans union , LFA # 34 , is represented by Ecojustice , formerly known as the Sierra Defense Fund , famous for bringing lawsuits on behalf of Tree-Huggers and Eco-Nazis . The lobster fisherman are upset mainly because they are afraid they will lose a few acres of lobster fishing grounds , out the entire Bay of Fundy . They claim that the herring fishery is gone , and lobster is all that is left , but the truth is that the herring are depleted due to over-fishing , not salmon farming . Even though environmental studies have been done , and have stated that it will not adversely or irreparably damage the local ecosystems , they claim the studies are flawed . There is no way to please them , even though the expansion will create over 400 new jobs , and bring in millions of dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea lice issue , and it holds true for other diseases as well . They can be handled , and are handled , when the proper guidelines are followed . Another complaint is that fish feces accumulate beneath the cages contaminating the environment . This one is partially true . Just as on land , where livestock create tons of feces , salmon also answer the call of nature frequently . On land , this is addressed by collecting it and using it for fertilizer , generating even more income . But the salmon farms have a unique advantage , that 's cost the farms nothing , especially for the farms in the Bay of Fundy . The Bay of Fundy has some of the most extreme tides on the planet , more than 50 feet , twice a day . Needless to say , the feces does n't  stay under the cages for long , and gets dispersed into the Bay , where it can provide vital nutrients to the ecosystem . It is the same for other marine fish farms . Fresh water fish farms , such as catfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in small , easily controlled ponds . The water is regularly flushed to remove feces , and the feces is either collected for fertilizer , or flows harmlessly back into the environment to nourish it , as nature intended . The only problem might be if a fish farm was established too close to a fragile coral reef , or similar environment . The solution in that case is to build the farm somewhere else . The ocean is huge , so this should n't be a problem . That 's why they do environmental impact studies before issuing permits . <p> The next complaint about farmed fish is that many fish , like salmon , are predators , and require fish . Fish farms usually feed their fish pellets made from fish meal . Detractors say this can result in the depletion of bait-fish , but these fish are already being harvested for fish meal to be used animal foods , fish oil that you buy in stores , and fertilizer . And none of these forage-fish species are endangered , or even remotely under pressure , except in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place . This is a result of poor fisheries management policy , not salmon farms . <p> The last complaint about the farms themselves are that some fish escape and interbreed with wild fish , making the species somehow weaker . Farmed salmon have not been around long enough to have any major changes in their DNA . Farmed and wild salmon are the same species with the same genetic traits and propensities . No study has ever confirmed that interbreeding between the small number of escaped salmon , with wild salmon , has any effect on the gene pool at all. - On the lunatic side , some have complained that they have caught pink-skinned pollock , from interbreeding with farmed escaped salmon . This is laughable . First , salmon and pollack are incapable of interbreeding , naturally at least . A pollock is a member of the whitefish family . A hybrid could only be created by gene-splicing , and the result would probably not be viable . And , another complaint of farmed salmon is that they have grey flesh . So , how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typical of the hysteria surrounding salmon fish farms . <p> OK , so the farms are n't  such a bad thing after all . But what about the nutritional values of farmed salmon ? - - A major complaint is that farmed salmon have grey flesh instead of white . Fish farms are accused of adding an artificial pigment to the feed to make them pink again . Once again , this is a half-truth . Wild salmon get their pink hues from the large amount of krill ( very tiny shrimp ) they consume in the wild . A pigment is added to all fish food , even that destined to feed aquarium fish ( its the same feed ) . ground up krill . Also , canthaxanthin is often added to the feed to make their flesh even pinker than wild fish . Canthaxanthin is a naturally-occurring pigment that has been used as a food additive in just about everything for decades . Canthaxanthin is also widely used as an ingredient in sunless tanning lotions . <p> Some of the claims do have some merit . Farmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it , it makes sense . Farmed fish do not have to dodge predators , swim in current , leap waterfalls , or even look for food . They basically get to live as fish couch potatoes . Of course , they will be fatter . But fish fat is different than , for example , beef , or pork fat . Fish fat , and oil is unsaturated fat , which is more heart-friendly , and actually beneficial to some degree . Farmed fish do have less Omega 3 oil , but they still contain more than enough to make them a very healthy alternative to red meat . If you are really worried about getting enough Omega 3s , you can also get them from sources like flax seeds , fish oil , beans , walnuts , and a whole host of other foods . This is not a problem . <p> Many fear the level of antibiotics and toxins that may be present in farmed fish , but land-based livestock production involves the use of the same types of products , and so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoiled beef , or chicken . <p> The bottom line is that all doctors and nutritionists agree that farmed fish are a good thing , and should be consumed regularly . They are safe , reasonably-priced , widely available , and ease the fishing pressure on their wild cousins. - Studies indicate that fish farms are sustainable , and when managed properly , do not constitute a threat to the environment . To date , no fishery has been irreparably damaged as a direct result of fish farms , and no one has died as a direct result of eating properly-stored farmed fish.in over 5000 years. - Aquaculture provides thousands of jobs , and millions of dollars in revenue to countless communities . So , the next time you get a taste for a grilled salmon steak , go ahead and indulge yourself . Chances are , it will be a farm-raised fish . Nothing will suffer as a result . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Pinolenic acid appears to be particularly effective at stimulating the release of CCK ( cholecystokinin ) , the hormone that works as a hunger suppressant .

Instead , I submit that it is beyond a doubt the most natural , healthy , and advisable thing you can possibly do to optimize your wellness and become bulletproof to Western disease . <p> Outrageous ! <p> What 's truly outrageous is just how sick we 've become . We live in the most prosperous nation on Earth , and yet overall we 've never been more unhealthy . Chronic illness is killing us and bankrupting our economy .

Unnatural has become natural . We 're completely upside down when it comes to food and health . And it 's time for a change . <p> To right the ship , we must begin by confronting the reality that were actually addicted to foods that are killing us .

This confluence of factors creates a persistent condition in which our bodies become disease incubators , sentencing us to an almost certain future of chronic illness . <p> Even more outrageous ? Standard operating procedure for treating these common chronic conditions " everything from high cholesterol to erectile dysfunction " is to prescribe medications that treat symptoms rather than address the root cause of the issue .

Instead , it 's about a willingness to release old ideas you 've harbored your whole life about what a healthy diet entails . It 's about being open to the adventure of experimentation , exploring and rediscovering whole foods in their natural state . It 's about developing an enhanced connection to and relationship with your body , learning to pay greater attention to the nexus between the foods you eat and how you feel and function .

@@24920944 @4920944/ <h> Low Testosterone in Men Linked to Huge Increase in Risk of Death <p> There really is a male version of menopause , often called andropause . It is not as pronounced as the menopause experienced by women , but it is none the less real . Men do not like to think about it or talk about it because it makes them seem less manly . They are reluctant to do anything about it , and when they do , it is to ask for a prescription for Viagra rather than attempting to address the underlying causes of their declining energy , weight gain , irritability and failing sexual performance . A recent study may jar them into action . Researchers have found that low testosterone levels in men are associated with high risk of death from all causes . <p> From about the age of 30 on , men experience a decrease in their sex hormone levels of approximately 1.5 percent per year . The declining testosterone level is responsible for decreased muscle mass and bone density , insulin resistance , and feelings of depression . Prescriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . They do nothing to address the real issues men face during this time period . Yet , this is a critical time period in their lives , a time period during which the seeds for early death are sown . <p> As reported in the Archieves of Internal Medicine , researchers at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System and the University of Washington at Seattle , evaluated whether low testosterone levels are a risk factor for mortality in male veterans . They studied the relationship between hormone levels and death in a total of 858 males over the age of 40 . All participants received care in the VA Puget Sound Health Care System and had their testosterone levels checked at least twice between 1994 and 1999 , with no more than two years elapsing between testing . These men were followed for average period of 4.3 years , with some followed for the full eight years of the study . None of the men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer . <p> 19% of the men were classified as having low testosterone levels . 28% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of test results in the low and normal ranges . 52.7% were classified as having testosterone levels in the normal range . Men who died during the first year of the study were excluded from the data . Results were adjusted for such co-variates as age , and medical morbidity . <p> Men in the low testosterone group had an 88 percent increased risk of death compared to the group who had normal testosterone levels . This is a highly statistically significant , jaw dropping result that persisted after the other variables that may have influenced risk of death , such as age , other illnesses and body mass index were considered . <p> Testosterone levels are known to decrease following a traumatic or highly stressful event , and this may increase the risk of death during such periods . However , in a follow up analysis of the data , this factor was also adjusted for . Men with low testosterone levels were sill found to be 68 percent more likely to have died . This finding points to the conclusion that the association between low testosterone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be easily justified or ignored by men in denial . <p> Andropause is like puberty in reverse <p> The changes brought by andropause are so gradual they usually go unnoticed for several years . It is as though the life just very slowly drains away . Men who used to come home from work and have active lives with their families , take care of household problems , deal with financial issues , or maybe work a second job , gradually end up spending most of their evenings in front of the TV set or asleep on the couch . When asked why they are not getting their usual responsibilities taken care of , they have no answer except irritability . Since andropause is rarely discussed and often denied , these men have no idea what is happening to them . <p> There is a cognitive aspect involved with declining hormones in men just like in women . Women are often amazed when their men fail to see the obvious and appear oblivious to much of what is going on . And men and women are equally amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andropause exercise but see little to no improvement in muscle development or definition . If they can detect any improvement immediately after exercise , it is gone by the next day . Without discernable payback , men in andropause gradually give up their exercise along with other aspects of their lives . <p> A man in andropause will not have the strong morning erections that characterized his youth . He may have the mental desire for sexual activity , but the physical response is not there or it is there but muted . Andropause has a broad affect , impacting hormonal levels , psychology , interpersonal relationships , social activity , sexual activity , and spiritual connectedness . <p> The traditional medical establishment can only mask the symptoms of andropause <p> The rare man who is willing to discuss his problems with a physician finds that he is given a drug to mask each individual symptom . In addition to the prescription for Viagra , he will most likely be given an antidepressant , another drug to deal with frequent urination , maybe something for the prostate , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol test . These drugs do nothing to deal with the real issue , which is declining hormone levels . While a man takes these drugs , the loss of testosterone continues to work behind the scenes . When hormones levels are sagging , the body is under constant stress . This results in rising cortisol and insulin levels , weight gain , and cardiovascular issues . Declining testosterone is the basis of the heart attacks men so frequently have in middle age . <p> Declining hormone level is the hallmark during this period of premature death . The death certificate may say the man has died from heart attack or other degenerative disease , but the real cause is hormonal decline and the havoc it creates in the body . As men hit their late thirties and early forties they are approaching the peak of their careers , a time when stress is at its highest . It is also a time period for them when responsibility for family and even aging parents is also at its highest . It is a time that requires optimal and balanced hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way <p> Hormonal loss in men is so gradual that they do not realize what is happening to them . They attribute their symptoms to aging and try to forget about them . But hormonal decline will only continue and lead to the almost inevitable result of declining health and disease . It is only bioidentical testosterone replacement that can address this condition successfully and eliminate the root cause of the problems . <p> Testosterone is an anabolic steroid . It builds bone and muscle . The heart is the largest muscle in the body , so testosterone is critical to keep it strong and able to do its job . Testosterone keeps the heart healthy by keeping cholesterol and blood pressure low . It increases blood flow to the heart . It restores and stimulates testosterone receptor sites in the nerves , blood vessels and genitals . It makes it possible to again build and keep muscle mass when exercising , and it keeps bones strong . <p> Testosterone is what sends the signal to nature saying this man is still young and virile , the kind of guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between testosterone decline and prostate problems is well established . The prostate is the male equivalent of the breast in females . It has ducts in which testosterone makes food for the sperm . When testosterone levels are declining , prostate problems begin . There is no food for the sperm , and no semen . Younger men with their full complement of hormones rarely get prostate cancer or other signs of prostate problems . Their ration of testosterone to estrogen is in balance . They do not run out of semen and they are fully functioning sexually . <p> Prostate disease is not inevitable . Many studies have shown that testosterone replacement keeps prostate disease away . It can restore in men the sexual vigor they had when much younger . <p> The disease establishment is in the grip of the pharmaceutical companies who promote the idea that prostate problems are caused by testosterone .

The money is to be made by selling patented drugs , and keeping men in a state of decline until they need by-pass surgery . Although it is an extremely disillusioning realization , the pharmaceutical companies are in it for the money . They do not seem to care at all about what happens to people . <p> One aspect of testosterone decline is the conversion of testosterone to estrogen . Excessive estrogen conversion is what gives men enlarged breasts . The latest research suggests that it is too much estrogen that causes excessive proliferation of prostate cells . It is only when testosterone levels decline and conversion of testosterone to estrogen increases that prostate problems appear . In Europe , where medicine is not so heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies , testosterone is being used to treat prostate cancer with glowing results . <p> The flabby stomach and enlarged breasts of middle aged men are a signal that their estrogen levels are too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even higher than those of women over fifty . This elevated estrogen level along with declining testosterone can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and lead to inflammation of the prostate and the rest of the body . Too much estrogen can also depress testosterone production . A man can become estrogen dominate just as a woman can . Other symptoms of excess estrogen that will sound very familiar to women are hair loss , headaches , irritability , bloating and puffiness . Men also experience these symptoms . <p> Males produce a small amount of progesterone that is essential to their health . Progesterone along with testosterone helps balance the build up of estrogen . Progesterone is a precursor for cortisol , testosterone , and other hormones . Levels of progesterone fall off too as men age , and this drop causes a drop in other hormone levels . <p> Achieving hormonal balance for men <p> The art of bioidentical hormonal replacement is to replace hormones to the level they were when a man was in his prime , in his early twenties .

You might be able to talk one of them into prescribing some hormones but the prescription will probably be for a hormone drug , not bioidentical hormones that are exact replicas of what the body makes naturally . Hormone drugs are substitutions for hormones ; they are not replacements . And if your traditional doctor agrees to prescribe hormones at all , he will probably only want to you take enough to bring you up to the level that is considered normal for your age , not the level that would take you to your prime . It is only when hormones are replace to that prime level that vibrant health can be achieved again . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

Instead , we feed the cells and systems so our body can do its job of destroying or forcing out invaders , and causing health to overtake . <p> In the case of psoriasis , red , swollen patches appear where derma cells replicate at about ten times the normal rate , while pre-existing cells die off at the same old , slower pace .

Yet , experts believe that a person can have the gene , and not experience the symptoms . Poor diet is considered among the root causes of psoriasis flare-ups . Further , deficiency of specific nutrients has been associated with the symptoms of psoriasis . <p> As with any health imbalance , the natural approach does n't  simply attack the obvious symptoms , but assists the body in establishing balance . For psoriasis , there are five primaryavenues of treatment , all of which are interrelated , and which must be done in cooperation . They are : <p> Nutritive nourish all the bodys cells , tissues and systems to strengthen defenses and empower health <p> Digestive ensure that the body can make fullest use of nutrients provided , and that waste is properly eliminated to avoid toxification <p> Detoxifying keep the tissues , systems and organs clear of buildup ; be out with the old , and ensure that toxic substances are eliminated in the most efficient , painless way possible <p> Reducing Stress avoid and learn to process emotional stressors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tolerate well for a harmonious internal life <p> For this segment on healing psoriasis , well take a look at specific nutritional deficiencies and how to reverse them . <p> Nutritional Therapy <p> Research has shown that people suffering with psoriasis symptoms are often deficient in zinc and vitamin A. Other vitamin deficiencies that are associated with skin ailments are vitamins B2 ( riboflavin ) and B3 ( niacin ) , and vitamin C. <p> As a part of your psoriasis relief plan , consider increasing your intake of these vital nutrients , the holistic way . Replace poor food choices such as fatty fried foods , processed foods with high sugar and/or refined flour content , and any refined grains such as white rice . All of the plant foods recommended below are rich in fiber , important for efficient elimination and to prevent toxicity . Eat lots of these nutrient dense foods in every , single , meal , including snacks . <p> Supplement wisely . If you 're taking any prescription drugs , consult with your physician before increasing intake of nutrients . Talk to your healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional therapy for psoriasis . <p> Pay close attention to any changes immediately following supplementation , and over the course of several days after you 've increased overall intake . Keeping a journal would be wise . Observe and record changes . Ask someone to observe patches on your scalp to watch for any change in color or swelling as you improve cellular nutrition . <p> Animal proteins such as grass fed beef and organic chicken breast provide higher amounts of zinc than plant sources ; but , these proteins are harder to digest and may aggravate symptoms . You might want to avoid heavy animal proteins for a designated period and watch for any changes . Again , pay close attention . <p> Take a multi-vitamin that provides zinc . You can also take a zinc supplement but zinc nose sprays are NOT recommended . The daily requirement of zinc for men is estimated at 11mg , and for women , 8mg ( more for pregnant and lactating women ) . However , the safe upper limit ( UL ) for zinc is quite higher , up to 40mg daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medications including common antibiotics . If you 're taking prescription drugs , be sure to check with your doctor before supplementing with zinc . Zinc is usually not recommended in high dosages for unbroken extended periods . When purchasing a supplement , use as directed . <p> Vitamins B2 ( riboflavin ) and B3 ( niacin ) <p> Rather than supplementing with isolated forms of the B vitamins , increase dietary intake , and consider taking the entire B-complex . B vitamins are water soluble , meaning your body will simply flush out excess in urine , so you neednt be too afraid of overdosing . The adult UL for niacin is 35mg/day . There is no established UL for riboflavin . <p> Eat foods rich in the B vitamins . Again we have almonds , peanuts and their butters ; mushrooms , yogurt , whole grains , beans and fish . B vitamins also help to nourish and calm the nervous system , helping to ease the stress that can aggravate psoriasis symptoms . <p> Vitamin A/Beta Carotene <p> Vitamin A should also be prevalent in your daily multi-vitamin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may want to ingest more . The daily recommended dose for vitamin A is 900mcg/3000IU for men , and 700mcg/2300IU for women ( a little more for pregnant women ) . The daily vitamin A UL for adults is 3000mcg/10,000IU day . The safest way to increase this fat soluble vitamin is to eat whole foods rich in beta carotene , which is the non-toxic precursor to vitamin A. For the most part , beta carotene vitamin supplements are NOT highly recommended . If you 're considering a vitamin A/beta carotene supplement , check with your healthcare professional . <p> Most of us know that vegetables and fruits with red or orange pigment are high in beta carotene , but greens are also excellent sources . <p> For sweets , eat cantaloupe and apricots . To get a concentrated dose , drink a glass or two or three of vegetable juice each day . Carrots are still king for beta carotene , and carrot juice is not only refreshing but a concentrated source , which is rapidly absorbed into your thankful body . Eat pumpkin and , yes , pumpkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kale , spinach , turnip greens , beet greens , and cabbage . Raw is better . You can also juice these fresh and drink for a nice foamy mustache and happier skin cells . <p> Its best to consume vitamin C throughout the day instead of taking a single high dose , especially when supplementing . <p> Camu-camu might be the most health-boosting vitamin C food-supplement available , as it also contains other vital nutrients that help to build and protect healthy cells , reduce inflammation and prevent disease . There are a plethora of vitamin C supplements available as capsule , powder , drink , tablet and lozenge . <p> Omega-3 Fish Oils <p> Essential fatty acids are serious skin-allies . They help to reduce skin-irritating inflammation , and have been shown to ease symptoms from psoriasis . <p> Studies have shown that EPA ( eicosapentanoic acid ) may reduce flare-up symptoms of psoriasis considerably .

Incomplete protein digestion causes the formation of polyamines , toxins that cause excessive skin cell growth . <p> Alcohol is inflammatory and may also trigger a psoriasis flare-up .

Though he says the foundations -4 million G5 million annual budget can still " struggle " to support its growing workload . <p> According to the Cambridge-educated scientist , the fundamental knowledge needed to develop effective anti-ageing therapies already exists .

If that sounds like the ramblings of a crackpot weird-beard , hear him out ; Dr De Greys run the numbers . <p> " If you look at the maths it is very straightforward , " he says . " All we are saying here is that its quite likely that within the next 20 or 30 years , we will develop medicines that can rejuvenate people faster than time is passing .

" The theory " first discovered by a lab in America " is that , as an adaptation to living underground in tight tunnels , theyve developed a really loose skin so they do n't  get stuck or snagged . That elasticity is a result of it producing this gloopy sugar polysacharide , high-molecular-weight hyaluronan ( HMW-HA ) . " <p> While humans already have a version of hyaluronan in our bodies that helps heal wounds by encouraging cell division ( and , ironically , assist tumour growth ) , that of the naked mole rat does the opposite .

" I see no reason why we cant use this to inform human anti-cancer and ageing therapies by manipulating our own hyaluronan system , " says Faulkes . <p> Then there are the naked mole rats cells themselves , which seem to make proteins " the molecular machines that make bodies work " more accurately than ours , preventing age-related illnesses like Alzheimers . And the way they handle glucose does n't  change with age either , reducing their susceptibility to things like diabetes . " Most of the age-related declines you see in the physiology in mammals do not occur in naked mole rats , " adds Faulkes . " We 've only just begun on the naked mole rat story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a major downstream effect on human health . Its very exciting . " <p> Of course , the naked mole rat is n't the only animal scientists are probing to pick the lock of long life . " With a heart-rate of 1,000 beats a minute , the tiny hummingbird should be riddled with rogue free radicals the oxygen-based chemicals that basically make mammals old by gradually destroying DNA , proteins and fat molecules but its not , " says zoologist Jules Howard , author of Death on Earth : Adventures in Evolution and Mortality . " Then there are pearl mussel larvae that live in the gills of Atlantic salmon and mop up free radicals , and lobsters , which seem to have evolved a protein which repairs the tips of DNA telomeres , allowing for more cell divisions than most animals are capable of . And we mustnt forget the 2mm-long C. elegans roundworm . Within these 2mm-long nematodes are genetic mechanisms that can be picked apart like cogs and springs in an attempt to better understand the causes of ageing and ultimately death . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may hold the master key to immortality : the Turritopsis dohrnii , or Immortal Jellyfish . Most jellyfish , when they reach the end of life , die and melt into the sea . Not the Turritopsis dohrnii . Instead , the 4mm sea creature sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor , where its body folds in on itself " assuming the jellyfish equivalent of the foetal position " and regenerates back into a baby jellyfish , or polyp , in a rare biological process called transdifferentiation , in which its old cells essentially transform into young cells . <p> There is just one scientist who has been culturing Turritopsis polyps in his lab consistently . He works alone , without major financing or a staff , in a poky office in Shirahama , a sleepy beach town near Kyoto . Yet , Professor Shin Kubota has managed to rejuvenate one of his charges 14 times , before a typhoon washed it away . " The Turritopsis dohrnii is a miracle of nature , " he says over the phone . " My ultimate purpose is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms to human beings . You see , very surprisingly , the Turritopsis genome is very similar to humans " much more so than worms . I believe we will have the technology to begin applying this immortal genome to humans very soon . " <p> If Pr . Kubota really believes his own claim , then he s got a race on his hands ; he s not the only scientist with a " 20-year " prophesy . The acclaimed futurist and computer scientist Ray Kurzweil believes that by the 2030s well have microscopic machines travelling through our bodies , repairing damaged cells and organs , effectively wiping out diseases and making us biologically immortal anyway . " The full realisation of nanobots will basically eliminate biological disease and ageing , " he told the world a few years back . <p> Its a blossoming industry . And , in a state-of-the-art lab at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory , at Bristol University , Dr Sabine Hauert is on its coalface . She designs swarms of nanobots " each a thousand times smaller than the width of a hair " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drugs to infiltrate the pores of cancer cells , like millions of tiny Trojan Horses , and destroy them from within . " We can engineer nanoparticles to basically do what we want them to do , " she tells me . " We can change their size , shape , charge or material and load them with molecules or drugs that they can release in a controlled fashion . " <p> While she says the technology can be used to combat a whole gamut of different illnesses , Dr Hauert has trained her crosshairs on cancer . What 's the most effective nano-weapon against malignant tumours ? Gold . Millions of swarming golden nanobots that can be dispatched into the bloodstream , where they will seep into the tumour through little holes in its rapidly-growing vessels and lie in wait . " Then , " she says , " if you heat them with an infrared laser they vibrate violently , degrading the tumours cells . We can then send in another swarm of nanoparticles decorated with a molecule that 's loaded with a chemotherapy drug , giving a 40-fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is very exciting technology that is already having a huge impact on the way we treat cancer , and will do on other diseases in the future . " <p> The next logical step , as Kurzweil claims , is that we will soon have nanobots permanently circulating in our veins , cleaning and maintaining our bodies indefinitely . They may even replace our organs when they fail . Clinical trials of such technology is already beginning on mice . <p> The naked mole rat colony in Chris Faulkes lab <p> The oldest mouse ever to live was called Yoda . He lived to the age of four . The oldest ever dog , Bluey , was 29 . The oldest flamingo was 83 . The oldest human was 122 . The oldest clam was 507 . The point is , evolution has rewarded species whove worked out ways to not get eaten by bigger species " be it learning to fly , developing big brains or forming protective shells . Naked mole rats went underground and learned to work together . " <p> A mouse is never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats , " says Faulkes . " Naked mole rats have no such concerns because they built vast networks of tunnels , developed hierarchies and took up different social roles to streamline productivity . They bought themselves time to evolve into biological marvels . " <p> At the top of every colony is a queen . Second in rank are her chosen harem of catamites with whom she mates for life . Beneath them are the soldiers and defenders of the realm , the biggest animals around , and at the bottom are the workers who dig tunnels with their teeth or search for tubers , their main food source . They have a toilet chamber , a sleeping chamber , a nursing chamber and a chamber for disposing of the dead . They rarely go above ground and almost never mix with other colonies . " Its a whole mosaic of different characteristics that have come about through adapting to living in this very extreme ecological niche , " says Faulkes . " All of the weird and wonderful things that contribute to their healthy ageing have come about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wiped out by infectious diseases . " <p> Still , the naked mole rat is not perfect . Dr Faulkes learned this the hard way one morning in March last year , when he turned the light on in his lab to a grisly scene . " Blood was smeared about the perspex walls of a tunnel in colony N , " he says , " and the mangled corpse of one of my mole rats lay lifeless inside . " There was one explanation : a queen had been murdered . " There had been a coup , " he recalls . " Her daughter had decided she wanted to run the colony so she savaged her mother to death to take over . You see , naked mole rats may be immune to death by ageing , but they can still be killed , just like you and me . " <p> That 's the one issue that true immortalists have with the concept of radical life extension : we can still get hit by a bus or murdered . But what if the entire contents of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " could be scanned and uploaded onto a mainframe , so when You 1.0 finally does fall down a lift shaft or is killed by a friend , You 2.0 could be fed into a humanoid avatar and rolled out of an immortality factory to pick up where you left off ? <p> Dr Randall Koene insists You 2.0 would still be you . " What if I were to add an artificial neuron next to every real neuron in your brain and connect it with the same connections that your normal neurons have so that it operates in exactly the same way ? " he says . " Then , once Ive put all these neurons in place , I remove the connections to all the old neurons , one by one , would you disappear ? " <p> Dr Koene is a neuroscientist , a neuroengineer and Science Director of the 2045 Initiative , the brainchild of Russian billionaire Dmitri Itskov , whose aim is to " create technologies enabling the transfer of an individuals personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier , and extending life , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breathtaking ambition , but could it actually be done ? " The mind is a product of the brain that is routed in physics , " says Koene . " Its a material thing subject to cause and effect , and that 's the kind of thing we describe in mathematical models . If we can describe something in math then it means it is computative , so of course its possible to upload a mind such that its running on a different computing substrate . That said , being just a brain in a box would be a very sad thing indeed . That 's why we need immortal bodies to support it . " <p> So he and Itskov have launched a four-phase assault on death , known as the Avatar Project . Avatar A ( 2015-2020 ) will be a robot that we control with our brains ; Avatar B ( 2020-2025 ) will be the transplantation of a brain into a synthetic body ; Avatar C ( 2030-2035 ) will involve uploading the contents of a persons brain into a synthetic one ; and Avatar D ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . <p> " The real reason for this is self-directed evolution , " Koene says . " If we can modify not just the mind but also the body , then that adaptability is the most powerful thing there is . It was Darwin who said it was n't the strongest or smartest species that survives , but the most adaptable , and this technology will include allowing us to change our capabilities of memory , travel , how fast the brain processes information , or even add new senses to experience a spectrum way beyond what we do now . " <p> Despite his lofty ambitions , even Koene thinks well never truly escape the cold hand of death . " Really , what were talking about is putting the extent of your life in your hands as a choice , " he adds . " Do n't  leave it up to a disease , leave it up to yourself . " <p> Aubrey De Grey ( Photo : SHARE Conference , via ) <p> But would , ultimately , that choice be up to us ? Or would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Troyer , director of Bath Universitys Centre for Death and Society , wants to know . " Overcrowding is the obvious long-term issue , " he says . " But the near-term question is about access . Will this technology be universally accessible , or will it be exclusionary ? " <p> He makes an intriguing point . Already there is a wide healthcare disparity between rich and poor ; recent figures from the London Health Observatory found the gap in life expectancy between those in Londons affluent and deprived areas is now nearly 25 years . " We already have discrepancies in access to all kinds of biomedical care in the UK , " he says . " Were heading into a situation where the upper classes might say , Well , maybe the lower classes should just be able to die a natural death while we live on. I mean , in some ways that 's already happened " its just not said that way . " <p> There are political , ethical and social questions , too . " How will we fund this ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies ? How long will we go to university for ? Will prisoners be offered the technology or denied it ? And what if the state tries to use it as a punitive tool " to forcibly regenerate criminals against their will for however long the sentence is ? Well , we already have that too . " <p> Dr Troyer sees another standout theme in mans quest for radical life-extension . " There is a certain masculine blindness to some of these issues , and I do n't  think its a coincidence that it is being driven largely by white men with money whove worked in tech , " he says . " Of course , I do n't  ever want to essentialise gender , but there is a bit of a divide in what could be described as male ego driving a lot of this , as if society would be robbed of the male genius . In my experience , I get a lot of women saying , Why would I want to do this ? Its a noticeable trend , that 's all I should say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mole rat would ever worry about . In their feminist ecosystem , there 's no place for male ego ; it is the queen alone who decides what 's good for the colony . And she has a bulletproof way of preventing overpopulation , too : by literally bullying her subjects into infertility , so she has exclusive breeding rights . " She uses a system of very subtle cues , like shoving and trampling , to prevent them from developing sexually , " says Faulkes . " In humans , stress can lead to infertility , and its likely that the same mechanisms are interfered with in mole rats . " <p> As a result , she gets the best food and does the least work . Whenever another tries to usurp her she fights them to the death , and usually wins . And if she wants sex , she gets it . " The queen always initiates mating , " chuckles Faulkes . " Woe betide anyone who tries it on with her uninvited . " It may be a dictatorship , but its one that works . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bit , no matter how small , for the good of the colony , which in turn helps them individually , " says Faulkes . " That 's ultimately why they 've developed their anti-ageing genes . " <p> Trouble is , that does n't  really work for humans : in North Korea , the average life expectancy is 69 years , according to the World Health Organisation , compared to 81 in the neighbouring south . " Short of all moving to the sewers and waiting 20 million years to evolve , " smiles Faulkes , " our best bets to replicate their mechanisms through biology . That we think we can do . " <p> So who 's your money on to win the race for immortality ? Obviously , each scientist I spoke to reckons their field is the one to watch . But in truth , it probably will be a combination of them all . As De Grey says : " I do n't  think there will be a single winner in that sense . I think itll be a case of the divide and conquer approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of different components and put them together before we can truly defeat ageing . " <p> Weve moved downstairs to Faulkes office . Aside from the reams of paperwork and science books , it is a cornucopia of biological curios : a pickled bat in a perspex box , monkey skulls , horse skulls , the scull of a sabre-tooth tiger , a dead crow , a stuffed fish and a plastic bag of preserved rats from the 1920s hanging on the door . It is a veritable museum of death , which seems a little ironic given what he does in life . " I suppose it all reminds me that death is everywhere , " he says . " Right now we cant escape it " not yet " so why ignore it ? " <p> But if we do work out how to streamline our biology to defeat ageing , would he want to live forever ? He thinks for a moment , then says : " I du n no . It might be interesting . But to be honest , I 'm more interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Sabbath with the wife and kids .

Magnesium regulates how your body uses zinc , calcium , potassium , vitamin D , copper and other nutrients . - <h> How Do You Know if You Have a Magnesium Deficiency ? <p> The symptoms of magnesium deficiency are pretty wide-ranging . If you only have one or two symptoms , you might not have a deficiency ( or not a serious one at any rate ) , but if you notice three or more persistent symptoms , you should increase your intake of magnesium-rich foods and take a magnesium supplement to see if it helps . You can be tested for magnesium deficiency , but it 's difficult for a doctor to assess your actual mag levels with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue cells , it does n't necessarily show up in your blood . Even if you do n't have a serious magnesium deficiency , but you have a symptom or two , you can always supplement ( start slowly ! ) and see if they improve .

If you find that you ca n't get enough magnesium through your diet , you can supplement with a topical magnesium spray . Topical magnesium will get into your system faster and more completely than a pill , as it is absorbed quickly through your skin and goes directly into your bloodstream . <h> Eat These Foods to Get- More Magnesium in- Your Diet <p> Vegetables , nuts and seeds are some of your best sources of magnesium. - Even though the mineral is abundant in our food supply , lots of people have a hard time getting enough of it in their daily intake . <p> That may be because we are so in love with the convenience , sugar and salt that come with processed foods that many of us- have trouble eating healthy . If you put in the effort though , you can increase your levels by carefully monitoring your diet to ensure you include plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnesium daily . <p> Here is a list of some of the most magnesium-rich foods you can eat <p> It 's valuable to know that even if you eat a diet that is high in whole , unprocessed foods and even if many of those foods are relatively high in magnesium , it can still be tough- to get as much magnesium as is recommended for a healthy adult . <p> This has a lot to do with industrial farming practices . Our soil is stripped of various nutrients " like magnesium " over time and chemical fertilizers do n't replace them . This means that the food we grow today has less magnesium in it than the same crops would have had 50 to 100 years ago . <h> Maybe that 's why as many as 80% of American adults are deficient ! <p> Whether you think you may have a magnesium deficiency or not , proper magnesium intake is very important for overall health . <p> Though eating magnesium-rich foods is always beneficial , I recommend that you add a magnesium supplement to your daily routine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your eating habits , body chemistry or day-to-day changes in routine . A great way to receive magnesium via supplement is with a topical magnesium spray . <p> Activation Products have the best magnesium . Its called- EASE magnesium , and it is the perfect solution that we 've been using for years . You can simply spray the mineral right onto your skin . <p> Each bottle of EASE is filled to the top with 100% pure iMCHG , our all-natural , bioavailable magnesium . Delivering 27.2mg of magnesium per spray , EASE is easily absorbed into the skin , enters the bloodstream and goes right to work in your cells . It can help to eliminate aches and pains and feelings of stress and anxiety . It aids in digestion , as well as ensuring a deeper and more satisfying sleep . Getting enough- magnesium has never been so easy ! <p> Do n't be one of the 80% who are plagued with magnesium deficiency issues . Face the problem head on . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654

While a majority focus on avoiding plastic bags , cups , etc. , not many are even mindful of the fact that coffee cup lids are harmful to both the environment and our health . Read on to know why you need to be a lot more mindful of that next cup of coffee . <p> We all know that plastic has its share of myriad harmful effects . If one statistic about Westerners having at least a kilo of undigested plastic in their systems is to be believed , an overwhelming number of individuals are at risk of suffering from hormonal imbalance due to plastic exposure . <p> The first rule of thumb for avoiding dangerous plastics is to inspect the bottom of any plastic object and see the number within the small triangle . If the number in this triangle is either 3,6 , or 7 , one must never proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plastics <p> #1 : Polyethylene terephtalate , also known as PETE or PET . This plastic is used to make water bottles and IS recyclable . <p> #2 : High-density polyethylene , or HDPE . This plastic is used to make milk jugs and detergent bottles and IS recyclable . <p> #3 : This represents PVC or vinyl and is most commonly found in childrens toys , plastic shoes , plastic food packaging and shower curtains . The 3 range of plastics is a threat to our health because it consists of phthalates , whose side effects include a negative effect on the formation of a male babys genitals . This type of plastic is also detrimental to our well-being upon breakdown over time and heating in a microwave . It is NOT recyclable . <p> #4 : Low-density polyethylene , or LDPE . This is what plastic shopping bags are made of . It requires a special recycling process and should not be intermingled with other recyclables . <p> #5 : Polypropylene . This plastic is used to make yogurt cups and other opaque containers . It IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plastic cutlery , and coffee cup lids , and the main component is polystyrene or styrofoam . Polystyrene is a known carcinogen and a neurotoxin , especially when heated . This is a cause for concern given that most coffee cup lids fall in this category . These items are NOT recyclable and they are NOT biodegradable . <p> #7 : These comprise miscellaneous plastics that do n't  fall in the other categories , that is , mostly Bisphenol A or BPA . BPA disrupts the hormones and causes behavioral and neural problems in children . These plastics are used to make everything from iPods to food storage containers . These are usually NOT recyclable . <p> Why coffee cup lids are dangerous <p> 1 . The plastic <p> Most juice and coffee cup lids are extremely toxic since they fall in the 6 and 7 classes of plastics . As such , one must never heat them or even sip from them . Fortunately , however , there are better alternatives made from Grade 5 polypropelene plastic . All said and done , it goes without saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To elaborate further on coffee cup lids , the problem lies in the fact that almost all of them can not be recycled , and that they can also leach dangerous toxins in the coffee . The plastic lids are made of polystyrene , a Grade 6 plastic which is the denser form of Styrofoam . This component can not only leach harmful chemicals that mimic hormonal action into food , but also increase cancer risk . <p> Biodegradable coffee cups lids are present in the market , but most retailers or coffee shops do n't  use them . The best solution in this case is to avoid the lid altogether when you buy your beverage . Another option is to use a reusable stainless steel mug that has a Grade 5 low-leaching and recyclable plastic lid . <p> 2 . The bacteria <p> A study conducted by the University of Arizona revealed that plastic coffee cup lids were breeding grounds for bacteria . Though bacteria are all around us , they are aplenty on disposable coffee cups . In the study , 40 coffee cup lids were tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that werent too harmful . <p> If you 're concerned about BPA toxicity in your food , these 3 quick tips will help you limit you and your familys exposure to this potentially toxic chemical . <p> Always check the number on any plastic bottle or food container . Look for are 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 as these plastics have the least amount of BPA ( or none at all ) . <p> Stay away from heavy-duty rigid plastic ( i.e. the plastic that is nearly impossible to break or shatter ) as BPA levels are much higher in such plastics . <p> Avoid canned food and drinks . Most cans are usually lined with BPA . Soft drink cans also contain BPA just another reason to drop your can-a-day habit . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654 @qwx245654 
@@24920968 @4920968/ <h> Scientists Discover a Fat Burning Hormone <p> When serotonin is in balance in your brain , you 're happier . When it 's working correctly in your gut , it prompts fat burning . Discover more in this post from HowStuffWorks ! <h> Is a Hormone in Our Brains the Key to Fat Burning ? <p> For the first time , researchers have found a hormone in the brain that stimulates fat metabolism . Biologists at The Scripps Research Institute ( TSRI ) in San Diego made the discovery , which could affect future development of fat-burning drugs . Their findings were published in Nature Communications . <p> Researchers at San Diegos Scripps Institute isolated a hormone in the brain that stimulates fat metabolism . LAGUNA DESIGN/GETTY IMAGES <p> Their research started with the neurotransmitter serotonin , which is found throughout the body . Scientists have known that serotonin regulates appetite and prompts fat loss , but havent understood how . The team studied serotonins effect on a species of roundworm called Caenorhabditiselegans because , interestingly enough , their brains are wired much like humans , and humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotransmitters . <p> Researchers tracked the fat-burning process by pinpointing the roundworms gene in which the fat-burning would not take place . They gave the roundworms serotonin and measured how much energy they burned and how much fat they had . Scientists then removed one gene at a time . If the worms continued to burn fat as it should , then the scientists surmised that gene was not involved . But if removing a gene disrupted the fat-burning , then they could make a link . That process of trial and error led the research team to a specific gene in a neuropeptide hormone called FLP-7 ( pronounced flip-7 ) . <p> Once scientists isolated the FLP-7 gene , they had to determine whether it was connected to serotonin levels in the brain . To do that , scientists added a protein that glowed a bright red to FLP-7 and were able to watch the hormone move through the worms body . <p> What they found was that worms brains released FLP-7 when they were stimulated by high levels of serotonin . As the hormone made its way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their intestines . <p> Scripps researchers also noticed no side effects when they increased the level of serotonin . The worms functioned normally as they burned more fat . <p> So , what does this mean for humans ? Well if you think it means you wont have to go to the gym anymore then think again . More work and studies have to be done ; the next step for the team is to begin testing on mice . If the results are the same as what they found in the roundworms , Scripps Research can consider preparing a drug for human clinical trials . <p> NOW THAT 'S INTERESTING <p> When serotonin is in balance in your brain , you 're happier , calmer , more emotionally grounded and less anxious . When the chemical is working correctly in your gut , so are your bowels . <h> BeWellBuzz 45654
