@@97944447 @2144447/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Eyeglass Frame Size <p> The size of an eyeglass frame is not important for fitting eyeglasses because eyeglasses are designed so that the temples , nosepads , and bridge can be adjusted to fit properly . Eyeglasses frame size is first and foremost a fashion decision.This article covers two aspects of eyeglasses frame size : <p> 1 ) How to find the right size of glasses that you want . 2 ) How eyeglasses frame sizes work and how to measure frame size <h> Virtual Try On Application <p> We have developed a patented Virtual Try On application so you can upload your photo and virtually " try on " most of our frames and see how the size looks on you before you buy . <h> Finding The Right Size Eyeglasses For You <p> The easiest and fastest way to find the right size glasses for you is to use your current glasses as a benchmark . Once you know the size of your current glasses , you have a frame of reference for a new pair of glasses . So let 's say for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can now use the Advanced Search function to search for eyeglasses with a similar size . When you do the search , search the eye size range 49-51 , and search the bridge range 18-22 , and do not search the temple size . Temple size is really not important except is very special cases . Searching a range of sizes is important because it vastly increases the number of results you will get , and also the difference in sizes will be almost unnoticeable compared to your current eyeglasses . <p> For any person , there is no one right size of glasses . Your face can accommodate a wide variety of glasses sizes and most glasses will work for most people . In order to understand why this is true , you need to look at what size means ; size in glasses is a very different concept than size in shoes or clothing . As a result , you should focus most on how the glasses look on your face ; when you find glasses that look good , in most cases the glasses can be adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the total width of the glasses front all the way across , including the endpieces , should be similar to the width of your head . This will allow for the optimum proportion of the glasses to the head , and for the best comfort . <h> How To Measure Eyeglasses Frame Size <p> There are two ways to measure eyeglasses frame size : 1 ) Read the tiny lettering on the inside of your glasses . Sometimes the lettering has worn off , or it is too small for you to see even with a magnifying glass . In which case you need to 2 ) Measure your glasses with a millimeter ruler . The eye size is measured from one side of the lens to the other , horizontally , at the widest points . The bridge size is the distance between the lenses at the closest point . The temple size is measured from the tip to the hinge , including the bend . <h> Eyeglasses Sizes <p> A glasses or sunglasses frame model is usually available in just one size , meaning one combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glasses frame may have more than one size : for example 50-17-135 B40 , and 52-17-135 B42 , and 54-18-140 B43 . You can not mix and match the measurements , you must take the whole set of measurements for a given glasses frame and you can not choose a different collection of measurements . For some manufacturers , if a frame model has more than one available temple length , you may be able to swap temples , but you must contact our customer service department to find out if this is possible for the frame you want . <h> Measurements <p> Glasses frames have four basic measurements : the eye , bridge , temple , and B measurements . The eye size refers to the horizontal width in millimeters of one of the frames lenses . The measurement is taken from the inside of one side of the frame to the inside of the other side of the frame . The lens is measured from its furthest point , where it would intersect with a vertical line . The bridge measurement is the distance in millimeters between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest points of the two lenses . <p> The temple length is measured along the length of the temple , from one end to the other , including the bend . Many frames are constructed with an endpiece that extends from the frame front back along the line of the temple . This backward extension of the frames endpiece could be as little as 2mm , or as much as 15mm . When the endpiece extends further back , the temple length tends to be smaller to compensate . As a result , if you are accustomed to a 145mm temple length , a 135mm temple could work perfectly for you if your new frame has an endpiece that extends back 10mm . This is also the case with many sunglasses with a wrap design . The wrap has the effect of bringing the frame front back towards the ears , thereby requiring shorter temples lengths to compensate . The B measurement refers to the vertical height of an eyeglasses lens , and is measured from the tip to the bottom of the lens aperture of the frame . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the lens , to the horizontal line intersecting with the bottom edge of the lens . The B measurement is only important when making progressive or multifocal lenses . <h> Reading Your Glasses Size <p> Most glasses frames have some size information printed on the inside of the frame , although the lettering can be worn away with use . To find all the lettering , you must look on the inside of both temples , and on the inside of the bridge . The numbers usually look something like this : <p> GU125 635 50 17 135 <p> For this frame , it means that the model number is GU125 , color number 635 , with size 50-17-135 . In this case , the brand Guess is abbreviated GU , followed by the model number of the frame . The eye size is followed by bridge size , sometimes with a small square box in between . The temple length could be printed after the eye and bridge sizes , or elsewhere . Other letters and numbers could refer to the color of the frame . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyeglasses Frame Size Total Width <p> However , these sizes do not give you all the information that you need to know for sure how big the glasses frame is . To know truly how big the frame is - meaning how will it look on your face - you must determine the total frame width . The total frame width includes the endpieces , and the endpieces are never measured and specified . The endpiece refers to the width of the frame from the edge of the lens out to the edge of the frame where the temples are connected to the frame front . On the product pages of the Eyeglasses.com catalog , look in the frame details for the " screw to screw " measurement , which tells how wide the frame actually is . <p> Once you have determined the total frame width , you can use that value to compare to your current glasses , or you can hold a ruler up to your face to get an idea how well the frame will line up with the sides of your head . Endpieces vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 6mm to 30mm of the total frame width . The rule of thumb is that endpieces add up to about 10% of the total frame width . Here is the formula to determine the total glasses width : Total frame width = left endpiece + left eye size + bridge size + right eye size + right endpiece . <p> You can quickly estimate the total frame width by adding the left and right eye size and the bridge size , and then multiplying times 1.1 . Because the endpiece sizes are never supplied by the manufacturer , and if you do not have the glasses in your hand to measure , there is a way of more accurately estimating the size of the endpieces online : <p> There are some cases where a large glasses frame on a small head could look oversized , and a small glasses frame on a large person may hurt ( as the temples persistently dig into the sides of your head ) . But even in extreme situations , you choose frames first on how they look on your face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed so they can be adjusted . You can take your eyeglass frames to a local optical professional for an adjustment , or read more about adjusting your eyeglasses . <h> Try On Glasses <p> You may feel that it is necessary to try on glasses before you buy them . However , unlike a shirt that you can not alter to fit your body , glasses can be adjusted to fit your face . Read more about eyeglasses fit . We have a liberal return policy , so feel free to order some eye glasses online , and then return the ones that you do n't  like within thirty days for a full refund ( there are some limits here ) . We do not charge a restocking fee unless you want to order a large number of frames on approval .

@@97944453 @2144453/ <h> Problems With Your New Glasses ? How To Solve Them <p> If you 're unhappy with that new pair of eyeglasses you 've just purchased , do n't be shy about returning to the optical store to discuss what can be done to fix the problem . <p> When you 're selecting new eyeglasses , you often ca n't actually see what you look like in the frames until your prescription lenses are inserted . So it 's not unusual for you to think you 've purchased the right glasses , only to have " buyer 's remorse " after wearing them a few days . <p> To avoid unpleasant surprises , it 's a good idea to ask your optician about the the optical store 's satisfaction guarantee ( if they have one ) and its returns policy before you buy . <h> No-Hassle Eyeglass Refunds And Replacements <p> You usually can expect a refund or replacement from an optical store in these cases : <p> You purchase an item that has a manufacturer 's defect , such as a frame that breaks because of a weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mistake in how your eyes were measured or the lenses were fabricated . <p> The Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) states that , if an item is broken when you buy it , you can demand a full cash refund . <p> If your eyeglasses break because of a defect , you should have no trouble getting your money back . <p> Also , reputable optical stores usually will have no problem offering you a replacement , because most eyewear manufacturers will provide free replacements to the retailer if there is a manufacturing defect . Both the makers of eyeglass lenses and frames and the optical stores put their reputations first and do not want consumers to think their eyewear is inferior . <p> However , there is a definite line between defective lenses and frames and ones that have been obviously abused or the victim of an accident . Neither the manufacturer nor the seller has an obligation to provide a replacement in those cases , although some optical stores do offer insurance or warranty plans . <p> The other clear-cut case in which obtaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenses are made incorrectly . There are two possible causes : <p> It is a good idea to take any pair of completed glasses back to the prescribing doctor and have the lenses checked for accuracy . If the optical shop has made a mistake , ask the doctor 's office for a written explanation of exactly what the errors are , so you can bring it to the store and have the lenses remade ? at no charge , of course . <p> Do n't like the look of your new glasses ? Whether you can return them depends on where you bought them . <p> If the prescription has been made correctly , but you are still uncomfortable with your vision through the eyeglasses , your eye doctor can recheck your eyes and modify the prescription if necessary . <p> Most optical stores will remake the lenses for you at no charge at least once if the doctor adjusts the prescription . In most cases , one change should be sufficient to give you comfortable vision . <p> If you have a specific problem with your eyes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your eyeglass prescription to change constantly , be sure to discuss this with your optician beforehand so you know how many times they will remake your lenses at no charge and what conditions apply . <p> Beyond the first courtesy remake at no charge , usually something must be negotiated . You may be able to arrive at an agreeable solution by paying a reduced amount for the remakes until the prescription is satisfactory and then paying to have any coatings or additional lens treatments put only on the final pair . <p> If your new glasses have progressive lenses and you have trouble adapting to them , your optician may be able to exchange them for a different design or brand of no-line multifocal lenses . <p> If instead you prefer to have your progressives lenses replaced with lower-priced bifocal or single vision lenses , it 's possible you wo n't be refunded the difference in cost , depending on the store 's policies . <h> What If You Just Do n't Like Your New Glasses ? <p> The gray areas come into play if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yikes ! If you ca n't see clearly when driving with your new glasses , return to your optician or eye doctor for a recheck of the lenses and prescription . <p> If the prescription is satisfactory , then being unhappy with the glasses can mean a number of things such as : <p> You simply made a poor choice in style ? a mistake we probably all have made . <p> Depending on what the exact objection is , optical stores have policies that can differ widely . Your success in exchanging the eyeglasses or obtaining a refund will depend on where you bought them . <p> Some optical stores will take the entire pair of glasses back within a certain time period , no questions asked . Within a specified time frame ? typically one to four weeks from the date of purchase ? you can receive a full refund or a store credit so you can find something more to your liking . <p> Some stores will offer a credit or refund only on the frames , because they can be returned to the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else . <p> Other stores wo n't take back the eyeglasses at all , and have an " all sales are final " policy . <p> This is why it pays to ask questions about return policies ahead of time . You invest a significant amount of money in new eyewear , so you need to know what to expect " just in case . " <p> Although state laws vary , what you are entitled to depends on the refund policy that the store posts in some form : on a sign by the register , a written policy on the sales slip or other documentation . But what you actually negotiate with the store may be much more satisfying than the written policy . <p> Just as when shopping for any other kind of merchandise , you 're best off using common sense when deciding on which optical stores to patronize . One that comes highly recommended from satisfied friends or relatives often is a good bet . <p> If you do n't have a recommendation , talk to an optical shop 's opticians before you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they treat you poorly , then chances are that you wo n't have a good experience should you have a problem down the road . <p> If staff members treat you courteously when you make the purchase , they often will look for ways to help you overcome any difficulties you have after the sale . If the glasses are too heavy , for example , the optician may be able to suggest a lighter lens material and allow you to pay only the difference between the cost of the original lenses and the lightweight lenses , rather than charging you full price . <p> Likewise , if the frames are n't a good fit , the optician may put the existing lenses into another style that fits better ? asking you to pay only the difference , should the better-fitting frames cost more than the ones you originally bought . If the new frames are larger , however , there also may be a charge to remake new lenses to fit the frames . <h> Insurance , Warranties And Replacement Plans <p> Aside from being unable to wear your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what happens if your eyewear gets damaged . Here again , the policies of different optical stores will vary , so ask about the store 's eyewear damage policy before you buy . <p> Some shops charge a fee ? generally in the $25 to $50 range ? for damage insurance or a warranty on the eyeglass frames and/or lenses . <p> Consider what the replacement cost would be if a lens became scratched ? the most common type of damage that can occur . Does the cost of replacing one lens exceed the price of the insurance ? If so , it may be worthwhile to purchase the extra peace of mind ? especially if the glasses are for a child or a rambunctious adult . <p> While some warranties guarantee unlimited replacements at no additional charge , others limit the number of frames or lenses they will provide . Different policies also may involve a small fee , or " co-payment , " to replace the frame or lenses . <p> Sometimes replacement policy costs are included in the purchase price of the eyeglasses , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . If damage is a big concern , then factor that into your decision about where to buy . <h> If You 're Still Dissatisfied <p> If you do your homework up front and purchase your eyeglasses from the optical store that makes the most sense for you , chances are that you will have good results should you have to request a refund or exchange . <p> But if you try to negotiate with the optical shop in good faith to resolve a problem and you believe that you are being treated unfairly , you are not without recourse . <p> If you are dealing with a retail chain store , contact the corporate headquarters and explain your difficulties at that level . <p> If it 's an independent store , or if the chain 's headquarters is unresponsive , you can file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau , which will work on your behalf to try to resolve the situation . In addition , your state or local consumer protection agency may be able to help . <p> If you are unable to achieve satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful weapon available to you : You can vote with your wallet . If enough people take their business elsewhere , the uncooperative optical store will find itself with no customers left to offend and will be forced to close its doors .

@@97944456 @2144456/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Anti-Reflective ( AR ) Coating <h> What is Anti-Reflective AR coating ? <p> Anti-reflective coating ( aka , no-glare , AR ) is a series of layers that is adhered to the back and front surface of a lens , or just the back of the lens if the lens is polarized . The purpose of no glare coating is to help reduce the amount of reflections on the lens . Consisting of metal oxides , each layer is a thin film that is designed to block a specific wavelength of light . The more layers of film , the more wavelengths that are blocked . AR coating causes the light that reflects from the inner and outer surfaces of each film layer to become equal , thereby canceling each other out . <p> Do you remember back in the 1990 's when anti-reflective AR coatings regularly flaked , stained , and got psychedelic colors ? It was a nightmare for opticians because customers got angry and would blame them for selling an expensive coating that did not perform well . <p> Well , the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether you choose the more expensive Crizal AR coating , or the less expensive AR coatings that are available . Yes , if you leave your glasses on the dashboard of your car in Florida , the anti-reflective AR coating could show signs of stress , but this falls in the category of abuse . Anti-reflective AR coating does cost an additional $20 to $90 depending on the lens it is coating , but there are significant benefits to anti-reflective AR coating . Whether it is right for you - if it is worth the extra cost - is your decision . Your glasses will work fine without AR coating , but the relaxation to your eyes and improved vision may be worth it . <h> Crizal No Glare AR Coating <p> Crizal is the best known anti-reflective ( AR ) coating on the market , and also the best and the most expensive . Before you choose Crizal , think carefully about whether you even need or want anti-reflective coating on your glasses . Anti-reflective AR coating is chosen by 28.5% of eyewear shoppers in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons that could contribute to this gap , but the primary reason is probably the bad history that anti-reflective AR coating had in its early years . In the 80 's and 90 's , anti-reflective AR coatings had a single layer which would craze , scratch or smudge easily . Today 's AR coatings includes a harder layer of scratch resistant coating , in addition to oleophobic ( anti-oil ) , hydrophobic ( anti-liquid ) , and anti-static layers . These extra layers help to repel the things that lead to smudging and scratching . They also help to make the lenses easier to clean and thereby reduce surface scratches from excessive cleaning . <h> Premium AR Coatings <p> Eyeglasses.com offers three basic types of coatings . On our least expensive lenses and within a restricted prescription range , anti-reflective AR coatings are an extra $20 . This is possible because the lenses are coated in a mass production of tens of thousands of lenses . On other lenses that are custom made , we offer a $59 anti-reflective AR coating which is an excellent coating . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR coatings offered by Essilor . <p> Anti-reflective AR coatings always work better when they are made by the same maker as the lens itself . For example , Zeiss AR coatingworks best on Zeiss lenses , Pentax AR coating works best on Pentax lenses , and Crizal AR coatings work best on Essilor and Varilux lenses . The reason for this is that the manufacturers each have their own formula for the underlying lens . That formula bonds best to an anti-reflective AR coating that is of the same chemical family . Premium anti-reflective AR coatings are actually bonded to the lens surface , becoming one with the lens . <h> Benefits of Anti-reflective AR coating <p> Anti-reflective AR coating allows 8% more light to enter the eye . That 8% of light was bouncing off the outside of the lens , causing other people to see a shiny spot on your glasses and preventing them from seeing your eyes . Also , when a light source is overhead or behind you ( as is often the case ) , light reflects off the inside of your lens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When there is more available light to your eye , you can see better and more clearly . The result is a clearer , sharper vision and reduced eyestrain , which would benefit everyone . However in some situations , the benefits are more noticeable : <h> Workplace <p> - Fluorescent lighting , computer screens , cash registers etc. all cause an increase of reflections in the workplace . This increase in reflections causes eye straing , headaches , fatigue and a decrease in work productivity . <h> Night Driving <p> - External reflections are a major problem when it comes to driving safely at night . The reflections from oncoming headlights , streetlamps , and the road can cause distractions and discomfort to the driver . Internal reflections can cause ghost images and result in a decrease in reaction time . <h> Sunglasses <p> - Anti-reflective AR coating on the back side of sunglass lenses eliminate some problems .

Eyeglass lenses all have a definite " index " , which ranges from 1.56 to 1.74 . For strong prescription , the higher the index , the thinner the lens ; for weak prescriptions , a low index lens will be no thicker than high index eyeglass lenses . As a result , if you are looking for the " thinnest eyeglass lenses " for your prescription , read more so you do not pay extra money for lenses that are not thinner . <p> Most people are looking for the thinnest eyeglass lenses , but " thinnest eyeglass lenses " differs from prescription to prescription . If your prescription is under +/-3.00 sphere , a 1.56 index CR-39 lens is the best index for you , because a higher index lens will be more expensive and not thinner . In this article we talk about the thinnest eyeglass lenses for your prescription , but this is a very general discussion . There are a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each prescription making it unique . We have found an excellent tool online to find out exactly how much thinner a lens and high index choice will be for your exact prescription : <h> Lens Materials <h> Plastic Lenses - 1.56 Index <p> Most lenses are plastic ( glass is still available , but heavier and more expensive ) , but the least expensive plastic used for eyeglass lenses is called CR39 hard resin lenses . Hard resin lenses are good for everyday use . These lenses have the least distortion of any non-glass lens . For children or active adults engaged in sporting activities , we strongly recommend polycarbonate ( impact resistant ) lenses . <p> If the sphere on your prescription is higher than +/-3.00 , you will benefit from the selection of a high index lens type . If the sphere on your prescription is higher than +/-4.00 , we recommend a thin lens type . Thinner lenses have three advantages : they do not look thick , they do not magnify or minify your eyes when seen by others , and they are lighter . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best choice for children , active adults , and sporting activities . Polycarbonate lenses are virtually shatterproof , provide the best eye protection of any lens , and includes 100% UV protection inherently .

Polycarbonate lenses are very difficult lenses to tint and are not recommended for people who want custom dark sunglass lenses ( we suggest Trivex lenses in this case ) . The suggested prescription range for polycarbonate lenses is plano ( 0 , no Rx ) to +/-6.00 sphere . <h> Trivex High Index Lenses <p> Trivex is a relatively new plastic lens material that is being used as a substitute for polycarbonate lenses . Trivex is optically superior to polycarbonate and it is lighter . Like polycarbonate it provides 100% UV protection and it is extremely durable .

Trivex is much better suited for tinting and is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range is Plano ( 0 , no Rx ) to +/-8.00 sphere . Trivex may be slightly thicker than polycarbonate lenses , but due to its specific gravity the weight will be similar . <h> High Index Lenses - 1.60 High Index <p> High index lenses with 1.60 high index are good for people with prescriptions over +/-4.00 sphere , because they are thinner and lighter . Thinner lenses have three advantages : they do not look thick , they do not magnify or minify your eyes when seen by others , and they are lighter . The suggested prescription range is +/-4.00 to +/-8.00 sphere . Thinner , lighter and more expensive than mid-high index or hard resin lenses , high index lenses are a good choice for every day use . <h> High Index Lenses - 1.67 High Index <p> High index lenses with 1.67 high index are good for people with prescriptions over +/-6.00 sphere , because they are thinner and lighter .

If your prescription is lower than +/-6.00 sphere , there is no need for you to spend the extra money for an ultra high index lens .

@@97944470 @2144470/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Progressive Lenses <p> Progressive lenses were first introduced in the 1990 's as a new lens product that offers multifocal vision " without the line " . Lens companies realized that aging customers did not like other people seeing the visible bifocal line for cosmetic purposes . So the progressive " no-line " lens was invented , and marketed well under such names as Varilux Lens , Varilux Comfort , Varilux Definity , and Varilux Physio . This was great news for the eyewear industry because this lens was much more expensive than single vision or bifocal lenses , which meant more money for the companies selling them . <p> Optometrists regularly " prescribe " progressive lenses to people , using their influence with patients as a trusted doctor to prescribe healthy aids . However , progressive lenses do not provide any physiological benefit to patients - only cosmetic benefits - but they do provide much more money to optometrists. ? Outside of the cosmetic benefits , progressive lenses offer the convenience of having distance and reading vision in one lens like a bifocal . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-range and a continuous viewing area in the middle of the lens . On the negative side , progressive lenses have large areas in the patient 's visual field that can not be seen through , thus causing blind spots , and this can lead to headaches and nausea during the adaptation period ( it takes time for a person to adapt his body and lifestyle to these types of lenses ) . Also , to use a progressive lens , the patient must learn not to move the eyes from side to side , but to move the head from side to side . At Eyeglasses.com , we urge patients to choose the right lens for their needs , desires , and pocketbook . In most cases , patients are more than capable of learning about eyeglasses , and making their own informed choices , along with advice from the eye doctor . <h> How Progressive Lenses Work <p> If you need vision correction for both distance and reading , then can use two pairs of glasses , and alternate depending on what you need to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or progressive lenses ( called multifocal lenses ) . Many people find it convenient not to be required to remove their glasses and switch to another pair in order to read something . Multifocal lenses divide the lens so that part of the lens is for reading and part of the lens is for distance vision . Bifocal ( two areas ) and trifocal ( three areas ) lenses have visible lines that separate the different areas of the lens . <h> Progressive Lenses <p> Progressive lenses , which are sometimes called no-line bifocals , are actually trifocal lenses without the visible lines . Progressive lenses were developed because many people wanted the convenience of not having to change their glasses to read , but they did not like other people to see the visible line.Also , with progressive lenses there is a continuous transition from one viewing distance to the next , so there is no large jump from near to far as there is in bifocal lenses . <h> Progressive Lens Design <p> Progressive lenses offer the convenience of multifocals , but without the visible line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adapt to than bifocal or trifocal prescription glasses , and they are much more expensive . In order to create a no-line progressive lens , there are two large areas of the lens that you can not see through . Imagine what an hourglass looks like . This is the shape of the area of the progressive lens that you can see through . Objects seen through the areas of the lens to the left and right of the narrow middle section are highly distorted and you can not see through them . The bulge areas at the bottom and top of the lens are for near and distance vision , and the thinner corridor connecting them is for intermediate distances . On either side of the narrow portion of the hourglass objects will appear blurry . In general , more expensive progressive lenses like Varilux lens have a wider corridor , and less expensive lenses have a narrower corridor that can restrict the viewing area considerably . On smaller lens sizes , it is necessary to slice off a portion of the bottom ( reading section ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . As a result , the smaller the frame size , the smaller will be the reading portion of the lens . <h> Adapting To Progressive Lenses <p> In order to use a progressive lens , you must learn to move your head to see things ; you can not just move your eyes because you will be looking through a blurry part of the lens . This is called adapting to the lens . Most people can adapt within a month , but some people never adapt . It is common to experience dizziness and headaches during the time that you are adapting . Getting accustomed to progressive prescription glasses can be difficult , and you must have proper instruction by an eyecare professional . <p> Sometimes , people who try progressive prescription lenses for the first time have a difficult time learning to look through the appropriate portion of the lens at the right time . Often a simple fitting adjustment to your prescription eyewear by your local optical professional can make all the difference . <h> Fitting Progressive Lenses <p> To fit progressive lenses ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first be fit and adjusted to your face . At this point , an optical professional measures the segment height of your lenses . He makes two dots on the lens , one at the bottom edge of your pupil , and the other at the intersection of the lower eyelid and your eye . The measurement in millimeters from the bottom of the lens up to each dot is the segment height . To make any multifocal lens , we must have an accurate segment height measurement . If you send us a pair of glasses with multifocal lenses in them , we can read the lens and determine the seg height and make a perfect copy ( re-lensing your glasses ) . But that segment height is specific to each pair of eyeglass frames and can not be used for a different pair of frames . <p> You can ask your local optical professional to measure the seg height for a pair of eyeglasses , and then send them to us with the markings on them .

Our MFS is a system that estimates how to mount the lens so that it will work for you . As a result , our MFS is not as accurate a fitting system as you would receive from a local optical professional . For some people , our MFS is not a good service , but you can still buy eyeglass frames at Eyeglasses.com and have the lenses installed by a local optical store . The MFS is a system that estimates your seg height . You have a conversation with our optical professional who will ask you questions about your experience with multifocals , the frame model you want to use , how you intend using the lens , and so forth . In the end , we are able to make a lens that works for about 85% of our clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , we have a 100% return policy on the frames and the lenses . To begin this process , you must first have your prescription and pupillary distance " PD " measurement . Our optician will need this information in order to design the right lens for you . <h> Choosing An Eyeglass Frame For Progressive Lenses <p> There is only one major restriction on the kind of frame that will accommodate progressive lenses . The eyeglass frame needs to have a height of 30mm or more . Height is referred to as the B measurement of the frame , and is the inside measurement from the bottom to the top of the lens aperture in the frame . If you have fallen in love with a frame that has a B measurement of 27mm to 29mm , there are some new short corridor lens choices that may work for you . Contact Eyeglasses.com customer service for more information . <h> Your Prescription <p> We strongly recommend that you fax your prescription to us . We can read your prescription and then help find the best prescription eye glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , we require that you fax your prescription to us . <h> About Your Prescription <p> Prescriptions have a certain format that is always followed . The first line of your prescription is always for the right eye , sometimes designated the OD . The second line is for the left eye , sometimes designated OS . The prescription for each eye is divided into Sphere , Cylinder , and Axis values . It is common to have no values for any one of these , in which case you might see the letters PL or plano , or to have values for all of these . Sometimes the prescription may say OU which means both eyes . <h> Multifocal Prescription <p> If your prescription is for bifocals or trifocals of progressive lenses , there may be additional information on the prescription that says for example Add +2.50 . This is important information if you are ordering reading or multifocal lenses . The numbers are expressed in diopters that tells the power of the lens . A diopter is a value that is metric and universal worldwide . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see information designated as add power . Your add power is simply the magnification that is added to your sphere value for distance vision , in order to create a field of view for reading . For example , if your sphere value for distance viewing is 3.00 , and your add power is +2.00 , then your near vision correction is 1.00 . Or , if your sphere value for distance viewing is +1.00 and your add power is +2.00 , then your near vision correction is +3.00. 
@@97944471 @2144471/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Prescription Sunglasses <p> You can design your own custom prescription sunglasses in the same way that you make your own prescription glasses . Shop for a frame , add a lens with your prescription , and then pick the lens tint and coatings that are best for your needs and lifestyle . Prescription sunglasses are a great way to see in the sunshine . <h> Prescription Sunglasses Frames <p> Before reading this page about prescription sunglasses , it would be a good idea to learn more about building prescription glasses . Begin making prescription sunglasses by selecting a pair of eyeglass frames or sunglass frames that can hold a prescription . Lower quality sunglass frames are not designed to hold a prescription lens , and are called non-RXable . RXable sunglasses are sunglass frames that can accept a prescription lens . Sunglasses frames with an excessive wrap design can only accommodate prescription lenses up to a power of approximately +/-5.00 sphere . You can not put a prescription is sunglasses with a shield design . Some sunglass manufacturers have facilities to maker prescription lenses for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . Follow this link to learn more about the features of all glasses frames . <h> Prescription Sunglasses Lenses <p> Prescription sunglasses can be made with single vision , bifocal , or progressive lenses , and in a variety of lens materials and colors . Most prescription sunglasses use the high index polycarbonate lens material , and for high performance prescription sunglasses lenses , we recommend using the Trivex lenses material . For more information , follow these links to learn about eye glasses lenses , how to buy eyewear , Lens Wizard , eyeglasses online , lens quality , and how to try on prescription sunglasses . If you have sunglasses and just want new lenses for them , follow this link to read about replacement lenses . <h> Lens Tinting <p> Once you have selected a frame , then choose a lens type ( hard resin , polycarbonate , high index , polarized , or sun-sensitive ) . Hard resin and high index lenses can be tinted easily to any color and tint density you choose . You can not choose the tints for polarized and sun-sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polycarbonate lenses can not easily be tinted . If you want the durability of polycarbonate lenses in your prescription sunglasses , the lens material to choose is called Trivex . It has the same durability as polycarbonate , but it can be tinted to your desire . <h> Lens Colors <p> Brown and gray are the most popular colors for sunglass lenses . Brown is the best color overall because it allows the wearer the widest light spectrum through to the eye , while blocking blue light and offering optimum contrast . Brown is great for applications where distances need to be constantly judged , like tennis or golf or skiing or other sports requiring acute visual perception and contrast differentiation . Brown is also best for lower light situations , like fishing in the late afternoon or early morning . Grey tint is best for bright light situations like water sports because it blocks out the brightest of the suns rays . Other colors like green and blue are used more for fashion purposes than for utility . Blue is the overall worst color of all for the wearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you like blue as a fashion choice , consider a custom-made lens tinted brown but with a blue flash mirror coating . Yellow is used to heighten contrast without blocking too much light , and it is commonly used for shooting and skiing on cloudy days . Boll makes a special green tint that is designed specifically for tennis ( the Competivision lens ) the green tint helps to accentuate the yellow color of the tennis balls and make the white lines stand out . <h> Lens Tint Density <p> Prescription sunglass lenses are tinted by leaving them in a bath of tint solution . The longer they are left in the solution , the darker the tint becomes . Lenses bathed in tint colors can assume just about any color shade or color density . The lens actually absorbs the tint color into the lens material . Tint density is defined as a percentage , where 0% is completely clear , and 100% permits no light to pass through ( solid ) . A 10% to 20% tint is used for a fashion tint , and a 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . For sun protection , you would use a 50% tint for all around use , both during midday and during morning and evening hours when there is less available light . A 50% tint is a better all-around lens . For bright light situations , like midday sun on the water , an 80% tint provides maximum protection from the bright sun . <h> Lens Options <h> Gradient Tints <p> A gradient tinted lens has a full tint at the top , fading gradually to no tint at all at the bottom of the lens . A double gradient tint is a lens with a full tint at the top and bottom of the lens , and a medium tint in the center of the lens . Double gradient tints are popular with skiers , because the lens blocks glare coming from above ( sun ) and below ( snow ) , while allowing for a clearer viewing area in the middle . <h> Mirror Coatings <p> Prescription sunglasses lenses can receive a coating on the outside that has looks to others like a mirror . It reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this coating is that it serves to reduce the amount of reflected light or glare that makes it harder to see expecially in bright light conditions . For example , when skiing on a sunny day , there is a lot of reflected light and glare coming off the snow . It is important to know that the wearer does not see the mirror coating from the inside , but only sees the lens tint . For example , if the lenses had a brown tint with a blue mirror , the wearer would see only brown , and other people would see only the blue mirror . This is a useful combination because , optically speaking , blue is the worst tint for seeing objects clearly ( brown is best ) , but blue is fashionable ; so the wearer gets the benefit of seeing through a brown tint as well as the benefit of having other people see only the blue mirror coating . Mirror coatings are a good alternative to polarized lenses , and can be used together with polarized lenses for added protection in extreme conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darkening the lens and reducing the amount of information your eye receives , which could make it difficult to see is situations where visual acuity is needed ( like flying an airplane ) . <h> Pure Mirror And Flash Mirror <p> Mirror coatings are available in two ways , as a flash mirror and as a pure mirror . With a pure mirror , other people will not be able to see your eyes ; with a flash mirror lens , other people will be able to see your eyes . The pure mirror is a more intense mirror and the flash mirror is less intense . In both types of mirrors , the wearer does not see the flash color , the color is only seen by other people . For example , if the lenses had a brown tint with a blue flash mirror , the wearer would see only brown , and other people would see only the blue flash mirror . This is a useful combination because , optically speaking , blue is the worst tint for seeing objects clearly ( brown is best ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of seeing through a brown tint as well as the benefit of having other people see only the blue flash coating . <h> Sun-Sensitive Lenses <p> Sun-sensitive lenses are also know by the brand name Transitions , and the technical name photochromic . Sun-sensitive lenses automatically darken to a moderate shade when they are exposed to the ultra-violet rays of direct sunlight . When the direct sunlight is removed , the lenses lighten again . Sun-sensitive lenses are typically only available in brown and grey . Sun-sensitive lenses are available in the normal range of vision correction for prescription sunglasses . A photochromic lens has some limitations . First , the lens needs ultra-violet light to darken , and it will darken more slowly or incompletely if the lens is not in direct sunlight . For example , if you are wearing a hat , or if it is cloudy , or if you are inside an automobile , the lenses may darken slowly or not completely . Second , it could take up to eight minutes for lenses to transition from dark back to clear . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be darkor clearwhen you want them to be . Third , photochromic lenses do not become completely clear indoors , but retain a light tint that may not appeal to people who want completely clear lenses indoors . <h> Trivex Sun Lenses <p> Trivex is a great substitute for polycarbonate lenses in prescription sunglasses , because Trivex can be easily tinted but polycarbonate can not . Trivex is much better suited for tinting and is an excellent choice for rimless drill mounted frames . The suggested prescription range is Plano ( 0 , no Rx ) to +/-8.00 sphere . While Trivex has a slightly lower refractive index than polycarbonate lenses , its specific gravity makes it the lightest of any lens material available today . This means the lens may be a little thicker than polycarbonate lenses but similar in weight . Like polycarbonate lenses , Trivex also has inherent 100% UV protection . However it is optically superior to polycarbonate lenses , meaning it is much less distortive . <h> Polarized Lenses <p> Polarized lenses are tinted lenses that block vertical light from hitting your eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , golfers , and drivers are the most common users of polarized lenses . Any surface can create glare in sunlight , including water , sand , snow , windows , vehicles , and buildings . Polarized lenses ease eye stress and fatigue in the sun , and lenses are available in several color and density options . However , in some situations , glare can be beneficial . For example , polarized lenses could make it difficult for a driver to see ice on the road , or for a skier to see ice on the ski slope , or for a seaplane pilot to see the water when landing . Polarized lenses function similar to window blinds with horizontal slats when open . You view the slats on the edge so they are very thin , and these edges hold the tint color . Polarized lenses block the vertical light that tries to enter your eye from down below or up above , and it only allow the horizontal light to pass through the lens . Polarized lenses are available in the normal range of vision correction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AR coating goes on the backside ( side closest to your face ) of prescription sunglasses and non-prescription sunglasses . Backside AR prevents light and glare from coming in to either side and from behind you , bouncing off the inside of the lens and into your eye . This kind of glare is very common in sunny situations , it is extremely disruptive and it is very valuable to eliminate this glare from your vision . <h> Clip on Sunglasses <p> Clip-on sunglass lenses are tinted lenses that clip on to regular prescription glasses , effectively turning them into prescription sunglasses . The clip-ons usually match the eyeglasses frame in shape and color , and attach either by clips or with magnets . Regular clip-ons require two hands to add and remove the clips , but magnetic clip-ons ( they hold to the frame with magnets instead of clips ) can be added or removed with just one hand . Clip-ons have advantages and disadvantages . It is convenient to be able to convert your eyeglasses into sunglasses and back again . However , wearing a clip on means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the clip , reflects off the front of the frame , reflects off the back of the clip , and bounces around in there , causing significant additional glare and eyestrain that does not occur with prescription sunglasses . There are also sunglasses that are designed to fit over your eyeglasses , covering them completely . Fit-overs are useful for eyeglasses that do not have matching clip-ons , and they also serve to block out light from entering around the sides of your glasses . Side-glare is extremely annoying , especially on the water , so fit-overs may be a better solution that sunglass clip-ons.

@@97944560 @2144560/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Eyeglass Frame Parts <p> Eyeglass frames have several components and the names of the different frame parts are useful to learn . Eyeglass frames have two basic parts : the frame front that holds the lenses , and the temples that hold the frame from falling off your face . <h> The Front <p> The frame front is composed of two eyepieces connected by the bridge . The eyepieces hold the lenses and connect to the temples by hinges , and the bridge is the part over your nose . Usually , there is just one piece of material connecting the two eyepieces , called a single bridge construction . Some , especially larger , frames have a double-bridge for extra support , with two pieces of material connecting the two eyepieces . <h> Eyepieces <p> The eyepieces on a full-frame completely encircle the lens . On metal frames , the eyepiece is held together with a screw that is removed when the lenses are installed , and then replaced . On plastic eyeglasses frames , the eyepiece is heated until it expands , the lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snugly around the lens . On half-rimless frames , the lens in held in place by a nylon cord called the eyewire that attaches to the frame in two places . The rim of a pair of eyeglasses is the part of the eyeglasses frames eyepiece that holds the lens in place . The rim can completely encircle a lens in the case of full frames , or partially hold the frame in the case of semi-rimless frames , or there can be no rim at all in the case of rimless frames . <h> Endpieces <p> On the outer edge of each eyepiece some material extends out beyond the shape of the lens . This is called the endpiece , and connected to it is the hinge which holds the temples to the frame front . Endpieces can be designed larger so that a larger person can wear a somewhat smaller lens without the frame pinching the sides of the head . <h> Nosepads <p> Many eyeglasses frames , most commonly metal frames , have nosepads attached to the inside of the bridge . Nosepads are normally made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable resting of the frame on the wearers nose . Nosepads can be adjusted to accommodate an individuals nasal structure , as well as the proper positioning of the lenses in front of the wearers nose . Nosepads are attached to pad arms , which are welded to the frame front . Nosepad arms are made of a malleable metal so that they can be adjusted ( bent ) during a fitting . This metal is then welded on to the frame front which could be made of titanium , monel , stainless , or other materials . Occasionally these weld points weaken and the pad arms break off the frame there . Nosepads are attached either by a screw ( screw-in nosepads ) , or they are push-in nosepads which require no screw . Most nosepads are designed this way so that the nosepads can be replaced when they wear out . Pad arms are always made out of malleable metal so they can be adjusted , even on titanium or aluminum frames .

The most common is the skull temple , with the long straight shaft that is bent with a 45 degree angle at the top of the ear near the end of the temple which is called the temple tip . The shaft is the straight part that extends from the connection point at the eyeglasses frame front to the bend in the temple . Library temples are straight all-shaft temples with no bend in them .

Franklin was alo credited with the invention of the bifocal itself , which began as an executive style , and then become more popular in the flat top 28 style that we mostly see today . The executive bifocal is a very easy lens to use , because both the reading and distance vision areas are large and easy to find .

@@97944585 @2144585/ 9041 @qwx869041 <h> Eyeglass Frame Material <p> Eyeglass frames are made out of many different composite materials and formulas , but the basic groupings are metal and plastic . In plastics , zyl is the most common although lower quality plastics are used in the cheaper frames . Nylon is often used in sport sunglasses due to its impact resistance and flexibility . Among the metals , monel is most common , followed by titanium , stainless steel , nickel silver , alpaca , and aluminum . <h> Zyl <p> Zyl is a short name for the material cellulose acetate , which is made of wood flakes , cottonseed fibers , stabilizers and plasticizers . Zyl is the most common plastic frame material because it can assume a large array of colors , textures and patterns . Temples and frame fronts can be cut from blocks of zyl extruded as a sheet of block acetate . Or , granular zyl can be liquefied and then injection molded . Block-cut zyl is stronger and more stable , while injection molded zyl is less stable and less expensive . With daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its form . Sometimes metal cores are added in the temples in order to strengthen and stabilize the frame . If zyl eye glasses frames reach a temperature over 160 degrees Fahrenheit , the plasticizers could rise to the surface of the frame , turning areas of the frame a milky white color . In addition , body oils , perspiration , ultraviolet radiation and cosmetics can also damage the material . <p> The best quality designer eye glasses frames are made with Italian Mazzuccheli zyl . Mazzuccheli now has factories in Italy and China , with the best quality and newest design materials coming from the Italian plants . All Mazzuccheli zyl is made in sheets , which are then cut in the eyewear factories . <h> Monel <p> Monel is composed of about two-thirds nickel and one-third copper . This highly ductile alloy can be hammered into a variety of different shapes without losing strength . It resists stress well is often use to stabilize frame bridges and endpieces . Monel colors well , is corrosion resistant , and durable . If you have an allergy to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that causes allergic reactions . <h> Titanium <p> Titanium is extremely lightweight and will not rust , making it a very popular and relatively new material for eye glasses frames . Titanium 's strength allows it to be made thin , but it is hard to solder or weld and is expensive . Titanium is a more expensive metal composite used in eye glasses frames known for its beneficial qualities of strength , lightness , and flexibility . However , titanium is very difficult to color so titanium frames usually come in a very restricted range of eyeglasses frames colors . <p> Eyeglass frames that are 100% titanium are also a hypo-allergenic--they do not contain any nickel which causes allergic reactions in some people . There are many other allergies ( to plastics , stainless , and various other materials commonly used to make eyewear ) , and 100% titanium eye glasses frames are a good choice for people with allergies to any of these materials . Many designer eye glasses frames brands use titanium in some part of their collection . <h> Stainless Steel <p> Stainless steel is comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manganese , and chromium . Stainless steel is highly lustrous , and makes a good thin and sturdy eye glasses frames with strong corrosion resistance . Although it is hard to make eye glasses frames with stainless steel due to soldering and welding difficulties , stainless steel temples are especially springy . <h> Nylon <p> Nylon is virtually unbreakable , so it is often chosen for sports and safety applications . Nylon is lightweight and flexible , but can only accept opaque colors . <h> Nickel Silver , Alpaca , German Silver <p> Sometimes called " Alpaca " or " German Silver " , nickel silver is rigid compared to other more malleable metals . Nickel silvers contain more than 50% copper , 25% nickel , and the rest zinc ( no silver at all ) . Copper adds pliability , zinc adds strength , and nickel gives it its namesake color , a whitish appearance , because when the nickel content exceeds 12% the copper color no longer shows through . Although the metal is lustrous , its brittleness makes it a poor choice for slender frame fronts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in hinges , endpieces , bridges and ornamental trims , as well as an inner core for temples . <h> Aluminum <p> Aluminum is cut from a block , is lightweight and low in density . This makes the material strong , and yet light enough to use for thick fashion designs . Aluminum can accept a variety of colors , and chemical anodizing is sometimes used to create black , brown and gold colors . Because aluminum can not be easily welded or soldered , endpieces , hinges , and nose pads must be fastened with rivets or screws , increasing the chance that those pieces fall out causing the frame to fail . This greatly limits the design possibilities . Aluminum is also very stiff , which limits its versatility . <p> However , the lightness and stiffness of aluminum in some eye glasses designs offers great advantages . For example , for metal frames that are thicker in design , and larger in design , aluminum is the toughest material and can accommodate the thickest and heaviest lenses .

Flexible eyeglass frames are available in many compositions , but the goal is always the same . This kind of material is used in eyeglass frames in order to reduce breakage . It is normally found in the shaft of the temple and in the bridge , and it allows these areas to endure tremendous twisting without breakage or permanent distortion of the frames shape . <h> Hypo-Allergenic <p> Some people have an allergic reaction to certain metals , especially nickel and certain plastics , which are common component materials used to make eyewear .

These were first sold by him under the " Ronsir " model name and they featured interchangeable bridges , eyewires , and " brows . " This made it possible for wearers to completely customize the size , fit , and also the color of their glasses . Back then , most eyeglass manufacturers only offered a very limited number of colors and sizes to choose from . This made Browlines a completely unique way for the eyeglass wearer to customize their own personal appearance . This new style of eyeglasses became highly popular almost immediately among eyeglass wearers and as a result of this , many other eyeglass manufacturers began to produce their own version of the browlines and during the decade of the 1960s there were six manufacturers that controlled the browline market . These companies were Shuron , Art-Craft Optical , Victory Optical , American Optical , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray-Ban Browline . Each of these six companies tried to make their frames unique with the addition of a plaque on the upper corners of their frames . These plaques also served to cover the rivets that attach the temples to the frame . The popularity of Browlines remained strong through the decade of the 1960s , but this popularity faded when advancements in plastics manufacturing made it possible for eyeglass manufacturers to even further customize their eyeglasses by making them with solid plastic frames , allowing them to be made into a bigger variety of shapes , sizes , and colors . In the late 1960s , the rise of the hippie subculture led to a drastic decline in the popularity of Browlines but in the late 1970s and early 1980s the anti-disco movement made the Browlines popular again . In the mid-1980s a pair of Shuron Ronsirs worn by Bruce Willis on the popular series Moonlighting and today only two companies still manufacture Browlines , Shuron , and Victory Optical .

This adds approximately 2-3 days to the processing time . Applying thin-film coatings to plastic requires laying an extremely fragile coating on a soft , porous , and temperature-sensitive substrate . for maximum quality anti-reflective coatings , the coater needs to know the lens substrate , lens manufacturer brand , and type of scratch coating . identifying the lens material enables coaters to formulate their AR process to the substrate ? s index and chemical composition . identifying the brand identifies which scratch coating is on the lens . the resins used in a particular lens can also affect the adhesion of AR coatings. lenses with resin that are more stable and less heat sensitive can better accept AR coatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years in the same prescription .

Then , learn more about prescription glasses lens features , options , and services . After that , you will be able to select from the menu of prescription eye glasses lens options the characteristics that will most support your lifestyle . When you are ready , proceed to the Lens Wizard . <h> Lens Types <h> Single Vision Lenses <p> Your eyes may need vision correction only for distance , only for reading , or for both . If you need correction only for distance vision , then you only need single vision lenses in your prescription eye glasses . With single vision lenses , you can look through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you need vision correction only for reading and you do not have astigmatism , then you can buy non-prescription glasses for reading . If you do have astigmatism , you need prescription reading glasses . In either case , these are still considered single vision lenses . <h> Multifocal Lenses <p> If you need vision correction for both distance and reading , then you can use two pairs of prescription eye glasses , and alternate depending on what you need to see . Or , you can choose multifocal lenses ( bifocal lenses , trifocal lenses , or progressive lenses ) . Many people find it inconvenient to switch to another pair in order to read something . <p> Multifocal lenses divide the lens so that part of the lens is for reading and part of the lens is for distance vision . Bifocal ( two areas ) and trifocal ( three areas ) lenses have visible lines that separate the different areas of the lens . <h> Progressive Lenses <h> Advantages <p> Progressive lenses , which are sometimes called no-line bifocals , are actually trifocal lenses without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because many people wanted the convenience of not having to change their prescription eyeglasses to read , but they did not like other people to see the visible line . Progressive lenses do have another benefit however , which is that you feel a smooth transition when you move your eyes from distance objects to close up objects . With a lined bifocal , the transition between viewing areas can be somewhat uncomfortable . <h> Disadvantages <p> So progressive lenses offer the convenience of multifocals without the visible line . However , progressive lenses are much harder to use and to adapt to than bifocal or trifocal prescription eyeglasses , and they are much more expensive . In order to create a no-line progressive lens , there are two large areas of the lens that you can not see through . Imagine what an hourglass looks like . This is the shape of the area of the progressive lens that you can see through . Objects seen through the areas of the lens to the left and right of the narrow middle section will be distorted and you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom and top of the lens are for near and distance vision , and the thinner corridor connecting them is for intermediate distances . On either side of the narrow portion of the hourglass objects will appear distorted . In general , more expensive progressive lenses like Varilux have a wider corridor , and less expensive lenses have a narrower corridor that can restrict the viewing area considerably . <p> On smaller lens sizes , it is necessary to slice off a portion of the bottom ( reading section ) of the lens in order to install the lens in the frame . As a result , the smaller the frame size , the smaller will be the reading portion of the lens . Follow this link to learn more about the features of eyeglass frames , and some of the restrictions regarding progressive lenses . <p> In order to use a progressive prescription glasses , you must learn to move your head to see things ; you can not just move your eyes because you will be looking through a blurry part of the lens . This is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , but some people never adapt . It is common to experience dizziness and headaches during the time that you are adapting . Getting accustomed to progressive prescription glasses can be difficult , and you must have proper instruction by an eyecare professional . <p> Sometimes , people who try progressive prescription glasses for the first time have a difficult time learning to look through the appropriate portion of the lens at the right time . Often a simple fitting adjustment to your prescription eyewear by your local optical professional can make all the difference . <h> Prescription Reading Glasses <p> If you need vision correction only for reading and you do not have astigmatism , then you can buy non-prescription reading glasses . If you do have astigmatism , you need prescription reading glasses . In either case , these are still considered single vision lenses . <h> Non-Prescription Reading Glasses <p> Non-prescription reading glasses simply magnify objects that are close to us , like the letters in a book . Your eye doctor can determine the magnification power that is best for you , or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A doctors prescription is not required in order to select a reading lens . Drugstore reading glasses are simply eyeglasses frames with magnifying lenses pre-loaded in a range of powers with stock lens powers . It is usually less expensive to purchase reading eyeglasses this way , but stock lens powers rarely provide a optimal vision correction . For best results , reading lenses with magnification customized to your needs can be installed in any pair of eyeglasses frames . <h> Prescription Eyewear Lens Types <p> Once you have determined the best lens type for your lifestyle , preferences , and budget , you can then choose the lens material . There are three basic types of lens material for prescription eye glasses--hard resin plastic , polycarbonate plastic , and high index plastic . <p> If your prescription is lower than +/-4.00 , then hard resin is the best choice for you . If it is above +/-4.00 , then high index plastic is best for you . If you are a child or an active adult and need some eye protection , then polycarbonate is best for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polycarbonate lenses are virtually shatterproof , and are highly recommended for children and active adults . By active we refer to any activity that includes a possibility of receiving a blow to the face . For example , policemen , firemen , tennis and ball players , aggressive sporting activities - just to name a few . Wearing polycarbonate lenses may not save your eye , but they will certainly help , and a little added protection cant hurt ! In general , if the sphere on your prescription is at +/-2.00 or lower , you will not benefit from the more expensive thin high index lens types . Hard resin or polycarbonate lenses will be just fine for you . If the sphere on your prescription is higher than +/-2.00 , you will benefit from the selection of a thin lens type . Thinner lenses have three advantages : they do not look thick , they do not magnify or minify your eyes when seen by others , and they are lighter . <p> In general , the thinner and lighter the lens , the more expensive it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , and aspheric is the most common thin lens design . Polycarbonate lenses can be purchased as aspheric , giving you the advantage of polycarbonates strength together with aspherics thinness . The thinness of high index lenses is characterized by the index of refraction ( IR ) . Mid-high index lenses are commonly around a 1.56 , high index lenses are around 1.60 , and ultra-high index lenses are 1.66 and above . All rimless eyeglasses must use polycarbonate , Trivex , or high index lenses to avoid cracking . After you have selected the best prescription glasses lens material for your personal situation , you can choose among other lens features and options , like sun-sensitive , scratch coating , anti-reflective coating , and UV protection ( UV protection is always inherent in high index and polycarbonate lenses ) . If you want sunglasses , additional options could include tint , polarization , and mirror coatings . Additional lens services would include a mounting fee ( applies only for rimless frames ) , and rolling and polishing ( applies only to higher power lenses being mounted in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens options , follow this link to eye glasses lenses . <h> How Thin Are The Thin Lenses ? How Thick Are The Thick Ones ? <p> The plastic used for lenses in prescription eyewear must have at least a 2.0 mm center thickness according to US law . The thickness at the lens edge depends on the strength of your prescription , your pupillary distance , the eye size of the frame , and the lens material . Because of all of these factors , it is nearly impossible to select a lens by its thinness . In general , the thinner and lighter the lens , the more expensive it will be . To make the optimal thickness/price choice for your personal situation , use the chart above as a guideline . You can choose to spend less money and have a thicker lens , or more money to have a thinner lens . Also , within the mid-high index , high index , and ultra-high index categories you can also choose an aspheric design for additional thinness . <h> New Lenses <h> Adapting to Lenses <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new glasses , whether you get your new glasses from Eyeglasses.com or any other optical store . The adaptation period could be very quick , or it could take a month , depending on you , your glasses , and your prescription . There are some ways to make the process easier , and to solve problems more quickly . <p> If your prescription is lower than +/-4.00 , then hard resin is the best choice for you . If it is above +/-4.00 , then high index plastic is best for you . If you are a child or an active adult and need some eye protection , then polycarbonate is best for you . <h> Common Adaptation Problems And Solutions <p> It is very common to experience a feeling of disorientation while you adjust to your new glasses .

It is also possible that your eye doctor gave you the wrong prescription ( sometimes they do make mistakes ! ) 5 .

Even on the few frames that do feature the lettering , it is so exquisitely done that it actually adds an extra classy element to the overall design . <p> Sperry eyeglasses jump out of a seafaring tradition begun by Paul Sperry in 1895 . Sperrys career began as a seaman first class in the U.S. Navy during World War I. After the war , he loved his cutter " Sirocco " , but almost lost his life due to slippery footwear . From that moment , he began a lifelong quest to solve that problem . Inspired by the alacrity with which his dog jumped around slippery rocks , he designed a shoe sole with carved grooves , giving birth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generations after Paul Sperry , culminating in the Sperry Top Sider eyeglasses collection .

Although women 's eyeglasses tend to have softer lines and more feminine colors than men 's eyewear , most frames are unisex and can be worn by either women or men . With a range of prices , frame shapes , and materials along with a variety of color combinations for both eyewear frames and lenses , Eyeglasses.com makes it easy to buy multiple ladies eyeglasses to suit different occasions such as work , school , or leisure . Depending upon the frame , our female customers find that they can often order two pairs of womens prescription eyeglasses at far less cost than they would pay for one pair of womens spectacles at a regular retail eyeglass store . There is no reason today why women 's prescription eyeglasses styles not only can be trendy , but also sophisticated . If you are looking for a retro or modern , bold or conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women nowadays are looking for shapes and colors that either complement or contradict their features . A " complementary " frame fits in well with the facial structure , as well as the coloring of hair , skin , eyes , and wardrobe . A " contradictory " strategy is one in which the eyeglasses are designed to stand out , to exude confidence , creativity , and to project individuality . There is no right or wrong strategy , and many women have several eyeglasses frames so that they have choice when arranging the daily assemblage . <h> Designer Eyeglasses for Women <p> We offer over 400 top design brand names of eyeglasses frames . Almost every major designer has created their own collection , and in most cases , their eyewear collection coincides with the design goals and philosophy of the brand .

There are so many different styles of designer frames that women never need fear to run into someone wearing the same thing . <p> Plastic frames ( actually zyl , which is a very high grade of plastic specifically designed for eyewear ) are an open palette for frame designers which allows them to combine thousands of colors into exciting and unique patterns . Whether the frame is a solid plastic that has infinite variations , or layers of plastic in different colors , the plastic frame is like painting with oil on a canvas .

Because you do not need a prescription for reading glasses , you can buy reading lenses and reading glasses online and in many stores . You can buy reading glasses for as little as a few dollars , but the quality of the low-cost reading glasses is quite low . Follow this link to see our entire collection of reading glasses online . <h> Stock Versus Custom <p> The least expensive way to buy reading glasses online is to buy stock reading glasses . These are reading glasses that sit on a rack in many different stores , and you can choose a pair off the rack with your reading power . It is easy to lose reading glasses , so many people have several pairs stashed around the home , car , and office so you will always have a pair around when you need one . Some people prefer folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small package and are easy to carry.The problem with stock reading eyeglasses may not work well for your eyes . <p> To get the most effective reading eyeglasses for your eyes , we recommend that you visit an eye doctor to get a prescription for reading . Ask your eye doctor how well served you will be with stock reading eyeglasses , or whether it is better for you to invest in custom reading lenses . Here are some common problems that can occur with stock reading eyeglasses : <p> 1 . Stock reading glasses are made in a one-size-fits-all way . The optical centers of stock reading glasses may be too wide or too narrow for your face . If you do n't  look through the center of the lens , you may not see clearly and/or you may get headaches or dizziness .

This too could lead to not seeing clearly , headaches , and/or nausea . <p> 3 . Stock reading glasses , especially the $20 variety found in drugstores and superstores , use low quality plastic lenses that may not be formed properly . The plastic could have blurriness and/or bubbles which impairs your vision . Follow this link to read more about lens quality . <p> 4 . Reading glasses are designed for a reading focal length , about 12 " to 18 " . Many people buy reading glasses to read the computer screen , which is normally 24 " to 36 " away from your face . This will make it more difficult to see the screen , and can cause you to change your posture in your chair leading to neck strain , back strain , and eye strain . <h> Custom Reading Glasses <p> Custom reading glasses are just eyeglass frames with custom lenses . Typically this option will be more expensive than buying stock reading glasses , but the quality of the glasses will be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle . To put together custom reading glasses , you need to select a frame and then install lenses . <p> One thing you can not do is to buy reading glasses at a drugstore and then install custom lenses . The reason is that the frames are not ophthalmic quality - they are too low quality to accept a custom lens . However , if you have some ophthalmic quality eyeglasses , it is easy to bring them back to life by installing new custom lenses . Follow this link to read about how to get replacement lenses . <h> Types of Reading Glasses <p> Reading glasses are simply magnifying lenses that make objects larger . But there are several different ways to accomplish this goal , so you can choose from a number of different types of reading glasses depending on your lifestyle and needs . <h> Full-Eye And Half-Eye <p> There are many different types of reading glasses , but the first most important choice is whether you want a full frame or a half-eye . Full frame reading glasses look like regular eyeglasses , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lenses sit directly in front of your eyes . Full-eye reading glasses are good when you spend a long time concentrating on material close-up . When you look up from reading , objects in the distance appear blurry . <h> Half-Eye <p> Half-eye reading glasses are flat on the top of the frame , and are designed to sit down on your nose so that you look down through the lens when reading .

Titanium is an amazing material that is significantly lighter and stronger than other metals . Also , titanium is hypo-allergenic , and quite flexible . These qualities make it ideal for use in eyeglass frames . Titanium frames do have some drawbacks , however . For example , it is impossible to adjust titanium , so manufacturers combine other alloys into the frames so they can be adjusted . Also , titanium becomes brittle at cold temperatures , so they are not well suited for cold climates , or for leaving out in the cold as they could break more easily than other eyeglass frame materials . <p> Oakley makes some great titanium frames , and we prefer the semi-rimless styles .

A full glasses frame has a rim that completely encircles the lens . In a half-rimless glasses frame there is no rim on the bottom or top of the lens . Most half-rimless frame styles have the frame on the top of the lens , but some half frames have the rim on the bottom .
