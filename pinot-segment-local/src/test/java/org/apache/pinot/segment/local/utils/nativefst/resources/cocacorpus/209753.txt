These wonderfully enriching activities provide family time , healthy exercise , play , education , social networking , nature experiences , and lots of fun . <p> Our gatherings are very casual .

@@74678567 @3378567/ <p> Here are the facts . In Los Angeles County , approximately ten million waste tires are generated annually . Waste tires that are illegally dumped or improperly stored can pose a serious threat to public health and safety , as well as to the environment . The result can be urban blight and significant costs to residents . Waste tires can serve as a nesting area for pests and a breeding ground for mosquitos which can spread encephalitis and other illnesses . Waste tires can also catch fire and release toxic smoke . <p> To eliminate these problems and help the environment , waste tires need to be recycled . But in the absence of adequate markets for waste tires , they have been disposed in landfills or dumped in your neighborhood or community . The County is continually looking for new and innovative methods to productively use waste tires , eliminate their illegal dumping , conserve natural resources , and preserve landfill capacity . The objective of the County is to implement a variety of programs and strategies to address these issues . <p> The County has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct waste tire collection events , and construct demonstration projects featuring practical uses for recycled tires . The waste tire events are rotated to different County areas for residents to drop off tires for free .

Collected tires are recycled and could be used for construction of amenities that benefit the community as shown in these recycled rubber demonstration projects . <p> The County has partnered with CalRecycle to promote the use of scrap tires in roadway rehabilitation projects . Scrap tires could be used to make rubberized asphalt concrete and slurry for use on road maintenance and resurfacing projects . It has many advantages and benefits over regular asphalt concrete .

" The business leaders are looking for modern , easy-to-use applications that can be quickly deployed to solve a specific problem or respond to a market opportunity . The IT organization is typically working toward a strategic goal of standardizing on a limited set of comprehensive application suites in order to minimize integration issues , maximize security and reduce IT costs . These competing goals often lead to strategic misalignment . " <p> In the Gartner Special Report , " Accelerating Innovation by Adopting a Pace-Layered Application Strategy , " LONG ...

Similar to the concepts in building architecture , Gartner has defined three application categories , or " layers , " to distinguish application types and help organizations develop more appropriate strategies for each : <p> Systems of Record Established packaged applications or legacy homegrown systems that support core transaction processing and manage the organization 's critical master data .

" The same application may be classified differently in one company than in another , based on its usage and relationship to the business model . We expect to see applications move among layers as they mature , or as the business process shifts from experimental to well-established to industry standard . " <p> Gartner analysts said that one of the keys to developing this strategy is listening carefully to the way business people describe their vision for particular parts of the business . These categories of ideas include : <p> Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow commonly accepted ways of doing things that change fairly slowly . <p> Different ideas aspects of the business in which leaders not only want to do things differently from comparable organizations , but also can specify the details of how the different approach should be taken , and can expect these details to change on a regular basis . <p> New ideas aspects of the business in which leaders are thinking of an early stage concept , and are not at the point where they can be specific regarding the details of how things should work . <p> Organizations must establish a new strategy for business applications that responds to the desire of the business to use technology to establish sustainable differentiation and drive innovative new processes , while providing a secure and cost-effective environment to support core business processes . <p> One of the keys to using pace layering is to take a more granular approach to thinking about applications . She said that organizations are accustomed to using common , three-letter acronym application categories ( such as ERP and CRM ) but , when classifying applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual processes or functions . <p> For example , financial accounting , order entry and collaborative demand planning are often part of a single ERP package , but are separate application modules that belong in three different layers in the Pace-Layered Application Strategy . This approach should also be used to classify individually packaged or custom-developed applications . It is important to determine whether they support a common requirement , a unique business methodology or an innovative new business process . This allows the organization to apply the appropriate governance , funding and data models , based on the characteristics of each application . <p> " As organizations look to pace layers to help their application portfolios evolve from the rigid nature of current monolithic application strategy , it will be important to establish process and data integrity requirements within and between each , " Mr. Gaughan said . " The pace-layered approach acknowledges that process and data integrity requirements will be different within each layer , and defines a set of architectural standards at each level to accelerate an organization 's ability to adapt . " <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong governance structure must unite all stakeholders , " Ms. Genovese said . " The challenge for IT management teams is to develop a culture of governance that encourages consistent and persistent participation . This means that governance can not be about IT telling the business stakeholders what needs to be funded rather ; there must be a true partnership that includes respect .

The Census stimulated the discipline of marine science by tackling these issues globally , and engaging some 2,700 scientists from around the globe , who participated in 540 expeditions and countless hours of land-based research . The scientific results were reported on October 4 , 2010 at the Royal Institution in London . <p> The first Census of Marine Life produced the most comprehensive inventory of known marine life ever compiled and cataloged it as a basis for future research30 million records as of January 2011 and counting !

They found and formally described more than1 , 200 new marine species , with another 5,000 or more in the pipeline awaiting formal description . They discovered areas in the ocean where animals congregate , from white shark cafTs in the open ocean to an evening rush hour in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to a shoal of fish the size of Manhattan off the coast of New Jersey , USA . They unearthed a rare biosphere in the microbial world , where scarce species lie in wait to become dominant if change goes their way , and found species believed to reside at both poles . While unlocking many secrets , investigators also documented long-term and widespread declines in marine life as well as resilience of the ocean in areas where recovery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of giant mats of microbes , ranked among Earths largest masses of life , a Jurassic shrimp ( Neoglyphea neocaledonica ) thought to have been extinct 50 million years ago , and multi-cellular animals ( three species of the animal phylum Loricifera ) thriving without oxygen at sea bottom , where only microbes were thought to survive , were but a few of the astonishing discoveries over the decadal study . <p> Along with surprises came extremes . Census scientists , for example , uncovered the deepest , hottest , most northerly and most southerly hydrothermal " black smoker " vents known to science , found the worlds largest biotic ecosystem created by a single type of organism , and traveled along as a sooty shearwater chased endless summer on its 64,000-kilometer ( 40,000-mile ) pole-to-pole journey . Scientists also reported the existence of everything from a giant squid to 38,000 different kinds of bacteria in a liter of seawater .

These new vision-expanding tools included genetic barcoding techniques that automate and speed identification of species , helping to compensate for a shortage of marine taxonomists , tagging and tracking methodologies that provide an insiders view of this watery world , and acoustic innovations , providing abundance assessments of marine populations heretofore not possible . While advancing technology , scientists also set to work on standardizing sampling protocols making it possible to compare " apples to oranges " across the global ocean , revealing a clearer picture of what lives below the oceans surface . These tools and strategies pave the way for the next generation of ocean explorers . <p> In addition to extensive contributions ( more than 2,600 papers ) to the scientific literature , the Census has created major legacies that range from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System ( OBIS ) database , the worlds largest open access , online repository of spatially referenced marine life data that will continue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange , to 13 National and Regional Implementation Committees that cross geographic , cultural , and political boundaries to orchestrate studies of the worlds ocean .

It has partnered with many to advance what is known and knowable about marine life . These partners include the Encyclopedia of Life , the World Register of Marine Species , and the Marine Barcode of Life , and Catalogue of Life projects . The Census also has served as a model for the Ocean Tracking Network . In total , the Census has laid a solid foundation for directing future collaborative marine biodiversity research , serving as a model for how huge scientific undertakings can be structured for success , and has provided needed science to help guide policy for a changing ocean . <p> Such advances would not have been made without the vision for a " Census of Marine Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provided initial funding for the international infrastructure that allowed for , and encouraged , scientific collaboration among peers and served to help leverage the US$650 million ultimately dedicated to this 10-year effort .

Late that day , I received a phone message that the parts had not arrived , but I was assured they would be there on Wednesday , December 28 .

I was told the correct part would arrive on Friday , December 30 . I received a phone call on Friday night and was informed that there was additional damage to my vehicle that had been discovered when the mechanic attempted to complete a wheel alignment . The night supervisor told me that my insurance would be contacted on Saturday , December 31 , I would receive a phone call update on Saturday , the parts would be ordered on Tuesday , January 3 , and my vehicle would be completed by Wednesday , January 4 .

Much of this change is being driven by the digitization of companies revenue and their services . <p> The Nexus of Forces is leading this transformation . The Nexus is the convergence and mutual reinforcement of social , mobile , cloud and information patterns that drive new business scenarios . Gartner analysts examined the impact of the Nexus of Forces during the opening keynote today at Gartner Symposium/ITxpo , which is taking place here through Thursday . <p> Organizations are digitizing segments of business , such as moving marketing spend from analog to digital , or digitizing the research and development budget . Secondly , organizations are digitizing how they service their clients , in order to drive higher client retention . Thirdly , they are turning digitization into new revenue streams .

" The Chief Digital Officer plays in the place where the enterprise meets the customer , where the revenue is generated and the mission accomplished . They 're in charge of the digital business strategy . That 's a long way from running back office IT , and its full of opportunity .

IT leaders need to make sure they have policies and procedures in place to respond to the new Nexus-driven threats . They must counter cyberattacks , and anticipate new attacks from new sources at a high scale . They will need to respond to " reputation " warfare and defend against social media " mercenaries " . They will also invest in new technologies that support employee-owned devices such as mobile device management , containerization and virtualization . <p> " Security investments are going to dramatically increase , " Mr. Willis said .

IT leaders need to anticipate and plan for the coming wave of government interventions and regulations . As information technology becomes pervasive in all operations , regulations from the analog world will come to the digital world . <p> CEOs want their CIOs to make their impact felt where the enterprise meets the outside world . They want the CIO to unleash the forces that will differentiate their business . They do n't  want the CIO spending all of their time automating the back office . <p> " The value CEOs seek is in digitizing the interface between your enterprise and its customer or citizen , creating whole new business opportunities in the process , " Mr. Willis said .

When asked to innovate , engage , or solve a problem , Gartner recommends turning the challenge into a game . However , looking beyond internal gamification , IT leaders need a laser focus on their customers . <p> " If you can not explain how every project in your discretionary budget affects the end customer or citizen , do n't  do it , " Mr. Willis said .

Without proper lubrication , the combustion engine becomes little more than an expensive boat anchor . <p> Engines are made up of hundreds of moving parts that have to slide and spin against each other , and without a reliable supply of clean oil , those parts will grind to a halt before you get to the end of the block . In addition to its primary function of reducing friction between moving parts , engine oil also acts as an additional coolant to help take some of the combustion heat away from the cylinders . <p> To properly do its job , oil has to flow freely through dozens of passages in the engine . The larger passages are cast into the cylinder block and heads , while many smaller ones are drilled into crankshafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bearings and other metal parts , tiny metal particles eventually contaminate the oil over time . A mix of unburned fuel and exhaust gases can also slip past the piston rings , mixing with the oil and diluting it . <p> If oil is n't changed according the vehicles maintenance schedule , it will get thicker and turn into a sludge that cant do the intended job .

If this happens for an extended period , it can cause very expensive damage . <p> Until about the mid-1990s , it was generally recommended that drivers get their oil and filter changed every three months or 3,000 miles .

Ford stated it recommends oils that meet Ford Material Engineering Specification WSS-M2C171-F1 , in lieu of CK-4 . <p> Starting December 1 , 2016 , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) began licensing two new diesel motor categories CK-4 and FA-4 .
