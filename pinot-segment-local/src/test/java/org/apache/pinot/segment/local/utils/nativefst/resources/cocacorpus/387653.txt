Rumor had it that the plague was brought to Seville by a man from Cdiz who was lodging in a house near the Tower of Gold ( Torre del Oro ) , next to the river ( see the frontispiece map of Seville , with place-names mentioned in the text ) . Within two days of the mans arrival , everyone in the house where he was lodging was dead . As the contagion spread inside the city , local authorities did what they could to contain it . Plague victims were quarantined in hospitals outside the city walls , and their contaminated clothes and possessions were destroyed in bonfires . The bodies of the dead were carted to mass graves on the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purify the air . Sevillians diligently applied these pragmatic secular measuresmedios humanos ( " human methods " ) , as they were known at the timeaccording to Diego Ortiz de Ziga ( 16331680 ) . But they placed more trust in medios divinos ( " divine methods " ) , the Sevillian chronicler explains , electing " to beg for clemency and placate divine justice . " <p> The medios divinos that Sevillians employed during the plague of 1649 included " prayers , rogations , acts of penitence , " and " processions of light and blood " with penitents carrying candles and flagellants whipping themselves . At the height of the plague , on June 26 , 1649 , Sevilles secular and religious authorities led a joint procession around the steps of the cathedral with a sacred sculpture , the Virgin of the Kings ( Nuestra Seora de los Reyes ) ( fig. 1 ) . After the procession , there was palpable relief from the plague , Ortiz de Ziga reports . Then , on July 2 , the Cristo de San Agustfna fourteenth-century sculpture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Augustinian monastery , outside the eastern city walls , to the cathedral , in the city center . A crowd of people followed the life-size Gothic crucifix through the streets " with sorrowful cries , " Ortiz de Ziga writes , in " a display of the greatest emotion and spiritual remorse . " After spending the night at the cathedral , the image of Christ was returned to the monastery of San Agustfn the following day . From that point forward , the plague was in retreat . By the end of the month , the plague hospitals had been closed , and the elite citizens who had fled to the countryside had returned back home . When it was all over , approximately sixty thousand peoplehalf of Sevilles populationhad died . The Cristo de San Agustfn was credited with ending the worst epidemic in the citys history , thus confirming the sculptures reputation and affirming the efficacy of the medios divinos . <p> Early modern Europeans , Catholics and Protestants alike , routinely interpreted natural disasters as divine punishment and promoted religious action as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague struck his bishopric of Bologna in 1575 ; the parliamentarian and diarist Sir John Oglander interpreted the rains , floods , and harvest failure that struck England in 1647 as divine punishment for the civil war . Six years after the plague of 1649 , the Andalusian lawyer Francisco Salado GarcTs published a book in which he promoted medios humanos for combating the disease but argued that divine methods should always be tried first , since " plague and contagion come to the world because of the sins of men , and they are the reason for it . " Prayers and processions were emergency measures to be undertaken in moments of crisis , but it would be infinitely better to avoid divine punishment in the first place . A city had recourse to different kinds of medios divinos in order to cultivate divine favor . Reforming immoral behavior was perhaps the most difficult . More feasible projects included building or decorating a church , promoting a local saint for beatification or canonization , and founding a new charitable institution . Such communal displays of devotion and good works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sevillians made a massive investment in long-term medios divinos in the troubled decades of the seventeenth century . Sculptors carved a fleet of new processional sculptures that painters brought to life with realistic flesh tones , while embroiderers and goldsmiths crafted opulent gowns and crowns for venerable old images like the Virgin of the Kings . Seville was turned into an open-air church for religious feast days and special celebrations when triumphal arches were erected in the streets and plazas , precious reliquaries and liturgical vessels were brought outdoors and displayed on temporary altars , and building facades were covered beneath rich fabrics , tapestries , and paintings ( fig. 2 ) . Sevilles most privileged citizens served the poor and needy at new charity hospitals that were attached to opulent churches . Between the 1660s and 1720s some thirty-two religious buildingsparish churches , monasteries and convents , and other sacred structureswere built , rebuilt , or renovated beyond recognition , and an even greater number of altarpieces and chapels were added to existing structures . Monumental paintings and gilded altarpieces adorned the walls of old and new churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( yeserfa ) . Imposing new church facades rose over the busiest streets and plazas in the city , while colorful tiled domes and bell towers redefined the skyline . The investment in medios divinos in the seventeenth century had a profound impact on the physical landscape and ritual practices of Seville and continues to define the city and its self-image to the present day . <p> With the proliferation of new religious buildings and the renovation of old ones , Seville became a giant construction site in the late seventeenth century . The Baroque aesthetic that was transforming cities all across Spain at this time left an especially strong imprint on urban development in Seville , where it found unique expression . The profusion of ornament , the mixture of medias , and the theatrical panache that are all characteristic of the Baroque interacted with Sevilles multilayered history , autochthonous building materials , and religious traditions to create a distinctive local variant of the style . The richness and splendor so typical of the arts in this era were a natural fit for the city that served as Europes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption at the height of Spains transatlantic trade in the sixteenth century , Sevillians would channel the secular splendor to which they had become accustomed into devotional art and architecture when their fortunes began to fade . <p> Nestled in a crook of the Guadalquivir River fifty-four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean , Seville had a long history as an international port and commercial center that dated back to its founding by the Romans . During the citys Islamic era ( 7121248 ) , such exotic goods were available that it was said , " If thou seekest for birds milk , by Allah thou shalt find it in Seville . " International trade continued to thrive in Seville after the Christian conquest of the city in 1248 . The Guadalquivir bustled with ships traveling to Seville from Christian and Muslim landsfrom Alexandria , Aragon , Catalonia , Ceuta , England , France , Genoa , Tangier , " and from many other places beyond the seas , " according to the late thirteenth-century General History of Spain . In the last decade of the fifteenth century , Seville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to finance Columbuss maiden voyage across the Atlantic in 1492 . The monarchs Isabella I and Ferdinand II ( r. 14741516 ) rewarded Seville with a monopoly over Spains new colonial trade . All ships going to and from the Americas had to stop first in Seville , where the House of Trade ( Casa de Contrataci=n ) was established in 1503 . <p> Lope de Vega called Seville the " port and gateway to the Indies , through which it could be said that the universal sustenance of Spain enters twice a year . " The playwright was referring to the biannual sailings of the merchant ships in fleets ( flotas ) , one that left Seville in August for Tierra Firme ( Panama ) and stopped in Cartagena and La Havana before returning in May or June , and another that sailed to New Spain ( Mexico ) in April and came back in July . The late sixteenth-century View of Seville attributed to the court painter Alonso Snchez Coello depicts the activity in the area known as the Arenal , the sandy stretch of riverbank between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , and the thirteenth-century watchtower , the Tower of Gold , on the right ( fig. 3 ) . A pulley machine next to the tower was used to unload the boats and galleys that transported goods to the Arenal from the large galleons that survived the treacherous transatlantic crossing . In 1574 the Sevillian doctor Nicols Monardes described the " incredible wealth " that came to Seville from the New World : gemstones , exotic animals and hides , valuable dyes , cotton , copper , sugar , gold , and silvermost of all silver17,637 tons of which passed through Seville between 1503 and 1660 before flooding the European markets . Sevillians exchanged their own native produce and imports from the Indies with European cities such as Antwerp and Florence in return for tapestries , books , silks , gold thread , paintings , and other fine goods . The precious raw materials and luxury products that arrived at the Arenal were loaded onto ox-drawn carts and driven into the city . <p> New World treasure transformed Seville from a well-to-do regional capital into one of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world . Merchants from all over Spain and Europemost of all Flanders and Italyflocked to Seville , and so did foreign artists and craftsmen , who were attracted by the opportunities that could be found there . Seville became a major center for the Atlantic slave trade , especially after the Spanish annexation of Portugal in 1580 , and had the largest population of slaves in Spain . The total population of Seville doubled between 1500 and 1588 to reach an estimated 150,000 , which made it one of the most populous cities in Europe at that time . Significantly smaller , Rome in 1580 had a population around 80,000 , and Madrids was about 65,000 at the end of the sixteenth century . Sevilles population boom gave rise to a building boom in domestic and public architecture . Between 1561 and 1588 an estimated 2,456 new houses were built to accommodate the burgeoning populations of Seville and Triana , the neighborhood across the river where many shipbuilders and sailors lived . <p> During the sixteenth century medieval Seville became a modern city with urban planning ideas , building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumental building projects of the sixteenth century were primarily secular in nature and used a classicizing vocabulary to communicate Sevilles newfound imperial status : a new town hall , a public park ( the Alameda de HTrcules ) , and the monolithic Lonja , which was built next door to the cathedral to house the Casa de Contrataci=n . The gates in the ancient city wall were renovated in the form of triumphal arches , like the one that can be seen on the right-hand side of the city view attributed to Snchez Coello ( fig. 3 ) . The gate , called the Postigo del Carb=n after the coal that was sold in its vicinity , was refashioned as a triumphal arch adorned with shields and statues in 1566 . When King Philip II ( r. 155698 ) visited Seville in 1570 , the unrenovated parts of the city along the kings procession route were covered with temporary architecture and tapestries to reflect a unified vision of Seville as a " New Rome . " The city councilmen dressed in floor-length robes of purple velvet in imitation of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most expensive city and the one with the highest standard of living in sixteenth-century Spain . By midcentury , working-class Sevillians owned luxury goods that used to belong exclusively to the upper classes , such as jewelry of precious metals and gemstones , and garments and household textiles made from sumptuous fabricsdamask , velvet , and taffetasometimes even trimmed with gold . Meanwhile , the upper classes acquired luxury goods in greater quantity and variety than ever before . The high demand for luxury goods in Seville supported a wide range of specialized local craft industries . Pearls alone required three different kinds of specialists to sort , pierce , and string them into necklaces . The arts of silversmithing and embroidery reached their apogee in Seville in the sixteenth century . Luxury goods were sold on the cathedral steps ( Las Gradas ) , in the silk market ( Alcaicerfa de la Seda ) , and in the shops on Calle Sierpes . Local historians like Luis de Peraza and Alonso Morgado proudly described Sevillians fine dress , magnificent palaces , quality craftsmanship , and luxury markets as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the treasures they saw average citizens wearing in the streets . Conspicuous consumption came to define Sevilles reputation and self-identity , both at home and abroad , in the sixteenth century . <p> Sevilles wealthy merchants were renowned for their ostentatious displays of luxury goods . Like their counterparts in Renaissance Florence and Venice , the merchants of Sevillea group that included many foreigners and families of Jewish origins ( conversos ) sought to assimilate into the upper echelon of society by building splendid Renaissance palaces and filling them with sumptuous furnishings , artworks , and other precious objects . Social boundaries were fluid in sixteenth-century Spain , most of all in the cosmopolis of Seville , where wealthy newcomers married local noblewomen and positioned their sons among the local nobility by buying titles from the Spanish Crown and purchasing seats on the exclusive cathedral chapter and city council . This made Sevilles wealthy newcomers the legal equals of the old nobility , but they lacked the traditional signs of status in Spanish societythe proverbial " lance and ancient shield on a shelf " inherited from noble ancestors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensated with public displays of their wealth . In 1571 one sympathetic observer warned Sevilles " merchants with an appetite for nobility " to avoid ostentatious displays of property , servants , jewels , and other luxuries , for a merchant who was seen spending a lot would be suspected of cheating his customers . But successful merchants like Gaspar de Arguijo , a Canary Islander who settled in Seville around 1565 , paid no heed to the warning . Having made a fortune in the slave trade , Arguijo amassed an impressive collection of urban and rural properties , including a palace in central Seville that he filled with treasures . His son , the poet Juan de Arguijo , inherited the family fortune in 1594 , when his father died , and spent it all by 1608 , when he lost the family palace to his creditors . <p> The story of Juan de Arguijos bankruptcythe subject of gossip and fascination in his hometownepitomized the citys collective fall from fortune at the turn of the century . Sevilles problems began in the 1580s , when merchant galleons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the commercial fleet was destroyed with the Spanish Armada . Transatlantic crossings of the flotas ground to a halt between 1586 and 1589 . Then the 1590s brought a combination of bad weather , harvest failures , and floods that left Sevilles population weak and susceptible to the plague that arrived in 1599 . The plague was still active when a cathedral prebendary ( racionero ) named Francisco Porras de la Cmara ( d. 1616 ) wrote a gloomy letter in 1600 to Grand Inquisitor Fernando Nio de Guevara , who was about to take office as archbishop of Seville ( r. 16019 ) . Porras warned the incoming archbishop that the situation in Seville was dire : " I regret to inform Your Grace that the calamities suffered by my city and your episcopacy are not only pestilences , sicknesses , shortages , and other needs and miseries , for in every way Seville is among the most lost and hopeless cities in all his majestys kingdom . " God was using the plague to punish Seville for its sins , Porras explained , comparing the disease to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a whip with barbed ends like a scorpions stingers that had been used to torture the early Christian martyrs . " I am very fearful that Gods punishments will not cease if we do not stop offending Him , " Porras wrote . He called upon Nio de Guevara to lead a complete spiritual and cultural reform in Seville in order to regain divine favor . <p> The situation in Seville only worsened over the rest of the century , as natural and man-made disasters barraged the city ( see the chronology at the end of this book ) . Imports of American silver began to diminish after 1592 as the accessible ores at the top of the Cerro Rico ( " rich mountain " ) of Potosf ( Bolivia ) were depleted . Transatlantic traffic declined over the seventeenth century , such that the registered tonnage carried between Spain and its colonies fell by 90 percent . At the same time , the shallow bed of the Guadalquivir was shrinking , its sandbar growing , as the river filled with lost tonnage , sunken ships , and runoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods in its history during the winter of 1626 . Another flood , in March of 1649 , cut the city off from food supplies and set the stage for the deadliest epidemic in the citys history . At midcentury , the population of Seville was already down from a high of 150,000 to 125,000 ; the plague reduced that number by half , leaving Seville about where it had been back in 1492 . <p> When the French diplomat Frantois Bertaut visited Seville in 1659 , ten years after the plague , he was unimpressed by what he saw . " Arriving in Seville , one can not believe that it deserves the great reputation it has acquired , " he wrote . " It is on a large plain on the bank of the Guadalquivir River , which is not very large , and where there is a pontoon bridge that is very ugly . There are no longer ships , because they all go to Cdiz . " Seville had been losing trade to coastal Cdiz for decades before the Crown officially moved Spains transatlantic port there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city on the Guadalquivir . That same year , Seville was struck by an earthquake . More floods and famines followed in the 1690s . In his chronicle entry for the year 1700 , Lorenzo Baptista de Ziga looked back at the era that had just come to a close and described it with apparent exhaustion as " the ill-fated century " ( el siglo fatal ) . <p> Sevilles problems took place within the context of a general seventeenth-century crisis of national , continental , and even global proportions . Spain fell from its position of prominence abroad and was besieged by economic and political crises within its own shrinking borders . Historians have long debated the causes and chronology of Spains decline , and some scholarship has argued that the Spanish economy actually rebounded in the last decades of the seventeenth century . What is indisputable is that there was a profound sense in seventeenth-century Spain that something had gone terribly wrong . The term " decline " ( declinaci=n ) began to appear around 1600 in the writings of political and economic reformers ( arbitristas ) like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out . Gonzlez de Cellorigo claimed that everything in Spain was in declinepopulation and productivity , agriculture and industry , manliness and moralityand he placed much of the blame on New World wealth . In addition to its deleterious effects on the Spanish economy , it was believed that easy money from the Americas was having a pernicious impact on the Spanish character by creating a society of idle men and rapacious women who consumed everything and produced nothing . In 1600 Gonzlez de Cellorigo went so far as to claim that Spain would have been better off altogether without American treasure : " If all the gold and silver that the Spanish have found and continue to discover in the New World were to enter Spain , it would not make the country so rich , so powerful , as it would have been without it . " The sense of disillusionment expressed by Gonzlez de Cellorigo would be exceptionally keen in Seville , as the epicenter of Spains colonial trade and the city that had been changed by New World wealth more than any other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small villages turned to medios divinos in the seventeenth century . On the national level , the Castilian Cortes voted in 1617 to elevate Saint Teresa of -vila to patron of Spain ( alongside the traditional patron , Saint James , or Santiago ) , as a religious solution to the problems that were plaguing the Kingdom of Castile and the Spanish Crown . Locally , communities in the beleaguered diocese of Cuenca , in a bid to win the protection of the saints , built a large number of new rural shrines during a period of declining populations and resources between 1583 and 1654 . Such investments in supernatural solutions to Spains problems were combined with pragmatic measures as part of an overall reform program . Medios divinos and medios humanos were complementary , not contradictory , as Baltasar Gracin explains in The Art of Worldly Wisdom ( 1647 ) : " Human means must be sought as if there were no divine ones , and divine ones as if there were no human ones . " <p> According to Gracins maxim , equal effort should be put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . But Sevilles local authorities were notoriously bad at the medios humanos . Sevillians accused their Crown-appointed royal governor ( asistente ) and city councilmen ( veinticuatros ) of negligence during the flood of 1626 , when the men who were supposed to be guarding the city gates went home to sleep as the rising river waters broke through and flooded the city . In the aftermath of the flood , Sevilles master of public works , AndrTs de Oviedo , proposed an ambitious plan to protect the city from future flooding by cleaning out the riverbed and digging canals . The damaged city walls were repaired , but none of Oviedos long-term solutions was carried out . His proposal to build a permanent replacement for the old pontoon bridge between Seville and Triana was not realized until the iron bridge named for Queen Isabella II was built in 1852 . The Seville city councils previously mentioned decision not to close the city gates in 1649 contributed to the enormous loss of life during the plague , according to Francisco Salado GarcTss account . Local leaders in Cdiz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the epidemica key factor in the rise of Cdiz to take Sevilles place in the second half of the century . <p> Inept in their handling of the medios humanos , Sevilles elites were remarkably conscientious when it came to the medios divinos . They showed great tenacity , spending decades pursuing the canonization of Fernando III and rebuilding the old church of San Salvador , to name two long-term religious projects . They invested enormous sums of money in religious art and architecturesometimes on ephemeral decorations that lasted only a few days or weeks before they were destroyed . These magnificent public displays have been characterized as an authoritarian effort to preserve a conservative regime and divert the masses from their real problems . But another side to the story has received less attention . Large-scale investments in sacred art and architecture ( whether permanent or temporary ) provided employment for local craftsmen and stimulated depressed local industriesnot just in construction but in all of the related crafts that were involved in decorating a sacred building or holding a public procession . In other words , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as medios humanos . <p> In seventeenth-century Italy there was " a growing awareness that magnificence in the form of elaborate public works was good for the economy , especially at times of unemployment , " according to Peter Burke . No less aware than their Italian counterparts , Sevilles elites used their patronage of medios divinos to stimulate the local economy . One example from the archive of the Seville cathedral illustrates this point quite clearly . In 1691 all Seville was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the treasure ships that were traveling across the Atlantic unprotected because the Armada had been diverted to respond to a French attack on Catalonia . The noblemen who governed the guild of Indies merchants , the Comercio de las Indias , met and decided that all they could do to defend the fleet was to ask for Gods help and offer a gift of some sort to enhance the divine cult in return . When the fleet arrived in Seville unscathed , the comercio showed its thanks by commissioning a set of red-velvet hangings trimmed in gold to adorn the massive columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric samples from Granada , Toledo , C=rdoba , Genoa , and elsewhere in Italy , and assessing the quality of their color , weight , and durability , a panel of judges determined that the silk from Seville was superior to them all . The comercio ordered four thousand varas of crimson velvetover two miles of fabricto be manufactured in Seville . This lucrative commission was a bright spot in what was otherwise a bleak period for silk manufacturing in the city . The comercios " opulent gift " made its debut during Holy Week in 1694 and was celebrated in a printed pamphlet . Through this commission , the elite men who governed Sevilles Indies trade performed a devotional act for the benefit of the city and gave a hand to a struggling local industry . In return they won public acclaim for their generosity and piety . <p> Religious patronage was an obligation among the nobility in Habsburg Spain . In seventeenth-century Seville , the most renowned patrons of public sacred art were local noblemen who could trace their origins back to Italy or Flanders and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sevilles transatlantic trade . A New World heir of Corsican descent named Mateo Vzquez de Leca ( 15731649 ) was an early seventeenth-century patron who has been overshadowed by his more famous successors . Vzquez de Leca experienced a dramatic conversion around 1600 , which led him to renounce the decadence of his youth and devote his fortune to pious patronage and devotional consumptionthat is , conspicuous consumption in the sacred sphere . He was a role model for the cathedral canon Justino de Neve ( 16251685 ) and the layman Miguel Maara ( 16271679 ) , the two most influential patrons of the post-plague generation . Through their energetic leadership and lavish investments in medios divinos , these prominent New World heirs overturned the negative reputation that men of their backgrounds had acquired as " a class of useless idle people , " as Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra characterizes them in one of his short stories set in Seville . They were publicly celebrated for their pious patronage , which was detailed in hagiographic biographies published in the later seventeenth century . One of themMiguel Maarawould be promoted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citys leading artists , who benefited socially from these collaborations . The changing status of the artist in seventeenth-century Seville was part of a broader phenomenon taking place in early modern Europe . Sevilles painters , sculptors , and architects were still governed by medieval craft guilds that had been established in the second half of the thirteenth century ( and whose rules remained legally in effect until 1813 ) . The guilds administered entry examinations , organized quality inspections , and strictly prohibited any guildsman from working outside his own medium . The city ordinances , which compiled the various guilds rules and regulations into one volume for the first time in 1527 and were reissued unchanged in 1632 , did not distinguish fine artists from practitioners of the other " manual trades " ( oficios mecnicos ) : in the book the painters ( pintores ) appear between the fishermen ( pescadores ) and the tailors ( sastres ) , each group defined by the tools of their trade , whether paintbrushes , fishing rods , or needles . But by the 1630s select artists in Sevillemost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter Francisco de Zurbarnhad achieved individual fame and were issuing challenges to the constraints of the traditional guild system . The Seville-born painter Diego Velzquez reached the pinnacle of society in 1659 , toward the end of his life , when he was accepted into the exclusive military order of the Knights of Santiago , which restricted membership to noblemen of pure Catholic ancestry and only admitted members after intense scrutiny . Although Velzquez rose to fame through his virtuoso achievements in the secular art of portraiture at the court in Madrid , sacred art was the key to social success in his native Seville . The artists who led Sevilles major public religious projects became household names and bequeathed a legacy of nobility to their heirs . The painter BartolomT Esteban Murillo ( 16171682 ) had a son , Gaspar , who became a canon of the Seville cathedral . Pedro Duque Cornejo , grandson of the renowned sculptor Pedro Roldn ( 16241699 ) , continued the family trade into the eighteenth century and lived like a gentleman , using the honorific " Don " before his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fostered exchange and interaction between artists outside of their guilds and brought artists together socially with their aristocratic patrons . Foremost among them was a short-lived but influential drawing academy that met for the first time in January 1660 . The academy started with twenty-four members under the leadership of two painters , BartolomT Esteban Murillo and Francisco de Herrera the Younger , who served as its first copresidents . It included professional painters , sculptors , and architects , who met for nightly drawing sessions with live male models in a renovated room at the Lonja . They were joined by noblemen like the cathedral official Juan de Loaysa ( 16331709 ) , who dabbled in painting as a hobby , and high-ranking aristocrats like Manuel Luis de Guzmn y Ziga ( 16271692 ) , the Marquis of Villamanrique , who served as the academys official " protector . " Artists and their aristocratic patrons also met on common ground as members of various religious organizations , including the mystical Congregation of the Pomegranate ( Congregaci=n de la Granada ) and the charitable Brotherhood of the Santa Caridad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces of these religious brotherhoods and the drawing academy united artists and their patrons in pursuit of common spiritual and intellectual interests . Two noblemen who belonged to Sevilles inner circle , Diego Ortiz de Ziga and Fernando de la Torre Farfn ( 16091677 ) , eulogized the leading members of the drawing academy in books that include some of the first art-historical writings on seventeenth-century Sevillian artists . <p> Outside of institutional structures , artists reinforced their personal and professional ties between one another and with their patrons in a variety of ways . Sevilles elites served as godparents for their favorite artists newborn children . Miguel Maara , for example , was the godfather of two of Murillos sons , in 1650 and again in 1651 . When Murillo was on his deathbed , in 1682 , he named his patron Justino de Neve as an executor of his will . Artists strengthened their interpersonal bonds with their colleagues by serving as godparents at baptisms , witnesses to contracts , and guarantors for real-estate transactions .

When Pineda witnessed the marriage of another one of ValdTs Leals daughters , Luisa Rafaela , to the sculptor Felipe Martfnez in July of 1672 , he declared of the bride and groom that he " had known them ever since they were born . " From cradle to grave , Sevilles most esteemed artists and their patrons bound themselves together in a tight-knit social circle that fostered a culture of collaboration . <p> Artistic production in Baroque Seville was fundamentally collaborative , as artists from different guilds worked together to create elaborate multimedia ensembles . The intention of this book is to examine these collaborative artworks in their original architectural , urban , and ritual contexts . The illustrations in these pages reflect the rich variety of material objects that made up Sevilles visual culture , including paintings and polychromed wooden sculptures , gilded altarpieces , carved plaster ornaments , marble fountains and columns , tombstones , tiled domes , silverwork , etchings , printed pamphlets and festival books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and require a word of introduction . A seventeenth-century Spanish church typically contained small altarpieces along its side naves and a larger onethe high , or main , altarpiece ( retablo mayor ) at the end of the central nave . Depending on its size , an altarpiece might be several stories tall and typically featured columns framing a central painting or sculpture . The wooden frames were carved and put together by a joiner , called an ensamblador ; a sculptor ( escultor ) would contribute three-dimensional figures of saints and biblical characters . The frame and sculptures would be painted , gilded , and sometimes treated with a technique known as estofado , which involved applying a layer of gilding over paint and scratching into the surface to imitate the appearance of a sumptuous fabric . <p> Luxury textiles and other objects made from precious materials were an essential element of any permanent or ephemeral display of sacred art in seventeenth-century Seville , although they are largely neglected in art-historical scholarship . They were called alhajas , a word derived from Arabic that was used generically at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for secular or ecclesiastical use , including jewelry , clothing , textiles , and furniture . Life-size wooden sculptures of the Virgin were dressed in fashionable gowns and adorned with jewelry and crowns made from precious metals and gemstones . Altars were covered with embroidered silks and set with silver and gold liturgical vessels . Paintings were hung on church walls in ornate carved and gilded frames . On special occasions , paintings were taken outdoors and hung from building facades on strips of velvet or cloth of gold . Wherever sacred paintings and sculptures were displayed , alhajas enhanced their value and prestige . Very few textiles from this period survive , but written sources often describe them in enough detail to reconstruct their appearance and the contributions that they made to the adornment of sacred spaces . <p> The five chapters in this book examine some of the most important and influential collaborative projects of sacred art in seventeenth-century Seville , with a focus on the dynamic period of the 1660s and 1670s . The purview of this book excludes Diego Velzquez , who left Seville for Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who worked primarily for private monastic foundations before he too left for the court in the 1650s . Each of the following chapters emphasizes the social function of sacred art in a particular historical moment . The first chapter explores how one wealthy New World heir , Mateo Vzquez de Leca , reinvented himself as a pious public patron in the first half of the seventeenth century . The next three chapters examine Justino de Neve and Miguel Maaras collaborations with the leaders of the Seville art academy on permanent and ephemeral projects : the opulent renovation of the parish church Santa Marfa la Blanca in the early 1660s , the festival at the Seville cathedral celebrating the beatification of San Fernando in 1671 , and the church and hospital of the Santa Caridad that were built in the 1670s . The final chapter examines the construction of San Salvador , one of several important old churches that were demolished and rebuilt in the later seventeenth century . The rebuilding of San Salvador suggests the important practical and symbolic roles that the construction of sacred structures played in Seville during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seville were thoroughly sacralized by Baroque interventions large and small , like the iron cross that was installed on Calle Sierpes in 1692 ( fig. 4 ) . The city itself became an outdoor stage set for daily acts of devotion and extraordinary celebrations that came to define life and civic identity in the seventeenth century . When he visited Seville in 1672 , the French cartographer Albert Jouvin de Rochefort marveled at the public demonstrations of piety and unity he saw in the city : " I could not help but admire the beautiful custom and laudable devotion of the Spanish , who all stop working and going about town at the same time when the cathedral bell rings the call to prayer . Even horsemen and coaches out in a hurry come to a halt , everyone kneeling in place to say the Ave Mariasuch that at this moment you do not hear in the city a single sound , as if it were the middle of the night . " The Sevillian author Alonso Martfn Braones ( 16441695 ) describes how " all qualities of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsies , and guttersnipes ( gente del Rastro ) would spontaneously flood the streets to sing the rosary . Sevilles sacred landscape , religious campaigns , and public devotions all contributed to the impression of unity in what was actually a very divided city . Incidents of iconoclasm in the 1690s , when unidentified perpetrators reportedly insulted and defaced street images of the Virgin , suggest that not everyone was on board with the program ( or that the authorities feared this was the case ) . <p> Generally speaking , religious art , architecture , and festivals fostered civic unity and identity in seventeenth-century Seville . But more precisely , public sacred artworks operated within particular neighborhoods to shape the identities of the elites who , for the most part , commissioned them . This book examines the social function of sacred art in several different neighborhoods , each with its own distinctive history , character , and role within the city . The topographical map of Seville ( fig. 5 ) commissioned in 1771 by royal governor Pablo de Olavide provides a detailed view of the city as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries . Each of the following chapters focuses on a different part of the map , from the narrow streets of the former Jewish quarter ( juderfa ) to the sandy riverfront of the Arenal , to the commercial zone around the Plaza de San Salvador . As visitors have been doing for half a millennium , we begin in the city center at the great Gothic cathedral that is the heart of sacred Seville .

" The cultures in question were those of the scientific community and the literary intelligentsia , and Snows lecture analyzed the polarization of intellectual life due to the estrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argued , more than just incomprehension , there existed mutual hostility and suspicion : " Thirty years ago the cultures had long ceased to speak to each other , but they at least managed a frozen smile across the gulf . Now the politeness has gone and they just make faces . " <p> Snows lecture remains perhaps the best-known expression of what one commentator has referred to as his " technocratic liberalism , " an optimistic embrace of the idea of a meritocratic and technologically advanced society that he set in opposition to the " Luddite " tendencies of the artistic and literary community of the 1950s . It was the culmination of a larger debate in postwar Britain about the place of scientific inquiry , and , in the wake of the 1951 Festival of Britain , it drew on a wider process of introspection about the future of British society . Snows diagnosis focused on the specialization in education that occurred too early , and his consequent remedy was to broaden the educational curriculum . While he overstated the differences , his argument was to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of reference in debates in this area . Indeed , the call for a dialogue between the arts and humanities and the sciences has become a recurring theme ; national and international research councils and funding bodies frequently and actively encourage projects that cross the boundaries between the two . <p> A response to the immediate historical circumstances of postwar Britain , Snows lecture was also rooted in a longer debate over the relation between the social and natural sciences in Germany before the First World War . Occupying the attention of major thinkers of the time , including Max Weber , the debate concerned the status of historical and social knowledge . If empirical historical findings could not be generalized into normative statements comparable to the laws " discovered " by the natural sciences , how could the humanities defend their scholarly status ? Famously , Webers response to this question was to assert the distinctiveness of inquiry in the humanities . They did not need to mimic the natural sciences in order to attain legitimacy . " There is no absolutely objective scientific analysis of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " empirical science of concrete reality " and its aim is the " understanding of the characteristic uniqueness of the reality in which we move . " This purported difference was summarized by Webers contemporary , the philosopher Wilhelm Windelband , as the distinction between the " nomothetic " concerns of the natural sciences and " idiographic " approach of the humanities . <p> Both thinkers acknowledged that this difference was not absolute . Windelband noted that " one and the same object can be the subject of nomothetic as well as ideographic inquiry . " A language might be studied in terms of its grammatical , morphological , and syntactical structures and rules , but at the same time , " each language is a unique , temporary phenomenon in the life of human speech . " Likewise , Max Weber highlighted the use of the " ideal type " as a heuristic procedure in sociology . The ideal type , a " synthesis of a great many diffuse , discrete , more or less present and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena . . . arranged . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for the identification of historical and social patterns against which individual cases can be contrasted . Despite such concessions , both men sought to mark out the distinctiveness and legitimacy of a domain of inquiry the objects of which could not be defined in terms of conformity to " objective " lawlike behavior . Linked to this , too , was the claim that the natural sciences are concerned with the objective , third-person explanation of observed phenomena , in contrast to the central role of understanding in the humanities , where actions and events are seen as the product of human agency and subjective intentions . <p> Knowledge of the details of the dispute among German scholars of the early twentieth century is now of limited resonance except to specialists , but it laid down the outlines of a debate that has continued to the present . Definitions of science still revolve around notions of the role of " covering laws , " as the philosopher Carl Hempel termed them . To quote Hempel , " Scientific explanations , predictions , and post-dictions all have the same logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred from certain other facts by means of specified general laws . " It is often assumed , Hempel suggested , that the historical and natural sciences are distinguished on this very point , that the former deal with singularities that can not be accommodated within a framework of generalized rules . <p> Hempel formulated this distinction in terms of the opposition between the nomological and the idiographic . Rather than thereby dismiss history as lacking the objectivity of the natural sciences , Hempel tried to argue that it , too , operates in a similar manner . " Historical explanation , too , aims at showing that the event in question was not a matter of chance but was to be expected in view of certain antecedent or simultaneous conditions . The expectation referred to is not prophecy or divination , but rational scientific anticipation which rests on the assumption of general laws . " Hempels formulation now belongs to the history of the philosophy of science , but the basic framework was taken up by scholars in the humanities . <p> Michael Baxandall , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historians employ " soft " generalizations , Baxandall emphasized that art history is nevertheless a primarily idiographic enterprise . This is not only because " our interest as historians or critics is . . . towards locating and understanding the peculiarities of particulars , " but also , he argued , because of the distinct focus of art historians . Historians study actions and events that may or may not be subsumable under covering laws , but art historians are concerned with artworks as the deposits of those actions . The historian may be concerned with works of art and other historical artifacts , but " his attention and explanatory duty are primarily to the actions they document , not to the documents themselves . " In contrast , the art historian is concerned with the document itselfa work of arteven though it is the result of an intentional behavior . <p> Given the debated status of unanalyzed notions of intentionality , agency , and authorship , one may wish to be more cautious than Baxandall , but he has nevertheless captured something important that distinguishes art history both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others and from what might be seen as the nomological dimension of historical inquiry . To take one of Baxandalls examples , we may be able to explain certain aspects of Piero della Francescas Flagellation of Christ by reference to " antecedent or simultaneous conditions " such as patterns of church patronage , iconographical traditions , theological doctrine , and the like . But this only manages to identify the painting as an instance of a certain type , rather than capturing something about the specificity of this image in contrast to all the other versions of the flagellation . <p> This issue lies at the center of many of the attempts to overcome the division between the arts and the sciences , and it will be discussed again in this study . But before going further into methodological reflection , it is useful to consider more recent attempts to implement Snows call for an integration of knowledge . Perhaps the most high-profile instance can be seen in the growing calls for " consilience . " Its leading advocate has been the biologist Edward O. Wilson , who has attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent approach to the production of knowledge . Envisioning himself as heir to such philosophes as Condorcet , Voltaire , and Diderot , Wilson sees consilience as picking up the tradition of Enlightenment thought that was interrupted by the French Revolution and the rise of romantic irrationalism . <p> Many of Wilsons arguments have a pertinence and force that is difficult to deny . He claims , for example , that one of the reasons for the failure of governments ( and societies ) to respond adequately to the challenges of environmental degradation is the fragmentation of knowledge . Biology , ethics , economics , environmental policy , and social science occupy different domains of knowledge , when there is an urgent need for them to be combined . A leading entomologist , Wilson has been particularly preoccupied with how the biological sciences can be deployed to explain facets of human culture . His first major foray into this area , the book Sociobiology , sought to ground human social behavior in inherited biological traits . Although much disputed , not least because of its political and ideological implications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is currently enjoying renewed interest . <p> The idea of a dialogue between , or even a convergence of , different domains of inquiry may , at first sight , appear a largely positive goal ; few dispute the value of interdisciplinary thinking . Yet it raises a host of questions that will be the focus of this book . Wilsons example of environmentalism is initially persuasive , except that the real object of criticism is the failure of government to take into account insights from numerous domains in the formation of policy , rather than the epistemological problem of the unity of knowledge . Wilsons argument , moreover , is based on an undeclared realist epistemology that assumes the world as a single object of knowledge , when there are many more constructivist positions that would cast into doubt the a priori possibility of a unified field of knowledge . <p> Aside from such theoretical issues , there are other reasons to be wary of the new " consilience , " for in many cases the calls for such cross-disciplinary activity have been prompted less by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire for intellectual imperialism , in which the proponents of the natural sciences lay claim to superior explanatory powers . Wilson provides an illustration when he states , " Without the instruments and accumulated knowledge of the natural sciencesphysics , chemistry , and biologyhumans are trapped in a cognitive prison . They are like intelligent fish born in a deep , shadowed pool . Wondering and restless , longing to reach out , they think about the world outside . They invent ingenious speculations and myths about the origin of the confining waters , of the sun and the sky and the stars above , and the meaning of their own existence . But they are wrong , always wrong . " The arts and humanities , lacking the tools of the natural sciences , are lost in a world of delusional mythologies . A similar opinion is expressed in Creating Consilience , a recent collection of essays that examines how the humanities and the sciences might be " integrated . " The nature of such integration is apparent , perhaps , in the first sentence of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyer : " Why is most cultural anthropology irrelevant ? " For Boyer , it is because anthropology has written itself out of the concerns of most importance to contemporary society . His upbeat solution is that it should embrace the biological sciences , since , he asserts , " the traditional concerns of cultural anthropology are currently being given a new lease of life and often a much more lively public relevance by evolutionary biologists and economists , suggesting that there may be such a field as the science of culture. " Boyer is himself closely associated with a program of evolutionary anthropology that has claimed to identify the inherited biological roots of a wide range of cultural and social practices . Yet of course the use of the term " irrelevant " invites the question : for whom ? Boyer and his colleagues never answer this question , but it is a recurring theme in this study , which starts from the premise that the construction of knowledge is a function of the interests of the inquirer , which , in turn , determine the questions to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " two cultures divide " is , it is alleged , the emergence of conflicting ontologies . Scientists are ontological monists , whereas exponents of the humanities hold on tenaciously to a dualism of mind and body and to the mystifying concepts of Verstehen ( understanding ) and Geist ( spirit ) inherited from the German hermeneutic tradition . Once such dualism is overcome , it is argued , the humanities and the sciences can be properly integrated , and more rational accounts produced of cultural practices and representations . Criticisms of such proposals are , it is claimed , little more than an unreflective response to their counterintuitive implications . " Because of our innate folk dualism , human level realitiesbeauty , honor , love , freedomstrike us as pertaining to the ontological realm entirely distinct from the blind deterministic workings of the physical world , and we are always ready to trot out the emotionally fraught charge of reductionism. " This trivializes , of course , the philosophical stakes involved . While some defenders of the specificities of the humanities may fall back onto unanalyzed notions of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no serious attempt to understand and engage with the philosophical underpinnings of the humanities . <p> One of the shrillest voices of all in this debate has been that of Richard Dawkins . Having written a number of groundbreaking works in evolutionary biology in the 1970s , Dawkins has since become the advocate of an increasingly fetishized and reified notion of science . Taking particular aim at religious belief , Dawkins has tended to dismiss anything other than " scientific method . " It is not the goal of this book to defend religions against his polemics , but it is legitimate to express concern at Dawkinss wish to monopolize the field of inquiry in the name of a simplistic , philosophically and historically uninformed image of " science . " The voices calling for consilience or for a dialogue between the sciences and the humanities therefore often seem to be aiming at anything but an open conversation . They envisage not a meeting of equals but , instead , an encounter in which the purported illusions motivating the humanities are shown for what they are and replaced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with the attempts to apply such an outlook to the study of art . It examines questions to do with theories of aesthetic response as well as issues relating to the historical understanding of art . There are some obvious examples of the interaction between scientific research and art-historical inquiry . Technical art history , for instance , is a by-product of modern chemistry , and its relation to the natural sciences is not in question . However , this study focuses less on that well-defined subfield of art history and more on the particularly prominent role that the biological sciences have played in the project of rethinking art and aesthetics . The theory of evolution has been of central importance in this context , and one might even argue that the call for consilience amounts to little more than an attempt to create a neo-Darwinian framework for the analysis of art . Indeed , evolutionary aesthetics has become a recognized field , and much of this book is devoted to the critical appraisal of the claims of neo-Darwinian accounts of art and aesthetics . Other , related approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attempt to analyze artistic creativity , as well as the response to art and architecture , using techniques devised in brain science . This book also examines systems theory . More usually seen as a product of the interest in management and computerized systems in the 1960s , systems theory has a much wider set of conceptual roots , and in the writings of its most important representative , the social theorist Niklas Luhmann , the theory of evolution is a central organizing theme . It has gained particular traction with theorists of contemporary art . <p> Almost as soon as art history emerged as a modern discipline , art historians expressed anxiety about its status . This anxiety related not only to its assumed role as a mere auxiliary discipline to history but also to its status as a " scientific " enterprise . At the first-ever international congress of art historians , held in Vienna in 1873 , the convener , Rudolf Eitelberger , declared that " art history was created through scientific workand it is only through scientific work that it has a future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confident assertion , reveals the fear that art history might be vulnerable to the charge that it was little more than an exercise in dilettantism , its exponents pursuing personal aesthetic preferences when writing about art . It was to counter such suspicions that Eitelberger proclaimed its scientific status , a view that was repeated by his successor as professor of art history in Vienna , Moritz Thausing , who in his inaugural professorial address of the same year declared that taste and aesthetic value had no place in art-historical scholarship . <p> The term Kunstwissenschaft , used by Eitelberger and Thausing to denote art history , suggested not only " science " but also " scholarship . " It had a less restrictive set of meanings than the English term science would suggest , and German Kunstwissenschaft embraces a broad spectrum of practices , from positivistic and archaeological documentation of factual information to iconological interpretation and formal and technical analysis . Nevertheless , almost from the inception of their discipline , art historians showed a lively interest in the natural sciences . Darwins On the Origin of Species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in influencing the thought of art historians across Europe and North America in the late nineteenth century . For many , the overall shape of arts history could be conceived of as an evolutionary process ; Gottfried Semper , Alois Riegl , Franz Wickhoff , and Max Dvork all espoused this concept . This not only informed the understanding of forms ; Riegl and Heinrich Wlfflin also saw art as an index of the evolution of vision . The meaning of this concept remains much debated , but it reveals the clear influence of Darwinism . Wlfflins and Riegls contemporary Aby Warburg mapped the history of art onto the evolution of human emotional and aesthetic response , with the constant possibility of the reemergence of atavistic impulses from a primitive past . Warburgs interest in the representation of bodily gesture , for example , was indebted to his repeated reading of Darwins study The Expression of Emotions in Animals and Man ( 1872 ) . In Britain , too , Darwinian thinking was marshaled to provide an explanatory framework for the development of artistic forms ; the anthropologists Alfred Haddon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of artistic decoration in evolutionary terms , mapping out the genealogy of a wide range of artifacts . <p> Alongside their interest in the theory of evolution , Wlfflin , Riegl , and others responsible for the development of modern art history sought to explain style and aesthetic response in terms of physiology and the psychology of perception . Younger scholars , such as Yrj Hirn ( 18701952 ) , Wilhelm Worringer ( 18811965 ) and , later , Ernst Gombrich ( 19092001 ) , continued this interest . But the subsequent identification of art history as one of the humanities entailed the marginalization of attempts at such integration . Edgar Wind may have attempted , in Experiment and Metaphysics , to draw parallels between scientific experimentation and art-historical inquiry , but this work fell stillborn from the press . Gombrich attempted to explore the psychology of perception , but his work was effectively ignored by the art-historical establishment . The occasional eccentric publication , such as Patrick Trevor-Ropers attempt to explain the work of a range of artists by reference to the defects in their vision , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is therefore all the more striking that in recent years there has been a renewed effort to bring scientific ( read : biological ) methods and concepts to bear on the understanding of art . This book proceeds on the premise that despite the often unhelpful tone of their aggressive and triumphalist rhetoric , the exponents of consilience can not be simply ignored or dismissed ; their claims require critical scrutiny . This is especially so given that neo-Darwinian approaches aim to explain some of the most fundamental questions to do with art , such as the nature of artistic creativity , the character and purpose of aesthetic experience , the process of artistic transmission , arts social purpose , and , ultimately , arts origins . <p> Speculation as to the origin of art is coterminous with the history of writing about art ; Pliny the Elders account of painting in the Natural History opens with a comment not merely on who the first artists were but also on how painting first emerged . Every subsequent major writer on art , from Vasari to Winckelmann , Hegel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins , and the discovery of Paleolithic artifacts and rock art in the nineteenth century gave added impetus to such conjecture . Nevertheless , the question of origins has been taken up again with renewed vigor in recent years , encouraged by neo-Darwinian theorizing about art and culture . Authors with otherwise disparate theoretical and ideological commitments , such as Ellen Dissanayake , Denis Dutton , Steven Mithen , and Winfried Menninghaus , have all advanced evolutionary theories of art , with an emphasis on its adaptive function . In the absence of other satisfactory metanarratives , evolutionary theory has also been used as the underpinning of " world art studies . " <p> The first chapter of this book examines and critiques the argument that art emerged as an evolutionarily adaptive behavior , not only by questioning the strength of its claims , or indeed of its politically problematic assumptions ( heteronormative models of sexual and social behavior are frequently inserted into descriptions of the Paleolithic primal scene ) , but also by interrogating its value as a statement about art and art behavior . It may be persuasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutation , but there is no way of knowing , and it is difficult to identify evidence for such a claim , or even to agree on what might count as evidence . In other words , I argue that such theories are underdeterminedone might even add " unscientific " and an indicator of this might be that the meaning of the term adaptive remains markedly uncertain . Some authors have pointed toward parallels in the mating rituals of other species to suggest that art was primarily directed toward reproduction . In contrast , others have suggested that art emerged out of a reservoir of behaviors that were reinforced by , and crucial to , human cognitive development . Still other commentators have suggested that arts representational function , its ability to evoke virtual and fictional realities , built on and enhanced the ability to weigh up possible worlds , a capacity that underpins deliberation on different courses of action and their possible consequences . Finally , some have argued that art was adaptive inasmuch as it enhanced the sense of communal identity and thereby ensured the reproduction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the difficulty is that there is very little evidence for which might be more plausible . This touches on a wider debate over the concept of underdetermination . <p> The philosopher of science Larry Laudan has argued that the critique of underdetermination is not necessarily decisive , inasmuch as a weaker criterion of rational defensibility may be all that is required to sustain an argument . This may be the case , but the difficulty with evolutionary aesthetics is that the models of adaptation advanced are all equally defensible , and the decision to select one over another is ultimately dictated by extrinsic criteria . One might thus begin to dispute the claim that the biological sciences provide a superior interpretative approach . Instead , it turns out that a central aspect of evolutionary theories of art lacks any " logical " or " scientific " basis . <p> One can , of course , make similar criticisms of the humanities in general and art history in particular . Even the most descriptive account of a work of art is a selective interpretation of what the commentator is observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years , is anything but close , since it is a selective attention directed by the wider interests of the interpreter . Moreover , as James Elkins has argued , although art historians have frequently drawn on " nomothetic " frameworks , from iconography to semiology and cultural materialism , there is nothing objective or nomological about their application to specific instances . The difference , however , is that art historians are all too aware of the contingent , interest-driven , and ideological nature of their work . In other words , they make few of the claims on behalf of their practice that the exponents of consilience make in relation to their own . <p> The difficulties mount up when one interrogates the issue further . Even if it is accepted that art emerged as an adaptive behavior , this is of little help when tracing arts subsequent historical course . For example , certain types of landscape painting may perhaps evoke primal ancestral memories of a Pleistocene natural environment to which humans were adapted , as various authors suggest , but this helps little when trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic representations . How does this help when trying to determine the historical relationship between a classical landscape by Claude and a transcendentalist vision of northern Germany by Caspar David Friedrich , for example ? How does it help when trying to determine the relationship between individual paintings of the same subject , Friedrichs The Oak Tree in the Snow ( 1829 ) and Gustav Klimts Tree of Life ( 1909 ) , if they are both expressions of the same atavistic impulse ? <p> This type of criticism can be applied equally to the subject of the second chapter of this book , namely , the use of evolutionary theory to describe artistic diffusion and the development of artistic traditions . Aby Warburg was the first to attempt such a project , using the biologist Richard Semons theory of memory to describe artistic reproduction and variation . Comparing artistic images to mnemic traces imprinted on biological organisms , Warburg envisioned the Renaissance as a process of mnemic recall , in which the retrieval of classical symbols was a reactivation of latent memories imprinted on the collective memory . Semon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same but also as a process where mutation could introduce variation , leading to the production of new lines of descent . This opened up the possibility that artistic tradition was not merely doomed to an eternal recurrence of the same , but rather could subvert the meanings of ancient memories buried in the inherited stock of visual imagery . Artistic tradition could thus be as much about the sublimation of primitive inherited impulses as about their repetition . <p> This model clearly bears similarities to Darwinian notions of evolution and descent , in which genetic lineages are either passed on and reproduced unchanged to subsequent generations , or are passed on in mutated form and even confer reproductive advantages on their bearers . Warburg focused his study of artistic transmission on dynamogramsthose visual symbols that were charged with cultural memory . More recently , in his book The Selfish Gene , Richard Dawkins took up the idea with the concept of the meme , the unit of cultural transmission that could be compared to the gene in biological evolution . For Dawkins , memes are handed down , repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities that bestows success on their ability to reproduce . A melody may be highly memorable ; an image may be particularly moving or striking in the specific context in which it is produced . In other words , it will be better " adapted " than others in that it has features that render it more likely to be passed on . Other authors have attempted to construct similar theories of cultural and social adaptation . Of these , the most ambitious is Walter Runciman , whose wide-ranging historical sociology is founded on notions of social evolution and adaptation . This is so not only in the case of larger-scale theories of social adaptation but also in more specific claims about the adaptational function of art . It is possible to see almost any social ( and cultural ) phenomenon as either adapted or maladapted , depending on the perspective chosen . Given that historical phenomena come into existence for a certain time , it is possible to assert their superior adaptivity over what preceded them , but , equally , since nothing lasts forever , it is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually comes to an end . As the biologist John Maynard Smith has admitted , the claims often advanced " become irrefutable and metaphysical , and the whole program merely a test of ingenuity in conceiving possible functions . " <p> The issue of arbitrariness comes to the fore when more detailed studies of individual cultural and artistic practices are examined . Numerous authors , from Alfred Barr and George Kubler to more recent writers such as Mark Collard and Franco Moretti , have attempted to construct evolutionary trees , or " cladograms , " that map out the lines of ancestry , continuation , variation , and extinction of specified artistic and literary objects . A common difficulty in such accounts is that the features they use as the basis of such mappingclues in the case of detective fiction for Moretti , geometrical figures in textile designs for Collardare chosen arbitrarily . It would be possible to use other features , equally arbitrarily , to reach quite different conclusions . <p> Such evolutionary accounts ultimately run the danger , too , of offering a positivistic tautology : certain cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , are " selected " because they are more successfully adapted . This weakness is evident in the work of Niklas Luhmann , the focus of the final chapter . Luhmanns systems theory has had a growing impact on aesthetics and art history , initially in Germany , but now , gradually , in the Anglophone world as well . Evolution is central to Luhmanns theory of social systems , according to which systems persist through time by means of the processes of self-reproduction , variation , and selection . But systems theory suffers from the same weakness as other evolutionary theories . Namely , while it observes such processes at work , it lacks a midlevel theoretical framework for identifying how or why certain variations are selected and others are not . This deficiency is especially significant given that in systems theory the environment is not seen as a constraining factor ( against which certain variations are better adapted than others ) , but rather as something that is itself defined by the system . In other words , the process of variation and selection is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grounds for such determinations . It is limited to making two observations : there is variation , and there is selection . <p> The third chapter addresses what has become one of the most contentious and disputed areas in which biological insights have been applied to the study of art : neuroarthistory . Although associated with John Onians in particular , it has been promulgated by a number of authors , who have used neuroscience to explore familiar issues in aesthetics and the history of art . Subjects have ranged from the meaning and origins of Paleolithic artit was the visual expression of a profound evolutionary leap in human cognition and neurological structureto more detailed art-historical case studies , such as responses to modernist abstraction , classical Greek architecture , and the Renaissance invention of perspective . For such theories , the power of art is due to its ability to stimulate certain evolved neurological processes . Conversely , neuroarthistory claims that artists and architects derive their creative disposition from specific patterns of neural development ; certain areas of the brain are overdeveloped , and these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of trenchant criticism , not least from researchers in the neurosciences , who have criticized its superficial understanding of neurological processes . Although some of these criticisms are outlined here as well , my main concern is , again , with neuroarthistorys explanatory value . Arguably , even if reactions to artworks can be correlated with observed patterns of neural activity , it is open to question whose interests this insight serves . Does neuroarthistory generate findings that address the disciplinary concerns of art historians , or does it merely use artistic raw material to provide " data " that are primarily of interest to those researching the operations of the brain ? What would it mean for the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans of the brain to be of significance for art-historical investigation ? How might it shape the course of the discipline ? What answer might there be to the suspicion that neuroarthistory merely uses the vocabulary of neuroscience to describe commonplaces about the formative role of social and natural environments ? What does neuroscience add to conceptions of aesthetic experience ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is used to account for individual episodes in the history of art ; it turns out to be unable to provide any method for distinguishing between responses to individual artworks , much less for considering their aesthetic , cultural , or other value and significance . <p> Critics of the new Darwinism in the humanities are often accused of a blinkered attitude , of an ideological and willful blindness that interferes with the possibility of genuine and meaningful dialogue with the natural sciences . In some cases , this accusation may be justified , but it should not be allowed to distract attention from the serious issues that attend the attempts to apply neo-Darwinian and neuroscientific ideas to the analysis of art . C. P. Snows original complaint was about the lack of meaningful engagement between the two cultures , which had become both socially and intellectually estranged . Overcoming this division may undoubtedly be an important objective , but , as stated earlier , many proponents of consilience aim at something more ambitious : the wholesale subordination of the humanities to a scientific paradigm . Yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that this is impossible . Neurology can , at best , describe individual brain states , but this is far from explaining the cultural and artistic objects that are of interest to the humanities . As Jan Faye puts it , " Cultures , norms and meanings supervene on numerous brains and their interactions , as mediated by language and other cultural symbols , which are themselves not neurophysiological states . . . . Individuals who share a common culture or communicate via some communal symbolic medium do not share some common brain state . " <p> At the center of the debate over the value of the natural sciences for the understanding of art is the question of the unity of knowledge . The premise of this book is that the desire for such unity is at the heart of the problem , for it is a misconceived project . It is no small irony that one of the most forceful advocates of epistemological pluralism has been Niklas Luhmann , whose vision of a system-oriented modernity stresses its " polycontextural " nature . For Luhmann , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated by individual social , biological , and psychic systems . The perspectives of individual systems may interact ( Luhmann speaks of " structural coupling " or " interpenetration " ) , and indeed they may sometimes depend on such interactions , but , in contrast to the proponents of consilience , this is far from constituting a single field of knowledge . <p> Cashed out in concrete terms , this means that insights from the natural sciences and the humanities may well converge on topics of shared interest , and that the possibilities of such convergence have to be examined . The argument , for example , that the emergence of representational art across the world at an approximately similar time is linked to crucial evolutionary developments in human cognition is compelling , unless one is committed to a nonnaturalistic theory of human mind . Equally , for all their contentious and problematic character , Darwins speculations as to the sexual origins of aesthetic experience merit serious attention . Likewise , through quantitative analysis it is possible to detect patterns of development that enable the reconstruction of evolutionary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selection . Nevertheless , in each of these cases the most striking feature is the limits of such explanations . <p> Even though an important cognitive evolutionary step may have been taken some forty thousand years ago that enabled the emergence of complex representational imagery , this can tell us little about the subsequent history of such imagery . A similar restriction besets the Darwinian reading of aesthetic sensibility . It may be that the sense of beauty is descended from earlier responses to visual display in mating rituals and is thus rooted in sexual selection , but such distant origins have long since been overwritten by layers of cultural meanings , which are precisely what concern art and cultural historians . In other words , evolutionary theory may provide an additional explanatory layer , but it does not easily replace more established discourses in the humanities . It is possible to map out patterns of cultural evolution , but the data generated require interpretation about the significance of such processes , which requires the application of a wide range of other methods and concepts from the humanities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives out of hand , for they may offer important insights and , on occasion , lead to a reframing of established questions . As the individual analyses suggest , the use of the evolutionary framework poses questions about how one might formulate models of art-historical change and time , about the cross-cultural validity of the categories of art and aesthetic experience , about the relation between art and sexuality , about the use of quantitative information in art-historical analysis , about norms of evidence and argumentation . At the same time , they suggest that the proponents of consilience of the arts and sciences are less entitled to the confidence that has often been a hallmark of their interventions . <p> It may be objected that in concentrating on questions of value , i.e. , whether such approaches offer a " difference which makes a difference , " as Gregory Bateson put it in another context , I have adopted an instrumental attitude toward inquiry . In response , I argue that in an important sense it is entirely pointless to debate whether Constables Hay Wain is as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in childhood , or whether we enjoy the landscape paintings of Albert Bierstadt because they evoke buried primordial memories of our Pleistocene past , or whether we find Myrons Discus Thrower beautiful because his proportions signify his genetic and hence reproductive fitness . I am not in a position to adjudicate the truth-value of research into mirror neurons , or the evolution of the human mind , nor are any other art historians . My concerns lie elsewhere , with issues such as whether the claims to greater rigor advanced by the proselytizers of consilience are borne out by the examples of " scientific " approaches to art and culture , whether they offer decidable and compelling propositions , and whether the explanations offered provide answers to the kinds of questions that preoccupy art historians and critics , as well as theorists of art and culture in general . My aim is therefore to interrogate what is gained when the world is represented in this way rather than in others . The remainder of the book will explore what such an interrogation might consist of and whether it , too , has positive value .

Our intent with The Rhetorics of US Immigration is to provide readers with an integrated sense of the rhetorical multiplicity circulating among and about immigrants . To this end , the volume engages a cluster of interdependent , mutually implicative , and urgent issues : the articulation of immigrant subjectivities by immigrants and nonimmigrants ; the function of these subjectivities in media and popular culture ; the construction of immigrant " experiences " in past and present public discourse ; the role of various symbolic forms ( such as narrative ) in discussions about immigration ; the effects of affects ; and the consequences of symbolic and material fear , violence , and exclusion on immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of The Rhetorics of US Immigration are intended to model and promote broad scholarly reflection on a topic that in the current geopolitical climate demands innovative inquiry . Further , the volume reflects both the political and cultural state of affairs of immigration rhetorics and the state of the discipline insofar as rhetoricians concerned with immigration rhetorics have selected a wide range of texts for analysis . Some of the contributors explicate the language practices that sustain prejudice , exclusion , and discrimination . They explain how public anti-immigrant sentiments not only influence deliberation and policy but more fundamentally structure immigrant experiences . Others examine mobilization efforts from immigrant communities , particularly young immigrants , rhetorically negotiating the perimeters of citizenship . Still others investigate the function of institutional authorities in immigration discourses , explicating the significance of the language choices of religious and secular leaders . Transcending epistemological and methodological differences , each contributor analyzes the particularities of a case study with two fundamental and mutually contingent assumptions : first , how the public , made up of citizens and noncitizens , talks about and mediates the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and citizens ; second , when the public negotiates the political resources at stake in this topic , we not only distinguish insider from outsider , indeed construct the difference between familiar and foreign , but identify the voices worthy of participation in deliberation and governance . <p> In our collaboration , the contributors to The Rhetorics of US Immigration pursue the hermeneutic potential of juxtapositioning . Extant literature on immigration rhetoric , much of which we engage throughout the volume , tends to focus singularly on media coverage , public metaphors , and presidential and activist advocacy . This body of work may be extended and complemented , we submit , by a project whose objective is the synergistic discovery of intersections . An essay examining pastoral letters as a mode of public activism precedes an essay on the conditions of detained LGBTQ immigrants because the sequential energy contains significant potential .

The interstices rendered by the essays thematic clusters represent an effort to foster readers capacity for inquiry and invention . <p> &lt;1&gt;Immigration Rhetorics : Language and Labels <p> A cohort of rhetorical scholars have in the past three decades written cogent analyses of immigration rhetorics , directing attention to many of the same issues that preoccupy and motivate The Rhetorics of US Immigration .

When the US House Homeland Security Committee passed H.R. 1417 on May 15 , 2013 , chairman Michael McCaul ( R-TX ) commented on the immigration " problem " and on the bills plan to " deal with " illegal immigrants , referencing multiple meanings of the phrase " rhetoric of immigration " : 60006 @qwx470006 <p> During the Committee debate , Democrats attempted to amend my bill to appropriate $3 billion up front . This is the cart before the horse . It is premature at this point in time to know what that number is . I want to know what their strategy is first . The Republican argument used to defeat this amendment underscores the difference in philosophies between liberals , who want to continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want to know what the plan is , how much it will cost , and how your money will be spent . This is the kind of accountability that has been missing from Washington for too long ! 60005 @qwx470005 <p> The " rhetoric of immigration " refers to the arguments advanced by activists , including organizations with such divergent agendas as the Federation for American Immigration Reform , NumberUSA , the Minuteman Project , the National Council of La Raza , the Southern Poverty Law Center , the American Civil Liberties Union , and Maldef . These groups participate in a more or less coordinated popular and public debate regarding policy and the immigrant experience . In the summer of 2013 , following the resistance of Republican members of Congress to S. 744 ( the Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act ) , thousands protested in coalitional rallies across the country ; virtual networks focused their efforts on circulating information through social media . As House Republicans debated the issue , thousands gathered on Capitol Hill , holding signs that demanded , " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Unafraid , " and " GOP , Rest In Peace ! " Inside the Capitol Visitor Center , participants sang the national anthem and said the Pledge of Allegiance . Their exigencies , choices , and strategies in these forums are the " rhetoric of immigration . " <p> The " rhetoric of immigration " entails the language of history and memory wherein citizens and noncitizens engage with the past , both real and pseudofictitious , continually reconstructing the " nation of immigrants " notion . In this sense , the " rhetoric of immigration " is generated by monuments and museums , including the Ellis Island memorial , and vice versa ; it is illustrated by family heirlooms , photo albums , and the " do-it-yourself " genealogy websites that are growing in popularity . Indeed , the Ellis Island website provides extensive information about discovering and tracing family lineages through immigrant passages . The " immigrant experience " page contains a " timeline of immigration history that shows the forces that brought people from all over the world to Americas shores . " Here , the rhetoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , with its powerful trajectories presenting circumstances and challenges . <p> The label further applies to the media texts and pop culture artifacts wherein the constructs of " immigration " and " immigrant " are in continuous symbolic negotiation . Documentaries such as Farmingville , 9500 Liberty , Made in LA : Hecho en Los Angeles , and Ni Una Ms examine the realities of immigration at the border as well as within the US economy and legal system . Television news magazines periodically shape the public dialogue about immigration with investigative pieces . Fictional television programs like TheBridge , Weeds , Breaking Bad , and Modern Family depict the lives of individual immigrants , perpetuating narratives of secretive and unpredictably violent criminals . Fictional films like Savages and Crash recycle this portrayal , adding to the cast the character of the immigrant in domestic service . <p> &lt;end BL&gt; <p> The scholars in this volume approach immigration as fundamentally rhetorical insofar as rhetoric itself is fundamental to the human condition beyond , for example , policy debates or legislation . To wit , if rhetoric is the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasion , as Aristotle claims , then immigration is rhetorical when DREAM activists stage sit-ins and draw on the LGBTQ communitys " coming out " rhetoric . Ditto when rhetoric is a " mode of altering reality , " as in Lloyd Bitzers theory of rhetorical exigencies . If , per Robert Scott , Richard Cherwitz , and Barry Brummett , rhetoric is epistemicindeed , if ways of knowing and sense making are essentially rhetoricalthen knowledge claims in reference to immigration become normative public epistemology ( distinguishing , for example , " terrorist " from " refugee " ) . Anguianos analysis of efforts to eradicate the label " illegal " illustrates these epistemic currents in immigration discourses . If this sense-making process is more narrative than argumentatively propositional , then , as Von Burg demonstrates , telling ones story of migration is an articulation of self and community that serves as a point of entry for cultural engagements . Diane Daviss instructive definition of rhetoricor , rather , rhetoricityas an originary " affectability or persuadability " that is the condition for symbolic action is reflected in Cisneross suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus immigration is rhetorical not only as a public exchange of arguments but insofar as it is contingent upon individual and collective language choices and symbolic realities . <p> &lt;1&gt;Exigency : The Geopolitical Moment <p> In the United States , the figure of " the immigrant " has long symbolically instantiated an imagined trajectory of assimilation , progress , and success . In a dialectical tension between past and present perspectives , the figure is both a target of deliberative dispute and a subject of epideictic lore . It at once animates most Americans family story and threatens the nations sovereignty , order , security , and prosperity . That immigration has been a feature of public culture for centuries is as central to the national memory as the emblematic slogan " We are a nation of immigrants . " This motif reveals how immigration experiences represent interiority and exteriority . While heritage stories passed from generation to generation intimately shape our individual and social selves , immigrants-qua-border crossers come from the outside , embodying the external in the midst of a community . Thus , while one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenry , this would be reductive . Even as one considers the anti-immigrant discourses that dominate contemporary media coverage and legislative debate , to say that the American public understands immigrants as " not us " obfuscates the complexity of the issue . The " nation of immigrants " mythos constitutes the horizon for modern immigration , complicating efforts to address its challenges . <p> Although surveying either the history of American immigration or the implications of the immigrant nation myth would obviously be beyond the scope of any single volume , it is instructive to identify a few political and cultural developments in the historical present , which provide the fraught context for immigration and this volumes exigency . During the spring and summer of 2014 , the surge of migrant minors to the southern border states exacerbated the intensifying political debate surrounding military enforcement procedures as well as so-called deferred action policiesboth interconnected and potentially significant election issues . Border state leaders , including Texas governor Rick Perry , publicly criticized the Obama administrations management of the crisis , framing the matter as a result of weak security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative , announced by President Obama in June 2012 , was complicated by the arrival of tens of thousands of minors ; the policy allows undocumented minors to defer deportation for a period of two years . Presenting further logistical difficulties is the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act , which mandates not only that the Department of Health and Human Services meet the health and legal needs of unaccompanied minor immigrants within seventy-two hours of their apprehension by the Border Patrolthe law was passed to protect victims of drug and sex trafficking , and most of the migrant minors come from Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvadorbut also that minors receive a formal hearing prior to deportation . Border states struggles to adhere to these provisions are , as this volume goes to press , contributing to political opposition in the US House of Representatives against the Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 ( S. 744 ) , passed by the Senate on June 27 , 2013 ( see below ) . <p> The year 2013 marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Agreement , the largest trade bloc in the world . This economic integration , touted originally as an innovative strategy to promote transnational commerce throughout North America , has significantly shaped conditions for immigration . Beyond the scope of NAFTAs " temporary employee " provisions , granting nonimmigrant status to certain migrant professionalsTN status ( Trade NAFTA ) is similar to the H1-B visa but more limited and available only to citizens of Canada and Mexicothe economy of the early 1990s meant a growing demand for unskilled labor . The then-dominant Immigration Reform and Control Act ( IRCA ) , controversial for both its amnesty regulations and its sanctions against those who employed illegal workers , failed to provide legal avenues for immigration in response to this demand . In confluence with Mexicos ailing domestic economy and increasingly violent climate of drug and weapon cartel competition , the result was a highly profitable industry of fraudulent identification , a network of coyotes and human traffickers , and perilous ventures in the desert terrain . <p> In addition , 2013 was the twentieth anniversary of the first World Trade Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City . Coverage of the 1993 bombing inaugurated the mainstream medias now-prevalent portrayal of immigrants , particularly Muslims and/or Arabs , as terrorists . This incriminating representation gained momentum and power after 9/11 , aligning with exclusionist policies that targeted specific nationalities and ethnicities . For instance , in November 2002 the Department of Homeland Security introduced a " special registration program , " registering thousands of male noncitizens from Iran , Iraq , Libya , Sudan , Syria , and other countries of suspicion . Under this " absconder initiative , " the largest registration effort in decades , authorities detained and deported suspects , most of whom were cleared of any connection to terrorism . Despite reports of civil liberties violations , the program was deemed a success by the Justice Department until its termination in May 2003 . <p> The increased cross-border migration generated by NAFTA , the impotence of IRCA , and the growing public support for restrictionist and isolationist policy have since the mid-1990s both prompted and served as justification for the " deterrence , " or " prevention through deterrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1990s was institutionalized in such severely criminalizing legislation as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act , is conceptually grounded in a classicist rational-choice model of criminal behavior and punishment . It operates in tandem with an **29;375;TOOLONG model , penalizing individual immigrants or immigrant groups so harshly as to have a discouraging effect on other potential immigrants . Since the 2007 defeat of STRIVE ( the Security Through Regularized Immigration and a Vibrant Economy Act ) , the deterrence approach has been reinforced by 287(g) " secure communities " programs across the country , including state-based legislation like ArizonasSupport Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act ( Arizona Senate bill 1070 ) . The programs allow the states to delegate authority in immigration matters , deputizing local law enforcement . Such deputizations , and subsequent large-scale raids on vulnerable Latina/o communities , have damaged already strained relationships between law enforcement and segments of the Latina/o population , effectively systematizing fear and suspicion as living conditions and professional directives . <p> In the spring of 2012 , the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction was presented to the US Supreme Court . In Arizona v. United States ( 11182 ) , the Supreme Court enjoined as preempted by federal law those sections of the controversial Arizona Senate bill 1070 that make failure to comply with federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor ; those sections that make it a misdemeanor for a person who is unlawfully in the United States to work or actively seek work ; and those that authorize warrantless arrests when a law enforcement official has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed such a crime as would be punishable by removal from the United States . Especially contentious was section 2(B) , which empowers Arizona law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of a person who has been detained or arrested " where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States . " On this point , the Court chose not to enjoin before state courts could determine enforcement procedures and implications . Arizona Senate bill 1070 , which has inspired similar " attrition through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled unconstitutional by Judge Susan Bolton in the US District Court , a ruling that was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . Significantly , and although vocal public criticism of Arizonas law has focused heavily on implications for racial profiling and the climate of fear in the Latina/o community , race was explicitly not at issue in the Supreme Court oral arguments on April 25 , 2012 . <p> A year after the Supreme Courts decision on Arizonas contested enforcement practices , the US Senate passed S. 744 ( the Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act ) . The sponsors , the " Gang of Eight , " were commended for their bipartisan efforts ; the bill was characterized in the media as a multifaceted composition , including humanitarian protections of immigrants civil rights . It institutes a Department of Homeland Security task force for border oversight and an " Ombudsman for Immigration and Related Concerns with a background in both immigration law and civil and human rights , " and mandates " distress beacons " in the border regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the House of Representatives counterproposal , the Border Security Results Act ( H.R. 1417 ) , emphasize security and border enforcement . The primary objectives of " situational awareness " and " operational control " identify surveillance and deterrence as the guiding principles of immigration policy at the border and beyond . These principles are backed in the bills by considerable budget allocations and reporting mandates . Neither initiative , however , devotes resources to policing transnational cartels smuggling weapons , humans , money , or drugs in both directions , a strategy experts have advocated as far more effective than seemingly " tough " enforcement legislation . <p> Surveying the economic and political developments that make up the current context for immigration , it is important to acknowledge a somewhat different cultural movement , centered on the so-called DREAM Act . This bill , originally introduced by Dick Durbin ( D-IL ) and Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) in 2001 , incorporated partially in reform bills from 2005 to 2007 , and reintroduced in 2009 and 2010 , redirects public discourse and , potentially , policy on immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants . The most recent drafts would provide legal but conditional residency and the opportunity for eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States at age fifteen or younger upon graduation from a US high school , receipt of a GED , acceptance to college , or enlistment in the armed forces . A community of young immigrants , DREAMers , has mobilized in support of this legislation , not only embodying and animating the fuzzy statistics of undocumented minors but enacting a new iteration of a rhetorical convention in political advocacy : self-labeling . Announcing publicly their lack of resident status in rallies , courtrooms , protests , and forums , DREAMers demand that policymakers confront the inadequacy of the long dominant but rarely acknowledged " were not sure what to do with you " model . Rejecting invisibility motivated by fear , they represent a kind of first-generation rhetoric of immigration grounded in the articulation of civic subjectivity . <p> &lt;1&gt;Overview <p> The essays in part 1 , " Activism and Public Campaigns , " survey public activism and advocacy campaigns , particularly those revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation of authority within immigration debates and attempt to explicate the epistemological implications of these rhetorical practices . <p> Terence Check and Christine Jasken analyze the use of appeals to fear and religious imagery in the US Customs and Border Protection Agencys 2004 public service campaign " No Ms Cruces en la Frontera " ( No More Crossing the Border/No More Cemetery Crosses on the Border ) . Focusing on three television advertisements depicting the dangers of border crossing , they demonstrate how certain enthymematic appeals not only empower the viewer as a co-creator of his or her own persuasion but invest the texts with divine authority : the border is deadly , and those who have died extend their caution from the grave ; God disapproves of border crossings , and those who defy his will suffer the brutality of the nature ( desert , heat , cold , wildlife , etc. ) that he has put in place . Check and Jasken propose that the campaign , via Burkean scapegoating , places the blame for the deaths of thousands of Mexican migrants on the migrants themselves , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolves US border authorities , policymakers , and citizens . <p> Anne Teresa Demo extends scholarship on immigration rhetorics by reaching beyond the predominant nationalization of the issue and beyond the authority of secular institutions . Analyzing the 2003 pastoral letter on migration , " Strangers No Longer , " issued jointly by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Conferencia del Episcopado Mexicano , Demo explains how an emphasis on hemispheric solidarity , and a reconception of human dignity and rights , sanctioned by divine rather than national authority , denationalizes immigration . The letter , Demo argues , challenges national sovereignty , specifically and by implication in that it subordinates the states prerogative to exclude migrating persons to migrating persons right to dignity as this right is realized in the pursuit of a living wage . Demos chapter responds instructively to calls in rhetorical studies to move the analysis of immigration discourses beyond the conservative politico-economic paradigm sustaining border militarization . <p> In chapter 3 , Karma R. Chvez analyzes a set of petitions to the Department of Homeland Security filed in 2011 by the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of LGBT migrants who , while detained within the militarized immigration enforcement system , experienced physical , sexual , and psychological abuse . She explains that while the petitions appear to speak on behalf of a " vulnerable population " in a potentially emancipating or progressive initiative , this potential is circumscribed by deep-seated assumptions about sexuality , criminality , race , and class . The petitioners rhetorical strategies warrant close attention , particularly insofar as they affirm the criminal status of immigrants and individualize systemic problems , attributing violence inside detention facilities to " bad apple " guards and officials . Chvez argues that as a function of the petition format and the rhetorical choices made by the petitioners , the LGBT identity is reified as a subset of a class in need of individual advocacy and protection . Chvezs conceptual critique explicates symbolic and material similarities and intersections between categories commonly thought of as distinct : migrants and LGBT/queer populations , immigration enforcement and the prison industrial complex , liberal activism and the reification of identity essentialism . <p> Building on part 1s analysis of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DREAMers , " examine how young immigrants negotiate identity within various institutions , especially schools and youth programs . They do so in relation to recent legislative efforts , specifically the DREAM ( Development , Relief , and Education for Alien Minors ) Act . They explore the implications of social class for second-generation immigrants , and reflect on the dialectical tension between publicity , or public recognition , and invisibility as features of young peoples public deliberation . <p> Claudia Anguianos chapter analyzes youth activism that targets a reconceptualization of the terminology of immigrants legal status . Anguiano contributes to prevailing and limited perceptions of this controversy by demonstrating how the " Drop the I-Word " campaign effectively deconstructs the inaccuracies and dehumanizing and racist implications of visa- and/or citizenship-related labels . Further , she describes the rhetorical strategies of so-called DREAMers , young undocumented immigrants eligible for relief under the DREAM Act . Noting how young activists have shifted the public conversation about their identity from legality to a student-centeredness , have embraced and capitalized on the symbolic connotations of being a " DREAMer , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unafraid ) , Anguiano illustrates a generational rhetorical agency and political subjectivity . <p> Dina Gavrilos investigates the ideology of education policy and implementation via what she calls a cultural paradox : the recent rise in popularity of foreign-language programs for white primary school students and the simultaneous rise of English-only curricula limiting immigrant students access to English supplemental tutoring and instruction in their native languages . Explicating the racism and classism sustaining this paradox , Gavrilos situates it in the United States history of language instruction with nationalist , imperialist , and colonialist motives . She juxtaposes media coverage of white students academic success , attributed to bilingual proficiency and the cognitive and socioeconomic benefits thereof , with nonwhite immigrant students " language barriers , " repeatedly framed in public debates about education models as obstacles to both intellectual excellence and professional opportunity . <p> Yazmin Lazcano-Pry looks at the intersection of the concepts of rhetorical citizenship and collaborative expertise to examine the agency and civic engagement enacted by young undocumented immigrants . Analyzing a collection of letters in which undocumented youths at GateWay Early College High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of students college-level course work , Lazcano-Pry explicates the efficacy of asserting ones voice from a precarious position , one fraught with legal and cultural threats . She argues that the GateWay students and principals co-construction of expertise in Documented Dreams ought to be interpreted as complicating the concept of citizenship beyond reductive binaries ( legal/illegal , citizen/noncitizen ) . With this approach to undocumented youths symbolic presence and production , she joins the scholarly effort to understand the dialectic of rhetorical agency and citizenship . <p> The essays in part 3 , " ( Hi ) stories of Exclusion , " offer a historical perspective on the rhetorical processes that enable the social , political , economic , and cultural exclusion of immigrants from American public life . At stake in these essays is the complexity of " citizenship . " The cultural exclusionary force of a negative definition is an important function of this fraught termmuch of its history may be seen as a series of what citizenship is not . Thus the authors in part 3 are concerned with the construction and manipulation of the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good " citizen , but principally to exclude " others " from democratic access . <p> Emily Ironside and Lisa M. Corrigan organize the nineteenth and twentieth centuries history of American immigration conceptually around " exclusionary nationalism . " Analyzing the concepts integration of the topoi of assimilation , racism , xenophobia , and classism , they explicate certain patterns in the rhetoric of policymaking . These patterns , they explain , recur through the immigrant experiences of , for example , Mexican laborers and Japanese internment subjects . Moreover , anti-immigrant policymakers define , through exclusive and nativist narratives , the perennially powerful ideals of Americanness , nationalism , and citizenship . Against these narratives and their implications for immigrants place in the American polis , Ironside and Corrigan advise activists , particularly those participating in the movement for undocumented youths civic rights , to break rhetorically with the identity premises of the dominant national discourse . <p> Jay P. Childers traces the still politically potent delineation of the " right kind " and " wrong kind " of immigrant to President Theodore Roosevelts speeches , specifically his rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrest . Childers explicates Roosevelts rhetorical deployment of such tropes as individual character and successful assimilation ; he argues that while Roosevelt ultimately neither endorsed nor vilified immigrants , and although he distinguished immigrants fitness for citizenship from their religion and language , his rhetorical presentation of American values effectively dissolved the popular notion that nationality constituted the major difference between citizens and noncitizens . The realization of Roosevelts American idealism , Childers explains , conflated the administration of citizenship with the arbitration of individual character . <p> Alessandra B. Von Burg provides a theoretical framing of memory , particularly the rhetorical utility of memory for managing immigration conflicts innovatively . She advocates a model that transcends the citizen/noncitizen binary : the Where Are You From ? Project , a video collection of first-person narratives gathered in a collaboration between Wake Forest University and the North Carolina Humanities Council , reconceptualizes immigration as " stories of mobility . " Turning to this initiative as a case study , Von Burg identifies critical parallels between contemporary and historical immigrants stories in order to facilitate peaceful and democratic engagement . Calling attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work among American citizens , Von Burg suggests strategies for a " renovation " of negative classifications to overcome the systematic marginalization of immigrants . <p> Part 4 , " Affect and Media Imagery , " is dedicated to the production and circulation of immigration in popular culture . The authors concentrate primarily on film and television , analyzing the ways in which mainstream media supply the public with certain interpretive frameworks and scripts for social action , simultaneously constraining the potential for alternative frameworks and actions . A central concern in part 4 is the function of mediated emotion and affect . As the authors note , the rhetorical construction , or representation , of immigrants is designed to elicit strong emotions in target audiences . Furthermore , the essays examine the medias capacity to enable the publics imagination , and identify imagination , or reimagination , as a rhetorical strategy for political change . <p> Michael Lechuga situates Hollywoods cinematic portrayals of alien others in the Burkean poetic categories of the epic , tragic , comic , satirical , and burlesque ; further , drawing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship implied analogously between the extraterrestrial and the Mexican immigrant , and the US solider and the patriotic citizen and nation-state , respectively . Building on the rhetorical notion of the border , consisting of the complexities of borderlands and border identities , Lechuga instructively takes up D. Robert DeChaines important program , and explicates the implications of popular media rhetorics for public militaristic orientations toward immigration . He advocates reconceiving this liminal space , focusing on its possibilities for performing disidentification . <p> J. David Cisneros assesses possibilities for challenging the emotionally and affectively charged immigration debate , analyzing " Immigration , " an episode of 30 Days , a Morgan Spurlock reality TV series that aired from 2005 to 2008 . By examining a text that shifts what he calls an " emotional habitus " that structures public discourse on immigration from fear and anger to compassion and friendship , he indicates that moving beyond reductive anti-immigrant sentiment is possible . Significantly , however , Cisneros also demonstrates that widely circulating attitudes about the program impeded its progressive or subversive potential , entrenching dominant emotions and affects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " stickiness " of the familiar mode of public feeling that underlies immigration conflicts . <p> &lt;1&gt;Definitions and Hopes <p> As an immigrant , you are defined by your movement from one place to another . This , of course , is a rhetorical process with much at stake . Indeed , you are less defined by your movement than constructed by the cultural circumstances of your departure and arrival . Are you a refugee , migrant laborer , or highly skilled visiting worker ? Are you assimilating with enthusiasm , embracing new ways of life in the land of opportunity ? Are you participating in the subcultures of urban or rural immigrant enclaves ? Who were you when you left whatever it was that you left , and who are you now ? And what do your answers to these questions mean for you , for me , and for us ? <p> In Border Rhetorics , a collection of important essays already cited above several times , D. Robert DeChaine focuses on how , " in the context of the U.S. nation-state , borders and border symbolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " DeChaine orients his project in relation to literature on immigration and borders by noting , first , that " a rhetorical border studies offers scholars , critics , and activists useful strategies for investigating the array of linguistic , visual , and aural resources through which understandings of citizenship , national identity , belonging , and otherness are publicly negotiated , " and , second , that " common among all of the contributors engagements is our decisive turn from borders to borderinga reorientation in analysis from descriptive accounts of status forms to critical interrogations of dynamic , power-laden enactments . " With the present volume , in which several of the same scholars appear , we hope to enact and extend DeChaines vision of what a rhetorical analysis might contribute to the ongoing study of immigration . We hope , moreover , to respond to his call for an ethico-political scholarly stance . As he notes in the afterword to the present volume , " studying immigration and border rhetorics involves , or should involve , an orientation toward a horizon of social justice , a motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses of power .

In her thoughtful analysis of coalitional politics , Karma Chvez describes how the DREAM movement uses queer activism as a resource , including the rhetorical tactics of the " coming-out " logos .

Daniels notes that in the public mind , the following myths about historical and present-day US immigration are taken for granted : that most immigrants come seeking liberty from religious or political persecution ; that most immigrants are among the poorest in their home countries ; and that , according to the " melting pot " ideal , those arriving here blend into one ( 17 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veracity , do not " square with the actual American experience " ( 18 ) . <p> 20 .

Although human beings have been making works of artby which I mean primarily painting , sculpture , and architecturefor approximately thirty thousand years , it was less than three thousand years ago that they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in ancient Rome and in the Middle Ages artists were usually not identified or known to a wide public . The modern cult of the artist first began to flower in Dante and Vasari and came into full blossom in the period of Romanticism . <p> We live in an era when there are more artists at work than ever before in all of human history . Very few of them , only a very small percentage , achieve recognition , fame , or glory remotely like the kind known to Michelangelo or Picasso . One might almost say that the large majority of these artists , like the anonymous artists of prehistory , labor in obscurity . They are largely unknown , their stories unnoticed . The story of the artist in the West is the history of how a relatively small number of artists in a very brief span of time came to be recognized , appreciated , indeed celebrated . <p> In this brief history of the artist , I attempt to demonstrate the powerful influence of fiction in the history of art and the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art history as an academic discipline , which , emerging in the nineteenth century , sought to follow a scientific model and detach itself from imaginative writing about art and artists . Although that way of thinking may now seem somewhat ingenuous , art historians nevertheless still resist thinking about the origins of their craft in poetry . <p> It is my contention , however , that imaginative literature , poetry and fiction alike , contributed greatly , often in unsuspected ways , to the history of art in which the artist plays a vital role . After all , imagination is itself an historical fact that needs to be taken seriously . We need to look back in the Hellenic tradition beyond Plinys Natural History , the usual starting point in the history of the artist , to the very dawn of literature , to Homer , in order to understand the origins of art history and the literary origins of the idea of the artist . By " art history " I mean not the kind of overarching story of artistic development or progress which , inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the poetic particularity and wit of good stories about artists that , in Horatian terms , both instruct and delight . I think of history as a form of literary art , art history as artful storytelling about art , which aspires , however imperfectly , to ascertain the historical truth . <p> The pivotal figure in my essay is Vasari , whose epoch-making Lives of the artists has deep roots in poetry , fiction , and mythin short , imaginative literature . Although in recent years commentators have written increasingly about Vasaris fiction , such fiction ( invariably in the service of historical truth ) still makes many art historians uncomfortable , and they prefer to dwell instead on the abundant facts or errors of his text . <p> Vasaris origins lie in part in the biblical or Hebraic tradition , according to which God the Creator is the supreme originary artificer . Reading both Vasari and Boccaccio , in whose tradition Vasari wrote , we can map out the entire history of Gods life as an artist from the beginning of the world till the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might say , writes as a prophet . <p> In Vasaris worldview , Michelangelo is the godlike messiah who restores art to its divine perfection . In this respect , he is the summit of art history . At the same time , however , his artistic persona , which is modeled on that of Dante , leads us back in time via Ovid to the origins of the history of the artist in Homer . Contemplating Homer , one finds that Hephaistos is the original artist in the Hellenic history of art . The comic persona and deformity of this divinity have a long afterlife in the Western tradition of art history , which is frequently mock-heroic . Indeed , whereas ever so much academic art history , aspiring to gravitas , can be somber in the extreme , poets or storytellers who sing or write about artists in the past , from Homer to Vasari , from Vasari to Balzac and beyond , tell stories that are comic , satirical , ironic , parodic , even farcical . <p> To understand Vasaris celebration of the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the idea of the epic poet as it develops over time . As we will see , Homer , Virgil , Ovid , and Dante are crucial in their poetic self-consciousness to the modern idea of the artist that we encounter later in both Vasari and Michelangelo . In short , the idea of the artist is rooted in the idea of the epic poet . <p> In the literature after Vasari the novelist , Balzac is the major storyteller in shaping the powerful persona of the modern artist . " The Unknown Masterpiece , " the tragic story of the painter Frenhofer and his heroic failure , provides us with the major myth of the modern artist . Although its various ramifications have been much discussed , the extent of its influence is still imperfectly understood . I will elaborate upon the seemingly infinite variations on Balzacs great narrative and upon its consequences for both fiction and art history alike . <p> When Rodin , for example , worked on his great monument to Balzac , struggling with the form of the figure in ever so many possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of Balzacs Frenhofer . To put the point more forcefully , if speculatively , it is hard to escape the hypothesis that as Rodin wrestled with the form of Balzacs body , he identified with Balzacs hero and saw his own difficulties in achieving a masterpiece in relation to Frenhofers heroic aspirations . <p> As I will stress throughout these pages , fiction and history illuminate each other . Homers fictional Hephaistos , for example , is a reflection of the real artists of ancient Greece . Inversely , the real Picasso , who expressly identified with Balzacs Frenhofer , was a reflection of the fictional character with whom he identified . At the same time the imaginary Frenhofer , who captures in many ways the nineteenth-century artist , has his origins in Vasaris obsessive Paolo Uccello and Leonardo , painters who are both real and fictional at the same time . In his relentless pursuit of perspective , Uccello is a quattrocento Frenhofer ; in his failed quest to achieve a perfection beyond perfection , to borrow Vasaris language , Leonardo is a kind of Renaissance Frenhofer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can all too easily unweave the larger fabric out of which the image of the artist is wovewoven with facts and fiction both , out of history and historical fiction alike . Even modern academic art history , despite its efforts to overcome the " errors " or distortions of fiction , can be deeply fictional . <p> We find the interweaving of history and fiction , for example , in the life of Raphael . Vasari tells us that the artist was amorous , painted a portrait of his lover , and refused to work in Agostino Chigis villa unless he was able to have his unidentified lover with him . It was only long after the painters death that this lover came to be identified as the bakers fabled daughter , the Fornarina . Although this woman is not inconceivably linked in some unascertained way to the reality of Raphaels love life , whatever the exact facts , which escape us , the Fornarina is essentially a fictional or mythic figurebut one who is nonetheless true to the voluptuousness of Raphaels art . <p> History was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminude woman covering her breast in a gesture evocative of ancient statues of Venus came to be identified as the Fornarinaan identification based not on fact but on a myth . This fiction has been magnified by those scholars who identify the figure of Mary Magdalene in Raphaels Santa Cecilia altarpiece as a portrait of the Fornarina . No matter that this figure does not even resemble the woman in the portrait said to be the Fornarina . Scholars suspend disbelieve as they accede to this identification , which is rooted in the legend of Mary Magdalenes sexuality and in the alluring gaze of the figure . When Ingres later painted a small group of pictures of Raphael with the Fornarina , his lover assumed a kind of seeming reality . The painters imaginary beloved now appeared before the beholders very eyes . She was the subject not of history painting per se , but of pictorial fiction . <p> When scholars suspend disbelief as they seek out art that reflects Raphaels life story , they build on the fiction of the Fornarina and expand on it . The seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . These allusions do not permit us to conclude that she was in fact a bakers daughter or that some of the images said to portray her are those of his lover . What I am trying to suggest here is that even those scholars who seek to write history as opposed to fiction can nevertheless write their own ( unwitting ) fiction in their imaginative reconstructions of Rapahels amorous pursuits , the evidence of which seemingly appears to our eyes in an altarpiece or in nineteenth-century pictures of Raphael and his beloved . Art historians sometimes do the same things that authors of historical fiction do , despite differences of intention . <p> If history is sometimes fictional , fiction is often deeply historical . In the life of Brunelleschi , for example , Vasari writes about the artists work on the dome of Florence , and , as he does so , he refers to the moment when the architect played a trick on a fat carpenter . He alludes to the event as if it really happened , whereas the tale of the fat carpenter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novella , a fiction , like the fiction or tales of Boccaccio , in whose tradition Vasari wrote . <p> It is not my purpose to retell here in full this wonderful story , which is readily available in various translations to which the reader can turn with pleasure ; nor will I present a full exegesis of the kind that the story deserves . I wish only to touch on an aspect of deep historical truth to which the fiction alludes . <p> According to Manetti , Brunelleschi and his fellow artists are offended when the fat carpenter fails to come to a social gathering , and so they decide to play a trick on him as punishment . Brunelleschi goes to the house of the carpenter and manages to get inside . When the carpenter returns , he finds the door locked . Brunelleschi cries out , " Whos there ? " The carpenter , whose name is Manetto , identifies himself , but Brunelleschi addresses him as Matteo and tells him to go away . When finally the incredulous and confused Manetto departs , he runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greets Manetto by also addressing him as Matteo . <p> As the story unfolds , Manetto wonders increasingly who he is . It appears that he has been transformed into somebody other than himself , and the transformation recalls the metamorphoses of humans into animals ; for example , Acteon , who becomes a stag in Ovids Metamorphoses . Eventually the simple carpenter Manetto is convinced that he is not himself but is indeed Matteo . ( Not only are the names of Manetto and Matteo similar , composed mostly of the same letters , but it should not escape our attention that the author , Manetti , and his antihero , Manetto , share essentially the same name , a fact of interest in a story that is all about identity . ) As an early example of identity theft , the joke is both funny and cruel in its various details . It reflects the literary tradition of Boccacciofor example , the tale in the Decameron in which an abbot convinces Ferondo that he has died and gone to purgatory . With delicious irony the fat carpenter himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Calandrinoa real&lt;&gt;life painter presented in a fictional manner in the Decameron . If Calandrino is famous as a simpleton , then the carpenter , in his consciousness of his similarity to the simple painter , is , paradoxically , not altogether ingenuous . ( We will later encounter a similar ambiguity in the apparent na&lt;n&gt;vet&lt;T&gt; and self-consciousness of Douanier Rousseau . ) <p> Brunelleschi , the perpetrator of the trick or illusion , was , as Vasari reports , the inventor of modern perspective , a system of pictorial illusion that establishes a fixed viewpoint of the beholder ; in other words , the viewers sense of place in relation to the fiction he beholds . If perspective implicitly defines the viewers sense of self in relation to the illusion he beholds , it also paradoxically absorbs the viewer so deeply that , suspending disbelief , he loses himself in its fictionmuch as the fat carpenter loses himself , his very identity , in Brunelleschis illusionistic trick , which is a play on perspective or viewpoint . We might well say that one loses oneself in a pictorial perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good book . <p> Manettis fable or fiction , a parable of perspective , seemingly becomes a fact in Vasaris biography of Brunelleschi , where it is alluded to as an event that really happened . It is more accurate to say , however , that the fable is true to the type of story told by Boccaccio and his followers about simpletonsmany , like Calandrino , themselves artistswho are duped . A parable of perspective , Manettis tale is profoundly true to the character of Brunelleschis perspectival art , to the artists illusionistic trick to which one yields oneself as one loses oneself in its fiction . As history becomes fiction in the life of Raphael , fiction becomes history in the biography of Brunelleschi , a fictional story true to what the artist in fact did when he made his perspectival illusions . <p> Quoting Brunelleschis epitaph in his biography of the artist , Vasari alludes to Filippos " Daedalic art . " Likened to the great ancient builder of the labyrinth , Daedalus , Brunelleschi is a reminder that the models of artists are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to Hephaistos as an exemplar whose image remains alive in the modern period either explicitly or implicitly , and we can even describe the idea of God the Creator as originary artificer as a form of Judeo-Christian mythology . <p> Later , in the period of Romanticism , which contributed so much to what we call Modernism , the mythic models of classical antiquity remain alive as in Balzacs historical fiction of Frenhofer , where Orpheus , Pygmalion , Prometheus , and Proteus are all invoked . But the history of art and fiction about artists is also informed by , or at least brings to mind , myths of the modern world , those of Don Quixote , Don Juan , and Faust . In his obsession with perspective , for example , the simple Calandrino-like painter Paolo Uccello is quixotic ; in his obsessive quest for scientific knowledge Leonardo is Faustian ; and in his obsessive pursuit of women so important to both his art and his biography Picasso is a type of Don Juan . All three of these mythic beings , Don Juan , Faust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern period within a century of Vasari , are the epitome of obsessionwhether the obsessions of sexual desire , the obsessive desire for knowledge , or the obsession with chivalric romance or pastoral poetry ; in other words , art . <p> The history of the modern artist is , in short , the story of artistic obsession , the unending pursuit of what is unattainable , and the various stories of obsessive artists all undermine the idea of art history as progress toward an idea or goal , since that goal is ultimately beyond reach . What we call obsession is not unrelated to the older notion of possession , of being possessed by a demon , the devil or Satan . This sense of possession persists in the story of the modern Faustian artist , who is diabolical . Satans defiance of God evokes Promethus , a type of originary artist who stole from the gods and thus similarly challenged their authority . Here we have the unity of the Hebraic and Hellenic traditions , which come together in Balzacs Frenhofer , who is both Promethean and diabolical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is also very real to both C&lt;T&gt;zanne and Picasso . In other words , fiction is part of the reality of these real-life nonfictional painters . Fiction is essential to the reality of their imagination . <p> If this essay begins with Gods life as an artist , it ends with Picasso , not because the latter is the last artist whose identity is saturated with mythic implications ( and here we cant forget Duchamp , Jackson Pollock , or Joseph Beuys ) . Picasso is a fitting subject with whom to conclude our narrative because his persona is so bound up with the important ideas of the artist that we find in the Bible , Ovid , Vasari , and Balzac . <p> I have surely not written " the " history of the artist . There is no such thing . For there are many stories of the artist , and mine is only one among many . The major claim of my essay , as I have said , is that the history of the artist is inseparable from historical fiction about the artist . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible history of the artist , will stimulate the reader to see other possibilities , to imagine histories of the artist previously unimagined . <p> Although what follows moves in approximate chronological order from antiquity to the modern period , I conceive of my text , in the root sense of the word , as something woven out of particular threads , above all , Homer , Ovid , Dante , Vasari , and Balzac , who , like Giotto , Uccello , Leonardo , Michelangelo , and Picasso , and their fictional counterparts , above all Balzacs Frenhofer , appear , disappear , and reappear throughout this book . Each time that they reappear I do not merely repeat the same stories about them or by them . Rather , I try to fill in details from these stories or show these tales in a different light , as I pursue their relations to the larger fabric out of which they are wovena text , which , I hope , provides clues to future narratives.

Flowers , fireworks , posters , interior furnishings , paintings , and shop signs , not to mention womens clothing , alternately assaulted and seduced Parisians senses . Baron Georges Haussmanns complete overhaul and redesign of the French capital had transformed Paris , as T. J. Clark has famously argued , into simply " an image , something occasionally and casually consumed . " 5 It seems hardly coincidental that this same Paris was also known for its taste for gaudy colors . When Parisians looked , what they saw was a city painted , illuminated , dyed , and splattered with color . <p> This book analyzes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , from the early commercialization of synthetic dyes ( ca. 1857 ) to the LumiFre brothers perfection of the autochrome color photography process ( ca. 1907 ) . It shows how bright and shifting colors came to define modern visual culture , arguing , more specifically , that the development of a consumer culture based on the sensual appeal of color fundamentally transformed collective categories of visual perception and understanding . Moving away from established views that high art became increasingly abstract while popular commercial culture remained resolutely realist ( or merely mimicked the modernist forms of high art ) , it suggests that the proliferation of color in visual and material culture challenged dominant understandings of realism , abstraction , and fantasythe basic aesthetic schemata of modern visual culture . <p> As we shall see , the shift to a lavishly colored world alarmed French tastemakers , who frequently decried the gaudiness of womens outfits and the lack of harmony of modern interiors.6 In response to what they perceived as a generalized state of chromatic confusion , fashion , decorative , and industrial arts experts provided producers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which promised to eliminate all uncertainty in the selection and combination of colors . For these tastemakers , who sought to contain and control color , the struggle for aesthetic harmony was also very much a struggle for social order . The spectacle of loud colors that increasingly characterized modern Paris warned elites of the threats posed to the nation by industrialization , social heterogeneity , and political discord . <p> Closely identified with women , children , and other " primitive peoples , " including workers and overseas populations , color served in the nineteenth century as a useful mechanism for classifying and controlling the world . In other words , aesthetic debates about color had pronounced social and political implications.7 Yet , the history of color during this time is not primarily one of chromophobia.8 Attentive to the ways tastemakers prescriptions failed to match up with actuality , this book highlights the failures of expert knowledge and multiple practical expressions of chromophilia in nineteenth-century France , from the synthetic dye industry that , by the end of the nineteenth century , fully reversed Europes dependence on exotic dyestuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labels , trade cards , and other ephemera . <p> Still , the history of color in the Age of Impressionism in France is more than simply another chapter in the history of taste , opposing chromophobes and chromophiles . Just as important , I argue , is the impact of mass-produced and -reproduced color on contemporary modes of signification and expression . Associated with film scholar Miriam Hansen , the expression vernacular modernism refers to the new modes of organizing vision and constructing meaning that articulated and emerged in response to modern urban life , marked , as sociologist Georg Simmel aptly put it more than ninety years before , by " the rapid crowding of changing images , the sharp discontinuity in the grasp of a single glance , and the unexpectedness of onrushing impressions . " 9 First among these onrushing impressions were those created by mass-produced color in the form of textiles , flowers , decorative household items , posters , paint , fireworks , and photographs . Indeed , while until now scholars building upon not only Simmel but also Walter Benjamins famous essay " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reproducibility " and its influential interpretation by Hansen , have mostly concentrated on the new experiences of shock and collage ushered in by popular commercial culture , it is clear that color , too , played a fundamental role in undermining long-held certainties about the nature of realism , abstraction , and fantasy , and not only in the realm of high art.10 At once highly evocative and changeable , mass-produced and -reproduced color gave rise to widespread and quotidian reappraisals of common modes of making meaning . <p> French men and women developed a sophisticated understanding of color , which they lived and worked with but rarely externalized as a specialized form of knowledge . Thus , in comparison to recent studies of the history of vision , which rely heavily on nineteenth-century medical and psychological literature , this book relies on a much broader range of documents , more directly related to the everyday production and consumption of colorful items.11 Parenthetically , this is also what distinguishes my account from most existing histories of color , which are mainly concerned with tracing the intellectual history of artistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from a brief discussion in chapter 5 , the form of synesthesia known as color hearing , whereby the sight of a color automatically triggers an auditory experience and vice versa , only makes a cursory appearance in this book , despite being a major preoccupation for Symbolist artists , poets , and writers of the 1890s . Originally articulated in the early eighteenth century , Isaac Newtons idea that a special correspondence existed between color and music , based on their shared vibratory characteristics , continued to inspire hundreds of years later . By the second half of the nineteenth century , alongside the growing popularity of synesthesia among artists , poets , and writers , scientists working in the field of psychophysics renewed their search for a biological explanation for this rare perceptual faculty.13 For the most part , however , the scientific , technological , commercial , and artistic actors discussed in this book had very little interest in the psychophysiology of color , synesthetic or otherwise . They were pragmatic experts , more interested in how color operated in the workshop and marketplace than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By drawing on a very different set of sources , more familiar perhaps to historians of business and technology than historians of art , it is possible to reconstruct the history of modern visual perception and signification from the bottom upa history anchored not in medicine , philosophy , literature , or art but rather in the dyeing and printing of fabrics , the growing of flowers and design of gardens , the printing and display of posters , and other prevalent if undervalued and understudied visual media and practices . These media and practices , this book contends , are often much better indicators of widely shared assumptions about the visually intelligible and significant than scientific and philosophic texts explicitly concerned with the nature of vision . Indeed , it is helpful to remember that , in his landmark study introducing the notion of the " period eye , " Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy ( 1972 ) , art historian Michael Baxandall turned not to early modern philosophy , science , or medicine but to the social , religious , and commercial activities of daily life : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic study , Color in the Age of Impressionism defines color as a material substance , visual sensation , and idea that nineteenth-century men and women encountered on a daily basis and through which they developed informal theories of realism , abstraction , and fantasy that , in many ways , are still very much with us today . <p> It is easy to see how color technologies contributed to the reigning taste for realism in nineteenth-century visual culture : for high-end artificial-flower makers , synthetic dyes were an important instrument in the reproduction of the natural world ; meanwhile , lithographers called attention to the detail and nuance of their color copies of famed artworks , which they sometimes varnished and framed in order to better reproduce the appearance of oil paintings ; and , by the beginning of the twentieth century , photographers vaunted their ability to capture the appearance of landscapes both near and far in all their chromatic richness . Less clearly understood , but no less significant , are the myriad ways that images , objects , and discourses about color invited viewers to contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , and the strictures of realistic representations . Paintings changed into ornamental patterns and theatrical fantasylands into pure abstractions , divorced from any outside referent . Looking at how a broad range of social and cultural actors understood and exploited colors ability to work in multiple aesthetic registers , the chapters that follow show how colorful images and objects fuelled and framed not only a revolution in taste but also , more importantly , a revolution in the ways that meaning was visually produced and exchanged in the modern world . <p> Impressionism both mirrored and mediated the change in the look and feel of everyday life resulting from the color revolution , and it is hardly happenstance that the artists associated with this movement have long served as paradigms for understanding color in the nineteenth century . As this book shows , however , Impressionist art emerged within an already restructured visual field , in which inexpensively produced and reproduced color functioned as the principal means by and through which modes of visual signification and expression were defined . More than simply adding a touch of fancy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual culture led Parisians to fundamentally reevaluate common modes of visual address.16 Stressing the inconsistency , irrationality even , of seeing color and seeing in color , the case studies examined in this book show howin the context of the laboratory , the marketplace , the studio , and the homecolor mediated between different aesthetic registers , forging the mental tools and visual practices that would serve to make sense of not only modern art but also modern life . <p> In situating the artworks of Claude Monet , Edgar Degas , Auguste Renoir , and their followers within the context of this broader transformation of modern visual and material culture , I mean to relativize and contextualize but not diminish the uniqueness of these artists cultural contributions . At no time did any of these artists seek to transparently record the vibrant mix of colors that surrounded them . Through their choice of subject matter , materials , and creative technical approaches , Monet , Degas , and Renoir intervened , whether intentionally or not , in collective debates about the nature , status , and meaning of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ambient chromaticism of late nineteenth-century France and provided original commentaries on it and thus constitute privileged windows onto the color revolutions refashioning of everyday experience . <p> Moreover , Impressionism , as noted earlier , has played a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of the history of modern color broadly defined . Accordingly , the " Age of Impressionism " in this books title refers as much to a specific historical period , stretching roughly from the 1850s to the 1890s , as to a distinct set of perceptual and cognitive habits developed by French men and women to make sense of their visual surroundings . In fact , I would argue that , in certain respects at least , we are still today very much living in the Age of Impressionism . <p> Recent years have seen a surge of scholarship on the historical origins of the visually saturated world of today , oftentimes focusing on the mass of inexpensively produced commercial images that proliferated in nineteenth-century cities and on urban dwellers distinct modes of engagement with this new environment . Color , however , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Karl Marx rightly noted , " the sensation of color is , generally speaking , the most popular form of aesthetic sense . " 17 Once laborious and expensive to produce , colorful images and objects became massively diffused and reproduced in popular commercial culture . Moreover , of all visual sensations , color is arguably the most inherently visual ; it does not inhere in objects but exists only when looked at.18 It is , as historian Neil Harris contended , " the most pictorial of all the pictorial medias characteristics . " 19 <p> During the premodern and early modern periods , dyestuffs were sought-after luxury items traded over long distances , along with exotic spices , silks , and slaves . In addition , sumptuary laws restricted the use of bright colorsscarlet and crimson , in particularby members of the middle and lower classes . But , in the space of a few decades , thanks to the development of the synthetic dye industry , vibrantly colored fabrics became accessible to everyone ( figs. 4 and 5 ) . Simultaneously , the printing industry took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still , the great majority of printed images were colored by hand . By the end of the century , however , French lithographers such as Lemercier , Appel , Chaix , and others routinely printed runs of several thousand copies of full-color posters and trade cards . In addition to inventing the steam- and later electricity-powered factory , the working-class tenement , the automobile , and the skyscraper , the nineteenth century also saw the emergence of the first vibrantly colored fireworks , thousands of new flower varieties , inexpensive wallpaper , and the disposable full-color print . <p> In 1896 , author Pierre de Lano noted , " Color , of which women possess the secret in fashion , is a modern taste , born certainly of the nervousness that torments our imagination , the dulling of our sensations , that constantly ungratified desire , which faintly tortures us and we apply to every aspect of our feverish life . " 20 This and similar testimonies from contemporaneous observers make it hard to believe that , save for a few noteworthy exceptions , the role and status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted more scholarly attention.21 One partial explanation lies in the centrality of photography as an object of historical study and theorization in nineteenth-century visual culture studies . Admittedly , Charles Marvilles , Nadars , EugFne Atgets and others iconic photographs of nineteenth-century Paris make it sometimes difficult to imagine the period in anything but black , white , and multiple shades of gray ( fig. 6 ) . As we shall see , however , no sooner was Louis Daguerres invention announced to the public than a multitude of professional and amateur scientists turned toward developing a method of photographically capturing and then reproducing the worlds colors . As Jacques-Henri Lartigue , an early adopter of autochrome photography , the first commercially successful color photography process , later recalled , " Even when I was a small boy I was itching for it to happen . Because , for me , life and color can not be separated from one another ; it had to happen . " 22 Indeed , it is important to remind ourselves that however some nineteenth-century photographs may look , for most men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . <p> Another possible explanation for this long-standing historiographical colorblindness lies in early theorists and scholars general misgivings about industrial modernity . In his classic essay " The Metropolis and Mental Life " ( 1903 ) , Simmel noted , for instance , <p> Money , with all its colorlessness and indifference , becomes the common denominator of all values ; irreparably it hollows out the core of things , their individuality , their specific value , and their incomparability . All things float with equal specific gravity in the constantly moving stream of money . All things lie on the same level and differ from one another only in size of the area which they cover . In the individual case this coloration , or rather discoloration , of things through their money equivalence may be unnoticeably minute.23 <p> Colorlessness served for Simmel as a metaphor to describe the equalizing effect of capitalism , which converts everything it can into a quantifiable , monetary measure . Giving new meaning to the expression " money has no color , " the sociologists description of the modern metropolis is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , one of the premier historians of color , Michel Pastoureau , known for his comprehensive investigations of color symbolism , suggested in his early writings on the subject , " Urban chromaticism diminishes starting in the seventeenth century and ends in the nineteenth . Despite the posters , the neon lights , and all the signage on streets and houses , our Western cities have generally conserved the gray and dull aspect they received during the industrial era . Even the rivers are gray and dirty . " 24 Here , again , the authors evaluation seems to have more to do with his ideological opposition to the modern industrial world " Even the rivers are gray and dirty , " he highlightsthan its actual appearance . All the while remaining mindful of the economic , social , and ecological injustices generated by industrial capitalism , the history of modern mass-produced color presented in the following pages asks us to contrast our mental image of the " dark Satanic mills " of the nineteenth century with the colorful goods they produced . <p> The modern mass-produced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . From Bakelite plastics to computer graphics , color in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries has a rich industrial , commercial , and cultural history , which others have expertly analyzed elsewhere.25 It is in the nineteenth century , however , that the visual practices and pleasures associated with color first became democratized and , by the same token , first began playing a dominant role in defining concepts of realism , abstraction , and fantasy . In the twentieth century , color became a major consideration in the design of automobiles , household appliances , and other durable goods . It is in the nineteenth century , however , that the association between color and fashion was originally formalized . Industrialists had yet to devise strategies for standardizing their palettes ; efficiency in design , production , and distribution were still a far while away . By examining the origins of the color revolution we gain a better view of the commercial , technological , and aesthetic horizons originally opened up , foreclosed , or overlooked by its main actors . <p> Many of the transformations related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted to France . Nevertheless , the French case constitutes an especially felicitous framework for the color revolution of the nineteenth century , for both historical and historiographical reasons . The emergence of modernism , as signaled by French Impressionists experimentation with color , constitutes a pivotal moment in the history of art and visual culture more generally . Along with its pioneering role in the arts , nineteenth-century Paris was also the uncontested center of fashion . The citys role as fashion trendsetter justifies a focus on France , even as the synthetic dye industry became increasingly concentrated in Germany by the end of the century . Certain of my conclusions about the color revolution in France undoubtedly also hold true for other countries , where French art and fashion exerted an often powerful influence on the upper classes , but I have left it to specialists of these regions to determine exactly how and to what extent this was the case.26 <p> Organized thematically into five chapters , each focusing on a different color technology , the bulk of the book concerns the period from approximately 1850 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial turning point in the production and consumption of colorful goods and images . The book begins with a consideration of the color theories of chemist Michel-EugFne Chevreul , including the law of the simultaneous contrast of color and his system for scientifically identifying and classifying colors.27 Up until now , scholars have principally looked to his theories for what they suggest about the evolution of scientific understandings of color or as a source for artists innovative uses of color in painting.28 Chapter 1 focuses instead on the reception of Chevreuls theories among industrialists and tastemakers and the broader technological , commercial , and intellectual context in which his ideas emerged and gained currency . As the chapter shows , the chemists failure to reform product design and manufacturing confirms the growing importance of color in the marketplace and the fundamentally uncoordinated and unsystematic nature of this transformation . While generally enthusiastic about Chevreuls ideas , producers failed to adopt the chemists system for identifying colors and persisted in manufacturing goods that violated the aesthetic standards laid out in his De laLoi du contraste simultanT des couleurs ( 1839 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Blanc and Emmeline Raymond , who played a major role in disseminating Chevreuls law of color harmony , resisted the chemists understanding of color as a purely optical and abstract property . Colors , these fashion and interior-decorating experts insisted , also served to express ideas , emotions , and the most individual and intimate aspects of a womans personality . Two conflicting conceptions of color thus collided and overlapped in popular discourse : one , proposed by Chevreul , treated color in strictly visual terms ; the other , prevalent in practical advice literature , encouraged expressive and symbolic understandings of color . Taking Chevreuls theories and reform efforts as its starting point , chapter 1 demonstrates that the absence of consensus about the meaning of color and how best to employ it was what most characterized the color revolution and the new visual landscape it created . <p> Advice manuals frequently advised designers of fashionable household items to turn to nature for inspiration . As chapter 2 demonstrates , however , the growing and selling of flowers in nineteenth-century France were increasingly determined by the imperatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variety that characterized the fashion industry . Horticulturalists and nurserymen created new varieties of flowers , whose colors gardeners heightened through clever plantings and juxtapositions . Together , they promoted an intensely visual experience of gardens , which blurred the distinction between the artificial and the natural , defined as an original state of being , untouched by human art . Likewise , in the artificial-flower industry , which was also blossoming at the time , the pressure to come up with new designs each and every season led many manufacturers to experiment with color , often resulting in the creation of eye-catching flowers that had no parallel in nature . Thus , while the demand for color led horticulturalists and garden designers to blur the boundary between the natural and the artificial , many flower makers were compelled to travel from the real to the imaginary . Moving back and forth between the categories of the natural and the artificial , the real and the imaginary , this chapter shows how these ideas were interwoven at the time , defining a distinctly modern way of seeing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fashionthis time from the perspective of Impressionist painting . The chapter begins by explaining how the growing popularity of synthetic dyes , starting with William Henry Perkins mauve in the 1850s , established a new understanding of color as bright , varied , cheap , evanescent , and toxic . Next , focusing on select artworks by Degas , Renoir , and Monet , the chapter goes demonstrates how Impressionist artists simultaneously evoked and participated in color chemistrys transformation of nineteenth-century visual culture . This evocation and participation took several forms . As documented by conservationists , a number of Impressionist artists experimented with synthetic pigments , which were typically brighter and less expensive than traditional materials . Yet the influence of color chemistry on the Impressionists went beyond their materials into the very way they saw and represented the world around them . Degas , Renoir , and Monet sought to fix on canvas the bariolage of everyday lifethe multiple and shifting play of colors that characterized the modern world . I argue that , in doing so , Impressionists partook in the elaboration of a chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividness , and inherently fugitive nature . Impressionism , we already know , was about much more than recording the appearance of natural , prismatic light . However , contrary to recent scholarship that relates Impressionists challenges to optical realism to the nineteenth-century science of psychophysics , the evidence provided in this chapter points to artists critical engagement with their immediate visual environment and the materials of their craft.29 <p> Moving from the quotidian spectacle of fashion and dyes captured in Impressionists paintings , chapter 4 takes up the momentous , large-scale spectacles of light and color created by pyrotechnists . More specifically , based on the business records of one of the oldest French fireworks companies still in operation and contemporaneous accounts of fireworks shows , the chapter reveals important similarities between the visual rhetoric of enchantment created by political authorities on special occasions and those generated by capitalism on a more routine basis . Looking at visual representations of fireworks , including James McNeill Whistlers controversial Nocturne in Black and Gold , the Falling Rocket ( 1875 ) , the chapter also investigates the challenge posed by representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations , as well as the overlapping of fantasy and abstraction in this endeavor . <p> Chapter 5 looks at the democratization of color in print , from high-end chromolithographic reproductions of paintings to the mass-produced posters , labels , and trade cards of the fin de siFcle . It shows how , in the context of the irreversible takeover of everyday life by color , it became increasingly imperative for bourgeois men to establish the terms of their participation in this polychromatic visual culture . As this chapter explains , this largely happened in the final decades of the nineteenth century by way of poster criticism and collecting . Influenced by the psychophysical theories of Charles Henry and Symbolist philosophy , critics writing in the 1890s quickly elevated posters above the vast realm of commercially produced color imagesincluding art reproductions , trade cards , scraps , labels , and so oncollected by women and children . As the poster craze continued , however , practices of poster collecting largely eroded not only many of the key distinctions between posters and trade cards but also the male elites tenuous hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the parallel developments of Neo-Impressionism and color photography marked an important turning point in the production and consumption of color , characterized by artists and photographers retrospective engagement with the images , materials , and perceptual habits that emerged earlier in the century . The paintings analyzed in this chapter , including Georges Seurats A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte ( 188486 ) and Models ( 188688 ) , reveal artists critical encounters with not only their contemporary visual surroundings but also the recent history of color-image making , which they sought to mobilize and redeploy to convey , as Paul Signac put it , a more " authentic reality . " 30 First presented to the public in 1907 , the LumiFre brothers autochrome photography process likewise promised a more authentic version of reality . Rather than simply document their visual environment or upgrade pictorialist photography through the artistic addition of color , however , early adopters of autochrome photography assembled a visual archive of the color revolution , codifying in the process its most distinctive modes of realistic , fantastic , and abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , more controlled and coordinated relationship to color . Indeed , as if to further highlight the end of one era and the beginning of something new , the synthetic dye industry , now predominantly located in Germany , redirected its resources away from the invention of new dyes toward the standardization and marketing of a more limited range of products.31 The First World War , with its massive dye and pigment shortages , would require Parisians to temporarily redefine their visual expectations . Still , from Piet Mondrian to Victor Flemings Wizard of Oz , the terms under which color would be produced , consumed , and experienced during most of the twentieth century had already been largely established . Color , if still bright , varied , and unstable , was no longer as much of a mystery . <p> Through his Vite ( 1550 ) , the founding text of Western art history , Giorgio Vasari specifically intervened in ongoing debates about the relative merits of disegno versus colore.32 Indeed , through the present books focus on color , I intentionally revisit one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , Poussinistes against the Rubenistes , and , finally , the Ingristes against EugFne Delacroix and his followersfew controversies in art history have had the same longevity and fervidness as that which , in the sixteenth , seventeenth , and nineteenth centuries , pitted artists and critics who believed that drawing was the primary element in painting against those who insisted that color was the leading creative force.33 <p> Familiar with the terms of the debate , contemporary observers expressly interpreted Impressionism as marking the definitive defeat of disegno at the hands of colore . As Symbolist artist Paul Gauguin noted in the late 1890s , <p> The characteristic feature of nineteenth-century painting is the great struggle for form , for color . For a long time two sides fought to gain the upper hand . . . . <p> Form , or draftsmanship , which is infinitely rich in vocables , can express everything and do so nobly , either by line alone or by using tones which shape the drawing and thereby simulate color . . . . <p> Then came the Impressionists ! They studied color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did so without freedom , remaining bound by the shackles of verisimilitude.34 <p> This narrative , chronicling the " liberation of color " first from drawing and , eventually , from the responsibility of representation altogether , infiltrated twentieth-century Formalist interpretations of Impressionism , including , most notably , that proposed by art critic Clement Greenberg in his influential 1960 essay " Modernist Painting . " " The Impressionists , in Manets wake , " he wrote , " abjured underpainting and glazes , to leave the eye under no doubt as to the fact that the colors they used were made of paint that came from tubes or pots . " 35 According to this reasoning , the so-called liberation of color functioned as an essential mechanism by which art drew attention to itself as art . <p> This book shares with these now old-fashioned Formalist analyses of Impressionism from the 1950s and 1960s a deep interest in inscriptions and marksthe constituent elements of visual language . Where Greenbergian Formalism falls short , however , is in its rigorously internalist framework , whereby conclusions about form are strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor and industrial arts were devoid of form and the Impressionists pictorial choicesthe minimization of tonal variations and flattening of space , the size and rhythm of brushstrokes , and so onwere unrelated to the broader historical context , including ways of producing and consuming color in more everyday contexts.36 Pastoureau gets it right when he insists that the history of color should be more than a specialized subfield of the history of art . " The history of painting is one thing ; that of color is another , much larger , question . Most studies devoted to the history of color err in considering only the pictorial , artistic , or scientific realms . But the lessons to be learned from color and its real interest lie elsewhere , " he writes . " Any history of color is , above all , a social history . " 37 <p> The aesthetic and semiotic challenges posed by the mass production of colorful images and objects in nineteenth-century France , particularly with regard to collective understandings of realism , fantasy , and abstraction , represent the core focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these broader historical developments that I consider the history of Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist artworks . Modeled in part on the material analysis of capitalism that Walter Benjamin undertook in the The Arcades Project , the current volume can perhaps best be described as a historical interrogation of the German philosophers insight that " the technique of Impressionist painting , whereby the picture is garnered in a riot of dabs of color , would be a reflection of experiences with which the eyes of a big-city dweller have become familiar . " 38 It is as much , if not more , about the urban visual culture and reconstruction of dominant modes of visual signification and expression through color as it is about art . It hopes to offer a critical contribution to the history of sensory perception and popular aesthetics and , on a more methodological level , a practical example of how , by embracing the larger field of visual culture , art history often finds itself returning to its origins .

The publication of Edward Saids Orientalism effectively unmasked the discursive structure of the European imperialist project in North Africa and the Middle East . This broad yet in many respects highly detailed account of Orientalist studies , literature , and art between the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries fused Antonio Gramscis conception of hegemony with Michel Foucaults notion of discursive formations to demonstrate how European and American culture fixed the " other " as a course of study or a subject of art , thereby neutralizing the potential expression of alternative worldviews that might challenge imperialisms legitimacy . Saids work has been questioned and critiqued by many scholars and by the author himself , but the influence of his fusion of hegemony and discourse has only increased in significance and relevance over time . <p> Numerous analyses of Orientalist painting , particularly concentrating on the nineteenth century , have followed the publication of Saids seminal analysis of Orientalism , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Studies of Orientalist art began by considering a very broad group of images . Recently , book-length works have developed from extensive historical research and complex , theoretical analyses of Orientalist imagery . Yet despite the ascendance of the study of visual culture , most academic accounts of imperial imagery have focused upon only a small fraction of the pictures that accompanied colonial contact . While some attempts have been put forward to include studies of " popular imagery , " meaning broadsides , cheap prints , and the photography generated by colonial encounters , many analyses have been hindered by familiar dichotomies such as self/other , native/exotic , visible/invisible , and so on . Some recent studies have proposed more sophisticated models of contact through recourse to the concept of hybridization , but such a notion leaves out the intentions of many image producers and disavows the unequal distribution of power . Certain images that emerged from colonial contact have survived over time and can be interpreted by historians ; other representations , which might have challenged the underlying assumptions of such views , are lost to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reading in paintings traces of contemporary political and social developments , no study has considered the way in which colonial imagery not only complements but in fact generates imperial power through an amazing variety of forms . Employing rigorous historical and visual analysis , this book hopes to accomplish as much . <p> It must be stated from the outset that , while this book follows Saids fundamental premise that a discourse ( Orientalism ) operates as a real cultural force with political manifestations over the course of history ( hegemony , broadly understood ) , my goal is distinct from art-historical studies of Orientalism , properly speaking . As Said explains , the Orient is not clearly delimited geographically or temporally , so works of so-called Orientalist art could refer to a wide variety of cultures at any point within their distinct historical developments , or even in an imagined or apocryphal history . In this sense , Orientalism as a category of art history is inadequate . While it is useful to describe the irruption of alternative models in the development of the tradition of European painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of describing the reciprocal development of European culture and the way in which imperial powers in Europe influenced and controlled the cultures referenced in Orientalist art . One of the most significant critiques leveled at Said was that he generalized the West just as much as he claimed the West generalized the East . My response is to follow recent authors and attend to the specifics of the interaction between French imperial machinations in particular locations and the images that negotiated these historical episodes in the mid-nineteenth century . The innovation I propose is to examine in greater detail the way in which images affectedas opposed to merely reflectingthese fundamental social and political changes in France . <p> Another difference between Saids project and this study is that rather than examining all Orientalist art featuring Algeria and made in France between 1830 and 1870 , I focus instead on a single category of images , those that can be productively classed as landscapes . There are two fundamental reasons for this self-imposed limitation . The first is that landscapes have been left out of most examinations of Orientalist art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to identity construction . The second reason is that , as will be argued below , depictions of landscape direct attention to the territorial character of French colonialism in the nineteenth century and provide a unique means by which to investigate the relationship of visual representations of the colony of Algeria and the social and political changes that France initiated there . <p> While it is clear that landscape has played a small role in investigations of Orientalist art , it is also true that examinations of landscape have not played a significant role in the development of art history in the last generation . Of course , countless books on landscape paintings have been published , many of them focusing on nineteenth-century France , but the subject of landscape is a topic whose full implications have been little examined in recent art-historical literature . While many authors have now gone beyond perceiving landscape as merely a category of imagery and have acknowledged it as a category of perception and a historical force , few have formulated a sophisticated model for conceiving the relationship between geopolitical notions of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over other visual media and primarily consider the way in which politics and society affect the representation of landscape . Those who have broadly considered the social dimension of landscape imagery have examined the way in which artists responded to historical , social , and political changes rather than considering how such transformations are themselves , at least in part , a result of pictorial representations and their apprehension by viewers . <p> The term " empire of landscape " seeks to account not just for images of power but also for the power of images . My point is that images themselves serve a hegemonic role in society . Of course , images respond to social and historical shifts , but the visual articulation of such transformations alters consciousness and directs perception . New visual media have been continually introduced at a rapid rate from the nineteenth century to the present . As the forms of visual culture multiply , responses to and interpretations of visual media become more sophisticated . By studying a period when visual spectacles became an essential part of modern lifethe mid-nineteenth centuryit is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visual culture and how each one structures our ability to apprehend information visually . Such a project has clear relevance today , in an era when new technologies and visual media have radically altered our perceptual faculties . <p> Between 1830 and 1870 , the French nation experienced unprecedented developments in the spheres of politics , society , economy , and culture . As any French historian knows , 1830 was the year of the revolution that put a constitutional monarch in power , but it was also the birth of Frances second colonial empire , which began with the seizure of El-Djezanr ( later renamed Algiers ) on the north coast of Africa . While France was , at that moment , administering colonies around the world dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the nineteenth century ushered in the period of settler colonialism for France . In the late nineteenth century , European nations greatly expanded their colonial empires overseas and , for France , Algeria provided the prototype for its later colonial ventures . The changes wrought by French domination in this area of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algeria also altered French society considerably . There can be no full historical accounting of these changes , but images of Algeria generated by Frenchmen who had experience in the colony offer a window onto this vast historical escapade . <p> New worlds were opened to French viewers not just extrinsically , through the expansion of France into Algeria and the subsequent imagery that resulted , but also intrinsically , through the profusion of new visual media that allowed French viewers to apprehend the world around them in novel ways . In examining paintings , prints , drawings , photographs , maps , panoramas , and illustrated travelogues from this period , I have become fascinated by the ability of images to transmit certain forms of pictorial truth based upon their particular medium . No one would expect to get the same information from a painting and a photograph of the same subject . The way a viewer perceives information from an image , historical or otherwise , is a product of the underlying principles of the medium itself . In order to interpret a painting , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of relative values to communicate spatial information , the way composition produces pictorial harmonies , or the symbolic importance of color . Attending to the perceptual shifts made possible by new media leads to a more nuanced understanding of the period and its imagery . This investigation of the reception of visual images suggests another role for pictures of the colony in France . <p> At bottom , a colony is no more than an assertion of control over space backed by military force . Though control of foreign territory is not always colonialism , understood in its proper historical sense , the French colonial experience in the nineteenth century was founded on redefinition of territory . As the ongoing multinational occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq amply demonstrates , military domination alone can not succeed in convincing the vanquishedor even the population of the vanquishing countryof the legitimacy of such an enterprise . This was equally the case in North Africa in the nineteenth century . In order for a colony to succeed , the character of that place had to be redefined . El-Djezanr had to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumscribed through borders , and a new name had to be invented : in this case , Algeria . By no means automatic , this development was a process of historical formation . El-Djezanr was first conquered in 1830 , and as the French continued to expand their control , Algeria was christened in 1837 . Abd-el-Kader , the leader of the resistance to French domination who did much to unify the region , was not captured until 1847 . The pacification of the colony was not complete until GTnTral Randon conquered the mountainous Kabyle region in 1857 , and even in 1871 a new anticolonial force emerged . In these years , a profusion of texts about and images of Algeria circulated in France , all connected to this course of events . Numerous scholars have shown how these works were ideologically charged and laden with more or less sophisticated messages about the relationship of France to the colony . The innovation of this study is to examine how these messages were conjoined with the perceptual terms dictated by visual media . Images of Algerian territory not only translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means to apprehend spaces anew . <p> The term landscape has a number of meanings , and most of them apply here . For historians of art , the primary reference is pictorial . It will be useful to say that a landscape is , first of all , a picture of the world . The term landscaping suggests that a landscape can be created in the material world . The creation of luxurious gardens and spaces designed for aesthetic enjoyment underlines the fact that nature is a human creation as much as any picture of the natural world would be . Further , the current rise of landscape designers and landscape architects demonstrates a contemporary recognition that spaces , as much as buildings , require human intervention and conception in order to transmit certain experiences . In all of these uses of the term , landscape is a way of framing the world according to aesthetic principles . Whether it is a question of seeing beauty in the world and recording it as a picture , or moving earth in order to achieve a picturesque prospect , landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a cultural image , a pictorial way of representing , structuring or symbolizing surroundings . " <p> There is a certain particularity to the word landscape as opposed to space or place . Landscape is specific and general at the same time . A landscape can be ordered according to any aesthetic principles , but it is always organized , structured , and crafted . Even if it is often perceived as " natural , " the crafting of it as such is still a cultural endeavor . It is a means of perceiving the world derived from vision , even the imposition of a visual structure . There is one more meaning of the term landscapethe purely metaphorical onethat is not confined to any actual place . In this sense , landscape need not be tied to a material form , such as a picture or a garden . It can be seen as a means of interpreting the world and making it into an identifiable image . This abstraction of the landscape metaphor is telling because it suggests that landscape is fundamentally linked to perception and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , landscape of possibilities , and so on . <p> For the purposes of this analysis , landscape should be contrasted with the inhabitation and productive use of space . It is one thing to live in , make use of , and develop an intimate familiarity with a place , and it is another to conceive of the world as an object to shape according to principles , whether innate or acquired . How we live in and interact with a world familiar to us is distinct from how we imagine the world in which we live . There is an ontological divide that separates the direct experience of space and the perception of landscape . The intersection of the two , in the colony of Algeria , is one of the central concerns of this work . Landscape is a form of idealization : we perceive and identify with the world , as opposed to merely occupying a place in it . Everyone lives in and interacts with a variety of spaces , but the term landscape could not be used to describe all of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or willfully , a subjective interpretation of the world that a space becomes a landscape . This is the most fundamental claim to make regarding the empire of landscape : in the context of nineteenth-century imperialism , landscape comes to mediate relations between humans and the world . Landscape becomes ubiquitous and functions to secure the colonizers control over space . It masquerades as both universal ( it is everywhere ) and authoritative ( it is impossible to deny ) . <p> In the colonial context , landscape serves an instrumental function , both political and social . Since colonialism is about control of spaceliterally seizing territoryits complement is the imposition of the colonizers understanding of space onto the colonized . The French took control of El-Djezanr and the surrounding area from Turkish rulers , so it could be argued that the residents of this part of North Africa simply exchanged one colonial power for another . Yet the nature of French control was very different and , over the course of time , the French determined to give their colony clear boundaries and eventually to privatize the spaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not content to control a subject people who perceived their world in a distinct manner . Previous practices of land use and engagement with urban forms were drastically altered to accommodate not just the French presence but French views of agriculture , urbanization , and transportation as well . The indigenous population of Algeria thus could not simply live under the French as they had under the Ottomans . Their own means of relating to and understanding their environment had to be adapted to French conceptions . This was a crucial aspect of the self-imposed civilizing mission of the French . Alternative conceptions of space had to be eradicated in order for French colonialism to be completely effective . Further , there was an equivalent need to make the colony apprehensible to French viewers as a discrete subject in order to situate the imperialist project in the guise of contemporary society and politics . This is where landscape comes to serve a political and social function : landscape , a subjective view of the world , was deployed in order to modify both Algerian and French views about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain this paradox that landscape could be at once subjective and socially mediated , or deployed in a political context ? To a certain degree , this duality can be explained by virtue of the fact that landscape comes to exist through its iteration in a specific medium and perception in an environment proper to that medium . Making sense of a picture ultimately means accepting the terms it sets forth for rendering the world . Interpretations may vary , but all viewers of imagery have to agree on the basic principles proper to a medium , such as understanding that a photograph is not drawn but is instead a direct impression of light . This knowledge provides the foundation for interpreting a photograph and binds all viewers of such images together . Yet there is another means to conceive of the landscape as collective : through an analysis of historical formation . <p> Though a number of thinkers have investigated the logic and history of colonialism , more often studies of the unequal distribution of political and economic power over the surface of the earth in the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the difference ? Does it matter ? If one imagines that a single nation comes to control a large area outside of its integral boundaries ( however much those may have shifted ) , there are two elements to the equation . One is the ideological structure that allows such a seizure of power to be conceived and rationalizedthe idealization of national interests in a global contextand the other is the ability to act on that impulse , to control another territory through the military seizure of buildings , spaces , and persons . If one speaks of the Dutch trading empire beginning in the seventeenth century , the reference is to the ontological whole , the way in which a variety of corporate and national forces worked together to provide an overall system of trade and the power to maintain and regulate it . If one refers to the Dutch colonies of the seventeenth century , the discussion would hinge upon the specific plantations and networks of trading relations that developed in particular areas , from Brazil to the East Indies , that actively fed the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is debatable whether Dutch seventeenth-century trade could be defined as an empire , properly speaking , its colonies were real enough . However , with the exception of South Africa and some areas of Indonesia , these were not lasting settler colonies of the sort that became common in the nineteenth century . <p> The point is that while empire is a forceful political conception , colonialism is the process of manifesting national power over foreign territory . To colonize a place is to undermine its very character , to redefine it as a means to take possession of it . Of course , this means getting rid of others who would offer up resistance to this process , or sidelining their concerns and their ability to engage in distinct activities that would threaten to undermine the seizure of the colony . Landscape helps elucidate these terms and demonstrate how they work in tandem : it is situated at the crux of creating an ideal world ( its aesthetic dimension ) and can literally remake the colonial map through its undeniable pictorial logic . Landscape can help viewers imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is unlimited , while at the same time it informs them about the particularities of a region , a climate , or a space . This study will consider images of landscapes that circulated in France and allowed viewers to imagine that distant land across the Mediterranean as part of their nation . It will also examine images that demonstrated how French settlement had definitively changed that region and marked its development . In certain cases , these two functions converge in a single landscape image . <p> There is a collective character implicit in landscape imagery when that vision is manifested by changes to the land itself . In the context of colonial Algeria , the French occupants and visitors did not often produce landscape imagery for indigenous Algerians and , as far as I have been able to determine , there were no indigenous inhabitants active in the visual arts during this period . However , both conquerors and subjects shared the limitations of landscape imagery that framed the relationship of an individual to the world in both a metaphorical and a very real way . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to a totally different way of life for all the inhabitants of the colony . Landscape , as a structure of perception , became a means to enforce a certain definition of territory and thus a way of legislating the relationship of self and the world . The legislation of this relationship was one of the central mechanisms of nineteenth-century colonialismand it is also a seductive means of introducing culturally specific terms , such as individualism and property , among subject peoples . <p> In the period under investigation here , landscapes and images of it were produced amidst a battle over land that ultimately became a battle for cultural sovereignty in North Africa . The French won , at least for the first 130 years . Between 1830 and 1870 , the most common term for Frances domination of Algeria was colonialism , although between 1852 and 1870 , France was officially an empire . ( In 1860 , NapolTon III muddied the terms even more by declaring Algeria a royaume arabean Arab kingdomwith himself as its leader . ) No matter what specific term was employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even accelerated , in the early part of the Third Republic ( 18711940 ) . <p> One interpretation of this period in French history views it in isolation . While nineteenth-century versions of imperialism accelerated near the end of the nineteenth century and continued well into the twentieth , this political form of domination more or less came to an end with independence movements that developed after World War II in Africa and Indochina . The present study certainly contributes to an understanding of this semi-isolated historical process of nineteenth-century imperialism and seeks to excavate its cultural mechanisms and demonstrate their involvement in , and even contribution to , political domination in this period . Yet this historical investigation is influenced by contemporary debates as well . Contrary to the notion that historical experience of empire is an isolated phenomenon , another idea of empire has begun to gain currency in contemporary studies of politics and culture . In the book titled simply Empire , Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue for a new understanding of the term , founded on an absolute and borderless domination of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France aspired to be in the nineteenth century . Though I do not agree with their conclusions , Empire makes clear that the notion of empire is alive and well today despite the decolonization of the later twentieth century . <p> The imperialism of nineteenth-century France and the place of landscape in this development is the subject of this study . Of course , the methodology is born of our own period and can not be divorced from landscape and empire as they are present today . There is no teleological connectionit is impossible to connect the dotsbut I hope to suggest that there is a relationship between the two eras . Landscape has altered the way people interact with their environments ; it continues to structure a relationship between the self and the world . The term itself is replete and imagistic . It functions not as an external force , but as a currency of interpretation . As such , landscape continues to exercise an effect on our individual and collective perceptions .

Defending Individualistic Non-Perfectionist Politics <p> Epilogue <p> Index <p> Preface <p> In the early 1980s Alasdair MacIntyre argued that philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche or Aristotle . If understood in terms of essentials , we accept MacIntyres claim regarding the fundamentality of this alternative . Further , we , like MacIntyre , but for mostly different reasons , choose Aristotle . We think that the resources of the Aristotelian tradition are crucial to avoiding the numerous pitfalls and intellectual dead-ends that we have inherited from modern philosophy . Yet , unlike MacIntyre , who has from After Virtue to Dependent Rational Animals assumed that if one chooses Aristotle then one must also reject modern political philosophy , especially liberalism , we hold that there is value in the modern approach to political philosophy and that there is at least a version of neo-Aristotelian ethics and a version of liberalism that are compatible . Moreover , we hold not only that such compatibility is possible , but that this version of liberalismthat is , a natural rights classical liberalismis best understood and defended by an ethics of Aristotelian inspiration . We argued for this thesis in our earlier work , Liberty and Nature : An Aristotelian Defense of Liberal Order ( 1991 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small monograph , Liberalism Defended : The Challenge of Post-Modernity ( 1997 ) , developed this argument further . <p> We believe our current work to be both the mature expression of this thesis and our best statement to date of the argument for it . We indeed make many aspects of our earlier argument clearer and more precise . Yet we also expand an idea noted , but not fully developed , in those earlier worksnamely , that neither the unique nature of liberalism nor the true character of political philosophy can be appreciated until it is understood that liberalism is a political philosophy of metanorms and that political philosophy should , contrary to what most Ancients and Medievals thought , give a central place to metanorms as well . <p> In this work we spend much time explaining the ethical typology of " metanormative principles " and showing their importance for political philosophy . We argue that the key to understanding the fundamental character of , and need for , metanormative principles is found in an account of neo-Aristotelian ethics , which we call " individualistic perfectionism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection ( and virtuous activity ) in Aristotelian ethicsis something real , but it is at the same time highly individualized , agent-relative , inclusive , self-directed , and profoundly social . These features of human flourishing generate a problem that can not be reduced to those of normative ethics . It is the unique problem of the political and legal order that requires the existence of ethical principles that seek not to guide human conduct in moral activity , but rather to regulate conduct so that conditions might be obtained where moral action can take place . Such principles are metanormative principles , and we label this problem " liberalisms problem . " We do so because liberalism has been , by and large , the only political tradition whose principles are consistent with an appreciation of this philosophical insight and because a pluralism of the forms of human flourishing points to liberalism as the appropriate solution to the political problem of integrated diversity . <p> We explain liberalisms problem in detail and show that it is a basic problem of political philosophy and one that in various forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briefly stated , liberalisms problem asks : What are the principles by which to establish a political and legal order whose structure will allow for the possibility that different individuals might be able to flourish and realize virtue in very different ways ? We argue that the key to solving liberalisms problem is the protection of the possibility of self-direction , since self-direction is the common critical element in all the concrete forms of human flourishing . We use this insight as the basis for our claim that the basic , negative , natural right to liberty is , together with its corollary rights of life and property , a metanormative principle , because it protects the possibility of self-direction in a social context . We further argue that such concepts as " social justice " and " the common good of the political community " are , as normally understood , not metanormative principles and that no ethical principles associated with these concepts , nor any other ethical principles , for that matter , can claim priority over the basic right to liberty as a metanormative principle . Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalisms basic tenet " namely , that protecting liberty , as understood in terms of basic negative rights , should be the paramount aim of the political and legal order . <p> Since our argument for this understanding and defense of liberalism is conceptual rather than historical , and since our approach is original , we should note some of the considerations that have shaped our argument . By making these considerations explicit we hope to assist the reader in navigating this works theoretical waters . <p> First , although we regard the presentation and defense of the basic structure of our argument as necessary to make our argument clear and persuasiveindeed , Chapter 11 is devoted entirely to the presentation of our arguments basic structurewe do not think this is sufficient . We think it is also necessary for us to compare and contrast our approach to , and defense of , liberalism with more traditional ones . Further , since our version of human flourishing belongs to the natural law tradition , we also make an effort to compare our version with that found in both traditional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that these comparisons will enable the reader to appreciate better our account and defense of both liberalism and individualistic perfectionism . <p> Second , the implications of what we are arguing are a critical means of understanding our argument , and in the diverse arena of competing positions in political philosophy , we can only differentiate ourselves at times by showing how we can not be reduced to one of the competitors already in that arena and can meet the objections posed by others . Thus , we not only engage in comparisons , we consider how our argument fares against criticisms launched from other perspectives . The danger in this approach is repetition , since the basic insights of our argument recur when we engage in comparisons , meet criticisms , and defend liberalism . We have striven , of course , to eliminate all needless repetition . <p> Third , we do not consider either ethics or political philosophy to be enterprises that can be conducted apart from philosophical anthropology . Thus , we think it is perfectly legitimate to note the superiority of one account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political theories . Further , we believe that once philosophers acknowledge the importance of philosophical anthropology , they are already knocking on the metaphysical and epistemological door . In this work , we do not , of course , walk through this door , but we do note some of the furniture that can be seen through its opening , for example , moderate essentialism and natural teleology . Thus , unlike the dominant philosophical fashions of the last century , we do not regard it a philosophical virtue to advance arguments in ethics and political philosophy as if the existence of deeper commitments can be denied , ignored , or at least not called to mind . Such commitments are crucial to the interpretative context of arguments in ethics and political philosophy , and if they are not made explicit , then they may be supplied by others , often with disastrous results for the intelligibility of these arguments . And if those commitments are not supplied , political philosophy will simply rest on a kind of irreconcilable intuitionism . Either way , to ignore these deeper commitments accomplishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet , it should be acknowledged that laying all of ones intellectual cards on the table has a price . Since not everything can be done in a single work , and since there are always more issues to be explored , a defense of these deeper commitments , though called to mind , must remain less than fully developed . Nevertheless , we have tried either to provide the reader with reasons for thinking our deeper commitments plausible or to point to places where this is done . The example of MacIntyre with which we opened is instructive here in that , to his credit , he has over the last twenty years come to recognize fully the importance of these deeper issues when doing ethics and political philosophy . <p> " Deeper issues " calls to mind philosophy , and philosophy concerns the perennial .

" Le Parisien 60009 @qwx470009 <p> Reviews <p> Bio 60012 @qwx470012 <p> Subjects <p> In this translation of the best-selling French book , La Revanche de Dieu , Gilles Kepel , one of Europe 's leading authorities on Islamic societies , offers a compelling account of the resurgence of religious belief in the modern world . His focus is radical movements within Christianity , Judaism , and Islam . Much has been written recently about the rise of fundamentalisms in contemporary religion . Kepel , however , finds the term " fundamentalism , " which derives from the American Protestant experience , to be inadequate for understanding revivalist movements throughout the rest of the world . Ranging from America to Europe and the Middle East , from Protestant televangelists to ultra-Orthodox Jews , from Islamic militants to the " charismatic renewal , " Kepel argues that each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can not be dismissed simply as a reaction to modernity . In Kepel 's words , " They are true children of our time . " Each group contains a militant membership of young , educated , and modern people . Rather than retreat into the past , they seek to recreate society according to a set of symbols and values in accordance with their holy scriptures . Each group pursues both a strategy from above , attempting to seize state power and use state legislation to promote its ends , and a strategy from below , evangelizing the masses and seeking to take control of their daily lives . <p> According to Kepel , we have much to learn from today 's religious movements . Like the workers ' movements of yesteryear , they have a singular capacity to reveal the ills of society . Whether or not we agree with their diagnoses , they offer an important and perceptive critique of our society at the end of the millennium . <p> " An astonishing book on one of the burning issues of the day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely unpartisan , The Revenge of God paints a disturbing picture of our world at the end of the millennium when , once again , apocalyptic voices are making themselves heard . " La Quinzaine Litteraire <p> " This book is well-informed and written in a precise and accessible way . . . . Rather than take sides , Kepel concentrates on describing and analyzing a major phenomenon of our time . " Le Figaro <p> " The Revenge of God examines religious revivalism in Islam , Christianity ( both Catholicism and North American Protestantism ) , and Judaism . As such , it is almost unique and sorely needed . Arguing that the simultaneity of these revivals is not coincidental , Kepel suggests that they are reflections of widespread and profound disquiet with modernity . His description of these movements is sound , and the analysis is thoughtful and perceptive . It is especially interesting to read the impressions that Kepel , a French scholar of Islam , has of Jerry Falwell , Oral Roberts , and others ! " Lisa Anderson , Columbia University <p> " This path-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islam , Judaism , and Christianity reaffirm for many believers the relevance of their respective sacred texts for personal conduct and political life . Kepel argues that these movements from below , each claiming to possess its Truth , are distinctly modern and have major implications for the future of civil society . Fresh and insightful , Kepel replaces conventional wisdom with a convincing framework for understanding religion and religiosity in the late twentieth century . " Dale F. Eickelman , Dartmouth College <p> " Where most of us notice freak and isolated sparks , Kepel discovers a smoldering bonfire . In what most of us explain away as so many local deviations from the global trend , Kepel discerns a fateful twist in history . He calls us to treat the new religious fundamentalism seriously and to read carefully the message it carries since it is a serious and seminal message . A timely appeal , which deserves to be widely heard and followed . This study is truly eye-opening . It may well change the way we think of the direction our world is goingif , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . " Zygmunt Bauman , University Of Leeds <p> " The Revenge of God offers a powerful and persuasive antidote to those over-reductionist accounts of fundamentalism that see it exclusively as a reaction to modernity and secularism . This is not only a book for academic specialists within the social sciences ; it is also for anyone seeking to understand those puzzling and parallel movements within contemporary religion that seem to be setting out to reconquer todays world . " Graham Howes , University Of Cambridge <p> " In the contentious admixture of politics and religion , Mr. Kepel is most unusual in not seeking to press a particular view . . . . He instead seeks intelligently to understand and to explain the influence religion is likely to have in the world in the foreseeable future . And he is persuasive when he concludes that , for better and worse , the political influence of religion will be much greater than it has been in the recent past .

Just as the barriers of poverty , disease and inhuman working conditions seemed to be yielding , the population explosion , the spread of AIDS , pollution and the energy crises burst upon the scene d and all of these scourges lent themselves to presentation in apocalyptic terms . <p> During this same period the great atheist messianic ideology of the twentieth century , communism , which had left its mark on most of our social utopias , went into its death throes , and finally succumbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Berlin wall , was destroyed . <p> The Christian , Jewish and Muslim movements we have been observing are to be viewed in this dual perspective . Their first task was to fix labels on to the confusion and disorder in the world as perceived by their adherents , breathing fresh life into the vocabulary and the categories of religious thought as applied to the contemporary world . Next they conceived plans for changing the social order so as to bring it into line with the commands and values of the Old Testament , the Koran or the Gospels ; for , as they saw it , nothing else could ensure the advent of a world of justice and truth . <p> These movements have a great deal in common beyond mere historical simultaneity . They are at one in rejecting a secularism that they trace back to the philosophy of the Enlightenment . They regard the vainglorious emancipation of reason from faith as the prime cause of all the ills of the twentieth century , the beginning of a process leading straight to Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernism is uttered by its own children , who have had access to today 's education . They see no contradiction between their mastery of science and technology and their acceptance of a faith not bounded by the tenets of reason . In fact , people like Herman Branover consciously symbolize the fact that a ' godfearing Jew ' can also be a ' great scientist ' . And the self-image favored by Islamist militants is that of a girl student , muffled in a veil with only a slit for the eyes , bent over a microscope and doing research in biology . <p> All these movements agree that the modern secular city is now completely lacking legitimacy . But while Christians , Muslims and Jews all consider that only a fundamental transformation in the organization of society can restore the holy scriptures as the prime source of inspiration for the city of the future , they have differing ideas of what that city will be like . Each of these religious cultures had developed specific truths which , insofar as they provide the basis for a strong reassertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common is a rejection of secularism ; beyond that point their plans for society diverge and then become deeply antagonistic , with a potential for bitter conflict in which none of these doctrines of truth can afford to compromise , on pain of losing followers . <p> Their short-term prospects will depend upon the relationship between their base in society and their respective political objectives . For re-Islamization , re-Judaization and re-Christianization do not have the same impact , the same significance , in their respective societies d despite the parallel courses they have followed since the mid-1970s . Their respective intensities can be gauged and their probable futures deduced by comparing the successes and setbacks experienced by movements ' from above ' and ' from below ' , the methods of action they most favor , whether or not they accept that democracy as such has an independent right to existence . <p> In the 1990s the re-Islamization movements appear to have the greatest potential . The Muslim world of the Mediterranean shows signs of social breakdown that are causing deep discouragement , especially among teeming youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Catholic Europe , the United States or the Jewish world . In Muslim countries Islamic fervor usually gathers strength just when the generation born after independence comes of age and the first government of indigenous elites is in power . In Egypt twenty-five years elapsed between the rise of Nasser and the triumph of the Jamaat islamiyya in the universities of Cairo . In Algeria , which became independent in 1962 , it was only after the 1980s that the Islamic Salvation Front achieved its first successes , with a crushing victory in the municipal elections of June 1990 . In Palestine , occupied by Israel since 1967 , the PLO leadership got along without much competition for two decades ; only with the Intifada did the Islamic Resistance Movement mount a challenge to it . <p> The success of the Islamists are the clearest indication of the political , economic and social bankruptcy of the post-independence ruling elites . To criticize them in the name of the sacred writings of Islam was specifically to challenge the alien , Western-import nature of the modernity they had tried to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything from a political system which it held to be intrinsically wrong . ' Democracy ' itself is rejected out of hand , as is incessantly repeated by Imam Ali Belhaj , the spokesman of the contemporary Islamist movement in Algeria ; there is no basis in the Koran for the idea of demos , the people as sovereign . On the contrary , it affronts the only legitimate sovereignty : that exercised by Allah over the umma , the community of believers , through a government which must implement the divine commands as found in the sacred writings of Islam . <p> Islamist condemnation of the democratic system is absolute on two counts . First , the ' democracy ' to which the rulers of Algeria or other countries paid lip-service was only a meaningless catchword , because the military regimes and the one-party states were dictatorships , and the people knew it . Thus it is easy nowadays to cast ' democracy ' as the ugly sister , because it has remained largely unknown in the Muslim world as an operative political system . But , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually inherent in Islamic religious doctrine , which , in its present-day militant reaffirmation , is fervently monist : there is only one organized principle in the world - God - and human freedom is reduced virtually to zero . In Islamic thinking there could be no room for autonomous political activity outside the control of the shar'ia , the Law codified by Islamic scholars from the revealed scriptures . To introduce democracy is to destroy the case put forward by the re-Islamization movements . <p> Thus there is very little chance of a democratic alternative that could mount a real challenge to the growing success of the Islamization movements in the deeply inegalitarian societies of the contemporary Muslim world . When unemployment is the most likely prospect for most young adults , the jihad seems more attractive than public freedoms . <p> The nature of these societies , combined with the specific characteristics of Islamic religious culture , also explains why movements ' from above ' play such a lage part . Ever since the later 1970s groups wishing to act directly on the state in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes including armed conflict . The Iranian revolution has had its would-be imitators , and in those closed political systems such aspirations tend to become channeled into insurrection . Such insurrections have been severely repressed d most of all in 1982 , when the Syrian town of Hama was bombed during an uprising instigated by the Muslim Brothers . Violence , not only against ' ungodly ' states but also against ' Westernized ' Muslims or non-Muslims ( from the Copts in Egypt to the hostages in Lebanon ) has now become inseparable from our image of the Islamist militant .

In front of several revolutionary legislators , hangers-on , and assorted observers , workers unearthed a large wooden box that had been buried in the center of the Bastille site less than a year earlier , on 14 July 1792 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Installed beneath a stone from the Bastille by the builder-entrepreneur Pierre-Frantois Palloy , the demolisher of the prison and a self-styled " patriot , " the container comprised part of the foundation for a monument to liberty that was proposed for the site but that never , in fact , saw the light of day . The box functioned as a kind of time capsule , for it contained a motley assortment of objects , all of which provided material evidence of the sweeping political and social changes brought about by the Revolution . Although it might be expected that these objects were vestiges of the Ancien RTgime , in fact few of them predated the Revolution itself , while those that did had been remade as overtly revolutionary . <p> Included in Palloys box were an assignat , or paper banknote , of fifty livres and several coins of varying values ; four medals made from the chains of the Bastille , representing the ci-devant king , his ministers , and the deputies of both the Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly ; and a copper-bound copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bronze plaque engraved with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the Constitution , a portrait of Louis XVI ( who had been executed on 21 January 1793 , just over three months before the box was unearthed ) carved into another Bastille stone , and effigies of the legislators Jean-Sylvain Bailly and Claude-Emmanuel de Pastoret were also packed into this underground casket . Following earnest speeches by the future consul Jean-Jacques RTgis de CambacTrFs and the deputy Louis-Joseph Charlier , the politically outmoded contents of the container were excavated by order of the National Convention , and , in a reenactment of the demolition on the same site in 1789 , they were smashed to pieces beneath the " national hammer " by the same Palloy who had put them in place the previous year . <p> Yet despite the iconoclastic rhetoric that governed this event and the ritualized erasure of the recent past it set in play , these objects were not simply destroyed . Instead , their bruised remains were piled back into the same cedar box and transported immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were placed under the guard of the chief archivist Armand Gaston Camus . Conspicuously but not irretrievably damaged , these obsolete fragments remain there to this day . The Bastille site , on the other hand , remained empty , despite the hopes for a future characterized by the production and display of effective and enduring symbolic objects that were no doubt in the air that spring day in 1793 . It was not until 1840 that it received its permanent monument in the form of a column commemorating the Revolution of 1830 . <p> Revolutions are forced to do stuff with debris , to sort and reframe not only the leftover remnants of the regimes they set out to destroy but the outdated , embarrassing evidence of their earlier selves . Becoming a revolutionary , to steal a phrase from the historian Timothy Tackett , required the production , and more pressingly , the reproduction , of things . This tale of revolutionary uncertainty regarding the Revolutions historical legacy was not an isolated incident but was typical of attempts to use material objects to narrate and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political order of 1790s France . Such responsiveness to the contingencies of the historical process came to typify revolutionaries self-conscious performance of their unique situation in time . While it is tempting to read the exhumation of Palloys memory-box as indicating the inability of its contents to secure the Revolutions " meaning , " longevity is not the only way in which objects acquire currency . Rather , this book will argue , visual practice in revolutionary France was characterized by the production and circulation of a range of transitional , provisional , ephemeral , and half-made images and objects , whose frequently uncertain , fleeting , or makeshift materiality paradoxically provided the most effective ongoing means of negotiating the historical significance of the Revolution . <p> Occupying a nebulous space between , and overlapping with , the traditional prerogatives of divinely ordained kingship and the new social order of nineteenth-century modernity , France in the 1790s was characterized by frequent shifts in political authority and an embrace of the new that regularly ran up against a persistent desire , shared by revolutionaries of all political orientations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not " permanent revolution " ) was a difficult one to realize , the stabilization and perpetuation of the Revolution requiring a delicate combination of stasis and ongoing incompletion . Throughout the 1790s revolutionaries recognized the potential for art to negotiate this impasse , and the call for the production of enduring monuments , paintings , and public spaces dedicated to the memory of the Revolution came from all points on the revolutionary political spectrum . This was often framed in terms of a perceived distance from the ephemeral displays , dissimulative feints , masquerades , and intrigues considered typical of both Ancien RTgime political culture more generally and the bourgeois art and elite luxury objects that dominated the market in eighteenth-century France . <p> However , the radical destabilization of systems of patronage and display that accompanied the momentous events of 1789 had engendered massive changes in the conditions under which artists worked . Shortages of materials and money , combined with a volatile political atmosphere , meant that it was increasingly difficult for painters , sculptors , and architects to carry on as they had before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-scale artworks or projects for lasting monuments were ever completed , although many were proposed . With some notable exceptions , the space was filled with the production of transient , ephemeral installations , often made for festivals or other revolutionary commemorations , as well as a wide range of new kinds of visual production that the Revolution had either initiated or transformed . These included the eclectic output of official and nonofficial print publisherscalendars , almanacs , paper money , identity cards , newspapers , bureaucratic vignettes , laws , forms , caricatures , playing cards , portraits , songs , topographies , and images of revolutionary eventsalongside numerous other souvenirs , relics , paintings , drawings , plans , clothing , and furniture . They provided multiple opportunities for artists and other cultural producers to work in newly straitened circumstances and , often , to experiment in a manner that would not have been possible previously . <p> In portraying the Revolution as " a sort of lacuna , a deserted and sterile space for the history of art , " Antoine-Chrysostome QuatremFre de Quincy , the antiquarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that monument to the persistence of memory , set the tone for the subsequent reception of much revolutionary visual practice . Although the diversity of revolutionary art has long been recognized , a focus on a few elite artists has contributed to the persistence of a surprisingly tenacious set of assumptions about the indifferent quality of revolutionary artistic practice or , worse , the Revolutions status as an outright negation of art . With some notable and influential exceptions , art history has tended to isolate for discussion a few key oeuvres from this period , privileging in particular the work of Jacques-Louis David and his students . While I am aware of crucial differences in production and use , my aim is not to reinforce the distinction between this kind of institutionally valorized art and the images and objects once described by Linda Nochlin as " an odd assortment of second-rate portraits . . . historiated toby jugs and indecipherable coarse-grained prints . " On the contrary , in examining how revolutionaries attempted to reconfigure their understanding of society , politics , and history via an engagement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay attention to how demonstrably " artistic " works intersected with a diverse field of images conventionally understood to be outside the sphere of art . <p> David and other academic painters were also , undoubtedly , implicated in the politics of provisionality , and not just in terms of a diversified practice that led to such artists designing everything from playing cards and letterheads to clothing , festivals , and theater sets during these years . Take , for instance , Davids 1794 painting of the child-martyr Joseph Bara ( fig. 2 ) , a work that for reasons both intentional and happenstance claims a middle ground between the past and future , between two incompatible regimes , between male and female , between childhood and adulthood , and between life and death . All of this is rendered in a feathery , irresolute brushwork that breaks down into hazy formlessness at the borders of the image , applied to a canvas that was intended to be paraded through the streets at a revolutionary festival that was planned in full but that never took place because of the downfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Davids work exemplifies , perhaps more than any other painting , the political stakes of provisionality in 1790s France . It demonstrates the extent to which constructions of subjectivity , gender , revolutionary politics , and artistic style were all subject , in different but overlapping ways , to the unpredictable effects of the Revolutions adamant forward drive . However , the belatedness of the painting , its fall into obsolescence before it had the opportunity to realize its purpose , and its teetering position between utopian future and revolutionary history only tell us part of the story of how provisional images and objects could be more than the outmoded wreckage of discontinued political systems . <p> Indeed , the vast majority of visual materials that conveyed the Revolutions symbolic message around France , whether issued by the state or private interests , were mobile , ephemeral , and multiple . Despite the revolutionary desire for permanent monuments equal to those of Rome or Greece , it was assignats , passports , games , caricatures , certificates , posters , souvenirs , clothing , and engravingsprecisely the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest role in transmitting visually the message of the Revolution , although not always in ways that were readily understood or easily managed by either their producers or their multiple consumers . Added to these were the rituals , performances , and impromptu spaces of display , exchange , and forgery , which were even more provisional in nature . As thestory of Palloys box on the site of the Bastille shows , the visual culture of the Revolution could at various points provide the bedrock for the historical imagination of the Revolution and at the same time be subject to radical and regular revision . <p> It is a central claim of this book that the temporary character of much of the Revolutions material culture is not best understood as a sign of the failure of revolutionaries to produce images and objects of lasting importance . On the contrary , it points to a dynamic , contradictory process of experimentation that had profound implications for how revolutionaries became constructed as political subjects . Widely reproduced , ephemeral , " in-between " images and objects made during the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of both individual subjectivities and wider national or political community identities , and they were at the heart of debates on the nature of political authenticity and historical memory . Usually , of course , permanence was the desired outcome , of both revolutionary politics and visual productionwitness the enthusiasm for a monument at the Bastille . However , the means by which permanence could be achieved were not straightforward and were regularly undermined by material , economic , and political constraints . As provisional images began to lose their meaning or value , or were recycled , destroyed , sequestered , or decommissioned , revolutionaries ( and those with alternative political affiliations ) were forced to think tactically about corporeal , political , and material legitimacy and , in so doing , to consider their relationship to the new ways of understanding time initiated by the Revolution . Thinking about material durability was one of the key ways in which revolutionaries thought about duration , and it was consequently crucial to how they imagined the place of the Revolution in history . <p> In short , provisional images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active role in shaping their world . Many of these works were explicitly " useful " objects , made for functional rather than overtly aesthetic ends . Operating in the here and now of the political present , some were necessarily conceived as flexible and evolving , a means to an end , while others came to be considered provisional only after their passing . These images and objects , most of which were produced in quantity , were often made in full consciousness of their status as commodities . The currency of these works , which was , in many cases , inseparable from their status as currency , resided too in their ability to circulateas reproduced items that could be owned , transmitted , or viewed by a critical mass of individuals and in their potential to operate as mediums of both change and exchange . <p> Rather than provide a comprehensive inventory of revolutionary visual culture or long-since-vanished objects ( an impossible task in any case ) , The Politics of the Provisional is an attempt to assess critically the visual politics of revolutionary France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct and conflicting themes within the political and visual culture of the period , interrogating an archive that is layered , heterogeneous , and contradictory . For reasons of coherence I have concentrated for the most part on images produced in Paris , where the majority of existing images were produced , sold , or legislated for ; although at several points this has been neither possible nor desirable , and I am conscious that Paris does not stand for the Revolution as a whole . While ordered thematically rather than chronologically , the book focuses on a conventional " revolutionary decade " from 1789 to 1799 , with some porosity at either end , yet it goes without saying that the narrow historical frame provided by conventions of date limitation is , while seductive , potentially misleading . This is all the more apparent in the context of a temporally complex process such as the French Revolution , whose origins are found long before the storming of the Bastille and whose significance expands well beyond it . <p> Despite the claims made for them by revolutionaries , almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier in the eighteenth century , if not before . Few scholars would now subscribe to a reading of the French Revolution as a rupture so absolute that it obliterated all signs of the recent past , and I certainly do not wish to lay claim to a reading of the Revolution as a fully autonomous , coherent historical unit . Rather , the question of how revolutionaries dealt with continuities , both from the previous regime and from earlier moments in the history of the Revolution , is at the core of this book . However , alongside these broader historical shifts , it is essential that we acknowledge the specific temporalities of the works under discussion . Material objects are complex things that have histories of their own . Even the most transient , fragile objects tend to stick around for some time . In factand this paradox is at the heart of any analysis of the " ephemeral " these objects that fall apart or are destroyed in great numbers often turn out to be as durable as their ostensibly more secure counterparts , for they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In many cases , the objects I discussmoney , identity documents , and festivals , for instanceall became more formalized in the Napoleonic period than during the First Republic , increasing in worldwide importance with the rise of industrial capitalism and the nineteenth centurys cycle of revolutions . None of this would have been possible , however , without the first French Revolutions eagerness to " regenerate " its symbolic language and all areas of administration , art , and ritual . Producers of revolutionary images may have drawn upon long-standing visual traditions when making their works , but that does not mean these images were mere recapitulations of all that had gone before . Continuities yes , but ruptures too . Paper money may have preceded the Revolution , but the assignatwas something quite new . A long tradition of royal and religious festivals undoubtedly informed revolutionary festivals , but not one of them commemorated a revolution . Ex-votos and relics were medieval in origin , but Palloys Bastille relics were singular to their historical moment . Almost every culture in history has had its fair share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in France in the 1790s they took on a heightened significance as the very substance of the Revolution . As much as any artwork , these objects deserve examination in the historically specific context of their production and use . <p> While the provisional has been frequently taken to stand for the degraded ephemerality of the Ancien RTgimenot least during the Revolution itselfsince the early nineteenth century it has also signified the effervescent transience of a modernity the Revolution arguably brought to realization . Over a decade before Victor Hugos fictional description of how " in the provisional France made the eternal , " Charles Baudelaire had conceptualized modernity , in his famous essay on Constantin Guys , as " the transitory , the fugitive , the contingent , the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable . " Baudelaire began this essay with a reflection on how the work of Philibert-Louis Debucourt , an artist discussed at length in chapter 5 , was particular to its historical moment . By 1863 Debucourts work was interesting to Baudelaire precisely because of its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its " essential quality of being present . " Yet although the dialectical character of modernity that Baudelaire outlined certainly seems to speak to the works under discussion here , we have good reason to be cautious of simplistic readings of the Revolutions modernity . Indeed , it is crucial to recognize that , despite a widespread contemporary recognition of the Revolutions unprecedented breach with the past , its aftereffects were often not anticipated by those responsible for it , newly politicized subjects whose expectations , ideas , and forms of expression were those of the eighteenth century . Nonetheless , the Revolution did transform inexorably the relation between made things and the political field , not least because , as Richard Wrigley has astutely observed in his study of revolutionary dress , it marked an ill-defined crossroads between a world where nothing was thrown away and a world of modern consumerism where obsolescence , transience , and disposal were intrinsic to the status of the object . <p> Consequently , each chapter of this book figures as a conjuncture where a set of images comes into focus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , in many cases , the very excess of these images has paradoxically limited their visibility as objects of study . Received as either functional objects outside the terrain of " art " or as art objects that address transient subject matter , these images are susceptible to a banal marginalization as " ephemera . " Yet these normative , unitary categories of " revolutionary visual culture " or " ephemeral art " have failed to account for the interactions between such forms of representation and other more established media and genres , from Academic history painting to sculpture or architecture . Moreover , as indexes of a political field that was itself far from stable , these images remind us too that binary separations between " revolutionary " and " counterrevolutionary " image making are limited in their usefulness , as such positions were far from fixed and were the product of processes of struggle and appropriation between politically varied and inharmonious groups . This book works from an assumption that any history of revolutionary visual culture demands a reading of counterrevolutionary visual production , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is at stake here is a politics of the provisional that is less about tracking shifting allegiances on a neat spectrum between royalist and Jacobin than it is about visuality itself as a form of political praxis . Despite the ostensible marginality of much of the material dealt with here , many of the images in the chapters that follow were produced by the state or were images that responded to or reflected administrative transformations of the political structure . Recognizing the power dynamics and genre hierarchies of so-called ephemeral works allows us to complicate notions of " high " and " low " in artistic practice . However , the reception of such images was neither straightforward nor uncontested . While the production of images in large quantities by the revolutionary legislature gives us a good idea of what successive governments desired to make known or change in the French people , at points it also allows us access to how people responded to the revolutionary state and what they recognized or subverted in the images made in their name . Forging and folding , attaching and adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies by which citizens could transform the function and appearance of the images and objects they encountered . Carefully scratching the ink away from the paper of a letterhead to reflect a change in political authorityin one example , issued at Nevers in messidor year III , " la mort " has been replaced by " la justice , " while " imperisable " has been crossed out altogether ( fig. 3 ) may have prolonged the existence and utility of the document , but it also exposed how works could change over time and recorded the interaction between individuals and images . By engaging with visual culture , public spectacles , private entertainments , or state bureaucracy , revolutionaries of all convictions situated themselves in relation to revolutionary politics . This had a historical dimension that was apparent from the start of the Revolution but that intensified as it progressed and that exceeded the boundaries of France itself , as colonial subjects also occupied a critical stance with regard to the images and objects of the metropolitan Revolution . <p> It is perhaps unsurprising then that historians have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art historians have been to engage with this diverse body of material , although their focus has for the most part leaned toward printed images representing prominent revolutionary episodes or symbols . There has also been a tendency among some historians to use images as illustrations of event- or value-based narratives rather than addressing the role of images in the construction of those narratives . However , Lynn Hunt , writing in a fall 2009 issue of French Historical Studies that reflected on the state of revolutionary studies twenty years on from the bicentennial ( a time when many important publications and exhibitions appeared ) , argues that the study of images may be one of the most productive future directions in French revolutionary studies , as it might provide us with ways of understanding how " people came quite literally to see the world differently . " In particular , Hunt suggests we develop new ways of thinking about subjectivity and the social through the examination of multiple rather than individual images . With that in mind , this book attempts to provide a set of criteria for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it represented into issues of how it represented and what that representation made possible ( or impossible ) . In doing so , this book necessarily casts a wider net than the printed material that has been the primary focus of much important work conducted by scholars including Hunt , Claudette Hould , Joan Landes , Rolf Reichardt , and Hubertus Kohle , arguing instead that the precariousness of representation in revolutionary France was constituted on an intermedial field of exchange between a range of different kinds of objects and images . <p> The book begins with an analysis of the revolutionary assignat . A bond based on the value of " reclaimed " clerical land , the assignat operated as a national currency until 1796 . Situating the assignatagainst other forms of visual production , from caricature to history painting , as well as the counterfeits that challenged its authority , I examine how the materiality of the paper notes proved a testing ground for the authenticity of other kinds of representation . Considerations of this sort had an effect on subjects as well as objects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their printed papers . Focusing on passports , certificates , and other documents , I investigate the ways in which they articulated belonging and exclusion , often understood in terms of evolving racial , gendered , or class-based typologies . <p> The theme of mobility is developed further in chapters 3 and 4 , which also explore differences between provisionality in two or three dimensions . Chapter 3 examines prints representing the first Festival of the Federation , held in Paris on 14 July 1790 . Printed images provided a means of negotiating the problematic destruction or recommissioning of the ephemeral structures erected for the festival and a way of rendering permanent the performative , mobile aspect of the event . Chapter 4 focuses on Palloys transformation of the ruins of the Bastille , in particular his production of souvenir objects recast in the shape of the prison . These troubling objects engage head-on with the issue of revolutionary time , the subject of chapter 5 , which concentrates on revolutionary calendars and almanacs , in particular a single color print by Philibert-Louis Debucourt . Chapter 6 returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the aftermath of the notes destruction in 1796 , many of which contained hidden silhouette profiles of the executed royal family or prominent revolutionaries in the negative space surrounding other objects . I argue that these images , which track a history of the Revolution through its paper traces , are a response to revolutionary trauma , and consider how motifs of ruin , chance , and dissimulation permeated postrevolutionary discourse . <p> The final two chapters engage most explicitly with processes of historical imagining and recollection , prediction and recall , and are characterized by an effacement of these differences in trompe loeil and other illusionistic techniques , where the blurring of material and temporal boundaries organized both the promise of a revolution to come ( Debucourts Almanach national in 1790 ) and the remembrance of a revolution past ( the representation of assignatsin 1796 and 1804 ) . Images such as these demonstrate the extent to which past , present , and future were not mutually exclusive categories in 1790s France but frequently intersected with one another and often did so within the same image . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonistic positions , examining how , short on time and money , revolutionary artists and legislators developed ad hoc , tactical forms of provisional representation that provided new ways of imagining and performing political agency . The Revolutions evident historical tensions can illuminate our understanding of revolutionary visual culture , but this visual culture also sheds light on the historical process itself . In looking at how the people of the Revolution " saw things , " we have often ignored the objects that made them most aware , on a daily basis , of the ambiguities presented by the visual and of their own precarious positions as spectators . Thinking seriously about revolutionary visual culture demands that we engage with the rich variety of things made to be seen that did not explicitly reference locatable , identifiable revolutionary events and themes , providing comfortable " illustration " for the historical narrative , but that we think too about the contingent , the multiple , the marginal , and the central , the nonfigurative , nonart , nonrevolutionary . How , we must ask , did authentic " revolutionariness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual culture , in its broadest sense , implicated in what it meant to be " postrevolutionary , " as far as such a term may be thought to be meaningful ? In revolutionary France , we know , everything was rethoughtviewed through the lens of the Revolution , all aspects of life were reimagined , and even familiar objects and practices acquired new resonances . Given this temporal ( not to mention political ) instability , how could revolutionaries tell the difference between what was " true " and what was " false " ? <p> Authenticity and its close counterpart , transparency , became terms of increasing significance for people , ideas , and things in 1790s France , although their meanings were far from stable , for they required recourse to criteria , inherited from the past , that were no longer available or useful . Reproductive media in particularbut not only printsworked to broker the relationship between the past , present , and future , securing the authority of new concepts and practices in some instances and challenging them elsewhere . These images and objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their unfixed relationship to a single standard of legitimacy , soon became so much outmoded , curious debris , yet they materialized the radical reformulation of time the Revolution had engendered and pointed toward new ways of imagining the future .

" Scott Paul Gordon , Lehigh University <p> " In this fascinating study , Paul Peucker offers the first book-length treatment of a period of crisis in the Moravian community in the late 1740s , known as the Sifting Time .

Features such as blood-and-wounds theology , as well as anything unusual or unorthodox , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on archival research and a close reading of Zinzendorfs letter of reprimand in February 1749 and the writings of other Moravian leaders .

It was marked by the belief that union with Christ could be experienced during sexual intercourse , both within and outside of marriage . Peucker argues that the Sifting was the catalyst for Moravians in later decades to turn away from more radical beliefs and practices towards conservative , mainstream Protestantism .

Their leader , Christian Renatus von Zinzendorf , son of the leader of this new controversial international religious movement , gathered the men in the chapel where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they to consider themselves men but from then on they would all pass as " sisters . " The following day Christel , as most Moravians affectionately called him , together with his fellow elder , Joachim Rubusch , went to nearby Marienborn , seat of the churchs theological seminary , and repeated the ceremony with the single men present there . What followed was a scandal that prompted Count Zinzendorf to intervene when he learned about it , causing great embarrassment among many in the church . <p> Even though three independent sources for the gender-changing ceremony exist , this event has not been discussed in any studies of eighteenth-century religion . The happenings of December 6 and 7 , 1748 , however , form a crucial moment in the history of the Moravian Church . Examining the developments leading up to the events as well as the reactions that soon followed will give us a good understanding not only of the Moravian movement but also of the vitality and diversity of Christian religion in the Atlantic world of the eighteenth century . When declaring the men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers theology relating to bridal mysticism , salvation , the Lutheran understanding of justification by faith , ideas on gender roles and gender identity , the ideal of imitatio Dei , sexuality , and eschatological expectations . <p> The gender-changing ceremony of 1748 was the most dramatic , and to many Moravians at the time , the most disturbing aspect of a crisis in the church that Moravians called a time of sifting . During the 1750s Moravians began to speak about a crisis that had recently occurred within their communities . They called this crisis a time of " Sifting , " believing the strength of their faith had been tested by Satan : " And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat " ( Luke 22:31 ) . This idea of a Sifting occurring in the 1740s shaped later Moravian historiography , but no one has given a suitable definition or description of this Sifting Time . <p> I will argue that this so-called Sifting Time was a culmination of Moravian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of Lutheran theology with its emphasis on justification by faith alone , of bridal mysticism , and of traditional passion symbolism . It was also a reaction against the austere Pietism of the time , resulting in provocative playfulness . At the end of the 1740s these elements , combined with the belief that the union with Christ could be experienced during sexual intercourse , culminated in antinomianism and perfectionism . The actual Sifting occurred when Moravians began to believe that the union with Christ could be experienced not only during marital intercourse but during extramarital sex as well . This undermined notions of marriage as a sacred bond that lay at the core of Moravian theology . The crisis revealed deficiencies of Moravian teaching and eventually led to a transformation of Moravian piety . After Zinzendorf 's death in 1760 Moravians were faced with a chaotic situation left behind by their leader : they were under attack from Lutheran and other Protestants opponents and they were faced with internal turmoil , caused by Zinzendorf 's lack of leadership as the crisis of the Sifting peaked and by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis . In the end , Moravians distanced themselves from any radical elements in their teaching and adapted to more generally accepted forms of Protestantism . <p> The main geographical focus of this study will be the community of Herrnhaag , the Moravian center of the 1740s located north of Frankfurt am Main , but the geographical spread of ideas and practices connected to the Sifting extended far beyond Herrnhaag . Most of all , the crisis of the Sifting Time was connected to eighteenth-century ideas on religion and sexuality . <p> &lt;1&gt;Religion and Sexuality <p> The history of sexuality has become an important field of study during the past few decades . Whereas in 1997 the study of religion and sexuality could still be called " an underdeveloped area of research , " historians have since worked to fill this gap . Among scholars of Pietism as well , interest for questions of sexuality and marriage has increased in recent years . Religion had great influence on matters of sexuality , and Christian ideas and institutions shaped sexual attitudes . Religious concepts such as original sin , purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality and religious leaders attempted to control the sexual lives of their followers . But sexuality also influenced religion : around the turn of the eighteenth century several religious people and communities separated from the established church because of the issue of sexuality . <p> Marriage and sexuality were central issues among early modern Protestants . A. G. Roeber draws attention to the debate among Protestants about the nature of marriage : is marriage a legal bond that asserts the authority of men as heads of the household , or is it a partnership in which husband and wife together pursue the ideal of holiness , reflecting the relationship of Christ with the church ? Luther as well as Spener tended to see marriage as the latter while other theologians , among them Pietist leader August Hermann Francke , rejected the " quasi-sacramental friendship marriage . " Willi Temme has pointed out that around the turn of the eighteenth century many Pietists raised questions regarding marriage , gender , physicality , and sexuality . For many , these questions were pressing problems , solved in diverse ways . Traditionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which original sin passed from one generation to another . The question therefore was : if sexual lust was sinful , how could sexual intercourse be acceptable ? For most Protestants of the Reformation as well as for most non-separatist Pietists the purpose of sex within marriage was procreation and was consequently sanctified . <p> Many radical Pietists did not accept such reasoning . For them , sex remained sinful , be it within or outside marriage . Some radical Pietists had high regard for the so-called virginal marriages in which both partners abstained from sex by mutual agreement . Others , such as Johann Georg Gichtel in the Netherlands or Conrad Beissel in Pennsylvania , taught strict celibacy because they believed the truly converted should not defile themselves with sex . Gottfried Arnold , who in his earlier works promoted celibacy , did not find much sympathy among his former admirers when he married in 1701 , seemingly abandoning his earlier ideals of purity . Some groups , in fact , believed sexuality could be cleared from any sinfulness . Followers of Eva von Buttlar , united in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from earthly desire . As such they could " blend " together with the body of Christ while having sexual intercourse among each other . Similar ideas about sinlessness and perfectionism existed among Moravians during the late 1740s . <p> Sexuality was a principal matter among eighteenth-century Moravians . Like other radical Pietists , Zinzendorf had struggled with the question if a true Christian could get married or not . It has been suggested that Zinzendorf was influenced by the ideas of Ernst Christoph Hochmann von Hochenau on marriage . In the discussion whether marriage was a legal institution or a holy bond , Hochmann distinguished between the marriage of ordinary ( unconverted ) people and true Christians . Hochmann believed secular people did not need to have their marriage legitimized by the church ; he thought a strictly secular performance of their marriages sufficient . Church weddings should be reserved to Christian believers whose bond was to be a reflection of the love of Christ for the church . A higher degree of marriage , according to Hochmann , were the " virginal marriages " for true Christians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest degree of marriage for Hochmann was celibacy , where the individual believer was betrothed to Jesus . <p> Zinzendorf came to the conclusion that a Christian was able to marry . He agreed with the radical Pietists that lust by definition was sinful , even within marriage . His solution , however , was not to abstain from sex but to remove lust from sexual intercourse . When sex was performed without lust it was not merely acceptable , but sex became a divine , sacramental act . Zinzendorf taught his followers to have sex without lust during which they were able to experience the union with Christ . Zinzendorfs teachings on marriage , especially his concept of sexual intercourse between husband and wife as a sacrament , placed the Moravians in the center of the ongoing Protestant discussion on marriage . Eventually , these same teachings , as I will argue , resulted in the crisis of the Sifting Time when Moravians began to celebrate the bond between Christ and the church outside of sanctioned , marital relationships . The Sifting Time was a crisis relating to questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Moravian Church began as a small group of refugees and descendants of the old Unitas Fratrum settled on the estate of Nikolaus Ludwig Count Zinzendorf in eastern Saxony , founding the community of Herrnhut in 1722 . The count was not only their secular lord but also the spiritual leader of the movement that emanated from the Herrnhut community . Awakened Christians from various parts of Germany and beyond joined the Herrnhuters and founded new communities on the European continent , in Britain and in North America . Missionaries went out to the slaves in the Caribbean , to the Inuit in Greenland and Labrador , to various tribes in Africa and to non-Christian nations in the East . The Moravians claimed to be a continuation of the ancient Unitas Fratrum or Unity of the Brethren , a pre-reformation protestant church in Bohemia that had suffered under severe persecution during the seventeenth century . In fact , in 1749 British Parliament passed an act in which this claim was acknowledged .

Whereas eighteenth-century Methodism was predominantly an Anglo-American movement , Moravianism attracted Germans , Scandinavians , English , Dutch , Caribbean slaves , American Indians , Balts , as well as the odd Italian , Persian , and Frenchman . <p> In recent years , historians have studied many aspects of the eighteenth-century Moravians such as art , education , music , sexuality , autobiographies , theology , linguistics , cross-cultural exchanges and transatlantic economics . Many of these studies imply that Moravians had a " dark side , " a period of crisis when things got out of hand , during which the use of bizarre and repulsive language alienated previous sympathizers . Moravians during the eighteenth century called this period of crisis the Sifting Time . <p> The Sifting Time is primarily a historiographical construct , invented by contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the meaning of the historical category Sifting Time changed and shifted . As later historians were unaware of what this crisis had exactly entailed , they began filling the term with their own interpretation of anything unorthodox and out of the ordinary found in the records . The further away an observer stood from the original crisis , the longer and more comprehensive he or she considered the Sifting Time to have been . In chapter two we will look at how historians in the past have treated the Sifting Time . <p> The Sifting Time is the topic of this book . What was the Sifting Time and why did Moravians perceive it as a crisis ? What role did the concept of a Sifting Time play in the development of Moravian self identity and historiography ? How do the ideas and practices of the Sifting Time relate to other religious groups of the time ? The study of this relatively short crisis will touch upon questions of gender , masculinity , marriage , sexuality and religion in the eighteenth century . We will examine the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of mysticism on a transatlantic movement during an age before national-confessional cultures dominated the stage . Examining the nature of the Sifting Time will help us get a better understanding of the vitality and inventiveness of religion during the eighteenth century . <p> Whereas most historical narratives on the Moravians include the Sifting Time , the exact nature of the Sifting remains vague . A general sense of embarrassment discouraged early Moravian historians from describing the precise character of the crisis and led them to discard any archival evidence that documented the crisis . Because many relevant records were destroyed , later generations of historians were faced with the problem that it became increasingly difficult to define the Sifting Time . Thus , the Sifting Time evolved from a taboo subject into an unsolved mystery of Moravian historiography . This is the subject of chapter two . Often the Sifting Time has been interpreted as a period defined by an excessive focus on the blood and wounds of Christ . Such interpretation can hardly suffice . If the Sifting Time was really about intensive blood-and-wounds language , exuberant festivities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moravian leaders so severe ? The strong rejection of the Sifting Time must have been connected to something larger than what we previously thought the Sifting Time to be . A mistake of many previous interpretations was , by lack of adequate source material , to infer that anything unusual and unorthodox during the 1740s was an element of the Sifting Time . <p> In 1996 Craig Atwood argued that in order to understand the Sifting Time one must study how contemporaries defined the Sifting Time . Atwood was able to demonstrate that " those aspects of the theology and piety of Zinzendorf and the Brndergemeine in the mid-eighteenth-century which later scholars have considered the essence of the Sifting Time are almost absent from Zinzendorfs rebuke to the community . " Consequently , blood-and-wounds theology , the adoration of the Holy Spirit as Mother , the language of the Litany of the Wounds , or an " over-emphasis on religious devotion " are not particular aspects of the Sifting Time but should be considered general characteristics of Moravian piety in the eighteenth century . This book will follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1740s contemporaries found so disturbing that they perceived them as a crisis . We will consider texts by contemporaries and examine how they defined the crisis . Based on a close reading of these descriptions and statements we will look at the preceding years and analyze how the crisis developed . It will be important to place the ideas of the Sifting Time in the context of other religious traditions . By finding an answer to the question what the Moravian Sifting Time entailed , we will gain better insight into the Moravian movement of the eighteenth century and how it adapted to notions of reasonable religion and to changing gender roles . <p> In order to gain an understanding of the Sifting Time we will lay out the chronology of events in chapter three , from the moment Moravians realized something had gone wrong , to the issuing of Zinzendorfs letter that defined the crisis , and finally to dealing with the crisis . This chapter will also discuss the terminology used to describe the crisis and consider the question how the crisis should be dated . The crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By writing his letter of reprimand in February of 1749 , Zinzendorf publicly admitted something had gone wrong . Based on Zinzendorfs letter of reprimand and other contemporary texts looking back on the crisis I will attempt to detail and explain the various elements that Zinzendorf and his contemporaries believed defined the crisis . Chapter four will begin to lay out these aspects , although a full understanding of the crisis can not occur until chapter six . <p> Before turning to the height of the crisis , we will pause to examine the hymns that were used during the late 1740s . Some of these hymns were never published but rather distributed in handwritten hymnbooks that were destroyed after the nature of the crisis had been revealed . Songs played an essential role in Moravian life and worship ; these hymns and their connection to bridal mysticism will be analyzed in chapter five . The actual crisis will be discussed in chapter six where we will try to discern what the Sifting Time comprised , and why this crisis was considered so scandalous that most related records were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crisis : how did the church react to the crisis ? Just dealing with the Sifting Time and its immediate aftermath would only be half of the story . The transformation of the Moravian Church during the second half of the eighteenth century is a consequence of the crisis of the late 1740s , as I will argue . The Sifting Time caused the Moravian Church to radically change course and to become a non-controversial mainline church , closely related to the official German Protestant churches ( Landeskirchen ) but with obvious Pietist leanings and with a separate identity . <p> Because so many records were intentionally destroyed , the nature of the Sifting Time became obscured . Moravians have taken great effort to eliminate evidence relating to this time of crisis , thereby turning the Sifting Time into an enigma . Eventually , the Sifting became the Moravians best kept secret . In a final chapter we will discuss Moravian record keeping , the symbolic role archives played for Moravians , and how Moravians constructed their history by consciously collecting as well as by purposely destroying historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how these resources were able to provide an understanding of the Sifting . <p> The crisis of the Sifting Time was a defining moment in the history of the Moravians . It was the culmination of Moravian piety of the late 1730s and 1740s , and its aftermath determined the development of the church for many decades . In order to fully understand the Moravian movement during the period of its fast expansion , developing from a local phenomenon ( Herrnhut ) into a worldwide religious network , we need to study the Sifting . This study wants to seriously consider the theology and practices of the 1740s rather than dismissing them as nonsense or aberrant theology . The piety of the 1740s needs to be studied in its own right : what characterized Moravian piety during the late 1740s and how is that to be understood ? Studying these years will also give us better understanding of Zinzendorf himself . We will see that the idea of a Sifting Time later served as a historiographical construct to either alienate Zinzendorf from the " true " Moravian Church or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional understanding of the Sifting Time has " in fact distorted our understanding of the entire Zinzendorfian era and the evolution of Moravian theology and piety . " <p> At the same time , the Sifting Time was an expression of eighteenth-century Christianity . Thousands of people , Europeans and non-Europeans alike , were attracted to the Moravians during the late 1740s and many of them , to varying degrees , participated in what we would now label as aspects of the Sifting Time . This implies that the Sifting Time is very much part of eighteenth-century Christianity . This is not a German story but rather a European and even a Transatlantic story : European religion manifested in the Atlantic world . <p> Zinzendorfs theology was perhaps not as unusual for eighteenth-century Europeans as is sometimes implied . The Moravians were one example of radical Christian social experimentation . Other groups , such as the Shakers , the Inspired , the Society of Mother Eva , the French Prophets , or Beissels community at Ephratato name but a fewpracticed similar unconventional ideas but they did not leave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their tradition of detailed record-keeping , provide a unique nuanced perspective on radical religion in the period of the Enlightenment . <p> Additional reasons for studying the Sifting Time are the resulting consequences and what it tells us about the transformation of radical religious movements over time . The Sifting Time is an important chapter in the history of the Moravian Church as it developed from a radical-Pietist group into a non-controversial evangelical group . Traditionally , Moravians have presented the Sifting Time as a period of aberration , a short but exceptional phase that was sometimes not even worthy of mentioning . Supposedly , after the Sifting Time , the church regained its true calling . I will argue instead that the Sifting Time was a crucial period in the development of the Moravian Church in the eighteenth century . It was the culmination of developments that began early in its history . At the same time , for many contemporaries inside the church the Sifting was also proof that certain aspects of Zinzendorfs theology and practice had undesirable consequences . <p> The phantom of their recent history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century . The fear for anything out of the ordinary and the desire to turn to the safety of mainstream Protestantism led to the conservatism of the second half of the eighteenth century . As a consequence , Moravians revisited their theology regarding marriage . From a sacramental act intended to experience the union of the believer with the Divine , Moravian marriage became a much more conventional institution . Without the Sifting Time Moravian leaders would not have changed their course so radically . We can not understand the Moravian Church of the second half of the eighteenth century without understanding the effects of the Sifting Time . Nor can we understand Moravian piety and practice of the first decades of the eighteenth century from the perspective of the second half . <p> &lt;1&gt;The Moravians within the Context of Radical Pietism <p> The Moravians were the most successful group brought forth by radical Pietism . Usually , the main criterion for radical Pietism is their separation from the established church , as opposed to the ecclesiastical Pietists who remained within the church . The term is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of established groups within radical Pietism a new phenomenon in the eighteenth century . Examples of other groups that separated from the church and organized their own independent societies include the seventeenth-century Labadists , the Society of Mother Eve , the Schwarzenau Brethren , and the Inspirationists . Although the two latter groups still exist in the United States , they never reached the size and spread of the Moravians within only a few decades of their origin . <p> Zinzendorf and his followers would not have agreed with either qualification : they distanced themselves from the ecclesiastical Pietists of Halle at an early time , and they categorically denied any separatist intention . However , from its beginning , the community at Herrnhut developed its own organization and held its own church meetings , independent from the parish church of Berthelsdorf to which Herrnhut officially belonged . Zinzendorf and the Moravians disguised their separatist intentions by using the mantle of being an ancient pre-Reformation church , the Unity of Brethren or Unitas Fratrum ; as such , they gained official recognition from various European governments . <p> Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneider and Wallmann consider Philadelphian ideas as the binding element of radical Pietism . Shantz lists several additional common features : the language of personal and cosmic renewal as found in the works of Jakob Bhme and Johann Arndt ; a migratory lifestyle ; an eclectic way of drawing from other traditions such as Lutheranism , mysticism , and alchemy ; downplaying the importance of confessional differences ; the role of women ; and the ideal of forming communities of true Christians . Some groups had charismatic leaders whom they considered divinely inspired . In his fourfold typology of radical Pietism , Shantz places the Moravians under the category of the " sect model . " <p> Moravians have not always been recognized as a radical-Pietist group ; sometimes they have been treated as its own form of ( ecclesial ) Pietism . There are two reasons for this . First of all , Zinzendorf and the Moravians deliberately avoided the impression of separatism . They insisted their community was the continuation of the ancient Unity of Brethren . In addition , Zinzendorf tried his best to place his movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moravianism as its own form of Pietism and not so much as a radical Pietist group is the fact that during the last decades of the eighteenth century the Moravians explicitly distanced themselves from their radical past . This reinvented , non-enthusiastic identity of the Moravians has somehow distorted the view of their earlier history . From this perspective , certain aspects of Moravian theology and practice during the first half of the eighteenth century were simply overlooked , ignored , or dismissed as premature aberrations that were not important in the long run . In this view the historiographical concept of a Sifting Time as a ( brief ) period of deviation made it possible to conveniently group anything unconventional as a feature of the Sifting Time . This study will focus on some of these unconventional aspects of Moravian piety . <p> As Shantz has recently pointed out in his study of German Pietism , there has been a shift in the historiography of Pietism . For most of the twentieth century , historians have downplayed mystical and radical influences in Pietism and emphasized the Lutheran roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radical Pietism has thrived . New studies have been published on groups like the Ephrata community , the Schwarzenau Brethren , and the Mother Eva Society . A similar shift can be seen in Moravian studies . Scholars of Moravian history have become more interested in questions of gender , sexuality , the role of mysticism , and the less conventional aspects of Zinzendorfs theology . The works of authors like Hans Schneider , Craig Atwood , Katherine Faull , Beverly Smaby , Aaron Fogleman , Peter Vogt , Marsha Keith Schuchard , and , most recently , Seth Moglen , and Derrick Miller have to be mentioned in this context . <p> This is a study about Zinzendorfs theology and how it was received by his followers . Zinzendorfs theology was authoritative and dominant among Moravians but his followers developed his ideas further and sometimes came to conclusions that revealed undesired consequences . The Sifting Time was the logical consequence of Zinzendorfs teachings . The relationship between Zinzendorf and his followers began on his estate during the 1720s.

You will find compiled therein the " classics " of modern philosophy . Since these texts are often designed for use in undergraduate classes , the editor is likely to offer an introduction in which the reader is informed that these selections represent the perennial questions of philosophy . The student is to assume that she or he is about to explore the timeless wisdom of the greatest minds of Western philosophy . No one calls attention to the fact that the philosophers are all men . <p> Though women are omitted from the canons of philosophy , these texts inscribe the nature of woman . Sometimes the philosopher speaks directly about woman , delineating her proper role , her abilities and inabilities , her desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at womens emotionality , irrationality , unreliability . <p> This process of definition occurs in far more subtle ways when the central concepts of philosophyreason and justice , those characteristics that are taken to define us as humanare associated with traits historically identified with masculinity . If the " man " of reason must learn to control or overcome traits identified as femininethe body , the emotions , the passionsthen the realm of rationality will be one reserved primarily for men , with grudging entrance to those few women who are capable of transcending their femininity . <p> Feminist philosophers have begun to look critically at the canonized texts of philosophy and have concluded that the discourses of philosophy are not gender-neutral . Philosophical narratives do not offer a universal perspective , but rather privilege some experiences and beliefs over others . These experiences and beliefs permeate all philosophical theories whether they be aesthetic or epistemological , moral or metaphysical . Yet this fact has often been neglected by those studying the traditions of philosophy . Given the history of canon formation in Western philosophy , the perspective most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , to be fully aware of the impact of gender biases , it is imperative that we re-read the canon with attention to the ways in which philosophers assumptions concerning gender are embedded within their theories . <p> This new series , Re-reading the Canon , is designed to foster this process of reevaluation . Each volume will offer feminist analyses of the theories of a selected philosopher . Since feminist philosophy is not monolithic in method or content , the essays are also selected to illustrate the variety of perspectives within feminist criticism and highlight some of the controversies within feminist scholarship . <p> In this series , feminist lenses will be focused on the canonical texts of Western philosophy , both those authors who have been part of the traditional canon , and those philosophers whose writings have more recently gained attention within the philosophical community . A glance at the list of volumes in the series will reveal an immediate gender bias of the canon : Arendt , Aristotle , Beauvoir , Derrida , Descartes , Foucault , Hegel , Hume , Kant , Locke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wittgenstein , Wollstonecraft . There are all too few women included , and those few who do appear have been added only recently . In creating this series , it is not my intention to rectify the current canon of philosophical thought . What is and is not included within the canon during a particular historical period is a result of many factors . Although no canonization of texts will include all philosophers , no canonization of texts that excludes all but a few women can offer an accurate representation of the history of the discipline , as women have been philosophers since the ancient period . <p> I share with many feminist philosophers and other philosophers writing from the margins of philosophy the concern that the current canonization of philosophy be transformed . Although I do not accept the position that the current canon has been formed exclusively by power relations , I do believe that this canon represents only a selective history of the tradition . I share the view of Michael BTrubT that " canons are at once the location , the index , and the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemonic formation , they must be continually reproduced anew and are continually contested . " <p> The process of canon transformation will require the recovery of " lost " texts and a careful examination of the reasons such voices have been silenced . Along with the process of uncovering womens philosophical history , we must also begin to analyze the impact of gender ideologies upon the process of canonization . This process of recovery and examination must occur in conjunction with careful attention to the concept of a canon of authorized texts . Are we to dispense with the notion of a tradition of excellence embodied in a canon of authorized texts ? Or , rather than abandon the whole idea of a canon , do we instead encourage a reconstruction of a canon of those texts that inform a common culture ? <p> This series is designed to contribute to this process of canon transformation by offering a re-reading of the current philosophical canon . Such a re-reading shifts our attention to the ways in which woman and the role of the feminine are constructed within the texts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us during this process of re-reading is whether a philosophers socially inherited prejudices concerning womans nature and role are independent of her or his larger philosophical framework .

It is my desire that this series reveal the importance of this type of critical reading . Paying attention to the workings of gender within the texts of philosophy will make visible the complexities of the inscription of gender ideologies.

Occasionally you can distinguish their faces , but they quickly leave your field of view , and often you can only get a quick glimpse of their shirts , their backpacks , or their hair . You struggle to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you zoom out until you can see the whole square at once , something will catch your eye . Suddenly you discern patterns of sound , of movement , and of stillness : patterns like the ululation of the chants , or the tendency of groups to form in some parts of the open square and not in others . Over time the constant alteration acquires a peculiar character . Some events occur regularly , and the movement in the city square may become something recognizable over a longer period . This " something recognizable " is not the unified people that the traditional conception seeks to capture . In fact , it is not even a unified thing , just as hurricanes , heat waves , and football matches are not unified things . Yet this something is just as real as a hurricane . When you consider time and change , you realize that a people does not originate when individuals merge into a bigger thing . Instead , a people arises when many actions and movements combine into novel patterns of change . For a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is about the people changing in time . I will argue that we should conceive of the people as a process rather than as an aggregation of individuals . Doing so , I argue , dissolves the problem of legitimizing rule democratically as the composition of the people changes . The people conceived as a process can be a source of democratic legitimacy that moors state institutions but is compatible with surprise and innovation . But before I discuss the people as process , let us step back and review the source of the problem I address : the thesis of popular sovereignty . <p> Popular Sovereignty <p> Popular sovereignty is the contention that the unified will of the people is the supreme authority in a state . Many political thinkers dislike this contention , and it is not difficult to see why . The idea that all individuals in a whole state could unify their wills is odd at best and dangerous at worst . Many a tyrant has abused this idea and committed atrocities in the name of the people . So it is not surprising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme authority is a dangerous idea , or that the unification of popular will is improbable , and maybe even impossible . Yet this odd and dangerous thesis prevails in the history of political thought . In fact , politicians and political thinkers have used it incessantly for at least two hundred years . So why has this implausible and risky idea survived in politics and political thinking for such a long time ? <p> You could argue that the thesis of popular sovereignty stays in circulation because of its rhetorical force . By evoking images of a unified people , the idea often persuades individuals to support a particular cause , leader , or government . Detractors of the thesis commonly argue that the will of the people can not be unified , and that no honest politician could use the concept with a straight face . In this view , crafty leaders manipulate nanve publics to believe that the leaders aim is the general will . But even if this were true , neither the innocence nor the ignorance of the public can explain why the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it recurs in political philosophy . Invoking the peoples will may bring cheers at a rally , but this alone can not sustain the idea of a unified will in philosophical arguments . Rhetorical power does not explain why the thesis appeals to philosophers and the public alike . Why , then , is the thesis so prevalent ? Why does it have such influence ? <p> The answer lies in a promise implicit in the thesiss traditional formulations : that of a good and just state . Those who employ popular sovereignty tacitly argue as follows : A state is good and just only when it guarantees individual freedom and equality , as well as social coordination . And this guarantee can be made good only when all individuals govern together or unanimously consent to rulethat is , when they all agree . They all agree when they recognize a true principle , obvious to reason , the recognition of which harmonizes all individual wills . The thesis of popular sovereignty presupposes this harmony and thus implicitly asserts that there exists a principle that harmonizes all wills through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this principle , we can have a state that is good and just . I believe this promise explains the resilience of the concept and the force of the image of " the people . " <p> The promise also explains why popular sovereignty is so problematic . For centuries politicians and writers have waved the flag of a unified and reasonable popular will in the rhetorical battle of liberty against tyranny . William Hazlitts prose is a model of this spirit and discourse : <p> Common interest and abstract reason taken together , as the test of the practical measures or general principles of Government , must be right , can not be wrong . It is an absurdity to suppose that there can be any better criterion of national grievances , or the proper remedies for them , than the aggregate amount of the actual , dear-bought experience , the honest feelings , and heart-felt wishes of a whole people , informed and directed by the greatest power of understanding in the community , unbiased by any sinister motive . Any standard of public good or ill must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitiated in principle , and fatal in its effects . <p> In Hazlitts text , the aggregated experiences , feelings , and wishes of the people directed by the " greatest power of understanding in the community " are what I call the " coincidence of popular will and reason " : the harmonization of all individual wills through a principle of reason . This harmonization unifies a people , and it may legitimize the state . This notion is powerful because it can legitimize rule , as well as political change in the guise of popular revolutionary movements . <p> In sum , this traditional conception views the people as the supreme authority in the community when popular will coincides with reason . But if you hold that only an actual coincidence of popular will and reason can legitimize rule , popular sovereignty remains an odd idea . Consensus rarely obtains among small groups , and it is unfeasible among large populations . As Locke wrote , unanimous mutual " consent is next impossible ever to be had . " If we ask ourselves where does popular sovereignty get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from actual unification , but rather from the promise of it . That is , popular sovereignty depends on the hypothetical coincidence of popular will and reason . Even Hazlitt , who seems to hold that the actual people can have a unified will , says that the people is unquestionably right only if the will of the people is led by " the greatest power of understanding in the community . " This condition implies that the people may not actually be unified , but if popular will coincided with reason it could unify . <p> This hypothetical view of popular sovereignty explains why the thesis prevails . Even when rulers commit abuses in the name of the people , a supporter of popular sovereignty could always argue that the abuse was not due to the idea but rather to its application . The people " can not be wrong , " the supporter could argue : what passed as popular will was simply an abuse or a failed attempt at achieving an ideal of unification . The real people could still legitimize the state some other time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because democratic rule does not require actual consensus : it is enough that state decisions are those that the people would make if they were unified . But how can we know what the unified people would decide ? According to the thesis of collective autonomy and hypothetical unification , you can know what the unified people would decide if you can discover a principle that every free and rational individual would agree with , under the appropriate conditions . All the people would necessarily agree to this principle because it guarantees both autonomy and social coordination . Since it would be universally agreed to , it is a principle for the hypothetical unification of the people . <p> Such a principle can ground the legitimacy of a democratic state without an actual consensus . Even without unanimity , some members of the community could deduce , from the principles of freedom and autonomy , norms and procedures for constituting a democracy . So hypothetical unification can ground the constitution of a legitimate representative democracy . If you argue for a hypothetical version of popular sovereignty , you assume there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such conditions might be access to education and other requisites for moral development , or the provision of complete information and time to deliberate . You also assume that there is no good reason to disagree with the principle if the appropriate conditions did obtain . The possibility of agreement is good enough to legitimize a constitutional democratic order . Of course , at this point the whole argument turns on how to determine the principle that grounds a constitutional democracy . This may explain why theories of democracy that emphasize principles , like John Rawlss contractualist theory of justice , are not concerned with the unification of the people . Instead , they concentrate on determining whether the principle that grants the possibility of agreement is morally adequate . <p> But determining the basic principle that justifies democracy can not itself legitimize a democratic state . Knowing that the people ought to agree does not establish that individuals would will to do so , and if they do not actively will their governments existence , their state can not be legitimate . Even hypothetical versions of popular sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence of will and reason at some point in the past or future . They may , on the one hand , displace the promise of unification to the past , as a reference to the original agreement that founded a democratic state . Constitutionalists , for instance , often use images of the past to legitimize the state . On the other hand , hypothetical theories displace the promise to the future as an ideal to be realized . An example comes from those theories that hold that a reasoned discussion , or deliberation , could produce agreement on principles of political morality . In short , theories of popular sovereignty sometimes posit popular unity in the future , and sometimes in the past , but they never demonstrate unification in the present , though they insist it must be there . <p> But how can you legitimize the state if the people is not unified at any given time ? The question of unification and its displacement in time uncovers a grave problem with profound consequences for the theory of democracy and political theory in general . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Indeterminacy of Popular Unification <p> The problem is this : how do you legitimize rule democratically as the peoples composition changes ? The problem arises from a condition for democratic legitimacy implicit in the thesis of popular sovereignty . This condition says that a state is legitimate only if those who are ruled consider that rule appropriate . But given that in a democratic state those who are ruled think rule is appropriate only when the body of the people accepts rule , the legitimacy of a democratic state depends on the peoples agreement on the reasons that justify rule . That is , in order to prove that a democratic state is legitimate , you must show that the people are or were unified in their agreement . Yet it is impossible to show this . Individuals never come together at one moment ; the people changes continuously . While a hypothetical version of popular sovereignty presupposes that the people could unify in the future , the problem of popular indeterminacy shows that the people will never unify . Indeterminacy , therefore , challenges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for democratic theory . <p> Popular indeterminacy has been an important concern in political theory in recent years . But new research into the edges of the political community , the composition of the demos , and the popular legitimization of the state treats the problem only tangentially , since it often takes the unified people as a given . Thus it tends to ignore the question underlying the problem : What is a people ? What is its nature ? For example , much of the recent research dealing with the people in political philosophy and constitutional theory assumes that there already exists a people , and then turns to examining what this people can do . These scholars ask : Can the people make collective decisions and rule itself ? Can the people agree on a justification for its government ? Can the people bind itself ? Can there be democracy beyond a given people ? But they usually do not ask whether their implicit assumptions about the nature of the people are correct or coherent . <p> The indeterminacy of popular unification also poses a problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless we have unification , we can not tell whether there is a people , and thus we can not determine who ought to be included in the demos . Yet most contemporary theorists who examine the political problems produced by massive immigration , extension of civil rights , and changes in national borders concentrate on the franchise . They have ignored the problem of who or what is the people underlying the electorate . These scholars also assume that there is a democratic people already , and then ask what are the appropriate rules for extending the franchise or constituting an electorate , or when secession or partition is justified . <p> The problem of popular unification is also relevant for constitutional scholars , but they see it from a different perspective . These scholars care about popular indeterminacy insofar as it produces a tension between constitutionalism and democracy . That is , they interpret the lack of popular unification as a rift between the liberal principles embedded in constitutions and the democratic practices that channel the concerns of actual mobilized populations . The indeterminacy of popular unification thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a people has unified at a given time , we can not understand how is it possible that free and equal individuals under democratic rule could be obligated to obey laws they did not create or approve . Unsurprisingly , however , constitutional scholars discuss this tension from within the democratic constitution ; they do not focus on the people , without which the constitution would not even be possible . <p> The problem of indeterminacy is also important , though tangential , for recent scholarship dealing with popular legitimization or populism . This body of work asks how political regimes use the concept of the people to legitimize existing institutions , or how revolutionary groups rely on the concept of the people to justify radical change . This work has a similar approach to studies of the people from a historical perspective . Generally , both approaches assume that popular indeterminacy is unavoidable . Hence they study how the concept of the people in nationalist narratives and political philosophy helps hegemonic groups legitimize rule throughout history , even though unification ( and thus democratic legitimacy ) is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the people functions as an ideological stopgap . They do not try to understand the nature of the people , or whether the problem of indeterminacy can be overcome . In short , they are concerned with the sociological aspects of the problem of popular indeterminacy , not its normative aspects . <p> Finally , those scholars who deal critically with the theory of popular sovereignty also care about popular indeterminacy . They acknowledge that unless you show that the people unify at some point in time , it is hard to explain how the people could be sovereign . Like the scholars in the previous group , these critics of sovereignty often stress that the populace does not correspond to an ideal unified people . They frequently assume that the people is necessarily indeterminate , and on this basis they describe the inconsistencies , paradoxes , and perplexities that underpin the theory of popular sovereignty . So even though these scholars deal with the nature of the people in reference to the problem of indeterminacy , they are not directly concerned with overcoming the problems that indeterminacy poses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the justification of democracy that relies on popular sovereignty . <p> In sum , all these discussions circle the concept of the people and the logical difficulties with the thesis of popular sovereignty . But none of them deals directly with the problem of indeterminacy of popular unification , or the underlying question of what is the peoples nature . Yet if you are interested in the normative aspects of the thesis of popular sovereignty , you can not afford to ignore the problem . Unless you tackle it head-on , democratic theory is left exposed to charges of self-contradiction , and democratic politics in danger of losing any normative foothold . <p> A Dilemma in Democratic Theory <p> The indeterminacy of popular unification undermines the foundations of democratic theory . As I will argue in chapter 3 , popular indeterminacy makes the traditional concept of the people collapse under the weight of logical problems , and with it , the legitimacy of democracy collapses as well . Moreover , without the concept of the people , even the principles of freedom and equality lose their traction within those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these difficulties are not just abstract conceptual problems . Chapter 2 shows with historical examples that these theoretical difficulties can make it impossible for actual states to achieve political stability . <p> Many of the theorists mentioned above acknowledge the indeterminacy of popular unification . The two major strategies they have chosen for dealing with it , however , seem equally unsavory . In fact , these options lead to a dilemma : either you sustain democratic legitimacy while embracing the paradoxes of democratic theory , or you reject these paradoxes and give up on finding a democratic foundation for the political order . <p> The first horn of the dilemmasustaining democratic legitimacy while tolerating paradoxmay seem a sensible approach , for it presents a compromise that may be the best available policy . Such an approach appears both sensitive to the complexity of political life and flexible in the face of the irrationalities of practical politics . And it may also divert violence and avoid pain , as Paul Ricoeur has argued . But the position is ultimately unsatisfying because sustaining a paradox is a form of intellectual capitulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy can not achieve its aim , the position leaves democracy exposed to attacks . It is easy to argue , against this position , that any government that claims to be democratic is in fact using the name of the people to establish the hegemony of a group . If an open people produces a hegemony like any other group , the critics would argue , there is no good reason for preferring an indeterminate people to other versions of the people ( such as an ethnic nation or a chosen people ) , since these appear to provide a more stable ground on which to build a state . <p> The second horn of the dilemma accepts the existence of the paradox , rejects logical inconsistency , and thus gives up on the people as a ground of legitimacy.Many radical critics on the Right and on the Left believe that the people is a chimera , and they deal with it as one would an imaginary animal . Some , including philosophical anarchists and critics of liberal democratic politics , dismiss the people as a dangerous fabrication that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do away with it , but they do not offer much in its stead . Others see the people as a form of idolatry . According to this traditional conservative view , the unachievable people usurps the states legitimate religious foundation . <p> In conclusion , the condition of indeterminacy in popular unification is costly because it produces two unpalatable reactions . The first rejects democratic legitimacy . The second tries to close the gap between the scattered individuals and the ideal people through such nondemocratic procedures as religious authority , nationalism , or political enmity . But there is an additional cost for political theorists . The indeterminacy of popular unification leads to stalemate in discussions about the legitimacy of the democratic state . Hence this indeterminacy challenges not only the legitimacy of the state , but also the imagination of political theorists . In sum , tackling indeterminacy is important , for at stake are the legitimacy of the liberal democratic state and our capacity to think creatively about the kind of political order we should strive for . <p> The People as Process <p> Dilemmas can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions . As Julio Cortzar wrote , there is an infinite wind rose between yes and no . The problem of how to legitimize the state democratically despite popular indeterminacy can be solved , provided one looks beyond the dilemmas two horns . But to find a genuine solution we must uncover the problems roots , and we must also be willing to make profound changes at those roots . <p> The root of the indeterminacy problem is the demand made by theories of popular sovereignty that the people be a fixed and stable thing that seeks to conform to the ideal version of itself , such that its internal changes do not alter the essential nature of the state it founds . Most theories of popular sovereignty require that the state have a unified will . This requirement depends on beliefs and metaphysical commitments that are seldom questioned , despite not often being justified in moral or political terms . In fact , most of the beliefs that ground arguments for the states legitimacy are not the most adequate or desirable for this purpose . For example , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is always what it ought to be : it is good , permanent , and enduring , without a shadow of change , like the will of God . Yet if you question these beliefs further , you find that , unlike the will of God , there is no good reason why the will of the people must have these characteristics . Take another example . According to a second set of beliefs , the ideals that constitute the hypothetical versions of the people are unchanging and thus formulated as principles sub specie aeternitatis . Yet upon further inspection we find that these unchanging ideals are incompatible with dynamic social processes and the indeterminacy of nature . <p> If these beliefs and metaphysical commitments generate the indeterminacy problem , you might ask , why not drop them ? Political theory implicitly gives two reasons why this is hard to do . First , the demand for one will in the state is embedded in contractarian arguments , which are those most commonly used to legitimize the modern state . This unitary-will tradition is implicit in many arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Second , the most common arguments in political philosophy depend on widely available beliefs and metaphysical arguments . In the West , the most prevalent arguments are those of a philosophy of being , which requires fixed identities over time , instead of a philosophy of becoming or process . This latter kind of philosophy does exist , but unfortunately those political theorists interested in legitimizing the state democratically have by and large ignored it . <p> This book seeks to make such philosophy available to democratic theorists . I will argue that a philosophy of becoming is better suited to studying the people than is the widespread philosophy of being . I am helped in this because a philosophical commitment to time and change has been systematized in the philosophy of process . This philosophical outlook is committed to describing the world in dynamic terms . On this philosophical approach , processrather than things or substanceis metaphysically ultimate . Here I rely on those aspects of process philosophy that have direct implications for the problem of indeterminacy . <p> I take this processualist approach in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may object that a metaphysic is not something one can decide to change , as one would a jacket . This is true and especially important in political theory , where the metaphysical commitments of theories are tied to conceptions held by institutions and the public at large . Additionally , concerted political action and perceptions of legitimacy depend on the publics entrenched ideas about identity and stability . This means that a solution to the problem that takes this new approach must at the same time consider historical habits and generalized expectations . That is to say , it must allow us to retain the general will , not as a set goal but as a tendency defined by the expectations of many individuals . What I am looking for , then , is the source of an open-ended tendency , one that is as stable as the self-perception of a people but flexible enough to allow for adjustments to novel and surprising events . <p> What , then , is a source of democratic legitimization that can avoid the problem of the indeterminacy of popular unification ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people as a process , a series of events , rather than a collection of individuals , then we can solve the problem of legitimizing rule democratically as the peoples composition changes . <p> The people as process is a source of democratic legitimacy that moors state institutions but is compatible with change , surprise , and innovation . It can both sustain democratic institutions and accommodate peoples indeterminacy because it does not seek a predetermined goal . Rather , it fosters creative freedom as it recognizes historical tendencies and the current need to search for relatively stable state institutions . As I will show , a people as process is an unfolding series of events coordinated by the practices of constituting , governing , and changing institutions . On the one hand , the people requires a set of practices and institutions , some of which are obligatory and constrain individual action . On the other hand , it also includes a fleeting community of hopes , expectations , memories , and fraternal feelings , periodically subject to drastic and unexpected changes . These two sets , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming . As I will argue , a theory of democratic legitimization that appreciates these distinct changing sets can deal with the logical problems that beset other conceptions of the people . Moreover , it can be a ground for democratic legitimization , since it is flexible enough to admit change , yet realist enough to recognize the staying power of institutions and the dangers involved in both change and stability . <p> Outline of the Book <p> Chapter 1 begins with a question that has perplexed democrats for more than two hundred years : how can you tell the people from a mob ? " The Mob and the People in Mexico , " presents a historical example of the problem of indeterminacy of popular unification , illustrating why the idea of the democratic people as an aggregation of individuals can not legitimize a new state . <p> Chapter 2 , " A Problem in Liberal Democratic Theory , " presents the indeterminacy problem in more detail , this time from the perspective of contemporary political thought . In this chapter I argue that the problem afflicts all contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections against this view that might be made by majoritarian democrats ( Robert Dahl ) , egalitarian democrats ( Thomas Christiano ) , social choice liberals ( William Riker ) , and liberal contractarians ( John Rawls ) . I conclude that liberal democratic theories can not legitimize the state because they require a popular unification that they can never prove would be possible . <p> The indeterminacy problem first appears as an epistemological difficulty . At first glance , it seems that the problem is not the actual lack of unification , but rather that we can not know that it ever happens . Yet if the problem were only epistemological , then hypothetical conceptions of the people could solve it . But I argue that they can not . Thus , in chapter 3 , " Mechanical and Teleological Conceptions of the People , " I argue that the indeterminacy problem also plagues hypothetical versions of democratic theory , which helps explain why a processual conception of the people is a better solution . <p> Chapter 4 , " Dynamic Constitutionalism and Historical Time , " examines one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jnrgen Habermass theory of co-originality . This theory makes the concept of the sovereign people a function of a flexible constitution open to self-creative change over time . That is , it conceives of the people partially as a process . In this chapter I argue that while it is compelling , Habermass solution is only partial . For instead of dealing with the indeterminacy problem in the present , he displaces it in historical time . <p> Chapter 5 examines other constitutional theories that espouse the idea of a changing people . In " The People Between Change and Stability , " I argue that constitutional scholars who conceive of the people as a dynamic process ( e.g. , Frank Michelman , Sheldon Wolin , and Bruce Ackerman ) offer a promising solution , but they also fall prey to the indeterminacy problem because they frame the process of constitutional change within a difficult tension between rigid stability and unruly change . <p> In chapter 6 , " Creative Freedom and the People as Process , " I develop a theory of the people as process that draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehead , and Nicholas Rescher . With their help , I define the people as an unfolding series of events coordinated by the practices of constituting , governing , and changing a set of institutions . Within this process , I call " creative freedom " the aim that coordinates the becoming of such a people . The chapter also explains how to distinguish a people from other types of process , and how to distinguish a specific people from other peoples . <p> Finally , chapter 7 , " A Democratic People as Process , " explains why this conception of the people can better deal with the indeterminacy problem than can other conceptions . In this chapter I show that a democratic people as process can avoid the logical problems that are insoluble for those theories that conceive of the people as a collection of individuals . I further argue that a justificatory democratic theory that rests on process philosophy can coherently claim that a democratic people creates itself and rules itself . In sum , the theory of the people as process offers a democratic justification of the state that is compatible with popular indeterminacy .

The chapters in this volume make clear that nothing could be further from the facts . The relationship between informal workers , employers , and public officials is more complex than logic can at first surmise . <p> The chapters that follow provide an integrated account of the political ramifications of a phenomenon first theorized more than three decades ago . Since the 1970s , informality in both advanced and less developed countries has received sustained attention ( Tokman 1982 ; Capecchi 1991 ) . Methodologies have been devised to measure its size and output in places as disparate as Buenos Aires , Miami , and Bologna ( Portes , Castells , and Denton 1991 ) . Controversy has raged about the effects , beneficial as well as harmful , of economic informality ( de Soto 1989 ; Fortuna and Prates 1991 ) . All along , however , political dimensions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This book redresses that omission . <p> Introduced by Keith Hart in 1970 , the term " informality " was first used to designate the transactions of petty entrepreneurs in Ghana , which were typically outside official control . Informality thus encompassed economic behaviors that were not inherently illegal but occurred outside the purview of the state ; it also constituted a field where economic actorsemployers as well as workerscircumvented government legislation . <p> A lively debate soon grew about the origins and persistence of the informal economy in Latin America . Some saw it as a vestige of precapitalist social formations and the legacy of roughly three centuries of colonial domination . By the 1980s a new literature argued the oppositeinformality was part and parcel of capitalist growth when ( a ) industry is unable to generate adequate demand for the available supply of labor , and ( b ) governments are incapable or unwilling to enact legislation to protect workers , discipline employers , and extract taxes from either . Informality was thus conceptualized as an effect of modernization and the byproduct of distorted or insufficient industrialization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with agricultural mechanization led to rapid rates of rural-urban migration , starting in the nineteenth century . Not able to survive in the countryside and lured by the promise of opportunity in cities , people had arrived searching for jobs in the private sector but ended up performing informal work in homes , assembly plants , or streets . Rather than a residue from the past , economic informality was understood to be an aspect of Latin Americas evolving present . <p> As important as unraveling the origin of economic informality was accounting for its internal dynamics and effects . The relationship between capital and labor took center stage ( Bonacich and Light 1991 ) . Interpretations about the repercussions of unregulated work fell into two main camps . Groups like the International Labor Organization ( ILO ) and Regional Program for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean ( PREALC ) envisioned informality as a low-cost way to create jobs through small business formation and self-employment ( Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 2000 ) . The Peruvian Hernando de Soto took a similar but extreme position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , in which he represents the " mercantile " state as a monstrous impediment to business acumen . In his view even a humble street vender would have incalculable potential for entrepreneurship were it not for the intrusions of a state bent on thwarting individual freedom . Just as Hart had done years earlier , de Soto maintained that the informal economy had been ignored as a motor of development . According to him , multiple restrictions and bureaucratic time lags suffocate independence and self-reliance . <p> Marxist and neo-Marxist writings , by contrast , argued that " entrepreneurs " in the informal sector were really " disguised workers " being exploited through indirect channels ( Bonacich and Light 1991 ) . In this perspective , the divide between self-definition ( small business owner or self-employed worker ) and actual circumstance ( proletarian ) leads to a fragmentation of class consciousness and an incapacity for political expression . Popular awareness of common interests is impeded when people must eke out livings without the protection of government or trade unions . Informal workers have an impact similar to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political mobilization . <p> In the final analysis , both Marxist and non-Marxist interpretations , including de Sotos oddly libertarian scheme , fall analytically short . Missing are cogent explorations of the role of the state and popular activism in the maintenance of economic informality . That limitation seems all the more surprising in hindsight because it is the state embodied in multiple practices , agencies , departments , and divisions that creates the conditions for the expansion or contraction of the informal economy . Without formal laws defining the relationship between employers and workers , the informal economy can not exist . Put differently , formality breeds informality . Furthermore , underground transactions are facilitated by factors such as <p> &lt;NL&gt; <p> 1 . The passage of legislation and legislative amends at various governmental levels in response to constituencies in different positions of political and economic strength ; <p> 2 . The uneven enforcement capabilities of state dependencies ; and <p> 3 . The actions of agencies with specific and sometimes contradictory mandates . <p> &lt;end NL&gt; <p> Elsewhere I have described the garment industry in Southern California as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of informal workers ( Fernndez-Kelly and Garcfa 1991 ) . As this volume further shows , it is through the interactions between public officials and unregulated actors that the informal economy evolves , taking different shapes and acquiring varying contents over time . <p> The spatial dimensions of economic informality are also worth considering . Unregulated dealings often occur on avenues , plazas , sidewalks , and even buses over which government agencies have jurisdiction . It is possible to conceptualize street vending , for example , as the result of negotiations between popular groups and government personnel over the use of public ambits . How and under what conditions do such compromises happen ? What are the proximate and cumulative consequences of those accommodations ? To what extent do informal workers and entrepreneurs represent new economic and political interests ? These are the questions broached by this book . <p> &lt;1&gt; Situating Regulatory Control <p> Chapter 1 , by Miguel Angel Centeno and Alejandro Portes , and Chapter 2 , by John C. Cross and Sergio Pea , improve our understanding of nuances in the relationship between government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier studies , which emphasized the adversarial relationship between the stateenvisioned as the organ responsible for the emission and implementation of legislative restrictionsand informal workers and entrepreneurs attempting to circumvent control . As the lead authors in this volume show , that dichotomy proved to be , at best , a simplification . <p> Centeno and Portes and Cross and Pea build on a rich tradition of inquiry about the relationship between unregulated workers and the state . Since the 1980s , a voluminous literature focused on advanced and less developed countries pointing to variations and regularities in the interactions between formal and informal sectors . Researchers documented , for example , how people move intermittently between the two domains , responding to need and opportunity ( Fortuna and Prates 1991 ) . They also showed how small businesses resort to unauthorized productive arrangements during times of financial crisis and how law-abiding firms occasionally engage the services of home workers to supplement production during periods of increasing demand ( Benerfa and Roldn 1987 ) . In other words , a mounting body of evidence made clear that a porous membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal sectors . <p> Research made obvious as well the extent to which subcontracting arrangements link formal and informal activities ( Tokman 1982 ) . Early interpretations characterized the two domains as separate , responding to different stimuli , and bearing distinct internal logics . The new evidence established that , in many cases , informality grows with and depends on urbanization and industrial expansion , two markers of modernization . Unregulated economic activity was thus proven to be not a relic from the past , as authors like Bela Balassa and colleagues ( 1986 ) or Alex Inkeles and David Smith ( 1974 ) had intimated , but a byproduct of advanced forms of production . For example , comparatively high rates of prosperity in Latin America during the 1970s paralleled the extension of the informal sector partly because of the burgeoning demand for goods and services , many of them produced outside the limits of government regulation ( Fernndez-Kelly and Garcfa 1991 ) . <p> Nevertheless , the ties between the formal and informal sectors proved to be contingent , not inevitable . Starting in the 1980s several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and austerity measures imposed by international monetary organizations throughout Latin America arrested the fragile progress of the previous decade . For the first time , even the informal sector failed to grow , as an increasing number of people retrenched into subsistence activities outside labor markets , whether regulated or not . Even more recently , the diffusion of neoliberal policies exacerbated levels of immiseration throughout the hemisphere , leading to rising predation and the reappearance of nearly extinct behaviors like barter in , of all places , Buenos Aires , a city once known as the Paris of South America ( Frasce 2002 ) . <p> A main contribution of the two first chapters in this volume is the elucidation of how economic behaviors intersect with regulatory structures . According to Centeno and Portes , it is not only the states ability to pass laws but also its capacity to enforce them that determines the shape and size of the informal economy . Their distinction of frustrated , welfare , and liberal states finds complement in Cross and Peas use of the terms informal , illegal , and mafia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs . The intersections in this model produce multiple outcomes . In some cases , informalization supplements state regulation ; in others , it opposes it . At first blush the informal economy may seem uniform but , as the studies in this volume reveal , it is internally heterogeneous . <p> &lt;comp : insert table 1 approximately here&gt; <p> Table 1 summarizes the interactions between public functionaries and unregulated actors . Informality under the aegis of a benevolent state led to complementarity , not opposition , in the case of Emilia-Romagna aptly examined by Vittorio Cappechi ( 1991 , 1997 ) . Aided by members of the Italian Communist partyless interested in ideological purity than in opening channels for production and accumulationformerly unionized Fiat workers became entrepreneurs . Government facilitated that conversion by modifying existing legislation . Proletarian spirit transmogrified into business shrewdness . The result was a network of small firms dependent on mutual trust and oriented toward flexible specialization . Although later studies suggested the impracticability of its transference to other , less adaptable settings , Emilia-Romagna became a celebrated , illustration of state versatility and worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample regulatory capacity but limited ability or will for enforcement delivers what Cross and Pea call a mafia state . In that scenario informal actors not only fill the demand for illegal goods and services but also assume state-like functions . A case in point is the almost wholesale absorption of the Colombian structure of governance by powerful drug cartels in the 1980s ( Fortuna and Prates 1991 ; Blanes JimTnez 1991 ) . <p> Drug trafficking under the watch of a state unable or unwilling to control it is a related instance sketched by the same authors . Throughout the first half of the twentieth century , American cities experienced the steady arrival of black migrants from the South . Demographic change led to drops in urban investment and " white flight . " Market activity in inner-city neighborhoods stagnated , and by the 1970s , ghettos became permanent enclosures . The agents of a massive statesocial workers , program managers , public service providers , and police officers , among othersrapidly occupied the spaces left empty by capital defection . State omnipresence thus became a distinctive feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grassroots level enabled predatory entrepreneurs to flood poor neighborhoods with dangerous drugs , like crack cocaine , that would have been unmarketable in better-protected residential areas ( Fernndez-Kelly 2003 ) . <p> As government programs multiplied to make up for feeble market activity in urban ghettos , youngsters , especially young men , organized and competed for the control of public spaces where they could hustle drugs and guns . Their confrontations and " drive-by shootings " sometimes portrayed by the media as racially specific phenomenaechoed the behaviors of Italian and Irish gangsters during the Prohibition Era . Shared by the two cases was the emergence of alternative mechanisms for the production and distribution of illegal commodities and the articulation of hierarchical arrangements that replicated some of the functions of the state . <p> The contestation of rights over the use of public space is also a central theme in John Crosss Informal Politics:A Study of Street Venders in Mexico City ( 1998 ) , the book that most closely antedates and inspires the present volume . On the basis of ethnographic and historical research Cross showed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh repression and negotiation to quell the informal occupation of walkways and parks in Mexico City . Street peddlers responded by seeking protection from politicians in exchange for votes . Nevertheless , the forging of patron-client relationshipsa common practice in Mexicowas only part of the story . Overwhelmed by individual applications for permits to sell goods al fresco , and eager to rid themselves of continuous demands , government officials offered to negotiate with street merchants but only if they formed trade organizations . The result was not , as they expected , the elimination of perambulatory commerce but the multiplication of street vender associationsan unintended effect of the less than visible interaction between state representatives and informal economic agents . In this case , city officials acted as catalysts for the political mobilization of unregulated merchants . Jeremy Grest documents equivalent phenomena in Durban , South Africa ( Grest 2001 ) . <p> A dramatic illustration of the relationship between economic actors and what Centeno and Portes call the liberal state is not found in studies of the informal economy but in the emerging literature on transnational communities ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , cheaper and faster transportation , and sophisticated communications technologies paralleled the diffusion of neoliberal economic policies in the 1990s . Those , in turn , led to the partial informalization of national bodies of government or , put differently , to a dismantling of regulatory controls and welfare provisions . Globalization is therefore more than an economic trend aimed at maximizing capital gains through the transfer of production from advanced to less developed countriesit is also a political strategy that atomizes and weakens labor forces in various locations ( Evans 1995 ) . Partly for that reason , the age of global integration has coincided with unionization declines in advanced countries and a dearth of effective mobilization in export production zones located in Asia , Eastern Europe , Latin America , and the Caribbean . The opposite of what Karl Marx predicted has occurredgrowing similarity in the experience of workers around the world has not led to alliances and unified militancy . <p> Nevertheless , as the research on transnational communities shows , this does not mean that workers have remained passive vis-a-vis the impact of neoliberal policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across borders to earn a living is using the same routes opened by international capital in its search for more productive and compliant workforces . For individual workers and entrepreneurs , international travel offers greater opportunities to circumvent the restrictions imposed by weakened national states . As JosT Itzigsohn shows in Chapter 3 , globalization is creating new locations within which informal workers and entrepreneurs increase their command over resources . Remittances , for example , have become a major source of revenue for towns and villages in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republica sort of foreign aid program implemented by people from those countries who work in the United States . Although most transnational entrepreneurs are men , the channels of travel and trade associated with economic integration are also creating new opportunities for women , as research by Hatice Deniz Yenal ( 2000 ) and Carla Freeman ( 2000 ) has shown . <p> It is not uncommon in this brave new world for individuals to see their hometowns in less developed nations as sources of personal and collective identity while envisioning countries of destination mostly as fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are momentous . As some have begun to observe , the ripping apart of identity and place is likely to have a profound effect on the very meaning of citizenship , a major dimension of political praxis ( Sassen 1996 ) . <p> Finally , the chapters by Centeno and Portes and Cross and Pea raise issues of significance to the new economic sociology . While early studies of the informal economy focused mostly on the extent to which workers and entrepreneurs escape state regulation , the present volume shifts emphasis to norms of trust and mutuality that social actors must deploy to maximize advantage and reduce risks . Interdependence and rules of reciprocity bring order and consistency to human interactions . It is not that the informal economy lacks regulation but that the sources and means of control are situated within it and not in the official structure of government . Bypassing the dictates of the law alters economic terms . The hazards stemming from informal transactions can increase costs , making it vital to distribute the risk among the members of social networks marked by what Alejandro Portes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That generalization applies not just to marginal commerce in general but also and especially to trafficking in illegal products or services such as drugs and prostitution . It is in those confines that the phrase " honor among thieves " acquires its most powerful meaning . <p> Finally , JosT Itzigsohns comparative study of families in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic echoes the findings of the two previous chapters while moving analysis into an international plane . As standards of living fall for many throughout Latin America and the Caribbean , workers seek new avenues to survive through migration and the deployment of transnational economic strategies . Immigrant workers in the United States , for example , put into motion vast financial flows that energize their home economies . Remittances are already the second source of foreign exchange in the Dominican Republic , surpassed only by tourism . Even more significant from this books perspective , migrantsand in some cases the children of migrantsincreasingly participate in the political life of their ancestral countries . They stride borders bypassing government regulations and altering conventional notions of social assimilation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether as undocumented migrants in some American city or as traders crossing borders back and forth on a regular basis , Latin American workers are operating within and broadening the reach of the informal economy . <p> &lt;1&gt; The Household as a Political Category <p> While the first three chapters take stock of past research and conceptualize afresh the relationship between political action and the informal economy , Chapter 4 , by Mercedes Gonzlez de la Rocha , and Chapter 5 , by Sylvia Chant , assume equivalent tasks with respect to domestic units . Households have attracted lively inquiry and debate in the social sciences , but no matter how they are defined , there is agreement that they connect various levels of economic action . It is within households that labor providers are nurtured , disciplined , and placed into circulation ( Fernndez-Kelly 1994 ; Chant 1999 ) . Cost-benefit calculations involving age , sex , level of education , experience , and ability lead individuals into different market niches , some formal , others informal . Yet there is more to households than their reproductive functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by feminist thinking interrogated the relationship between private and public domains and exposed a paradoxical convention : goods produced and services provided in domestic spaces are generally understood to be outside the price system and therefore to have no explicit economic value . Household chores , mostly the responsibility of women , are performed in the name of duty , instinct , or sentimentnot as part of market exchanges . Such emphasis on biological and emotive determinants naturalizes what are , in fact , economic transactions subject to price classification and market effects of supply and demand when occurring in the public domain ( Hartmann 1976 ) . A meal may be a symbol of hospitality in the home but it is a commodity when purchased in a restaurant . Feminist critics convincingly argued that denuding domestic work of its economic significance affects the balance of power between men and women , putting the latter at a major disadvantage ( Edholm 1977 ; Deere and LTon de Leal 1990 ; Kessler-Harris 1975 ) . <p> In the years that followed , the separation between private and public life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of gender inequality ( Benerfa and Sen 1986 ) . As a result , power and resource differentials between men and women received the most attention . The chapters by Chant , Gonzlez de la Rocha , and Itzigsohn underscore different but equally significant political dimensions . To the extent that it is constructed as a private space outside state regulation , the household presents in extreme modalities some of the characteristics of the informal economy . Furthermore , it is not possible to understand changes in the unregulated sector without appraising equivalent transformations in the domestic sphere . <p> Gonzlez de la Rocha vividly documents the transition from what she calls the resources of poverty to the poverty of resources resulting from the application of neoliberal policies over the last two decades . Her point is that during the 1970s and 1980s informal workers throughout Latin America deployed creative strategies to maximize access to income and meet survival needs , often through the domestic production of goods and services sold in public markets . The street vendors that Cross examined in their dealings with local authorities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , putting together plastic trinkets , preparing food , or sewing garments in quarters they inhabited as members of families . In those cases the limits of personal and public action blurred as individuals confronted the challenges of daily existence . I noted earlier that during periods of economic growth the informal and formal sectors expand harmoniously partly as a result of subcontracting connections . Subcontracting aims at diversifying production while at the same time lowering costs . It is often within the confines of the household that those two objectives can be met most effectively . <p> Even in the 1980s , when external debt and cuts in public spending threw countries like Mexico into deep recession , households were able to satisfy basic needs by pushing wives and even children into the labor force ( Chant 1991 ) . Contrary to plausible expectations that crisis would result in family atomizationunemployed men deserting families they could not support ; women fleeing violence and povertythe opposite occurred . Gonzlez de la Rocha ( 1990 ) and Chant ( 1991 ) documented the increase in the average number of household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were behind that counterintuitive findingwhen able to , families shared their quarters with displaced relatives or enlisted young female kin to take charge of domestic obligations while older women worked long hours outside the home . <p> By the 1990s even those strategies were insufficient to maintain minimum standards of living . As economic growth stagnated and then reversed , informality gave way to even more elemental transactions : scavenging , a panoply of rapacious acts , some of them terrifying , the bartering of services and goods , or the use of promissory coupons to mark economic exchanges . The dismantling of public welfare legislation , itself the fragile legacy of an earlier stage of development is thus muting to some extent the differentiation between domestic and public spheres . Older household studies emphasized the politics of gender . The chapters in this volume expose an equally important phenomenon : the extent to which the overlap between domestic and informal economic activities reflects accentuating political vulnerability for a large number of Latin American families . <p> &lt;comp : insert fig. 1 approximately here&gt; <p> Figure 1 conceptualizes two moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example could be Mexico during the 1970s when import substitution industrialization programs were still in effect and economic growth was comparatively vibrant . In that instance the overlap between domestic and informal activities was significant but many products assembled in homes found buyers in the formal or informal sectors . Those two domains , in turn , were often linked through subcontracting arrangements represented by the arrows in the figure . <p> In the second exampleperhaps Argentina in the year 2002the interaction among the three sectors has been rearticulated . In response to shrinking formal demand of goods and services , subcontracting wanes and potential workers retrench into domestic spaces , directing their energy to subsistence production and mobilization . The proliferation of communal kitchens and the use of grassroots associations to provide public services are examples of that shift . It is as if , under the impact of neoliberal reform , the private ambit extended outward , beyond conventional boundaries , in order to address survival needs formerly satisfied by the welfare state or the Keynesian market . Gonzlez de la Rochas analysis gives pause and raises anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see also MacLeod 2001 and Sassen 1996 ) . To say that the personal is political , echoing the feminist slogan of the 1970s , acquires a new significance in the early twenty-first century when economic change is leading to a tighter articulation of and greater overlap between the domestic and public sectors . <p> In that bleak picture , some auspicious news is available . According to Chant , the feminization of the labor force that has paralleled globalization both in central and peripheral countries does not perforce entail a further weakening of womens power or limit their access to resources . Studies published mainly in the United States associate rising numbers of female-headed households with sharp poverty levels . Chant offers persuasive evidence that such generalizations may be overstated . In places like Mexico the poorest households are not , by and large , those led by single women but those in which men are the heads . That is because escalating levels of male unemployment coupled with cultural conventions that sanction womens dependence and domesticity can exacerbate economic penury . It is at this level that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women . <p> Chants research also shows that , in order to reinforce their masculine role , men are likely to use even modest earnings in conspicuous displays like gambling , purchasing sexual services , or drinking with friends . Women , on the other hand , exhibit a higher propensity to invest in children , even at the expense of their own well-being . Female-headed households derive substantial benefits from replacing husbands earnings with those of grown children . In such cases the average income may be lower than that in situations where both husband and wife earn wages , but womens higher level of control over funds makes up for that limitation . In other words , the contributions of employed sons and daughters to mothers in charge of domestic services can turn female-headed households into versatile mechanisms that widen advantages where resources are in short supply . <p> &lt;1&gt; Public Mobilization <p> Neoliberal economic policies may have expanded the overlap between households and markets but the demarcation between private and public spaces has not faded away . The last four chapters in this book by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jon Shefnerexplore the open expressions of political dissatisfaction in the global age . They thus connect our studies of the informal economy with the existing literature on social movements ( Escobar and -lvarez 1992 ; Avritzer 2002 ) . <p> In Chapter 6 , Javier Auyero writes eloquently about the innovative strategies conceived and implemented by disgruntled workers in Argentina . He approaches collective unrest from the theoretical perspective first formulated by Charles Tilly ( 1995 ) , thus emphasizing the cultural repertoires used by social actors as they try to attract attention to their plight . Auyeros is a response to an earlier , more simplistic perspective that envisioned mass protest mostly as a reaction to " grievances . " In that view , the buildup of collective resentmentover low wages , inadequate working conditions , insufficient services , and government violenceinevitably leads to explosions . Two limitations mar that seemingly plausible framework : first , it equates complex social phenomena with simple laboratory eventsjust as gases can detonate in a heated flask , rising collective stress is said to cause public mobilization . The evidence does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances does not explain cases in which vast resentment is not followed by violent eruptions or those in which minor complaints lead to major outbursts . <p> Auyero does not underestimate grievances as factors leading to popular unrest , but rather emphasizes shared traditions , communicative exchanges , and institutional expectations , that is , cultural repertoires . Collective strife takes place everywhere but how groups express their discontent varies markedly from context to context . In Argentina the harsh conditions resulting from the extension of neoliberal policies have had a three-fold effect : first , they have contributed to the emergence of fluid groups that , although adversarial , do not generally resort to violence . Second , they have facilitated a reshuffling of class alliances in which el pueblo , " the people , " now encompasses not only members of the rural and urban proletariat but also a larger segment of the middle classeducators , managerial workers , and government employees . Finally , the dismantling of Argentinas welfare state has made it less likely for workers to see capitalists as the group responsible for their predicamentit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the common interest . The tearing apart of what little was left of the Peronist legacy has led a people internally diverse in terms of class but united by shared political concerns to occupy streets and block intersections to galvanize public attention . <p> Even today , Argentina is far from being the most impoverished country in the hemisphere . In that nation public disturbances are not caused by economic privation alone but by the disjuncture between the collective memory of past promises and the collective experience of the inability of government to deliver on those promises . In John Crosss Mexico City , venders occupy streets not only to survive economically but also to apply political pressure on local authorities . Argentina offers a parallel case in which formal and informal workers take over public spaces as a way to leverage the state . It is the delicate balance between economic intention and political calculus that varies in the two cases . <p> In Chapter 7 Robert Gay complements Auyeros analysis by focusing on the gradual transition between clientelism and citizenship in Brazil . In conventional interpretations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reciprocity meant to garner the support of constituencies often formed by informal and marginal workers . Given the large imbalance between the material , human , and ideological resources available to politicians and those at the disposal of popular groups , the assumption has been that patron-client relationships are vertical and top-heavy . Gay paints a more complex image by describing how grassroots leaders play politicians against one another in order to maximize their own access to public services . Gays account connects brilliantly with the typology by Centeno and Portes showing the limitations of the frustrated state . Latin American politicians are less powerful than sometimes imagined . Force and suppression are not viable means to secure popular compliance in the long run , and the assets needed to buy votes are not always available . This opens up opportunities for informal transactions that local populations use to advance their goals . By restoring agency to both political machines and constituencies , Gay makes a signal contribution . The dwellers of Brazilian favelas may still be dependent on employers and public officials , but now we can appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new clientelism uncovers grassroots diplomacy . <p> As leaders of popular organizations improve their negotiating positions , their motives and objectives can change . Beyond the satisfaction of material needs they may seek firmer inclusion in the larger society . Gay hypothesizes that in Brazil , as in other parts of Latin America , the trend has been from a defense of particularistic interests to the universalistic pursuit of citizen rights . Juan Manuel Ramfrez Sis reveals the unexpected consequences of that process in his compelling description of the rise and fall of Mexicos Movimiento Urbano Popular ( MUP ) . The case study is of interest here because it exposes the conditions under which political means are converted into economic ends . Among affluent groups , observes the author , the acquisition of real estate is mostly an economic operation guided by market forces , just as orthodox economists would have it . By contrast , for populations without adequate employment and therefore the means to purchase homes , access to shelter depends primarily on political activism . At the peak of their success MUP leaders used mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishment by any standard . <p> In its early stages , the MUPs dazzling success depended on its autonomy vis-a-vis government officials . Although not completely immune to patron-client dealings , the movement maintained its independence for almost twenty years . That , in turn , increased its credibility and following . In the 1980s , however , the MUP fell prey to the influence of partisan politics . Ramfrez Sis shows how , in their effort to control and mobilize resources , MUP leaders forged alliances with candidates of various political stripes . This not only produced divisions within the movement , but also put the brakes on action . To the extent that grassroots organizers had to adjust their behavior to the requirements of party bureaucracies , they were less able to meet collective needs or even maintain the detachment that had contributed to their earlier success . <p> The chapter by Ramfrez Sis is in good measure the telling of a paradox : in the early stages of their development , popular movements are fueled by the expectation that collective action will bring about a better allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . As popular leaders become part of institutional bodies , their capacity for mobilization diminishes . Put differently , the lack of bureaucratic structure gives popular movements flexibility but not necessarily ways to satisfy basic needs . Bureaucratic mechanisms , on the other hand , facilitate access to resources but hinder the capacity for the equitable distribution of limited goods . That problem , concludes Ramfrez Sis , lingers unsolved . <p> In the closing chapter , Jon Shefner approaches the continuum between narrow economic ends and the broad pursuit of citizen rights from a somewhat different angle . Through his remarkable study of a marginal colonia in Guadalajara , Mexico , he brings into full view the paradoxes of democratic improvements amid declining material assets . Deviating from typical practice , the neighborhoods that Shefner investigated were not populated by squatters first tolerated and then sanctioned by the authorities . Instead , government representatives made those residential alternatives available as part of a populist agenda that also included plans for greater political participation and the more efficient provision of services . As in the case of Brazil described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was only the beginning . In subsequent years , government failed to heed its pledges . Evidence of this , notes Shefner , was a manhole in a central street , originally envisioned as the beginning of a public water project , which to the dismay of local residents remained exposed and untouched for more than a decade . <p> Working people in Latin America are familiar with disappointment . In countries where national states are limited by insufficient resources and bureaucratic sclerosis , local communities have learned to rely on their own strengths . In the case reviewed by Shefner , however , mobilization diminished despite generalized frustration among the dwellers of the humble Guadalajara colonia . Why ? Because , replies the author , neoliberal policies may have weakened even the capacity of local communities for self-reliance . Furthermore , a multitude of nongovernmental organizations now populating the Latin American landscape may have inadvertently encouraged passivity . In earlier decades , under the rhetorical mantle of nationalism and class warfare , local residents often took an adversarial stance vis-a-vis governments and employers . More recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in the case of American inner cities , where people often use welfare agencies as one of several resource venues , the poor in Latin America increasingly depend on international philanthropy to maximize access to limited goods . The result is quiescence . <p> Paradoxically , narratives muting socioeconomic inequality and emphasizing democratic participation have accompanied the shift in the locus of patronage . Freedom of expression , broader involvement in the electoral process , and fairer representation in government are laudable ends . Yet as Shefner astutely shows , the very meaning of democratic participation is subverted in contexts characterized by what Gonzlez de la Rocha calls earlier in this volume the poverty of resources . <p> &lt;comp : insert fig. 2 approximately here&gt; <p> Figure 2 summarizes the central ideas in Shefners argument . In agreement with Auyero , Gay , and Ramfrez Sis , he points to a progression from particularistic to universalistic political practices . Old forms of patronage gradually give way to movements oriented toward electoral participation and voters rights . The goal is for popular groups to achieve full membership in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and state regulation as it occurred in many Europeanand some Latin Americancountries earlier in the twentieth century . By contrast , in settings affected by the extension of neoliberal policies , the movement away from early modes of patronage has not brought about full citizenship but new types of clientelism , some of them involving nongovernmental organizations . <p> With these insights Shefner brings our books argument full circle . His analysis also echoes concerns advanced by authors not represented in this volume . William Robinsons prescient analysis of polyarchy as the language and modus operandi of the most advanced capitalist sectors comes to mind ( Carroll and Carson 2003 ; Robinson 1996 ) . In their pursuit of profit and flexible conditions for production , members of that potent international class have supported the passage of free trade agreements and the obliteration of paternalistic legislation . They have done this guided by democratic ideals through the extension of individual rights and responsibilities , even as neoliberal policies erode the capacity of many workers to meet fundamental needs ( Galbraith 2000 , 2002 ) . Shefners analysis gives pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond advancing thanks to democracys embrace or are they just waiting , strangled and dispossessed , for a new moment of resurgence ? Only time will tell . <p> &lt;1&gt; Conclusion <p> The chapters in this book are united by a common preoccupation : to reveal the political dimensions of informal economic action . As a whole , they form an integrated analysis whose main tenets I summarize below . <p> First , in agreement with earlier studies on the subject , this book provides new evidence that the informal economy is far from a vestige of earlier stages in economic development . Instead , informality is part and parcel of the processes of modernization . Its content and type of relationship with regulated production and commerce vary in consonance with changes in the material foundations of society . Contrary to early arguments , we present the informal economy as an organized entity . Its regulatory means are not to be found at any level of structured government but within the informal economy itself . To exist , informal workers must rely on norms of reciprocity and solidarity , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociology . <p> Second , the chapters in this book make it clear that informal actors are far from apolitical . Their economic survival depends routinely on transactions they make and alliances they forge with government authorities at the local , state , and federal levels . Conversely , government entities are not always in opposition to unregulated sectors . Distinctions between formal and informal politics may be useful at the analytical level , but on the ground , government officials are often pushed into arrangements that promote the continuance and even growth of the informal economy . In other words , it is the state through its regulatory and implementing capacity that partly determines the size and shape of the unregulated sector . <p> Third , this book makes an important contribution to our understanding of households as economic fields in close but fluid relationship with both the informal and formal sectors . Although the reproductive functions of domestic units have received attention in the past , this is one of the first attempts to systematize the relationship between unpaid labor as it occurs in domestic ambits and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present moment is the greater overlap between private and public spheres as a result of the extension of neoliberal economic policies . <p> Finally , this book brings to light the logic of innovative forms of clientelism emerging in the age of global economic integration . Old patron-client relationships are being displaced by new arrangements . Even as national states dismantle protective legislation and working classes resort to self-provisioning , nongovernmental organizations and self-help entities become the new loci of patronage . The language and practice of democratic participation thrive in a volatile age when inequities are on the rise throughout the hemisphere . <p> At its most fundamental , political action is about the collective production , dispersal , and exercise of power , authority , and influence . Too frequently in the past informal workers have been portrayed as economic players without a recognition of their active participation in the push-and-pull that alters processes of negotiation , co-optation and realignment . They have been , in Eric Wolfs memorable words , a people without history . With this volume we hope to redress that narrow conception of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic : ritual magic . Klaassen shows that texts of medieval ritual magic were cherished in the sixteenth century , and writers of new magical treatises , such as Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee , were far more deeply indebted to medieval traditionand specifically to the medieval tradition of ritual magicthan previous scholars have thought them to be . <p> " Well argued and well researched , The Transformations of Magic represents a thorough and scholarly treatment of medieval magical texts , as well as an engrossing read . " Michael Heyes , Religious Studies Review <p> " Klaassens elegantly written monograph is an incisive analysis of an understudied body of evidence . His argument that two types of illicit learned magic characterized the period between 1300 and 1600 brings coherence and clarity to an intellectual tradition that has too often been overlooked . By locating magical texts within broad theological , philosophical , and scholarly traditions and by emphasizing the continuities between medieval ritual magic and Renaissance texts , Klaassen challenges his readers to see medieval and Renaissance intellectual culture in new ways . His work thus not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the premodern era , but it also participates in conversations about the periodization of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance .

It concerns the changes , sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic , that took place each time a medieval author , scribe , or collector set out to understand and practice learned magic , and then to copy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the transformations that entire genres of this literature underwent in the later Middle Ages and the sixteenth century . It seeks to understand what motivated these changes and what this tells us about the intellectual culture of late medieval magic . <p> The history of learned magic in the Latin West may be understood in part as a series of attempts to reconcile theologically problematic practices and ideas with Christian orthodoxy . This was a matter that concerned not only the authors of magic books but also the scribes and collectors who transmitted or preserved such texts . The nature of each reconciliation could , in principle , be quite distinctive and depended on a wide variety of factors , including the nature of the text received , any known authoritative reactions to it or the kind of magic it promoted , the context in which it was transmitted , and the copyists interests . A desire to see magic in terms of natural philosophy would , for example , demand a fundamentally different approach from a desire to regard it as a kind of mystical technology or religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authoritative voice might generate a different response from one that had not . In addition , the intellectual world of late medieval scribes was not only a matter of solving abstract problems ; it was circumscribed and informed by a number of broader conditions , such as the kinds of texts available and the professional context of the individual author , scribe , or collector . A monks interests , abilities , and resources were different from those of a medical doctor , student , or priest . A copyists profession affected not only what texts were available but also how they were interpreted , copied , and altered . <p> The processes involved in copying were thus very complex , and even where the original text was not altered in any way , the act of copying was not passive . On the contrary , it involved a wide range of choices , conscious or otherwise , that might fundamentally alter the sense of the received text . Which text would one choose , and which version ? How would one find the text one wanted if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and value be judged ? Should one alter the contents , omit parts , or extract a portion from its original context ? If it was corrupt or fragmentary , how would one correct or supplement it so that it made sense ? Might it be incorporated into a new text ? How would it be presented on the page ? Did it deserve its own folios or was it fit only for the margins , some loose parchment , or a pastedown ? Would it be copied in a notebook , a schoolbook , or an illuminated manuscript ? How should it look on the page ? Once written , would it be annotated , glossed , indexed , or cross-referenced ? Would it be strictly for personal use or available in a library ? Finally , assuming that the scribe had the luxury of such a choice , in what kind of book would it be placed , that is to say , with what other kinds of texts should it be gathered for easy reference ? Evidence of at least some of these decisions remains in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two and a half centuries covered by this book , and the interests and assumptions that lay behind them , we must begin by examining such data . <p> The transformations were far from random , and clear patterns emerge . The literature of illicit magic , and the way in which it was understood and treated , falls into two major streams . To illustrate the intellectual culture that in part determined the course of these streams , the first two sections of this book are introduced by the stories of two men , an unnamed apothecary and John of Morigny . In each case , the protagonist faces an essentially unsolvable problem . The apothecary must decide whether to believe that an astrological image that made him rich derived its power from occult natural properties or from deceptive demons . Brother John , by contrast , struggles to reconcile the fact that ritual magic was transmitted in booksbooks that one should assume were corruptbut could only be learned , practiced , and understood through experiences that were not really communicable through the written word . How , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide whether what one discovered was true or legitimate , and pass it on to others , when any written text might ultimately be corrupted ? These problems form the creative core of the traditions of late medieval Scholastic astrological image magic collections and the literature of ritual magic . <p> The apothecarys dilemma derives from the rationalist context of twelfth- and thirteenth-century Scholasticism and its Arabic forebears . A few key writers in this intellectual tradition offered the hope that the magical effects of astrological images might derive from natural processes rather than demonic deception . An intellectual debate concerning images , inspired by the writings of the ninth-century Arab philosopher al-Kindi , took hold in the twelfth-century Latin West and engaged the energies of many of the major Scholastic philosophers . It sought to evaluate this kind of magic with reference to authoritative discussions of the natural world and through a process of logical analysis . Although astrological image magic texts contained significant elements that could not be accommodated to naturalistic explanation , the associated debates about the natural world remained the intellectual rudder for how they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic . While scribes tended to alter the contents of these works very little , the decisions they made about which ones to copy were powerfully influenced by authoritative discussions , particularly the Speculum astronomiae . Consequently , of the scores of texts once available , a relatively small group came to dominate the library . The transformation was also one of perspective : scribes understood these texts to be reconcilable with Scholastic ideas or , at a minimum , to belong to the larger discourse of natural philosophy . Even where we find no evidence of theoretical concerns , scribes still followed Scholastic thought and associated the texts with the genre of naturalia . In this way , a significant library of texts , many of which were not intended asand did not claim to benatural magic , were collected with other works concerning the natural world . <p> Part I of the book treats this topic . Chapter 1 describes how writers from Augustine , through al-Kindi , to Aquinas understood astrological images . It argues that , despite clear authoritative statements to the contrary , medieval intellectuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of naturalia . Chapter 2 examines the manuscripts of astrological image magic and argues that in the later Middle Ages , particularly under the influence of the Speculum astronomiae , a pattern of collection developed that was so regular that it should be understood as a genre : the Scholastic image magic collection . Chapter 3 examines the few exceptions to the rule and argues that these manuscripts tend to confirm the rules in other ways . The habits of mind and patterns of collection in this literature stand in stark contrast to the literature of ritual magic , to which the next chapters turn . <p> Brother Johns dilemma arose from ritual magic , a different set of texts that flowed in an almost entirely discrete stream of transmission : demon conjuring , angel magic , and the theurgic arts , such as the Ars notoria , that emphasized the mechanisms of religious rites , dreams , and visions . For enthusiasts of this sort of magic , discovering truth was less about logical elaboration than about experience and revelation . The textual tradition they produced lacked the stabilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the mythologies written into the texts themselves encouraged the view that truth might very well not be found in any magic text , since ritual magic was less a repository of truth than a vehicle for its discovery . Authors , scribes , and collectors of these sorts of texts also acted with similar assumptions . A text had to accord with their ideas about what magical and/or religious rites should look like , and if its rituals produced any subjectively convincing experiences , these too could affect how the text was understood or treated . It is clear that scribes evaluated magic texts and regularly altered them on the basis of changing religious sensibilities , practical experience , or even what they took to be instruction by numinous powers brought about by their practices . Arguably , scribes were driven to this approach to truth as the only way to counterbalance the lack of clarity generated by the unstable transmission of ritual magic manuscripts : in order to make systematic sense of unsystematic traditions , suprahuman assistance was needed . The need to defend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim divine guidance and sanction for their texts and practices through visionary experiences . This knot of problems helps us understand not only the far more unstable nature of ritual magic but also the resiliency and longevity of a form of magic that survives in a relatively robust form to the present day . <p> Accordingly , Part II of the book concerns the literature of ritual magic . It examines and compares the mythologies or literary representations of ritual magic practitioners within magic texts , the magical processes those texts ordained , and the way practicing magicians actually operated , including how they interacted with and transformed their texts . It argues that , unlike astrological image magic collections , ritual magic collections evince no interest in the literature of naturalia and lack stable textual traditions . Instead , their authors , scribes , and collectors had a strong interest in ritual processes , in highly personal or individualistic forms of magic , and in direct experiences of the numinous . This part of the book also argues that in this tradition , practitioners were encouraged by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received texts , a mythology that encouraged practitioners to think of themselves as divinely guided editors or authors , and operations that emphasized the fundamental importance of individual experience , including subjectively convincing experiences of the numinous . Chapter 4 addresses the theurgic and largely angelic magic of the Ars notoria , John of Morignys Liber visionum , and the Liber iuratus Honorii . Chapter 5 examines the literature of necromancy , that is , operations involving both angels and demons . <p> Once we appreciate the distinguishing features of these two streams of thought , the distinctive blend of new and old in magic after 1480 comes clearly into view . This is the subject of Part III . Chapter 6 argues that although the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries are often characterized as a period when the superstitious " old dirty " magic of the Middle Ages was shed in favor of a more elegant magic of Hermetic or kabbalist inspiration , often associated with natural and astrological image magic , the magic manuscripts of this period exhibit no such shift . The most commonly copied texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late medieval ritual magic . Astrological image magic , on the other hand , and most particularly the Scholastic image magic collection , enjoyed its highest level of copying during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . It then almost vanished as an independent genre , and its texts , when they were copied at all , were typically subsumed within the larger literature of ritual magic . This situation can not be explained by the increased availability of magic texts in print . <p> Chapter 7 attempts to make sense of all this by comparing the manuscript evidence with the magic of Marsilio Ficino , Cornelius Agrippa , and John Dee . It argues that the major occultists of the sixteenth century , particularly Agrippa and Dee , stood firmly in the tradition of late medieval demonic and angelic magic . Even Ficinos magic , often understood as a limited kind of natural magic , was in fact a distinctively Neoplatonic system with great similarities to medieval ritual magic , highly ritualized and with powerfully religious , interior , experiential , and personal dimensions . Also like their medieval forebears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions , and they understood themselves as part of a divinely inspired renovation of magic . In short , Brother Johns dilemma lies at the heart of Renaissance magic . <p> Scholarly Context <p> This study begins with manuscripts . Unlike most studies of learned magic , however , and particularly works on Renaissance magic , it focuses upon a wide spectrum of scribes , collectors , and authors of magic works . The weakness of this approach is that the most eloquent proponents or elucidators of magic in the period are not treated in detail . The subtleties of their positions and the intellectual power of their writing often fade in a sea of intellectual mediocrity . The strengths of this approach , however , are considerable . First , by examining copyists and collectors rather than just authors , we discover important traditions , such as the Ars notoria , that have become invisible in the intervening years . Second , because most people are not exceptional , any understanding of the cultural world of late medieval magic should at least take cognizance of more ordinary intellectuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Agrippa , Trithemius , Bruno , and Dee , did not write their works in a vacuum : great writers often become so through their ability to engage the concerns of their age . Their popularity , intellectual lineage , and originality are therefore better understood in the context of broader intellectual trends . In order to understand the significance of their books , we must understand their readers , on the one hand , and the magic traditions with which they were familiar , on the other . This approach also provides a kind of aerial view of the literature that transcends the divisions into which scholarship conventionally has fallen . <p> Until relatively recently , the historiography of illicit learned magic has fallen roughly into two streams that correspond to the two streams of transmission just identified . In one , historians concentrated on the relationship between science and magic , and in the other on the relationship between religion and magic . Lynn Thorndikes eight-volume History of Magic and Experimental Science epitomizes the first approach . Although this monumental work includes a great deal of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorndikes treatment of necromancy and the Ars notoria is very limited , no doubt owing to the limited connections between these texts and the discourse of natural philosophy . Frances Yates significantly extended this approach to the Renaissance , emphasizing the connections of science with Renaissance magic , which she understood as fundamentally concerned with natural magic . <p> In the other stream , which emphasizes the relationship between religion and magic , such scholars as Keith Thomas , Norman Cohn , and Edward Peters have examined the relationship of magic to broader cultural issues , and have worked to locate magic in the complex nexus of moral , legal , and religious thought . Thomass classic Religion and the Decline of Magic assumed as its starting point that religion and magic were inextricably interwoven in the medieval period . Norman Cohn sought to understand the part that ritual magic played in late medieval conceptions of witchcraft and evil . <p> Scholars have also tended tacitly to assume a division between magic before and after the 1480s , when Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola produced their powerful new syntheses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval and Renaissance magic ; but for the most part this has been an unspoken divide that few scholars have crossed . Like the division in scholarship between the scientific and religious aspects of medieval magic , this divide arises from and to a certain extent is justified by the sources . Renaissance writers incorporated the traditions of Neoplatonism and kabbalism in novel and very sophisticated ways . They also self-consciously rejected earlier traditions , particularly necromantic magic , and constructed their systems not only in opposition to prior magic texts but also in the self-conscious assumption that their age was engaged in a broad-based intellectual renovation that drew on the knowledge of antiquity . At the same time , this rejection belied the debts owed to their medieval forebears , and recent scholarship on the traditions of learned magic in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance demands that this division be reconsidered , or at least that the transition between medieval and Renaissance magic be better and more clearly articulated . <p> In recent decades scholars have begun to pick up the diverse threads of Lynn Thorndikes remarkable survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this considerable and important literature . David Pingree and Charles Burnett in particular have broken new ground with their close studies of individual figures and texts associated with medieval traditions of Arabic magic . Although he had already published many articles on magic in the West ( in addition to his survey Magic in the Middle Ages ) , Richard Kieckhefers edition and study of a fifteenth-century necromancers manual , Forbidden Rites , initiated a flood of editions and studies of specific texts , many by a new generation of scholars . The dean of magic studies in France , Jean-Patrice Boudet , produced a variety of important examinations of the Ars notoria and other texts and has led the way in editing the corpus of Solomonic literature in the Latin West . An edition of the Liber iuratus Honorii by Gsta Hedegsrd , followed by studies by Robert Mathiesen , Kieckhefer , Katelyn Mesler , Boudet , and Jan Veenstra , has expanded our awareness of this important text . Don Skemer has produced a study of textual amulets . Paola Zambelli has produced an edition and analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ars notoria is perhaps the single most remarkable achievement , given the vast number of manuscripts involved.Sophie Page , Benedek Lng , and I have conducted studies of manuscript collection and transmission and have contributed to a growing body of scholarship on specific texts and manuscripts . Veenstra and VTronFse have provided important studies of other ritual magic texts as well . The profoundly compelling materials left behind by John of Morigny have been partially edited by Claire Fanger and Nicholas Watson , who are currently at work on additional parts of his corpus . <p> Work on Renaissance magic has also shifted to more focused examinations in recent decades ; the literature is so vast that I can mention only a few studies that are directly relevant to this book . Brian Copenhaver , Michael J. B. Allen , Christopher Celenza , and Chaim Wirszubski have examined Ficinos De vita coelitus comparanda and Pico della Mirandolas Oration on the Dignity of Man , contributing substantially to our understanding of these difficult but central texts . Paola Zambelli , Michael Keefer , Vittoria Perrone Compagni , and Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophia . The magic of John Dee has been treated in detail by Nicholas Clulee , Deborah Harkness , Stephen Clucas , and an array of other authors . <p> In addition to this more focused scholarship , a number of important surveys now provide guidance to the broader traditions of medieval magic . Boudets study Entre science et nigromance is the most important general treatment of magic in the later Middle Ages and in many ways supersedes Kieckhefers Magic in the Middle Ages . Perhaps its greatest virtue is its tremendous breadth , including an examination of divination and astrology as well . Nicolas Weill-Parots Les " images astrologiques " au Moyen -ge et a la Renaissance surveys the literature of astrological image magic and the reactions of medieval scholars from al-Kindi to Ficino . Paolo Lucentini and Vittoria Perrone Compagnis list of manuscripts of Hermetic texts ( many of them concerning image magic ) has superseded Thorndikes work on this literature , as have comparable lists in the works of Boudet , Weill-Parot , and VTronFse . In addition to these , recent years have seen a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Eamons study of books of secrets and William Newmans work on alchemy , while not focused precisely on magic , provide a useful backdrop against which other traditions of magic may be measured . At the same time , few studies of magic have attempted to survey illicit magic in general in both the medieval and Renaissance periods , a gap this study attempts to fill . <p> The relationship to this book of some of the scholarship I have mentioned merits explicit treatment here , particularly its relation to studies that attempt to outline broader historical developments in the history of illicit magic in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance . Keith Thomass classic Religion and the Decline of Magic argues that an inherently magical medieval church tended to preserve or even promote the practice of magic , its support fading with the Reformation . While my study does tend to confirm the argument that religion and the practice of ritual magic can not be easily disentangled , it suggests , on the one hand , that this integration of magic and religion is one of the factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reformation , and , on the other , that magic , particularly medieval astrological image magic , can not comfortably be collapsed under the broad rubric of religion , at least not in the Latin West . Instead , many of its proponents argued ( or evidently assumed ) that image magic was natural magic and was thereby as discontinuous with the practice of religion as any other natural tool would be . It was more precisely , as Weill-Parot has argued , the subject of an ongoing Scholastic debate surrounding what he has called its " addressativity , " that is , the uncomfortable reality that this form of magic appears to , or actually does , address spiritual beings that medieval theology insisted had to be demons . This study also confirms Weill-Parots contention that the high point of this genre was reached in the fifteenth century . I also follow Boudets suggestion , in Entre science et nigromance , that the medieval period was characterized by a fundamental ambivalence toward magic , but Boudet casts his net further than I cast mine , including the broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deeply into the connections between the history of magic and medieval institutions and the growth in the sophistication and tenor of condemnations of magic in the later Middle Ages . It is curious that this period of increasing condemnation was accompanied by a growing interest in magic , and VTronFse has suggested that it was also characterized by the development of the " author-magician . " I have developed , and articulate more fully here , a similar and parallel argument that the highly individual-centered magician of the later Middle Ages and Renaissance flows naturally from the practices and mythologies of ritual magic , which promoted the importance of the individual practitioner and the idea of the magician as a divinely guided editor . With respect to the transition between the Middle Ages and Renaissance , evidence presented here suggests that the stark division of medieval and Renaissance magic promoted by many scholars , particularly by Frances Yates , can not be sustained . Despite my reservations about Brian Vickerss evaluation of Renaissance magic , he is quite right to note that most magic in the sixteenth century looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she called the " old dirty magic " of the Middle Ages . In addition to demonstrating the continuity of Renaissance magic with medieval traditions , then , I hope that this study will help redeem the old magic and prove it worthy of study . <p> Two other scholars not directly concerned with magic also deserve mention here . William Eamons Science and the Secrets of Nature emphasizes the division between Scholastic natural philosophy and the literature of naturalia , particularly books of secrets , on the grounds that the former offered explanations for observed realities , whereas the latter , at best , offered demonstrations of those ideas . While recognizing the quiapropter quid division , my study emphasizes the continuity between debates in Scholastic natural philosophy ( propter quid ) and habits of mind in the wider literature of naturalia , including experiments , secrets , divination , and astrological image magic ( largely quia ) , and argues in particular that Scholastic natural philosophy fundamentally influenced the fortunes of astrological image magic texts . Eamons work also emphasizes the practical nature of much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Newmans Promethean Ambitions , which focuses heavily upon the practice of alchemy , my study takes seriously the idea that magic , even when it was a largely theoretical activity , was still a practice involving habits of authorship , translation , selection , copying , analysis , and practical application . These habits provide crucial evidence for understanding the intellectual culture of illicit learned magic in the premodern world . <p> Assumptions and Terminology <p> I use the terms " magic " and , less often , " religion " and " science " as useful general categories only . The modifiers " religious " and " scientific " are easily understood ways of referring to a very real division in premodern treatments of magic . Naturally , those who copied astrological image magic texts into volumes containing works of Scholastic natural philosophy were no less religious than the scribes of ritual magic , nor were the latter less " scientific " than the former . Yet the manuscripts do reveal different ways of approaching and thinking about the texts . If the Scholastic approach to magic texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ) , it was , at the same time , fundamentally concerned with physical processes , natural phenomena , and related theoretical questions . Similarly , if ritual magic texts reveal a more explicit desire to connect with the numinous , to perform powerful liturgical rites , and to engage in magic in an effective way , almost all of their scribes would have had Scholastic training . So there is no reason to assume that these approaches were in any way mutually exclusive . That some medieval scribes participated in both traditions , and that Renaissance writers and scribes merged these two streams , argues very strongly that they are better understood as distinctive modalities of relation or discourse . Similarly , the term " magic " is tremendously vague . I engage in a modern anachronism when I use this term , for many of my scribes did not use it , nor did they necessarily regard their practices as " magic . " Nevertheless , use of the term may be justified by the fact that most authorities would have regarded all of the practices considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Boudet has pointed out that writers commonly used the term " nigromancy " to refer to magic of which they approved and " necromancy " for magic of which they did not . A practitioner of demon conjuring was thus likely to refer to himself as a nigromancer , and it follows that to use the term " necromancer " to describe him might be anachronistic . However , the term " nigromancy " lacks precision , as it was used to refer both to astrological image magic and also to ritual magic , traditions that this book seeks to distinguish . Further , when a medieval catalogue identifies a book as necromantic or nigromantic , this does not necessarily mean that it was a work of demon conjuring . For example , a German medieval catalogue refers to works of astrological image magic simply as necromantic . This was simply a negative valuation of astrological image magic , but in the absence of the accompanying description it is impossible to know whether the texts were astrological image magic or explicit demon conjuring . The terms are thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of the author . For this reason , I use the term " necromancy " in the conventional sense , to refer only to those activities that the authors , scribes , and collectors explicitly regarded as involving the conjuring and deploying of demons . <p> An additional problem with the term " magic " is that it can be taken to imply a practice that is inherently inefficacious . I do not regard medieval assumptions about the world as in any way absolutely true . But the magical processes they described were assumed to be real , and I do accept that , in many cases , they did work . Certainly , practitioners could assign results to their magical operations in retrospect , but subjective experience of magic is far more complex than this . Ritual magic employed human mediums , reflecting surfaces ( fingernails , mirrors , water , or " show stones " ) , transparent substances ( crystals or vials ) , and randomly moving things ( fire or smoke ) , which could have evocative power even in the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence in everyday human experience , were also common vehicles for ritually induced visionary experiences . Recent studies , such as those by Tanya Luhrmann , have demonstrated that the techniques of modern magic , which differ in only limited ways from their medieval forebears , can result in subjectively convincing and even life-altering experiences . Certainly , the medieval worldview provided abundant encouragement for the belief that these kinds of experiences could occur : conventional Christianity commonly employed visions and reports of visions as a way to access divine mysteries , and as Richard Kieckhefer has observed , very few people in the medieval period did not believe in demons and angels . Given a state of suggestibility or altered awareness brought about by an ongoing discipline of meditation or visualization and more immediate evocative stimuli , it should be unsurprising that experiences ranging from feelings or impressions to visual or auditory hallucinations might follow . Of course , it is conceivable that some authors and scribes failed in their magical efforts , but we have every reason to assume that they copied magic texts under the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image magic : although there was some debate about how it workedwhether it operated because of astrological influence or demonic interventionthe assumption remained that it did work . Throughout this study I assume that the practices described probably did achieve some subjectively convincing results , and if not , that the practitioners would have better cause to doubt their texts or techniques than to question the principle that magic could work . <p> Sensitive readers will also be aware that it is problematic to use the term " scribe " to indicate the person whose intents and interests are reflected in the text . It is , of course , unclear whether the texts were copied by professional scribes or were the work of the person directly interested in magic . It may be that both participated in the selection and transmission of the text . In fact , a single manuscript may reveal a startling complexity of " archeological " layers , each represented by a different person . It may have been assembled from several previous books , each assembled by a different person . The complete surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up , may have been owned , that is , collected , by numerous people .

This is one of the great riches of the medieval codex , but any attempt to reflect this complexity can make for some very clumsy writing . In order to simplify things , and to avoid the endless repetition of awkward phrases like , " the scribe , the person who directed the copying or paid for it , the collector or the group who collaborated on this manuscript , the authors , extractors , or those who in some way made authorial interventions , " I often simply refer to this person or group in the singular as " the author , scribe , or collector , " or sometimes " the scribes .

They serve as tokens of love , objects of jealous passion , and icons of royalty . They are commissioned by lovers and kings , exchanged in marriage negotiations , and manipulated in political plots . Sometimes they are endowed with the uncanny presence of the sitter and overpower their viewers with desire or , often its twin opposite , violent rage . In other instances , they are stripped of transcendent value and reduced to sheer materiality . Occasionally stage portraits take the form of easel paintings visible to audience members . More often , though , they are miniatures , sometimes encased in jewels , sometimes unframed , but either way seen by the audience only indirectly through the reactions and descriptions of the characters among whom they are exchanged ( fig. 1 ) . <p> Rosaura 's portrait in Calder=n de la Barca 's famous La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tellingly revealing of how the small physical size of miniature portraits is belied by their importance as the focal point of the larger dramas of desire , identity , and power in which they are embedded ( fig. 2 ) . Although he has abandoned Rosaura , Astolfo still carries her portrait with him when he leaves Muscovy for Poland and pursues Estrella , the cousin with whom he intends to assume the Polish throne . In a scene very close to the center of the play , Estrella demands that he surrender this token of a previous love as proof of his feelings for her . Rosaura , who has found employment as Estrella 's servant under a new name , walks in at the very moment in which Astolfo agrees to bring her the portrait and replace it with the image of Estrella 's beauty in his heart . Rosaura can not let that exchange take place ; she is determined to recover her portrait from the man who betrayed her and keep it from falling into her rival 's hands . Played out within the drama of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called secondary plot of La vida es sueo , the conflict over Rosaura 's portrait is not at all incidental to the work 's main drama of kingship , good governance , and destiny . In fact , it is where Rosaura 's story and the story of the prince Segismundo , long recognized by critics to mirror each other , most emblematically converge . Rosaura 's determination to recover her portrait and prevent it from entering into her rival 's possession mirrors Segismundo 's reclamation of his right to his princely identity , which his father had denied him at birth . That Rosaura 's unwitting rival is none other than one of the cousins who plans to usurp his claim to the throne makes the link between the two characters all the stronger . Rosaura succeeds in regaining possession of her portrait , anticipating her twin character 's recovery of his stolen birthright . <p> Dramas of the portrait like the one in La vida es sueo belong to an age-old preoccupation with the powers , pleasures , and perils of the human simulacrum . As books like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History and Theory of Response and Maurizio Bettini 's Portrait of the Lover brilliantly explore , likenesses of the human figure , especially the face , have fascinated , haunted , and consoled people throughout history , and the image of the king , the self , and above all the beloved has fueled the Western and Near Eastern cultural imagination since ancient times . Plutarch relates how the military commander Cassandrus trembled at the sight of the deceased Emperor Alexander 's portrait . In classical mythology , the beautiful youth Narcissus burned with desire for his own reflection in a pool until he withered away and died , transformed into the flower for which he is named . Pygmalion fell in love with the ivory-statue woman of his own creation ; he loved , caressed , and showered the statue with gifts , and finally it came to life .

It is a culturally and historically specific chapter , and it invites a culturally historicizing approach . The recurring drama of the portrait is to be understood in the context of the social and cultural milieu that accounts for and was , in turn , shaped by the interrelated place of the theater at the center of a newly urban court society and the increasing role of portraiture in urban social commerce .

Eliezer plowed on the mountain . R. Eliezers cow fell and was maimed . It proved fortunate for him that his cow was maimed , because he fled from his brothers and came to the famed R. Yoh ? anan ben Zakkai to study . But now R. Eliezer was poor and had nothing to eat , so he ate clods of dirt until his mouth had a bad odor . The other students went to their teacher and complained about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odiferous student and said , " Just as the odor of your mouth caused you to smell bad for the sake of Torah , so will the fragrance of your learning go from one end of the world to the other . " <p> This brief narrative describes the sacrifice of a young rabbinical student and the prediction by his teacher of that rabbis future greatness . To accomplish its goal , the narrative relies on our personal experiencenot with how difficult it may be to plow a mountain , or the distress with which a family might receive news of its cow being lame ; these are explained within the context of the narrative . Rather , the climax and resolution of the vignette depend upon our firsthand knowledge of bad breath . And this remains unexplained . That is , the narrator relies on our personal experience so that we will empathize with the students , for we all know how repulsive bad breath in others can be . At the same time , because we know how difficult it is to perceive bad breath in oneself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his being destitute and eating clods of dirt werent enough to render us compassionate ) . More intriguing , however , is R. Yoh ? anan ben Zakkais response , which turns bad odor into a positiveeven worthyattribute . R. Eliezer may emit an offensive odor in pursuit of Torah , but once he has acquired knowledge and begins the teaching of Torah he will emit a perfumed fragrance to which people will be drawn . Bad or offensive odor is rendered not only positively but as perfume . The rabbis odor wafts abroad , attracts students to him , and draws them in . They , in turn , teach the rabbis teachings and spread the perfume from one end of the world to the other . Bad breath becomes fragrance , and fragrance is Torah . What appears to be a simple legend is , on closer perusal , a deeply encoded metaphor and lesson . Sacrifice and suffering for Torah operate in the world as perfume , seducing others to believe . <p> This book examines rabbinic imagery of fragrance and explores how the ancient rabbis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious claims . It focuses on the many midrashim that mention specific spices , such as frankincense , myrrh , and balsam , and those that reference the more general language of perfume , incense , anointment , and fumigation . At its most poetic , this study uses the lens of aroma to examine rabbinic reflections on such topics as love , righteousness , death , the Divine , and the " other . " At its most mundane , it explores and describes the utterly quotidian . That is to say , it seeks out the impulse for these comparisons and finds them in everyday experience : the fumigation of clothing and rooms , the use of incense in the rituals of various religions , the application of medicinal unguents and ointments , and the bathing and anointing of the body with oil . In the late Roman and early Byzantine periods , these daily activities meant that one inhaled the scents of exotic places in the marketplace , the bathhouse , and the home . These experiences , along with rabbinic reflections upon them , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sublime , form the backdrop for the astounding layers of metaphor and meaning found in the many " aromatic " midrashim . <p> When I first began my work on fragrance , I believed that the Hebrew Bible served as the primary impetus for rabbinic images of fragrance . After all , the ancient rabbis interpreted every element of Scripture . I therefore spent much time and energy locating almost every reference to olfaction , aroma , and particular spices in the Hebrew Scriptures . I evaluated the terms , studied clusters of terms , and noted that these groupings quite naturally gravitated to spheres of priestly , royal , or erotic topoi . I explained that these groups sometimes overlapped and that the terms themselves often served as the bridge from one metaphor to another . I then turned my attention to the rabbinic interpretive literature , and there it appeared that the rabbis picked up these biblical terms , along with their associated meanings and valences , and transformed them solely on the basis of " rabbinic " understandings of the biblical literature . I analyzed these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other studies have done , my work demonstrated that these rabbinic interpretations and perceptions were multivocalic and often at odds with one another within and across the tradition and historical periods of redaction . Further , it appeared that early midrashim incorporated " shorthand " descriptions of the same images that were amplified in later interpretive collections . Most important , this work served as an initial demonstration of the serious consideration the ancient rabbinic voices gave to olfaction and fragrance . These voices employed the biblical terms as well as the characteristics and other features that had adhered to those terms and deployed them with finesse and subtlety in the interpretations . <p> In the midst of that project , however , I began to notice that the rabbis embedded several scent images within a single midrash . In some cases it seemed to me that this level of creativity would have required an intimate acquaintance with the initial image in order to build and layer these metaphors one on top of the other . As I moved from one midrash to the next , I began to intuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a deep cultural understanding of what particular scents meant . I began to wonder whether some of the rabbis might have had firsthand experience with these particular smells and whether the force of the imagery , whether it concerned erotic arousal or beatific death , came from their own intimate knowledge . While I attempted to address and incorporate some of the cultural questions that arose during the course of the initial project , it became increasingly clear that this avenue of investigation was better suited to another study , which has become this book . <p> In this book I investigate the relevant history , archaeology , and cultural data that serve to enlarge and deepen our understanding of these remarkable rabbinic interpretations . Although I am not formally trained in history , archaeology , or anthropology , I believe that work in these areas is of critical importance to students of texts if we want to comprehend the full scope and profundity of any given rabbinic interpretation . This work uncovers and organizes the social science data , reviews the biblical texts , and then turns its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words and associations of the biblical text , the mores of the larger society , and the experience of the rabbis themselves shape the interpretations , their images , and their didactic force . <p> Some readers will find ample rationale for this study in the synthesis of information and methods from a variety of disciplines . Such an interdisciplinary pursuit has the potential to inform not only the literary analysis , thereby presenting a more complete picture of the texts , but also may change how we understand the history and daily life of the rabbis of the late Roman and early Byzantine periods ( roughly the second through the fifth century C.E. ) . But there are those who will no doubt question the value of such a study , and still others who may applaud interdisciplinary pursuits of one kind or another but see little value in studying the concept of aroma in rabbinic literature . It is true that the rabbis did not use scent as an organizing principle in either of the Talmuds , and they have no overarching opinion , theory , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why pleasant aroma in particular ? <p> First , odor , whether pleasing or foul , enters almost every aspect of our livesits subtle pervasiveness affects our attitudes and judgments toward both the mundane and the sacred . In the rabbinic worldview , where almost every daily activity became a locus of theological discussion , interpretation , or legislation , aroma was quite naturally part of the discourse . Second , olfaction is one of the primary modes of interaction and communication with God in the Hebrew Bible . Each properly performed sacrifice is described as a " soothing odor before the Lord , " and Gods chosen leaders are identified through anointing with perfumed oil . Both king and savior are referred to as messiah , " anointed one . " Even the Bibles most secular book , the Song of Songs , is replete with sensual images of wafting perfume and seductive spices . The rabbis of the late Roman and early Byzantine periods , who inherited and transformed many of these biblical images in order to express their own theology and values , lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and carried a variety of cultural meanings . To ignore scentwhere it appears in the interpretive texts or in the social world of the rabbisis to exclude one of the most pervasive and influential themes of rabbinic discourse . I would also argue that the study of the foul is just as important as that of the fragrant , but limits on time , space , and the readers endurance require that this subject be addressed elsewhere . <p> Problems in the Study of Odor <p> As important as this undertaking is to the field of the history of Judaism specifically and of religion more generally , it is also rife with difficulties . Our understanding of ancient cultures is most commonly derived from an interpretation of their material remains and history . Spices and perfumed oils do not endure over long periods of time , however , and the destruction of incense , through burning , is integral to its employment . Only the containers ( bottles , jars , burners ) or implements of formulation ( oil presses , mortars and pestles , molds ) of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to this the nature of archaeological science , in which only a few select sites can be thoroughly excavated , and the evidence from the material record becomes quite sparse . Further , our construction of social history for the ancient world is derived in large measure from the interpretation of textual sources . Issues surrounding source selection and interpretation are only the beginning of the difficulties the social scientist faces . For the literary researcher who wishes to study olfaction and fragrance , even language becomes a problem . <p> Intuitively , one may understand scent images as categorically different from auditory or visual descriptions . Scents are most often described by simile , metaphor , or metonym . While this may be true for visual and auditory images as well , further description of those images is also possible . The visual simile " her cheeks are like pink roses " can be described further by elucidating the details of " her cheeks " or of " pink roses . " The additional descriptions may include the aspects of softness , size , or precise hue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are almost impossible to grasp if one has not previously experienced the scent . A bar of soap may smell like a rose , but it is difficult to describe precisely what " rose " smells like to anyone who has not already experienced this fragrance , and further descriptions of the object will seek to include visual , tactile , or other perceptual clues of the " bar " or " soap " rather than of the " rose . " <p> Without an aesthetic lexicon for aromas , a textual analysis may be reduced to simple repetition of the text . In addition , concentration on the memory of a visual image enables the subject to see the image in his or her mind . Scent does not lend itself to this kind of memory . Most of us can not smell the fragrance of an orange by mentally concentrating on the idea of an orange . In literature spanning several centuries , continents , and cultures , however , the emotional and recollective reaction to specific scents , such as Marcel Prousts reaction to the madeleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to inspire consideration of scents pervasive hold on our emotions and memory . Further study on these initial problems reveals their origin in the physiological mechanics of olfaction . The nature of human olfaction , in turn , triggers several important cultural developmentsa short review of which is necessary if we are to be able to suspend the judgment of our own culture and historical moment in order to understand those of the late Roman and Byzantine periods . <p> The Physiology of Smell <p> In her popular book A Natural History of the Senses , Diane Ackerman gives one of the most lucid descriptions of olfaction : <p> Odor molecules float back into the nasal cavity behind the bridge of the nose , where they are absorbed by the mucosa containing receptor cells bearing microscopic hairs called cilia . Five million of these cells fire impulses to the brains olfactory bulb or smell center . Such cells are unique to the nose . . . . If you damage neurons in your eyes or ears , both organs will be irreparably damaged . But the neurons in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other neurons in the body , they stick right out and wave in the air current like anemones on a coral reef . <p> As one can detect from Ackermans description , the physical act of olfaction is unique in comparison with the other senses . The neurons in the nose are constantly replenished , making the sense of smell less susceptible to physical damage or the frailties of old age . In addition , since the molecules actually enter the body cavity and are deciphered directly by the brain , olfaction can be considered an unmediated activity . <p> Most scholars agree , though , that our senses are " mediated experience " ; that is , when we experience an event through our senses , our brain interprets that experience . This interpretation may involve our personal history ( our experience of that sensation before ) , our generation , our culture , our religion , or any number of factors . With olfaction , this second order of experience ( the interpretation of what we have smelled ) occurs so quickly that we experience the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation seems to disappear . <p> In part , this phenomenon may be due to the physical location in which our experience of scent resides . Once the brain encounters an odor , it sends a message directly to the limbic system , that " mysterious , ancient , and intensely emotional section of our brain in which we feel , lust , and invent . " This repository of our olfactory experiences is also the warehouse in which we store emotions and many of our deepest memories . As a result , each time we smell something familiar , emotions and memories associated with that odor return practically instantaneously . In fact , because scent is stored in the limbic system , it may have the strongest link to memory of any of the senses . Memories of our other sense experiences can almost be considered short term , because they are easily replaced or forgotten . A scent , by contrast , because it is stored in the limbic system , is better retained in the memory . <p> Because the olfactory bulb is located so " far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while sight and hearing take place in the outer ( cortical ) layer of the brain , many researchers theorize that olfaction is the " oldest " of our senses . As Ackerman observes , it is the olfactory bulb sticking right out of our ancestors heads when still swimming in the sea that became the mammals brain . These two factors , that the sense of smell is the oldest of our senses and that the experience of sight and hearing occurs in a different place in the brain , may account for the perception that olfaction is more " animal-like " than vision or hearingor at least that it was more useful to humans in their earlier developmental period . Taste can be included with smell in this respect , as it requires that the subject be close to the object ( as smell often does ) and does not exist in all its nuances and varieties without smell . On its own , taste includes only the basic sensations of salty , sweet , bitter , and sour ; it requires interaction with smell to derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two senses may have worked in tandem in early human development , given the importance of avoiding poison . Smell and taste are the two primary indicators of what should and should not be ingested . <p> The wellspring of emotions found in the limbic system may account for the disconnection between scent and language . Many researchers agree that we seem to have emotional reactions to scent far more quickly than we can articulate them . But it also appears that our inability to describe odor goes beyond this emotional reaction , for even long after we experience them , we most often describe scents by metaphor , simile , or simply naming the scent . William Miller , in his work on disgust , elaborates : <p> The lexicon of smell is very limited and usually must work by making an adjective of the thing that smells . Excrement smells like excrement , roses like a rose , rotting flesh like rotting flesh . Sometimes we attempt description by saying that rotting flesh smells like feces , or that a perfume smells like a rose . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matches the richness of distinction we make with the tactile as with squishy , oozy , gooey . . . . Odor qualifiers , if not the names of the things emitting the odor , are usually simple adjectives and nouns expressing either the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the smell , most of which merely mean bad or good smell . . . . Olfactory and gustatory reduce us to saying little more than yum or yuck . <p> In response to Miller , one might ask whether this lexical insufficiency pertains only in English ( or Hebrew or Aramaic , as I discovered ) . Dan Sperber clarifies that " even though the human sense of smell can distinguish hundreds of thousands of smells and in this regard is comparable to sight or hearing , in none of the worlds languages does there seem to be a classification of smells comparable , for example , to colour classification . " Sperber argues that unlike vision or hearing , there is no " semantic field of smells . " We know and recognize thousands of scents but have virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories . Further , Ackerman points out that with 23,040 breaths a day , we use our sense of smell almost as much as our sense of touch . We smell while we sleep , eat , exercisewhile we do everything and anything . We cant turn smell off , and we cant seem to describe it either . <p> The physiological phenomena regarding olfaction do not end where the " trail of scent " stops . Work in recent years on pheromones has shown that we are smelling even when we are not consciously aware of it . Pheromones may explain many mysteries once thought to be purely social , such as common menstrual cycles in collectives of women who either live or work together , mate selection , group leadership dynamics , and common fear responses , to name a few . Considering the physiological phenomena , researchers interest in olfaction , scents themselves , and the operation of pheromones is not surprising . Recent years have seen an avalanche of information on scent , how it operates in the human body , and which scents ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanities , though , far fewer studies have been undertaken . This is surprising , especially in the study of ancient religion and culture , where odors must have dominated rites of sacrifice . This oversight may have more to do with our own cultural attitudes toward scent than with its physiological aspects . <p> Philosophy and Psychology and the Sense of Smell <p> The study of olfaction in the humanities has been hindered largely by the inculcation of Western philosophy and early psychology into the various fields of the humanities . Nowhere is this more evident than in the study of religion , where research should include investigation of all aspects of human existence and expression : intellectual , emotional , and physical or sensorial . In fact , most definitions of religion mention " ritual " as an attribute . And what is ritual if not the physical and sensorial expression of religious belief ? If it is nothing else , " practice " is sensual . <p> In the past several years this lacuna has been greatly rectified by scholars studying the " embodiment of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until very recently studies of the senses , and specifically of olfaction , were often considered frivolous , even laughable , by many scholars of these two Western religious traditions . These negative attitudes can be traced back to a history of devaluation of the senses in Western philosophy and psychology . With respect to philosophy , Hans Rindisbacher points out that <p> the epistemology of the senses has its origins in Plato and Aristotle . It is with Plato in particular and his forms that the emphasis in the dyad of perception and cognition is placed in favor of the latter and thus shifted from the concrete to the abstract ; and it is in the opening lines of Aristotles Metaphysics that the sense of sight is extolled in both its usefulness and its pleasure-giving function . It is Aristotle also who , by acknowledging the senses potential for both knowledge and pleasure , places them at the beginning of a road that will soon bifurcate into the cognitive-scientific and the hedonistic-aesthetic realms . With the emergence of Christianity and its ambivalent attitude , to say the least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforced and undergoes a shift in emphasis : Augustine . . . redraws the line between the disembodied , spiritual , and transcendental realm on the one hand and the corporeal , sensual , and immanent on the other . <p> This bifurcation becomes so entrenched in the predominant denominations of Christianity that it naturally enters the humanities and the study of religion by way of those who perform the research . This division , which becomes a binary oppositional organization that values the incorporeal over the corporeal , the spiritual over the sensual , and aligns rational thought with the transcendent and emotion with the immanent , seems to act subliminally upon investigators . As a result , scholars who are otherwise reasonable , open , and objective fail to see how their own values and assumptions prevent them from evaluating religious practice and belief by any other structure or in any other way . Thus , it is not surprising that the issues of " embodiment " and " the senses " are infants in the study of Western religionsparticularly the history of Judaism , which seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When the senses are studied at all , sight is the most commonly emphasized . Occasionally , one may encounter a study on " hearing , " in part because the Hebrew Bible itself tries to propagate , at least in certain sections , the idea that God is heard and not seen ( Deut 4 ) and in part because scholars of the Bible have come to understand textual traditions as having their basis in oral traditions . Until recently , however , studies on the other senses ( touch , taste , and smell ) have been rare . Rindisbacher would likely attribute this omission to the further demotion of these senses brought about by Kant and Hegel . These two philosophers include only vision and hearing in their constructions of an aesthetic realm . Hegel asserts that the " sensual in art is limited to the two theoretical senses of vision and the ear whereas olfaction , taste , and touch are barred from aesthetic enjoyment . " These three senses are linked too closely with " the material and the unmediated sensual qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetics in philosophy , it is not surprising , when one considers the interconnectedness among the various areas of the humanities , that the three " lower " senses would receive less attention than vision and hearing in the field of religion . Olfaction becomes linked with matter , rather than intellectual complexity , and is therefore less interesting to religious scholars . Philosophy alone , however , is not responsible for the neglect of the study of scent . The discipline of psychology and the Western cultural construct of " good taste " that evolved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have also played significant roles . <p> The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of writing and research on scent , as a rising bourgeois class became obsessed with elements of " good taste " and sanitary conditions . An increasing perception of smell ( good and bad ) in the family circle was extended to the public arena . Western society was transformed as odorsparticularly bad , offensive , and " unhealthy " odorswere scrutinized , researched , and catalogued . Attempts were made to control odors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everyday life , and what the " scientific " community responsible for public health focused on , was considered an unacceptable topic of conversation , intellectual pursuit , and possibly even literature . This trend continues today , as evidenced by the overwhelming number of deodorants and cleansers stocked in our grocery stores to rid our bodies and homes of any conceivable " bad " smell . The abundance of perfume counters and the glut of new perfumes on the market also testify to our desire to cover up unwanted body odor . Ultimately , our obsession with " bad " odors has led to the desire to create an environment that has no scent at all . While I hope to the contrary , it would seem to follow that a society that values " odorlessness " would produce scholars in the humanities who find it unnecessary , possibly unintellectual , and even undesirable to study scent . <p> Whether or not our cultures values hold sway over academic study , the study of scent in the humanities was dealt another blow when Freud and other sexual researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smell . Freud supposed that as man became more civilized , he sought to repress his erotic desires , which were constantly triggered by the scents of women . Freud pointed to mans evolution into a being who walked upright ( without " his nose to the ground " ) as the development that freed him from the scent of female genitalia . The implications of Freuds assertions are staggering . Scent , having already been connected to the " sensual , " devalued as an aesthetic category , and relegated to the corporeal , now became entwined with the erotic and animalistic . By virtue of this association , aroma was relegated to the dark recesses of the human mind and body and consigned to the uncivilized , bestial worldthe world that was repressed in the civilizing process and that required vigilant suppression . By standards of " good taste " and polite society , discussion of the erotic , much less erotic behavior , became taboo among the cultural and intellectual elite . <p> The study of scent came to be an area of research on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms . Repression of the erotic thus took place at both the individual and the social level . Scent took on an added stigma given its liminal nature and our inability to control leaking odors , particularly bodily odors . Freuds view of smell caused studies of scent in connection to psychology to focus on pathology : sexual dysfunction , disease , and mental illness . An understanding of human development that transformed the nose into an anachronistic sexual organ that had to be repressed was easily translated into a theory that humans do not need their sense of smell , or need it less than they did in earlier stages of development . As a result , people with a keen sense of smell could be considered less human and more akin to the animals who are unable to repress their sexual desires . <p> It is noteworthy that some academics have feminized the study of olfaction . It makes sense to them that a woman would study scent because , as a few of them have remarked , " women have a keener sense of smell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion . I can only surmise that this view is the result of those links forged early on by philosophy and psychology that connected aroma , the erotic , and the feminine . Other scholars sidestep the issues surrounding the eroticism of smell and maintain that our olfaction does not work as well as it did in ancient times . Proponents of this theory seem to have absorbed a " lay " understanding of Darwinism , coupled with an obvious misconception of history . Nevertheless , the number of academics who claim that humans are not able to smell as well as they used to is astoundingespecially since there is no scientific evidence for this view . Smell is an adaptive sense , which means that our ability to detect odor may be infinite ! <p> But the philosophers and psychologists were not all wrong . Some of their rational and intuitive assessments of olfaction have been verified by scientific discoveries on the neurological aspects of smell . The philosophers were correct in describing olfaction as categorically different from vision and hearing . These two senses first appear at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance from the object of discernment , and their language pathways seem to be more developed . On this last point , the philosophers correctly ascertained that we have few methods for organizing ideas about scent ; we lack a " lexicon " for categorizing scents . And just as smell is the oldest of the senses , it is also a direct experience in terms of the molecules entering deeply into the body . That the memory of a scent is stored in the limbic system , " the seat of emotion , " means that both the philosophers and Freud were fair in their assessment of scent as difficult to intellectualize , or as in some way related to the " unmediated sensual qualities of matter . " Our responses to scent are tied directly to emotions that are not easily articulated , and memories associated with scent are also very strong and often associated with early childhood experiences , whether positive or negative . Freud was not wrong in positing a connection between scent and the repression of feelings and desires , a normal part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining a connection between scent and the erotic ; this has been verified by the scientific discovery of pheromones . As a result of scents special liminality in the psyche and body , its unwieldy ephemerality , and the development of our own cultural prejudices , the lack of research until recently is not so surprising . But now that physical , biological , and social scientific research on scent and olfaction is " blossoming , " the time has come to look at this important sense perception in terms of its cultural , historical , and religious significance . <p> Studies of Scent <p> Many influences have contributed to recent studies on olfaction and aroma . The postmodern period has witnessed a new trend toward individualism and a blurring of the lines between pop and high culture . The line between the biological and social sciences has also eroded , as a resurgence of scientific study on scent and pheromones continues to uncover the physiological , emotional , and psychological importance of scent in our lives . In addition , more positive lay attitudes in the West toward scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Eastern medicine . These developments have opened new avenues of research in each of the humanities and have promoted interdisciplinary studies . A significant rise in the number of women in the academy , along with major achievements in feminist studies and theory , has also had widespread positive effects on research in virtually every area , smell and scent included . Some of the longest-standing and most misogynistic claims about women are simply read and dismissed without hesitation , thereby inviting us to investigate the same material with new methods and from different viewpoints . <p> Several excellent studies have been published on aroma . Each has a unique focus and methodology , and almost all have supplied valuable insight and data for this project . Works on social history by Alain Corbin and William Ian Miller have encouraged me to reflect on the daily lives of the ancient rabbis . In addition , Miller has explored the changes we may experience psychologically when some action , object , or type of behavior moves from the public to the private sphere . What prompts disgust at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy , particularly sexual intimacy . By analogy , this line of thinking is helpful in considering many different unpleasant and agreeable odors . I have also found helpful Hans Rindisbachers literary analysis of the operation of smell in nineteenth- and twentieth-century German literature . Remarkably , the triangulation of scent , eros , and thanatos that he perceives in German literature appears in some rabbinic midrashim . In addition , Aroma : The Cultural History of Smell , by Constance Classen , David Howes , and Anthony Synnott , demonstrates the deep connections of history , culture , and religion with fragrance . The authors also address the question of how culture-specific our evaluation of scent can be ; one culture may identify a scent as abhorrent while another finds it pleasurable . Such reversals and inversions appear in rabbinic literature as well . Finally , an important article by David Howes , " Olfaction and Transition , " helped me to clarify my thinking about olfaction , ritual and life transitions , and perfume and liminality . <p> A handful of sense-specific studies on the Bible , Judaism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of these is Susan Ashbrook Harveys Scenting Salvation : Ancient Christianity and the Olfactory Imagination . I assumed that as I moved toward the later rabbinic literature , I would find that the later rabbis had less direct experience with incense and perfume than their earlier Roman-period counterparts . The Roman Empire , with its vast employment of spices for adorning the body , fumigation , and sacrifices to the gods , changed fundamentally under Christian leadership . But Harvey maintains that although the early church fathers may have had ambivalent attitudes toward perfuming the body , incense and perfume were used liberally in the Christian communities of the East , particularly from the fourth century onward . This discovery demanded that I reconsider the late Palestinian material , which until then I thought had been a period of aromatic unadornment . It also encouraged me to reevaluate the Babylonian material , as I realized that Babylonia would have had continual access to these spices long before , during , and after the Sassanid dynasty and the corresponding height of the Roman and Byzantine periods in Palestine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BTatrice Caseau , and the strong tie between perfume and medicine in the ancient worldalso evident in the rabbinic literature . <p> I hope that this volume will add to an ever-expanding discussion of the senses , and the role of olfaction more specifically , in the history of religion . Although the rabbis use of aromatics is primarily nonritualistic , rabbinic interpretations reveal deeply encoded cultural constructions of what perfume , incense , and spice represent . In some cases , as in the midrash on R. Eliezer with which this introductory chapter begins , understanding the midrash depends entirely on these structures . This study thus seeks to unpack the layers of these midrashim by demonstrating how scent operates in them . To that end I have relied on a methodology that combines literary contextual analysis with an examination of the role of aromatics in the society in which these texts were produced . <p> Method and Organization <p> The sheer number of passages concerning scent and the difficulty in deciphering the meanings behind these literary and cultural representations require a system of categorization and evaluation . Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my analysis of rabbinic texts reveals a profoundly complex social encoding of scent images and layering of the ideas , or valences , that adhere to those images . Perfume , for example , which is often associated with romance , sexuality , and tranquility , can be viewed quite positively when referring to God ( with attendant images of mercy and memory ) but may have strong negative associations ( witchcraft and idolatry ) when applied to women . <p> Rabbinic images of fragrance ( most often articulated by means of perfume , incense , and spice ) and their attendant characteristics ( good , bad , dangerous , erotic ) are not purely literary productions , however . The perfumed substances and their environments ( people , bathhouses , altars ) are part of the realia of daily life . As such , they possess and attract distinct characteristics and valences of their own , and these too find their way into the literature . As a result , a thorough understanding of everyday practices involving fragrance is critical to unraveling the full meaning of the texts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archaeological record and the textual sources . Fortunately , a solid pathway has been trudged by several experts in late antique Jewish written and material evidence , and this allows us to form a synthesized understanding of the culture . By reading literature alongside historical , archaeological , and social evidence , these scholars have transformed our understanding of the cultural landscape of rabbinic Judaism . <p> Several literary and historical studies have noted that rabbinic literature , both halakhic ( legal ) and aggadic ( nonlegal ) , often reveals the worldview of the rabbis themselves , or at least their desire that the world be seen in a particular way . And these rabbinic attitudes and viewpoints often stand in sharp contrast to how the world actually operated . For example , historians have raised the issue of self-referential rabbinic ascendancy for times during which the political situation must have been otherwise . Other investigations have demonstrated rabbinic accommodation to widespread practice , the preponderance of legislation that was probably ignored by the Jewish community , and the unreliability of the rabbinic interpretation of history . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the rabbis lived , then , we need to examine the broad external evidence and compare it to the archaeological , historical , and social record of the immediate culture . First and foremost , however , we must choose which rabbis to study and find out where and when they lived . The large group of midrashim taken up later in this volume is found primarily in the books of Genesis Rabbah and Song of Songs Rabbah.Genesis Rabbah is a collection of interpretations that follow the biblical book of Genesis line by line . It was redacted in Palestine during the fifth century C.E. but incorporates much earlier material . Song of Songs Rabbah , by contrast , which interprets its biblical namesake , was probably not redacted before the middle of the sixth century C.E. Although Songs Rabbah is considered a somewhat late compilation , its sources also include much older material ( from the Mishnah , several baraitot , the Palestinian Talmud , and , most important , Genesis Rabbah ) . The interpretations cross numerous generations of rabbis , primarily from the third through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interests and opinions . In light of the strong presence of Palestinian tradents in this literature , combined with the redaction of the Mishnah , Tosefta , and Talmud Yerushalmi in Palestine , those cities , towns , and villages that had significant Jewish populations and most likely a rabbinic presence during these centuries seem to be the best places to study . This study thus focuses on the cities of Caesarea , Tiberias , and Sepphoris , as well as smaller Jewish towns such as Meiron , Gush-Halav , and Beit Shearim from approximately the second through the fifth century C.E. <p> As has often been noted , the term " rabbis " is problematic because it implies a group in universal agreement on many , if not all , issues . As almost every aspect of rabbinic literature so far studied has revealed , however , particular rabbis and groups of rabbis had particular views , often in sharp disagreement with one another . Thus , it is not unreasonable to assume that the rabbis disagreed about issues surrounding fragrance or that their views changed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature , as well as across geographic regions . When and in what manner aromatic spices should be used , or whether the employment of incense and perfume by gentiles could have a negative influence on Jews are two questions about which there was undoubtedly disagreement . In her work on scent in early Christianity , Harvey discusses the variety of opinions about , and reactions to , perfume among the early church fathers . Although attitudes as strident as those of some of the church fathers appear only occasionally in rabbinic literature , negative opinions are expressed and occasionally forcefully argued . More common , however , is the absence of opinion on fragrances and their employment , and in these cases the literary material should be read neither prescriptively nor proscriptively . <p> Nevertheless , the general outlook that may be derived from the literary and material evidence indicates widespread familiarity with , acceptance of , and employment of pleasurable aromas on the part of the rabbis and their communities . To that end , chapter 2 reviews the cultural , archaeological , and literary evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods ( the rabbinic periods most closely aligned with the late Roman and early Byzantine periods ) in Palestine . This evidence is organized around the contexts of daily life in which fumigants could be found : the marketplace , the bath , the home , and burial . In this chapter I seek to draw as complete a picture as possible of the everyday uses of spices . Not only do rabbinic customs , rituals , and attitudes surrounding aromatics conform in large measure to those of the wider society , but these everyday uses , experiences , and attitudes often underlie and serve as the impetus for the metaphors and images incorporating scent that are deployed in rabbinic interpretive texts . <p> Examination of the material and cultural underpinnings of daily life and the sensory experience of scent in this period lays the groundwork for the subsequent chapters . The literary analysis in succeeding chapters is informed by discussion of everyday practices such as bathing , eating , fumigating garments , and burial , as well as by broader issues , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban life . In addition , chapter 3 departs slightly from rabbinic issues to review the scent images found in the Hebrew Bible and to explore how inner-biblical reinterpretation combines erotic metaphors about perfume with those of sacred incense , primarily in the books of the Prophets . Although this chapter appears to take several steps backward , historically speaking , its method of literary analysis conforms closely to that employed in the subsequent chapters on midrash , and it focuses on the key passages and images that form the basis for rabbinic interpretations involving fragrance , primarily from Song of Songs . For this reason I have placed chapter 3 just before my analyses of rabbinic interpretation . <p> Chapter 4 presents the variety of scent interpretations that the sages of the rabbinic period employed in their elucidations of key values about people , places , and history . For example , the rabbis interpret Song of Songs , in which the young woman describes her beloved as flowing myrrh , while he describes her as a garden of spicy delights , allegorically as referring to the relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation assigns the role of the beloved variously to biblical characters ( Abraham and Jacob ) , the righteous of the world , and even the rabbis themselves . These interpretations are heavily laden with fragrance imagery and reveal deep-seated feelings among the rabbis . The section in chapter 4 on perfume and " the other , " for example , illuminates rabbinic attitudes toward women ( both as virtuous and as licentious ) by means of perfume . Likewise , the rabbis subtly compare the aroma of perfume and the substance of perfumed oil so as to raise questions of who is righteous and how rabbis should behave . <p> Because rabbinic literature transforms so many biblical images of perfume , spices , and love into images of erotic death or sacrifice and eventual redemption , chapter 5 assesses rabbinic material concerned specifically with sacrifice , death , and martyrdom . Here the " bundle of myrrh " worn by the beloved in Song of Songs is transformed into the suffering servant , whose death by fire serves as both atoning sacrifice and redemption for Israel . <p> Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking primarily at how we might reconsider rabbinic theology in light of both the material-cultural evidence and rabbinic literary constructions of the erotic , death , and suffering . During the fourth century C.E. , we see not only a rise in the use of aromatic imagery but also a new thread of this imagery that views Israels persecution as inherent in her intimate relationship with God .

Most of contemporary political philosophy has been nurtured by his seminal ideas and can be understood either as a follow-up or a criticism and reaction against them . Thus , no student or scholar of the discipline can ignore them . ( Audard 2007 , 1 ) <p> By providing a chronological overview of English-language feminist engagements with Rawls from A Theory of Justice ( TJ ) onward , this " biography of a bibliography " displays the range of issues canvassed by feminist readers of Rawls as well as their wide disagreement about the value of his corpus for feminist purposes . As we shall see , feminist responses to Rawlss first articulation of his theory of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This early debate coalesced around such themes as whether his principles of justice extend to family relations ; what it requires for a family to be just ; and what lessons about justice children receive within families . The consensus was that whereas Rawls failed to exploit the feminist potential of his theorizing , it was there for others to explicate . Feminist responses to Rawlss work after his turn to political liberalism are more numerous and more polarized , with one side arguing that this turn has largely stripped justice as fairness of its feminist potential , and the other finding political liberalism to be replete with resources for addressing feminist concerns . In this phase of the debate , Rawlss feminist interlocutors examine whether efforts to accommodate reasonable pluralism compromise and constrain the feminist potential of justice as fairness . In doing so , they ask what qualifies as a reasonable comprehensive doctrine and how Rawls configures the public-private demarcation . They consider what political liberalisms appeal to public reason offers feminists and ponder whether justice as fairness evinces any awareness of the ways in which girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and whether Rawls provides any measures to combat such self-interpretations of lesser worth . This introductions survey of feminist engagements with Rawls also sets the stage for introducing the eight chapters in the current volume , chapters that testify to the continuing ambivalence among feminist readers about the value of Rawlss work . <p> Responses to TJ <p> Feminist engagement with TJ began with Jane Englishs 1977 article " Justice Between Generations , " which responds to Rawlss attempt to address the problem of intergenerational justice by making the parties in the original position ( OP ) heads of families rather than individuals . Encouraging them to consider the interests of the next generation gives these choosers a more than simply self-interested perspective focused exclusively on the present . However , in Englishs estimation , this solution to the problem of getting one generation to save for the benefit of the next creates other problems . It is , for instance , inconsistent with Rawlss wider theoretical approach , which strives to minimize motivational assumptions ( English 1977 , 9293 ) . Rawls also fails to indicate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not address how much they are willing to sacrifice in the present for their childrens benefit ( 94 ) . English also fears that if thinking in the OP takes the family , rather than the individual , as its basic unit , Rawls could effectively endorse some utilitarian-style calculi about overall costs and benefits in a way that violates his insistence upon the importance of each individual . Yet such an insistence is a major rationale for his rejection of utilitarianism in the first place ( 9496 ) . Making parties in the OP heads of families rather than individuals also troubles Rawlss account of justice within the family ( 91 ) and could legitimate sexist principles in the OP ( 94 ) . English likens Rawls to Hegel when it comes to the family , because he seems to depict the family as a sphere of love and affection rather than justice ( 95 ) . <p> Deborah Kearns elaborates on this point , inferring that " Rawls assumes love and the family unit to be so natural that he excludes them from the scope of the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 ) . Placing the family beyond justice claims makes the two principles of justice applicable to the public realm only ( 39 ) . Rawls never defines what he means by the family , but he seems to assume that it is a natural grouping and that its heterosexual , nuclear form is its natural form ( 38 ) . He seems , further , to accept that moral development differs according to gender ( 37 ) , with male and female children growing up with different experiences and expectations based on gender ( 36 , 40 ) . For Kearns , a family lacking justice is not well equipped to inculcate a sense of justice in its children ( 36 , 40 , 41 ) . She concludes that " Rawlss whole theory is thus flawed from its very inception . An unjust family structure can not produce just citizens " ( 36 ) . <p> Like English and Kearns , Karen Green fears that Rawlss depiction of those in the OP as heads of families betrays a traditional understanding of the public-private separation that could be inimical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those in the OP might have as they imagine who they will be once the veil of ignorance is lifted ( Green 1986 , 2829 ) . Yet women who conceive , bear , and nurture children are necessarily less free than the men who father them ( 2930 ) . However , just as it restricts natural liberty , so raising children brings benefits such as the fulfillment that comes from an intimate relationship with another human and the ability to transmit ones culture and conception of the good to the next generation ( 30 ) . Contractors in the OP would wish to take this asymmetry into account by restricting both mens liberty to remove themselves from the reproductive process immediately after the sex act and womens monopoly on the benefits of raising children . Evincing more hope than Kearns does about the feminist potential of Rawlsian thought , Green offers a reading of the first principle of justice that would not only accommodate this need " to choose principles of justice appropriate for regulating a shared responsibility for and enjoyment of members of the younger generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radical feminist restructuring of family relations " ( 32 ; cf. 35 ) <p> Susan Moller Okin brings Rawlsian thought to bear on the debate between the ethic of care and the ethic of justice , which had been ignited by Carol Gilligans 1982 book In a Different Voice ( Okin 1989b , 24647 ) . Rawls seems , prima facie , to belong to the " ethic of justice " camp , for his approach to moral psychology can easily be read as rationalist , individualist , and abstract ( 230 ) . However , Okin discerns " a voice of responsibility , care and concern for others " ( 230 ; cf. 23638 , 245 ) at the center of his thinking about justice , insisting that " feelings such as empathy and benevolence are at the very foundation of his principles of justice " ( 238 ) . The emotional intelligence needed in the OP includes a capacity for empathy , for imagination , for thinking about difference , a willingness to listen to other points of view , and an ability to consider others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for them ( 246 ; cf. 24445 , 24748 ) . <p> With her 1989 book Justice , Gender , and the Family ( JGF ) , Okin produced the most sustained feminist response to TJ . Offering a feminist appraisal of Rawlss work , chapter 5 , " Justice as Fairness : For Whom ? " ( 89109 ) , issues a mixed review . Okins first complaint is that TJ gives no indication that " modern liberal society . . . is deeply and pervasively gender-structured " ( 89 ; cf. 91 ) . Neglect of gender is also evident in Rawlss initial failure to stipulate that parties in the OP would be ignorant of their gender ( 91 ) . While Okin applauds Rawls for including the family in his theory of justice , he fails to develop this promising beginning into any reflection on what justice within the family requires . Whereas Kearns read Rawls to be removing the family from considerations of justice , Okin sees him as carelessly assuming the family to be just . In doing so , he prematurely and illegitimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family looks like and requires ( 22 , 94 , 97 , 108 ; cf. Okin 1989b , 23738 , 249 ) . Okin echoes Englishs suspicion that a conventional view of the family has been smuggled into his theory , and reiterates her charge that the family is " opaque to claims of justice " ( English 1977 , 75 , cited in JGF , 94 ; cf. 95 ; cf. Okin 1989b , 23031 , 235 , 239 ) . <p> On the plus side , however , Okin finds considerable feminist promise and tries to exploit this in ways that Rawls had not ( JGF , 90 ) . She maintains that " a consistent and wholehearted application of Rawlss liberal principles of justice can lead us to challenge fundamentally the gender system of our society " ( 89 ) . In addition to the conception of justice as requiring both reason and emotion , discussed above , three encouraging aspects are ( 1 ) the location of the family in the basic structure , ( 2 ) the device of the OP , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major school of citizens moral development . Rawlss explicit inclusion of the family in the basic structure suggests that the family should be examined and criticized in light of the demands of justice . Including the family in this structure also confounds the traditional liberal reading of the public-private distinction , for this theory of justice applies to public institutions and to the family , which traditionally has been deemed private ( 93 , 9697 ) . Assuming the veil of ignorance should require those in the OP to consider what sort of family life is most compatible with a just society . If ignorant of their gender , and formulating principles of justice relevant to the family , they would craft a society that disadvantages no one on the basis of gender ( 101 , 105 ) . Finally , Rawls recognizes , officially at least , the central role the family plays in producing and reproducing a just society . <p> Agreeing with Okin , Linda McClain identifies the many ways in which Rawls thinks of individuals as connected to , and caring for and about , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives , and their norms of response and reciprocity " appear in his thinking ( McClain 199192 , 1204 ; cf. 12069 , 1214 , 121718 ) . McClain does not find that Rawls operates with an implicitly masculine image of the atomistic individual who is disconnected from others , self-interested , and competitive , and who prioritizes rights over responsibilities . That charge is based on a misunderstanding of the OP , which is simply a thought experiment ; it is not freighted with ontological commitments ( 12045 ) . McClain further suggests that the dichotomies between rights and responsibilities , justice and care , and masculine and feminine experience that structure some of the feminist criticism of liberalism are not illuminating when interpreting Rawls ( 1215 , 1217 , 1263 ) . She holds that Rawlss actual view of personsthat they are capable of assessing and revising their conceptions of the goodcan be beneficial for women , allowing them to review " whether certain kinds of connection , at the familial or community level , are desirable and not oppressive " ( 1206 ) . <p> Lara Trout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on economic interests to the neglect of other types of interest that can be salient . Rawls does not acknowledge " that least advantaged could entail more than ones economic starting point in society " ( Trout 1994 , 44 ) . His conceptualization of the " relevant social position " therefore manifests " an insensitivity toward the proper representation of minorities and women " ( 39 ) . Noneconomic interests " are grounded in a persons self-respect " ( 40 ) , which makes Trouts charge that Rawls ignores them a powerful one , given that self-esteem is an important primary good for him ( 41 ) . Trouts answer to her own question " can justice as fairness accommodate diversity ? " is " yes it can , even though it currently does not . " Like many of the first responses to TJ , Trouts critique is immanent : she criticizes Rawls for failing to give one of his own claims the theoretical attention it deserves . <p> Responses to Political Liberalism <p> A major development in Rawlss thinking about justice in the wake of TJ was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that justice as fairness was a purely political doctrine . Born of his greater attention to pluralism in a liberal society , this innovation manifested Rawlss ambition to make justice as fairness applicable and appealing to people holding a wide variety of worldviews and moral positions . The source of this pluralism in a liberal society is freedom : in a society that respects and promotes the basic civil and political freedoms , individuals inevitably generate different and ultimately conflicting worldviews and moral positions ( PL , xviii ) . Any liberal approach to justice that fails to create maximum room for such pluralism is therefore deeply flawed . Thus , in a series of essays published after TJ , culminating in PL in 1993 , Rawls carves out a form of liberalism that is an exclusively political doctrine . All justice as fairness needs is an overlapping consensus on the principles of right , leaving individuals free to live according to their own values in other areas , assuming that these positions are reasonable . <p> One of the first feminist responses to this shift came from John Exdell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly adverse , effects on its feminist potential ( Exdell 1994 , 450 , 461 ) . A principal aim of political liberalism is to minimize controversy about the principles of justice , which makes Rawlss approach more conservative than would be acceptable to feminists who challenge many accepted beliefs about womens ( and mens ) roles and status . This conservatism is compounded by Rawlss ambition to ground the principles of political liberalism in the shared meanings of the public culture ( 459 ) . The reach of political liberalism is limited , too , for it is formulated for the public-political realm , respecting pluralism by leaving citizens free to live according to their own beliefs and choices in the private sphere ( 442 , 460 ) . While this has the desired effect of making political liberalism attractive to religious fundamentalists , it offers no support to feminist attempts to make standards of justice applicable to the family ( 442 ) and to increase womens liberty , agency , autonomy , and equality . Exdell identifies a number of philosophical and policy questions where feminism and fundamentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalism effectively , even if unwittingly , lends support to the latter rather than the former . <p> Exdell concedes that political liberalism might not be wholly bereft of feminist resourcesRawls requires that all members of the well-ordered society be educated about their rights and liberties , which includes the freedom to leave groups they find oppressive or uncongenial and to develop their own conception of the good . This creates some space for an education in girls and womens equality and autonomy and could justify some feminist policies to promote womens independence ( 1994 , 45354 ) . But at best this points to Rawlss ambivalence about how tightly the public can be separated from the private , and it is ultimately defeated by his conception of public reason , which relies upon values and beliefs widely shared by the citizenry ( 460 ) . <p> Linda Hirshman answers the question " Is the original position inherently male-superior ? " with a resounding yes . She expresses amazement at Rawlss ability to ignore feminist responses to his work in particular , and feminist scholarship about the social contract tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially critical of his " amputation of the public sphere from the rest of life " ( 1861 , 1865 ) ; his confinement of justice issues to the state ( 186263 ) ; and his " metaphysical assumption of a moral psychology of autonomous individualism " ( 1861 , 1865 , 1868 ) . Although she does not cite Exdells work , Hirshman also castigates PLs attempt to accommodate religious doctrines , for she sees the revival of Christian fundamentalism in American society as driven by regressive views of race and gender ( 186465 ) . Any approach to justice that focuses on appealing to such views has , in effect , to legitimate inegalitarian doctrines . <p> Conducting a Rawlsian thought experiment of her own , with some " tough-minded " Hobbesian realism thrown in ( 1877 ) , Hirshman rethinks " the social-contract scenario from the distaff side " ( 1875 ) . Implicitly endorsing Okins suggestion that the OP offers a fruitful way of thinking about justice for women , Hirshman imagines how contractors behind the veil of ignorance would think , were it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Although she does not cite Greens work , she echoes its concern that , being physically smaller and weaker and rendered vulnerable by childbirth and nursing , females will be handicapped when contracts are imagined among equal and autonomous individuals . Hirshman identifies two major entailments of those in the OP , imagining that they might be women once the veil was lifted . " First , the application of the principles of justice could not possibly be limited to the official coercive agencies of the state , but would penetrate to the most intimate human relationships . This is vital for feminist purposes because many of the threats to womens liberty , equality , and security , such as rape , sexual abuse , and sex discrimination in the work place , emanate from non-state contexts " ( 187576 ) . Second , rational contractors who knew they might end up as women would not be willing to bargain as individuals but would insist upon collective action to compensate for their physical disadvantages ( 1868 , 187374 , 1877 ) . <p> Rawlss shift to a doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 , 23 ) . On the plus side is his express claim that his principles of justice cover questions of gender equality ( PL , xxix ) . Yet this claim remains underdeveloped , and Okin wonders whether he is offering women merely formal or more substantive equality ( 1994 , 25 , 3941 ) . Moreover , several areas of concern outweigh this positive feature . The family appears to have been consigned to the private realm ( 26 ) , and Okin wonders whether Rawls retains any concern with justice within it , noting the reduced attention accorded to the familys role in forging a just society ( 23 , 26 , 28 , 3334 , 37 ) . Okin also fears that Rawls is willing to accommodate sexist doctrines under the rubric of reasonable comprehensive doctrines ( 2931 ) . Like Exdell , whose analysis she praises ( 23n1 ) , Okin observes that Rawlss toleration of a wide range of comprehensive doctrines clashes with the promotion of gender equality ( 28 ) . Tolerating comprehensive doctrines that advocate gender inequality is not a good training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to the political realm , justice as fairness requires that women be treated as free and equal . The friction between a comprehensive view of men and women as unequal and a political doctrine premised on womens equality would be significant , with the message that children learn in the household conflicting directly with the stance they must endorse as citizens ( 29 ) . Like Exdell , Okin finds hope in the fact that schools are required to provide civic education , exposing children to the idea of citizens as free and equal , for this could mitigate sexist lessons inculcated in the home ( 3132 ) . Overall , though , the feminist potential that Okin identified in TJ seems to have diminished radically in Rawlss turn to political liberalism ( 25 ) . <p> Sharon Lloyd addresses some of Okins criticisms of political liberalism . What makes a comprehensive doctrine reasonable is its unwillingness to use state power to impose its views on others , so a sexist or racist doctrine that did not seek to use the state in this way could qualify as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Rawls also tolerates inegalitarian conceptions of marriage , so long as the marriage has been entered into , and can be left , voluntarily . Lloyd thus effectively concedes the validity of some of Okins concerns about political liberalism . But when Okin suggests that Rawls is uninterested in the justice of the family , Lloyd doubts that she has correctly understood the relationship between the principles of justice and the basic structure . These principles are not designed to apply directly to each and every institution within that structure , but rather to the operations of the system as a whole , to the outcomes of the interactions among its constituent institutions . What matters is that the operations of the institutions of the basic structure , when taken together , comply with the principles of justice ( 1994 , 35859 ; 1995 , 1327 ) . <p> Lloyd contends that Rawls is , in the interests of pluralism , indifferent to the form the family takes : all that matters is that it effectively prepare children for membership in a just society ( 1994 , 35859 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him insouciant toward family dynamics , however , or toward all forms of injustice within the family ( 1994 , 361 ; 1995 , 1331 ) . A family in which the rights of one member were violated by another would be unacceptable . This precludes one family members selling another into slavery , depriving him or her of civil and political liberties , and assaulting and battering him or her ( 1994 , 358 ; 1995 , 1327 ) . Children can not be neglected or abused and must be educated in the rights and duties of citizenship ( 1994 , 362 ; 1995 , 1332 ) . Additional requirements for the family to be just include the aforementioned freedom to marry ; guarantees of equitable division of material assets and parental support upon divorce ; publicly provided or subsidized child care ; family leave and flexible working hours ; comparable worth policies in the workplace ; and affirmative action for women and their equal access to equally good jobs ( 1994 , 36162 ; 1995 , 133132 ) . Lloyd concludes that " all of these measures taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and affirm sexist beliefs about natural hierarchy " ( 1994 , 362 ; 1995 , 1332 ) . Being raised in such a family could damage girls and womens sense of equality and their capacity for justice , and this should pose a problem for Rawls ( 1994 , 36366 ; 1995 , 133338 ) . Lloyd suggests , however , that people can acquire a sense of gender justice despite being raised in households that do not practice or promote gender equality ( 1994 , 36465 , 369 ; 1995 , 1336 , 134142 ) . <p> Kimberly Yuracko would agree with Lloyds interpretation of Rawlss tolerance of inegalitarian gender doctrines in the family . But as the second half of her articles title implies , she is very critical of this . Yurackos " Towards Feminist Perfectionism : A Radical Critique of Rawlsian Liberalism " ( 1995 ) objects that some of the comprehensive doctrines that Rawls would accept as reasonable encourage girls and women to think of themselves as subordinate . Although the basic structure transcends the standard public-private divide by including the family , PL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere " ( Yuracko 1995 , 6 ) . But this obscures what Yuracko calls the spillover effects from the public to the private realm . What happens to individuals in the domestic sphere shapes their opportunities in other areas . If some family members carry an undue burden of unpaid domestic work , this limits their ability to participate in politics or other activities ( 79 ; cf. 3 ) . Spillover effects also occur in more subjective registers , such as womens preferences and self-esteem ( 3 , 12 ) . Yuracko effectively echoes Trouts claim that Rawls attends to socioeconomic disadvantage while ignoring other forms of disadvantage and exclusion ( 13 ) . She evinces skepticism about the sufficiency of his insistence that all children receive a civic education in their rights and duties as citizens , fearing that this is unlikely to go far enough in combating the effects of socialization in gender inequality ( 1011 , 13 , 1718 , 3235 ) . Rawlsian liberalism is incapable of addressing the serious barrier to gender equality created by " internalized gender-based conceptions of the self " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conflicting comprehensive doctrines , a feminist approach to justice requires " an affirmative endorsement of the values and behaviors that are necessary for a normative vision of gender equality " ( 3 ; cf. 4 , 31 , 4142 , 48 ) . <p> Amy Baehr ( 1996 , 4953 ) echoes Lloyds observation that Okin has misunderstood the role that Rawls assigns to the two principles of justice . Baehr proposes that it would be possible to make the family a more just institution without requiring the direct application of the two principles , and she points out that whatever Okins professed belief on this matter , she does not consistently apply the two principles to family life ( 61 ) . Baehr , like Yuracko , would agree with Lloyds interpretation of Rawlss tolerance of inegalitarian gender doctrines in the family under the mantle of the reasonable ( 5758 ) . This is one of the reasons why Baehr also agrees with Exdell and Okin about the diminution in feminist potential with Rawlss shift to political liberalism : he " dulls the critical edge of liberalism by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 ; cf. 50 , 5657 , 61 ) . Baehr rehearses Yurackos point about spillover effects ( which she calls seepage ) between private and public spheres making any strong separation between them untenable ( 51 , 54 , 58 ) . She concludes by tendering a Habermasian approach to the public and the private as more fruitful for feminist purposes , for Habermas deems personal and political autonomy to be " co-original , " positing that rights in the public sphere enjoy no normative priority over those in the private sphere ( 62 ) . <p> Two angles from which the question of family justice can be considered within Rawlss work are discerned by Veronique Munoz-DardT . The first is justice within the family . This part of her discussion retreads much of the ground covered in Englishs early response to Rawls . Munoz-DardT engages Okins views on the feminist potential of Rawlss work ( 1998 , 34547 ) but finds her interpretation of those in the OP practicing empathy , care , and concern for others to be problematic and even unnecessary : ignorance of their sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely that gender equality be considered as an issue of justice " ( 346 ) . The second angle scrutinizes the justice of the family as an institution . Rawls poses the radical question of whether any family form is compatible with justice , for the family compromises equal opportunity.Because belonging to one family rather than another affects childrens life prospects in myriad ways , " as long as the family exists individuals will have unequal life chances " ( 339 , emphasis in original ; cf. 335 , 338 ) . But Rawls argues against the familys abolition on the grounds that the family is the most effective way of ensuring childrens moral development ( 339 , 35051 ) . Unlike previous commentators , Munoz-DardT treats TJ and PL as a single theory ( 335n1 ) . She admits , however , that there have been changes ( 337 ) , such as Rawlss seeming to adopt a more expansive conception of the family ( 338 ) and adding gender to the slate of informational restrictions in the OP ( 340 ) . Munoz-DardT can not see how Okins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it seems to rest upon a wider comprehensive doctrine , but here she fails to acknowledge that Okins ideal was connected with TJ and that Okin herself expressed grave doubts about whether political liberalism could support it ( 347 ) . <p> The justice of the family is also taken up by Ron Mallon , who agrees that the family is at odds with Rawlss commitment in the second principle of justice to equality of opportunity ( Mallon 1999 , 273 ) . Arguing that the family can not be successfully defended in terms of its unique contribution to childrens moral development ( 27581 ) , Mallon advances an alternative defense based on the good of cultural membership ( 271 ) . Although Rawls does not make cultural membership a primary good , he should , according to Mallon ( 272 , 275 , 281 ) . Mallon sets out to show that ( 1 ) the family is a necessaryand not merely a sufficient condition for the transmission of cultural membership , and ( 2 ) the primary good of cultural membership is of sufficient weight to override @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity ( 281 , 28485 ) . Given PLs concern with a plurality of conceptions of the good , culture has to assume a significant role , for cultures host such conceptions as well as providing normative and symbolic resources for their revision ( 288 ) . Cultural membership is therefore vital to the power of personhood that Rawls associates with a capacity for a conception of the good . Rawlss restrictions on the states promoting any particular conception mean that the state could not carry out the task of transmitting cultural membership to children ( 289 ) . Consistent with Rawlss emphasis on pluralism in PL , Mallon permits a wide variety of family forms to carry out this crucial task ( 271 , 29091 ) . <p> An influential critique of Rawlsian liberalism inspired by the ethic-of-care debate was mounted by Eva Feder Kittay , who charges that its image of the liberal subject as an independent individual standing in a condition of equality relative to similar others blinds Rawlss political theory to the pervasive fact of human dependency . As children , we all experience dependency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , mental or physical disability , financial need , and old age . This fact of dependency entails the work of caring for those who are dependent . Yet this social reality is occluded in justice as fairness , rendering Rawls unable to address the fact that most of the caring work in Western societiescare in the home for dependent family members , be they children , older people , or the disabled , and caring work in hospitals and other health institutions , child-care centers , and so onis done by women . It is mostly unpaid or underpaid and always underrecognized ( Kittay 1999 , 78 , 11011 ) . Any theory of justice unable to acknowledge , let alone accommodate , the fact of dependency and its implications for those who need , as well as those who provide , care , is seriously flawed . Kittay insists that dependency " must be faced from the beginning of any project in egalitarian theory that hopes to include all persons within its scope " ( 77 , emphasis in original ) . Among the options for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are including the capacity to care as a moral power ; considering dependents and their caregivers among the least well off ; and adding a third principle of justice : " To each according to his or her need for care , from each according to his or her capacity for care , and such support from social institutions as to make available resources and opportunities to those providing care " ( 113 , emphasis in original ) . <p> Just as Okin complained that major contemporary theorists of justice were largely oblivious to gender issues ( JGF , vii , 14 , 134 ) , and as Kittay accentuates dependency relations , so Hilda Bojer observes that most contemporary theories of distributive justice ignore children ( Bojer 2000 , 2324 ) . She aims " to sketch a theoretical framework that makes it possible to take the just interests of children as children into account on an equal footing with those of adults " ( 26 ) . Rawlsian theory is the only approach that can assist Bojer , but even then she must spell out its " radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ( 30 ) . If those behind the veil did not know whether they would be children or adults , the conditions of childhood would be taken very seriously , given how weak children are as a group . The important impact that childhood has on the adult that one becomes also urges that it be taken seriously by rational contractors ( 35 ) . Although Bojer does not engage the debate about the family as an impediment to equal opportunity , one of her conclusions is compatible with that concern : " The right nutrition , preventive health care , education . . . must be ensured for every child in the just society , in my interpretation of Rawls , independently of their parents income or merits " ( 37 ) . <p> Samantha Brennan and Robert Noggle echo claims by English , Okin , and others regarding Rawlss failure to consider the justice of the family , and they emphasize how this neglects the interests of children ( Brennan and Noggle 2000 , 46 ) . Rawls says little about children in TJ and even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 61 ) . When he does discuss children , it is in the context of moral development rather than their moral status in its own right ( 46 ) . While this renders his theory of justice incomplete , Brennan and Noggle share Bojers belief that Rawlss concern with the least advantaged members of society can be applied to children ( 4647 ) . Dropping the idea , in response to Englishs critique , that the parties in the OP are heads of families ( PL , xlviiin20 , 20n22 , 274n12 ) enables the contractors to think of themselves as being children , once the veil of ignorance has lifted ( Brennan and Noggle 2000 , 52 , 54 ) , and therefore to construct principles of justice that protect children . <p> Stephen de Wijze reviews the feminist criticisms of political liberalism by Exdell and Okin and deems them unfounded . The first line of criticism , which Wijze calls " the incongruence argument , " points to the mismatch between political liberalisms requirement that women be treated as free and equal citizens and its tolerance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26263 ) . A second criticism , which Wijze dubs " the political virtues argument , " asserts that a family in which injustice occurs is a poor training ground for citizens of a just society ( 263 ) . Underpinning both lines of criticism is a concern with the way in which the liberal tradition has typically separated the public and private realms ( 26365 ) . Wijze contends that feminist critics misunderstand two key things : what political liberalism means by just family forms and how it draws the political-personal distinction ( 257 ) . Following Lloyd and Baehr , he argues that Okin has misunderstood the relationship between the family and Rawlsian principles of justice , for the latter are not intended to govern the former directly ( 27375 , 27879 ) . Political liberalism operates with a robust but minimal conception of family justice , according to which a just family respects its members civil rights and liberties and promotes their capacities to be or become cooperating members of society ( 280 ) . Even though the principles of justice do not apply directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wijzes second response is that feminist critics of political liberalism exaggerate the public-private separation . Political liberalism does not depict the family " as an inviolate inner sanctum immune from state interference " ( 272 ) . Instead , as indicated above , civil rights and liberties are protected in the private sphere ( 274 ; cf. 275 ) . In response to the political virtues argument , Wijze replies that if sexist family forms made it impossible for women " to develop the requisite political conception of the self " ( 277 ) , they would not be tolerated by political liberalism . However , he charges that feminist claims about this are empirically dubious . Rather than provide evidence to counter these claims , he simply casts doubt on their plausibility . But even if sexist family forms prevent women from realizing the political conception of the self to the fullest possible degree , they will , in the interests of pluralism , continue to be acceptable ( 277 ) . <p> Rawlss Later Writings <p> When considering the feminist implications of political liberalism , Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on women and the family ( Lloyd 1994 , 371n4 ) . Some of the ideas in that manuscript made their way into section 5 of " The Idea of Public Reason Revisited , " " On the Family as Part of the Basic Structure " ( IPRR , 15664 ) . There Rawls mentions Lloyd along with McClain , Okin , and Martha Nussbaum as encouraging him " to think that a liberal account of equal justice for women is viable " ( 15657n58 ) . References to this later material begin to appear in feminist responses to Rawls in the twenty-first century . <p> In " Rawls and Feminism , " Nussbaum conducts an overview of some of the main lines of feminist critique of justice as fairness , contending that Rawls can provide a powerful response to many ( Nussbaum 2003 , 488 ) . Nussbaum devotes a lot of attention to feminist critiques of the rationalism and individualism of Rawlsian thought and endorses readings like those of Okin and McClain on the important role of emotions and connection with others in Rawlsian thinking ( 48999 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater challenge in incorporating womens equality into the family . On the one hand , Rawlss pluralist commitment to individuals freedom to devise conceptions of the good implies maximum freedom for families . On the other , the family can be a site of " sex hierarchy , denial of equal opportunity , and also sex-based violence and humiliation " ( 500 ) . Rawls should acknowledge the liberal dilemma when it comes to the family , asking how to " balance adult freedom of association , and other important interests in pursuing ones own conception of the good , against the liberties and opportunities of children as future citizens " ( 506 ) . Despite the more explicit and focused attention Rawls gave to women , the family , and justice in IPRR , Nussbaum identifies three remaining issues . First , if the family belongs to the basic structure , why does Rawls repeatedly liken it to voluntary associations ( 504 ) ? Participation in a family is never voluntary for children , so freedoms of entry and exit hold little relevance for them . Second , Rawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product of the law . The law defines which combinations of individuals can be regarded as families for the purposes of public policy , and shapes the nature of many of their relationships to one another and to other institutions . Because the state has the power to dictate who and what counts as a family , it is unhelpful to ponder the issue of state intervention in the family as if they were two discrete entities ( 5046 ) . Third , even though Rawls seems to have expanded his conception of the family since TJ , Nussbaum suspects that he endows the Western nuclear family with a quasi-natural status , ignoring forms of affiliation in other cultures that represent viable alternatives to the family ( 504 ) . <p> Nussbaum also raises the issue , which goes back to Exdell and Okin , of political liberalisms tolerance of sexist comprehensive doctrines ( 2003 , 50911 ) . She follows defenders like Lloyd and Wijze in pointing out that doctrines denying womens equality qua citizens would not be tolerated . She agrees that citizens who affirm womens subordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political liberalisms insistence that women are equal citizens ( 510 ) . Nussbaum also points out that feminists remain free to criticize such doctrines in civil society and personal relations ( 511 ) . She concludes her review of feminist engagements with Rawls with Kittays dependency critique ( 51114 ) , accepting that in order to respond persuasively , Rawls would have to rethink both his image of citizens in the well-ordered society as fully cooperating members over the course of a life and his account of primary goods . But , overall , Nussbaum believes that Rawls can productively absorb feminist criticisms by revising justice as fairness to become even more liberal ( 515 ) . <p> A revised version of Anthony Ladens 2003 article " Radical Liberals , Reasonable Feminists : Reason , Power , and Objectivity in MacKinnon and Rawls " is published here as chapter 1 . Laden questions the belief that political liberalism bodes poorly for feminists , showing instead that Rawlsian liberalism can engage the concerns of feminist critics of liberalism such as Catharine MacKinnon . Laden distinguishes a theoretical approach that is blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberalism would be blind to feminist concerns if there were nothing in its theoretical apparatus to respond to them . A theory that is merely myopic , by contrast , might overtly ignore such concerns , but it nonetheless contains resources for addressing them . Advancing a reading of Rawlss thought that emphasizes its deliberative dimensions , Laden sets out to show that political liberalism is merely shortsighted when it comes to gender . <p> Elizabeth Brake agrees with Laden that Rawlsian liberalism can rise to some of the challenges posed by MacKinnons feminist critique of liberalism . Focusing on the issue of neutrality , Brake urges feminists to see it " as a moral ideal in the process of justification . . . that . . . will require substantive feminist reform " ( Brake 2004 , 295 ) . The ideal of neutrality can be invoked to attack the sort of state-sponsored gender hierarchy of which MacKinnon is so critical ( 296 ) . This initially seems counterintuitive , given that neutrality requires that the state refrain , as far as possible , from endorsing any conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out , if current practices and institutions are nonneutral , the ideal of neutrality can leverage considerable change . Current arrangements regarding paid employment and unpaid caring work in the home are biased against women , so a neutral state would be justified in enacting many of the policy changes Okin outlines in JGF , in the name of removing or reducing this bias ( 3079 ) . Neutralitys appeal rests ultimately on the commitment to moral equality and equal respect that underlie it , for these values portend " a rejection of sexist and other oppressive doctrines " ( 309 ; cf. 3012 , 305 ) <p> In " Democratic Citizenship v. Patriarchy : A Feminist Perspective on Rawls , " Marion Smiley reviews a number of feminist criticisms of Rawls , asking which , if any , prove fatal . The three most powerful are ( 1 ) that Rawlss methodology is abstract and individualist , which biases his thinking in a masculine direction , away from a more feminine orientation toward care and relationships ( Smiley 2004 , 16026 ) ; ( 2 ) that justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sphere ; and ( 3 ) that the veil of ignorance requires that people think away key aspects of their identity ( 1601 ) . Smiley does not find the first criticism to stand up , but neither does she deem Okins attempt to associate the OP with care and empathy to be successful ( 16078 ) . With regard to the second criticism , Smiley finds that the OP contains the potential to challenge patriarchy in public and private life ( 1600 ; cf. 160813 ) . The third criticism , which is especially salient for members of oppressed or subordinate racial communities ( 1613 ; cf. 161319 ) , can be addressed via a reading of Rawlss thought that is , like Ladens , derived from Rawlss increasing tendency to present justice as fairness as a theory for democratic societies . This tendency needs to be strengthened if Rawlss work is to fulfill its feminist and egalitarian potential by emphasizing what it means to belong to a democratic community , with its requirement not just of moral equality but also of political equality and nondomination ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of democratic identity . . . that challenges patriarchy and other hierarchical structures of domination " in both public and private spheres ( 1626 ; cf. 162022 , 162426 ) . This would , conversely , require that Rawls downplay some other aspects of his thought , such as his view of toleration and the limits of state action , and the role of rational choice ( 1627 ) . <p> Susan Moller Okins " Justice and Gender : An Unfinished Debate " surveys Okins own , and some other , feminist engagements with Rawls since TJ . Okin also registers her reactions to the later developments in Rawlss thinking about women and the family . Her reaction , once again , is mixed . While grateful that Rawls eventually responded to his feminist interlocutors and adopted some of their recommendations ( Okin 2004 , 1565 ) , Okin remains troubled by his unwillingness to apply the principles of justice directly to the family ( 1538 , 156364 , 1567 ) and puzzled by his comparisons of families to associations ( 1563 , 1566 ) . She insists that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1538 , 1555 ) , and finds unconvincing the distinction between respecting womens political equality while propounding their metaphysical or moral inequality . Her answer to Lloyd , Wijze , and Nussbaum , therefore , is that a doctrine promoting the latter can not truly respect the former ( 1559 , 1562 ) . In this context , Okin reiterates Kearnss original question about how a family that does not practice justice can transmit a sense of justice to its children ( 156667 ) . <p> Like many feminist commentaries on Rawls , Karen Greens revisits the debate between him and Okin but maintains that Okins ideals are more destructive of Rawlsian liberalism than Okin appreciates . Four major problems can be identified in Okins call for a form of androgyny where gender differences are minimized or eradicated . The first is that sex difference might be more biologically rooted than Okin allows , and the second is that some people might feel attached to their gender identities and not want to relinquish them . Pursuing androgyny would , third , interfere with individual liberty by imposing a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that an ideal of androgyny clashes with multiculturalism , for many minority groups have strong commitments to gender difference . A more liberal approach would support a variety of family forms , which is the position that Rawls ends up adopting . Greens preferred way of creating and implementing just family law is to follow a principle of parity that guarantees equal representation of both sexes in parliament . With parity in place , " one can leave the choice between androgyny and gender difference to be determined by individuals within a framework of law that is informed as much by the voices of women as by those of men " ( Green 2006 ) . <p> Catherine McKeen ( 2006 ) encourages feminists to be more solicitous of family privacy and family autonomy , for these goods leave adults free to determine the familys comprehensive doctrine . The values and attitudes circulating within a family need not " conform to the dictates of public debate . . . or be open to public scrutiny in the first place . " These protections against state interference mean that parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Partiality refers to " particular attachments , relationships and loyalties " and is a good that the family realizes . Partiality could even , in McKeens view , qualify as a Rawlsian primary good . Protecting it means that relationships do not always have to be " answerable to general social concerns , " nor must individuals always be " thinking of public concerns and public goods . " <p> In 2006 Lisa Schwartzman published Challenging Liberalism : Feminism as Political Critique , underlining the incompatibility between feminist theory and liberal methodology . An abridged version of Schwartzmans critique of Rawls appears here as chapter 2 . Schwartzman evinces skepticism about Okins use of the OP for feminist purposes , for this departs from Rawls by including gender as a relevant social position and attributes knowledge of gender oppression to those behind the veil . Schwartzman also echoes Trouts complaint that Rawls focuses on economic status to the neglect of other forms of social inequality , and follows Trout in advocating a wider understanding of the concepts of " relevant social position " and " least well off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Rawls is doing ideal theory and so writing about inequalities that would be acceptable in a well-ordered society . She also criticizes Rawls for his too permissive pluralism , for some of the conceptions of the good that he tolerates take for granted the continuation of structures of oppression . With its focus on people as individuals rather than as members of classes or groups , liberalism is incapable of perceiving , let alone criticizing , the social hierarchies that subordinate individuals on the basis of group membership . Feminist theorizing , by contrast , must pay attention to collectivities and be contextual and concrete , rejecting also the abstraction that characterizes liberal methodology . <p> I puzzled through some of the uncertainties that Okin identified in Rawlss later writings on women , and I contend that Rawls goes a long way toward addressing some major feminist-liberal concerns about justice as fairness ( Abbey 2007 ) . Yet in accommodating his feminist interlocutors , Rawls pushes justice as fairness in the direction of a more comprehensive , rather than a strictly political , doctrine . Situating the family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , equality , independence , and rights to the strictly political realm . In bringing family relations within the purview of justice as fairness , Rawls must go beyond ideas implicit in societys public political culture , for , as feminists have long argued , the family has traditionally been relegated to the private sphere . Once the family becomes the subject of justice , at least some of the virtues of private life , which Rawls relegates to comprehensive doctrines , become part of his theory of justice . As he fleshes out what it means for women to be equal , free , and bearers of inalienable rights in all ( or most ) areas of their lives , the insufficiency of a purely political liberalism becomes manifest . I contend that Rawls advocates a type of autonomy for adult individuals in the domestic , as well as in the political , realm , which once again surpasses the limits of a purely political liberalism . <p> Just as I was suggesting that more than political liberalism was needed to satisfy feminist concerns , Corey Brettschneider advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Brettschneider articulates a " principle of publicly justifiable privacy , " according to which the public-private distinction must be formulated with reference to political liberalisms values of free and equal citizenship : " to the degree that privacy exists at all , its boundaries must be determined by and normatively argued for through public reason . . . . Domestic life is not immune from political examination " ( Brettschneider 2007 , 24 ) . Political liberalisms values apply as much to the domestic as to the public sphere and should be used to scrutinize citizens comprehensive doctrines . When such doctrines clash with those values , the doctrines should be amended . " When public reason demands it , individual moral identity must be completely reformulated " ( 26 ; cf. 23 , 25 ) . Political liberalism thus has considerable power to transform citizens outlooks , indicating that Brettschneider offers a much less passive , permissive reading of political liberalism than do interpreters like Lloyd , Wijze , and Nussbaum . Yet Brettschneider insists that political liberalism remains distinct from comprehensive liberalism , for while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not dictate how a family should behave or what it should prize or pursue in all areas . This leaves room for a diversity of comprehensive doctrines to address these issues in different ways ( 2728 ) . In stark contrast to McKeens defense of partiality , Brettschneider sees it as a strength of his reading that " the moral identity of individuals as citizens is given priority over their private identities . This often means that our public commitments are more fundamental than private ones " ( 26 ) . <p> Like Brettschneider , Baehr ( 2008 ) explores the feminist potential of political liberalism and thinks through what it would mean for feminism to become a public political philosophy . While feminism can be classified as a family of partially comprehensive doctrines ( 195 ) , political liberalisms ambition to be hospitable to the fact of pluralism serves feminism well , for feminism is itself an internally plural school of thought . A robust feminist approach to politics would attract an overlapping consensus from as large a number of women and feminist positions as possible . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would draw its conclusions and recommendations for public policy from the values implicit in the public political culture of a democratic society . As a public political doctrine , feminism would argue for or against certain social practices on the basis of whether they harmed womens liberty and equality as citizens , or how they affected womens physical security or chances of equal opportunity . Baehr indicates what such an approach could justify as well as what its limitations would be . In the concluding chapter of the current volume , she develops her vision of feminism as a public political philosophy , looking closely at liberal feminism through this lens . If liberal feminism can be portrayed as a purely political doctrine , then it can be affirmed by those holding different comprehensive doctrines , such as Jewish feminism , ecofeminism , or socialist feminism . <p> Continuing the debate about the value for feminists of Rawlss turn to political liberalism , Christie Hartley and Lori Watson contend that political liberalisms commitment to equal citizenship makes it highly supportive of feminism . They distinguish their defense of political liberalisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nussbaum by the attention they give to reciprocity . The criterion of reciprocity limits what counts as a reasonable comprehensive doctrine to views that eschew any form of womens subordination to men . They go further than previous feminist defenders of political liberalism by claiming that " political liberalism is a feminist liberalism " ( Hartley and Watson 2010 , 6 ) . They do not discuss , however , a key issue that arises from attempts like theirs and Brettschneiders to recover a feminist position from political liberalism , namely , the limitations that this necessarily places on pluralism , which was , as noted above , the impetus to its creation in the first place . <p> The Current Volume <p> In addition to chapters 1 and 2 , by Laden and Schwartzman , respectively , which contain previously published material , this volume offers six new essays that further the debate about the resources that Rawlsian theory provides for feminist thought . Along with chapters 1 and 2 , the volumes concluding chapter , by Baehr , which grows out of her 2008 article , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts an argument about the latent feminist possibilities in Rawlss thought that takes a shape similar to her position on neutrality , described above ( Brake 2004 ) . In this volume , Brake explores the place of self-respect in Rawlss thinking . Rawls deems self-respect a primary good , but , in Brakes estimation , having awarded it this cardinal status , he never develops its implications . Brake effectively echoes Trouts ( 1994 ) charge that Rawls fails to give one of his own claims the theoretical attention it deserves . Brake notes the ambiguity in Rawlss treatment of this concept and advances a definition of self-respect that holds promise for thinking about gender inequality and the family . She develops the important implications of self-respect for the legal recognition of family forms and for the question of parents rights to infuse children with their beliefs . <p> In stark contrast to those who find potential for feminist causes in Rawlss thought , Clare Chambers identifies deep-seated difficulties that emanate from his belief that the basic structure is the appropriate subject of justice . Like many feminist commentators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that principles of justice should apply to the family . She examines the rejoinder , first advanced by Lloyd , that the principles apply not to single institutions but to the interactions of the basic structures components . Chambers replies that what the familys relationship to justice illustrates is that how the principles apply to an institution does not in fact depend on that institutions location in the basic structure . Chapter 4 of the current volume thus interrogates Rawlss wider position that there is something distinctive about the application of justice to the basic structure and finds it unconvincing . <p> In chapter 5 , Nancy Hirschmann considers how Rawlsian theory responds to the claims and needs of disabled citizens . Surveying the debate about this issue , she agrees with feminist critics like Kittay about Rawlss inability to address the crucial issue of dependency and care in human life or politics . But Hirschmann reframes the issue of disability as a question of freedom rather than justice . Examining what Rawlss theory has to offer disabled citizens in the way of freedom reveals the Rawlsian self to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawlss work is underpinned by a tacit but influential notion of embodied individualism that makes assumptions about what sort of bodies are able to be free . Rawlss negative conception of freedom , moreover , is ill equipped to respond to claims by the disabled for greater inclusion in social life , and his neglect of the social construction of desires and identities is explained by his general indifference to social relationships . Hirschmann defends the social model of disability and its implications for enhancing freedom by contrasting it with the dominant medical model . <p> Nussbaum is among the thinkers whom Hirschmann discusses who try to correct for deficiencies in the Rawlsian approach by incorporating disability issues into their thinking about justice . Heavily influenced by Kittays critique of Rawls , Nussbaum strives to find a way to incorporate human dependency in her capabilities approach to justice . Nussbaums parallel attempt to show how thinking about justice can be extended globally features prominently in chapter 6 , in which Eileen Hunt Botting addresses Rawls and international justice . Hunt Botting examines Rawlss Law of Peoples and considers Nussbaums critique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nussbaums theories of justice offer useful resources for advancing feminist values in international and transnational relations , albeit in different situations . Nussbaums capabilities approach is helpful for defending womens human rights in situations of minimal cultural or religious conflict , whereas Rawlss approach is more useful for womens human rights in situations of significant cultural or religious conflict . Rawls also has the advantage of wrestling with the hard case of using military force to defend womens human rights . <p> Along with Nussbaum , another feminist thinker to have been powerfully influenced by Rawls in a number of key respects is Jean Hampton . In chapter 7 , Janice Richardson examines Hamptons work , comparing and contrasting Rawls and Hampton as contractarian thinkers . Richardson applauds Hampton for applying social contract thinking to the justice of everyday relationships , for this brings this tradition into line with much other feminist thought that is concerned with the implications of everyday beliefs . Richardson aligns Hamptons interest in self-worth with Rawlss references to self-respect , and agrees with Brake about the importance of this concept for feminist thought .

Olin interprets these studies in the light of a theory of " structural symbolism " associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement , showing how they articulate in great detail a theory of the capacity for representation in ostensibly nonrepresentational ornament .

Not that I feared running into feelings or remembering traumatic experiences that might surprise me . Rather , I was afraid of discovering who I might have become had the Nazi regime lasted . <p> Mine is a story of growing up in Nazi Germany in a small town of former Silesia , and of being trained in Nazi ideology and its practices . It tells how I experienced this training and how I unlearned Nazi ideology and attempted to undo its impact on my development . It is a story of ordinary lower-class and middle-class people living in an ordinary backwater of the 1930s to mid-1940s . I describe what it was like to grow up under leaders and among a people some of whom committed the crimes of the Holocaust and most of whom stood by and made no attempt to stop the perpetrators . At this late stage of my life it seemed more important to me than ever to write about my childhood and adolescence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftermath , because so few personal accounts of involvement in Hitler Youth exist . Even fewer seem to understand the implications of such a childhood , or to attempt to formulate the obligations that arise from it . <p> I took part in the JungmSdel ( young girls ) , the junior branch of theHitler Jugend ( Hitler Youth , or HJ ) , from age ten to fourteen , as most children in Germany did after it became obligatory in 1939 . As an eleven-year-old , I attended yearlong leadership training , and for the last two years of JungmSdel was a squad leader . After graduation from grammar school at age fourteen , I went to a Nazi teachers seminary for a number of months and belonged to the Bund Deutscher MSdchen ( League of German Girls ) , the Hitler Youth for girls aged fourteen to eighteen . I always knew that I participated in Hitler Youth with greater enthusiasm than my classmates in the fifth to eighth grade . I now understand some of the reasons for this : my father , before he died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Fathers death , Hitler gradually became an idealized substitute father for me . I championed Hitlers cause all the more as my mother showed her disapproval of my real father and of Hitlers party . <p> In writing this account I discovered , to my relief and surprise , that by the time I was thirteen or fourteen I had begun a rebellion against the conformity that Hitler Youth demanded of us , even though I was unaware of what I was doing or feeling . From my first full encounter with the extent of Nazi crimes , revealed during the Nuremberg trials , I had some , if limited , understanding that I had been given the kind of indoctrination and training that could have enabled me to participate in the persecution of the enemies of Nazism . I certainly possessed the youthful enthusiasm and sustained some of the psychological trauma that can be exploited by unscrupulous leaders . And at the end of the war , I was frightened and confused enough to have sought emotional release through violence . But I was too young during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a member of the cohort of Germans who spent their entire childhood under the Nazis and who became politically aware of the damage done by Nazism as an adult living abroad , I felt that as a teacher of German literature I had a special obligation to speak to my students about what we Germans had participated in and what happened to us . I had to tell them about the enthusiasms and the beliefs I held then , the disillusionment , anger , grief , shame , and remorse I experienced after German defeat , and the grief , guilt , and shame that haunt me still . During my forty years of university teaching , I searched German literary texts for the relationship between individual conscious and unconscious psychology and political ideology and power . I traced vestiges of everyday fascism in the contemporary world , and I investigated the historical roots of Nazism in German educational institutions and abusive child-rearing practices . I wrote on the psychology of Nazi women informers and on how German writers dealt with and continue to deal with their Nazi past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a language to understand issues of class , race , ethnicity , and gender and made me conscious of the gender , ethnicity , and class imprints on my body and my early life . Feminism also confirmed what I knew intimately from personal experience : The personal is the political . Politics under Nazism invaded every sphere of life : every move could acquire political implications for girls and boys as it did for women and men . Both my teaching and my research gave me the larger factual , historical frame into which I could easily place my own experience , all the more so in that , from the age of about eight or nine , I was keenly aware of such political events as the pogrom of Kristallnacht in 1938 or the German armys march into Austria . The actual writing of this account proved to be an entirely new experience , however . <p> I first thought about writing an account of my Hitler Youth experience in 2001 , when I taught a freshman seminar on growing up in Nazi Germany after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates relied on the Internet for their information about Nazi Germany . Members of the Hitler Youth , both boys and girls , had become clichTs , inane caricatures mouthing Nazi slogans , the boys trained in weapon use and the girls prepared to bear numerous offspring for the Fnhrer . My students were not interested in the 1960s memoirs of Hitler Youth that I assigned , Melitta Maschmanns Account Rendered ( 1963 ) or Hans Peter Richters I Was There ( 1962 ) . Both accounts were too distanced , too defensive , or too focused on externals to allow my students to empathize with and understand the motivations of their writers . My students could not grasp how young people could be drawn into situations where they remained unaware of anyone except their own kind or unmoved by the suffering of fellow humans . <p> I thought that it was important for my students to identify with my age cohort , the Hitler Youth generationboys and girls born between the mid-1920s and mid-1930s . I wanted my students to see this generation as humanly understandable despite spending their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to me important to show todays students , through an early life history like my own , how the right leaders in an ordinary small town could produce potential perpetrators . I wanted my students to be able to identify with this girl , with her personal situation in her family and her town , with her interests and her emotions , her motivations , her wishes and her goals , so that they would not , with the clarity of perfect hindsight , dismiss who she almost became with a facile " this would never happen to me . " <p> Of that generation , a few were fortunate , either by remote location or by family tradition ( Catholic , socialist , communist ) , to have participated only minimally in Hitler Youth or avoided it altogether . But the majority did participate , and most of us , boys and girls alike , participated with " heart and soul , " as we used to say . At one time or other , many of us wanted to become , and some did become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of our fatherland . While it may be uplifting to study the resisters , it is much more necessary to understand the perpetrators and bystanders , if we want to prevent the repetition of a regime like Hitlers . <p> Many of my early memories of persons , places , and moods are indelibly inscribed on my mind and body . With Primo Levi , I believe that survivors of traumatic events " are divided into two well-defined groups : those who repress their past en bloc , and those whose memory of the offense persists , as though carved in stone . " Like him , I feel " as if at that time my mind had gone through a period of exalted perceptivity , during which not a detail was lost . " But as I began to write and rewrite , I encountered numerous difficulties with writing a memoir of what I remember about growing up during the Nazi period . Though I vividly recalled my early family , my teachers , and my reading , and clearly remembered the HJ practices and its ideology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels of Nazi childhood like Christa Wolfs Patterns of Childhood ( 1976 ) , and historical research and documentation of Nazi crimes , could not help but influence my understanding of my own recollections . Reading often stimulated me to recall forgotten or repressed detail . I tried to use primarily memories of experiences whose emotional impact on me as a child I could recall in clear , sensuous detail , associated with a specific person , environment , or occasion . So as to enliven the narrative , I transposed some episodes into dialogue . The persons , events , sequences , and relationships of this narrative are based on my recollection . Usually a situation would first come to mind in stark and vivid outline . As I wrote , more detail would emerge . In shaping the narrative , much of it had to be eliminated as irrelevant to my primary purpose . In a very few cases , for the sake of teachers or friends still living , I have omitted or altered names . Beyond the personal , and for the benefit of the English-speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chapters and sometimes in their course , brief sketches of the relevant historical background so as to set my personal experience in the local as well as the wider historical , political , and social context of Germany from the 1920s to the 1950s . <p> As we have learned from Holocaust studies and memory research , the memories of participants , victims , and bystanders are often unreliable , particularly when the person who remembers has been traumatized or has strong feelings about the subject matter , as I certainly do . Social , educational , experiential background influences not only the perception of an event or person but also its processing into short-term and long-term memory . The potential for unreliability , distortion , and confabulation of embarrassing or incriminating memories is all the greater , and the temptation to hide , deny , or overlook experiences can be expected when social disapproval or shaming by an internal ego-ideal is at work . <p> Writing this memoir led me to a head-on conflict between memory and history . The same remembered event looked different in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal or social judgments . Over a lifetime , I have experienced many , sometimes radical , physical , emotional , and intellectual dislocations : from German Silesia to Polish Silesia , to the Federal Republic , to the United States ; from enthusiasm for Hitler Youth , to ambivalence , to anger , to rejection , to condemnation , to remorse and shame ; from nationalism , militarism , and ethnic phobia to internationalism , pacifism , multiculturalism ; from Nazi to feminist , psychoanalytic , and liberal-democratic left-leaning positions . Each act of remembering from a different juncture in my personal life , from a new point of reference , brought different details of the experience into view and reshaped the remembered experience . Each act of remembering lifted previously unimportant or forgotten detail from suppression , and revealed suddenly an aspect of the experience the full significance of which I had not appreciated at all . Full understanding came only years later . Often , for those of us who recall a Nazi childhood , the sudden emergence of a forgotten detail may turn a harmless idyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . From April 1944 to January 1945 , during my fifteenth year , I attended a teachers seminary for girls . Into the 1980s I vividly remembered several of my teachers and a few classmates . I knew that this seminary was different from the seminaries my grammar school teachers had attended . One went to those seminaries only after completing the Abitur ( the high school comprehensive examination ) , whereas we could attend after grammar school or middle school . We had worn our HJ uniforms there , since we were fourteen years old and therefore belonged to the Bund Deutscher MSdchen ( BDM ) . I did not believe that this membership played a large role in our lives other than continuing the kind of regimentation we had been used to from the JungmSdel ( the Young Girls , ages ten to fourteen ) . It seemed a rather ordinary wartime boarding school with one extraordinarily good teacher . It was only in the late 1980s that I read that the seminary I attended was a Nazi response to wartime shortages of high school graduates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable cadre of young teachers who could be used to teach the children of ethnic Germans and the Reichs Germans in the eastern territories annexed to the Reich after their conquest by our troops . <p> This knowledge cast my earlier memories in a different interpretive frame . I then recalled that the director of the school had indeed spoken to us of our mission to teach in the East , but I had failed to understand the import of this mission . With this new knowledge , I came to see the school and its teachers in a political light , and the subjects we studied and the strategies our teachers used took on new and different meanings . My favorite literature teachers privileging of the humanistic Greco-Roman Western tradition over the Germanic traditionboth of which I remembered represented in our textbookcast her in the role of the opposition to the Nazi director , a BDM leader . My memory , stimulated by the change of perspective , provided additional details about the looks and dress of the two women that begged to be understood politically . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1990s as I studied the opportunities the BDM and Nazi womens organizations provided for females through new leadership and career paths . I began to wonder about my awareness of the personal advantages that leadership and a Nazi career might have offered me . Remembering my burning social ambition , my desire for an education , my handling of the entrance examination to the seminary , I realized how ready I waseven at age fourteento use this new opportunity , no matter where it led . I understood for the first time that I had been much more implicated in the Nazi regime than I had known . Many times in my life I have been haunted by the feeling that I , like Kafkas land surveyor in The Castle , had been in the castle without knowing it . <p> The example I give is only one of many in which a seemingly harmless memory took on sinister meaning . The new meaning elicited further forgotten details , demanding a recasting of the experience . In my narrative I have tried to show the girl I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will sometimes interrupt and comment on what the experience meant to me at different stages of my life . But that girl still lives in me . She is part of my identity . <p> I started the actual writing of this account in 2004 , after a former student of mine died of breast cancer . She had fully understood and promised to carry on my work on the sociopolitics of traumatic experience and its depth psychology . After her death , my research on the political and cultural consequences of child abuse in German-speaking countries bogged down . As a diversion from this complex and arduous academic undertaking , I wrote a few episodes of my early life , and it seemed as if I had opened a floodgate . The mourning for one friend led me to express my grief for the family and friends of my childhood . After that , it was easy to let memories come and to record them for a first draft of the memoir . As I wrote and rewrote , the narrative became increasingly an attempt to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Hitler Youth experience , German culpability , and the Holocaust . Writing , structuring , and restructuring the narrative became another working through . The first episode that I wrote told of my disillusionment with my HJ leaders , their betrayal , my almost becoming a victim of a Nazi suicide pact as Germany was defeated , and my survival . Pride at having survived was the first emotion elicited by my early story , and " Survivor " became the title of the first version . While writing a second version that included my familys history , I came to realize that each memory consisted of layers of different understandings of each detail of my experience . Each new and different layer moved me from a superficial knowledge of my part in the HJ to a deeper insight into my implication in Nazism . <p> These revelations produced in me ever deeper responses of shame . Shame that I had participated enthusiastically , shame that I , an adult liberal of the Left and a feminist , had failed for so long to understand the connection between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions purpose , which might have made me into a perpetrator . Shame , finally , that in my pride at having survived the Nazi regime , I had appropriated the term survivor from the victims of the Holocaust , the potential perpetrator making herself into a victim as well . <p> With each new understanding and each new version of the memoir , the title changed : Survivor ; Work of Mourning ; Dislocations ; and , finally , The Shame of Survival : Working Through a Nazi Childhood . I decided to keep this title to indicate that I feel shame about having survived the victims of the Holocaust whose only crime was that they were not Aryan and German but rather Polish , Roma and Sinti , communist , Jewish , Jehovahs Witness , or anti-Nazi , while I , the potential perpetrator , won the privilege of living .

As memories of my early childhood came crowding infirst events and then more and more details , particularly details about the places of my childhoodI found that I could reconstruct the floor plan of the house I lived in until age four , down to the staircases and hallways that I dreaded . I could visualize the streets of the town where I walked on my way to nursery school . I could draw maps of sections of the town we lived in till I was sixteen , including the houses , churches , and public buildings , both before and after their destruction during the last days of the war . My mind held an entire geography of childhood , and , to my surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my early years turned into celebration . <p> I have included my sketches and outlines of that geography of my neighborhood and my town instead of the few pictures that others , like my brothers , have of the persons and places I grew up with . I have a few photographs of myselfa snapshot of my older brother and me at ages four and three . I also have two passport pictures , at age twelve and sixteen , respectively . But I have no visual record of some of the people who were most important to me as a child . I have therefore included photographs of sculptures through which I later attempted to re-create several of the people I loved and mourned . <p> As important as it was to me to note our continuous euphoria over the chain of initial German victories in World War II , it was equally important to record the breakdown of our family and the social order , and the degradation of social inhibitions during the last months of the war . I remembered the symptoms of the breakdown without understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused by what I saw . My only intention was to hold on to what seemed stable to me , my Hitler Youth identity , my favorite teacher , and my goal of becoming a teacher . Writing about that period was wrenching . Through the process of writing , I realized that it took the actual betrayal by my Hitler Youth leaders , our flight from the Russians , my survival of a group suicide attempt , and my understanding of our total defeat to eradicate my belief in Nazi causes . As painful and traumatic as the loss of the war was for me , I understood only by writing that anger and disillusionment had begun to lead me to question myself and to reflect on my actions and convictions ; that loss had strengthened me in my resolve to pursue an education . <p> The end of World War II , the Nuremberg trials , and postwar encounters with several political concentration camp survivors provided me with intellectual insight into the crimes of Nazism and German militarism . Intellectual insight is easy , as I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full impact of what my country had done to German and European Jewry , as well as to all the countries it fought , only when I came to live abroad in the 1950s and when I met and became friends with men and women who had lost members of their families or who had themselves been harmed . During my entire life , sometimes on the most trivial occasions , I discovered in myself attitudes , unconscious biases , and emotional reactions that dated back to my Hitler Youth years . These had led a subterranean life , despite my conscious belief in democratic forms of governance and my commitment to account for Nazism and to counter its resurgence . <p> Having been an adolescent during the Russian occupation and Polish administration , during our eviction from Silesia and resettlement in West Germany , I looked at these experiences as challenges and at some of them even as adventures . Most of the autobiographical records of these experiences by German " victims " of the war , particularly those recorded and collected in the immediate postwar period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possesswith the notable exception of the diary kept during the Russian invasion by " Anonyma , " published in the United States as A Woman in Berlin ( 2005 ) . I never regarded myself as a victim . Yet I rarely if ever spoke about this time of my life even to my friends , fearing that any remark about the Russian invasion and our eviction by the Polish militia might be misconstrued as a cry for sympathy , or as a desire for revenge or a demand for restitution . In their propaganda , the political Right in Germany , as well as some of the refugee organizations of the Federal Republic of Germany , exploited the impulse to seek revenge and compensation more than enough , and I did not want to add to their clamor . I could think of writing about these experiences only after anti-Nazi writers like W. G. Sebald in " Between History and Natural History : On the Literary Description of Total Destruction " ( 1982 ) , and Gnnter Grass in Crabwalk ( 2002 ) , had begun to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian and refugee casualties . I understood and understand the bombings , the hardship of the invasion , and our eviction as the price we all paid for our hubris , for our conquests , for our inhumanity in seeking world domination . And I am glad that todays democratic Germany , for the most part , seems to have profited from the lesson of total defeat . I can recall these events in eastern Germany now because the borders that were set in 1945 are firmly established . Germany and Poland live as equal partners now within the framework of the European Union . The Allies had been right when they decreed at Potsdam that the border conflicts that had led to the war could be resolved only by separating the populations . <p> In writing about the immediate postwar years , it seemed imperative to put my personal striving for an education into the larger framework of the reeducation efforts of the Allied occupation , particularly the Americans , during the late 1940s , and into the context of the social legislation on behalf of refugees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutional measures gave me and other young Germans opportunities for education , self-development , and careers in a democratic society that we would not have had otherwise . I pursued my quest for an education through the early 1950s , when I emigrated to the United States and found at the university an intellectual home that made my further development possible . This latest working through of my early life , by writing , is but one more foray into a past that is not dead .

Taming the Tiger : A Quantitative Analysis of Militarization and Democracy in Latin America <p> This book examines the relationship between militarization and development in Latin America . I assess the effect of military size and budgets on three separate indicators of developmentdemocracy , economic growth , and equity . I review past research and identify and solve a policyrelevant and theoretically important intellectual puzzle : while the conventional wisdom and case study evidence conclude that large militaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossnational research finds that lots of soldiers are good for economic growth and equity in developing countries . Why ? <p> I use a simple typology of militaries to generate an explanation for the different effect of militarization on development in Latin America than in other regions of the developing world . I posit that the conservative historical trajectory of Latin American militaries , the Cold War influence of the United States , and , above all , the considerable internal focus of the region 's armed forces combined to produce a particularly malignant pattern of militarization in the region . I expand the explanation using concepts of state capacity and priorities or focus . I test three hypotheses using several types of data and both quantitative and comparative historical research methods . I start at the general level , using statistical techniques and longitudinal data to test the effect of militarization on democracy , economic growth , and equity in both a universal sample of developing countries and in Latin America . This exercise demonstrates that the different military missions , history , and external threatlevels result in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal sample . The results are stark and unambiguous : militarization has a substantial and significant negative effect on democracy , economic growth , and equity in Latin America . <p> Finally , I present a comparative historical analysis of the effect of militarization on development in Costa Rica and Honduras in the 194898 period . The comparative historical chapters establish agency and sequence in the relationship and illuminate the causal mechanisms . They also clearly reveal the serious opportunity costs of militarization and show how large and powerful militaries can undermine state capacity and trump efforts for greater economic growth , equity , and democracy . These chapters also reveal many novel insights about the democratic consolidation process and economic transformations in Costa Rica and Honduras in the 194898 period . <p> The Puzzle <p> The proposition that large militaries undermine democracy , equity , and economic growth is widespread in Latin America . The most visible advocate of this position has been Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias SaTnchez . While not discarding the possibility that geography , history , and differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arias posits that a great part of Costa Rica 's success in the postWWII era stems directly from the dissolution of the military in 1948 and argues that other countries would also benefit greatly from demilitarization . For more than a decade , Arias has championed the vision that demilitarization is not a dependent variable , but rather a causal variable that can have significant positive developmental effects for Caribbean Basin nations individually and for the region as a whole . <p> When President Arias ( 198286 ) began exhorting his neighbors about the potential benefits of demilitarizing , the Cold War was raging . Arias was vilified by U.S. policy-makers and the very idea of another country going sans armTe anywhere in Latin America was viewed by scholars as nothing more than a pipe dream . Even modest military reductions appeared unrealistic . In the past several years , the environment has radically changed . With the Cold War over and the neoliberal ideology of efficiency dominant , tremendous pressures are now being exerted on Caribbean Basin countries by U.S. embassies , J apanese aid officials , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downsize and in some cases eliminate armed forces . Panama recently disbanded its military , as has Haiti . Vigorous yet difficult efforts are under way in other Latin American countries to divert funds from the armed forces to debt reduction , education , and health services . <p> While Arias and others have used moral persuasion and case study evidence to argue that lower levels of militarization lead to development , more rigorous crosssectional statistical analyses have not necessarily concurred . Indeed , the bulk of the quantitative research featuring inferential statistics shows a significant positive relationship between Third World militarization and economic growth and between militarization and equity/ social development . The vastly disparate results found by quantitative techniques and qualitative case studies represent a major intellectual puzzle . And this is a puzzle with important policy implications . With the end of the Cold War , domestic civil society groups and international actors are actively encouraging a reduction in military spending in many countries of the region even while a host of quantitative scholars arrive at the " somewhat awkward conclusion " that large militaries have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Developed Countries ( LDCs ) . The prime objective of this book is to solve this puzzle and firmly establish the relationship between militarization and development . The Research Design : Leverage and Dependent Variables The overarching argumentmilitarization has a negative effect on development in Latin Americais stated in very general , broad terms for two important reasons . First , this permits leverage maximization ; we want to explain as much as possible with as little as possible ( King , Keohane , and Verba 1994 , 29 ) . Second , research questions or propositions should permit clear tests of falsification . This very general argument allows more specific and observable implications of " development " that in turn generate testable hypotheses . <p> What is development ? Mittelman defines development as the " increasing capacity to make rational use of natural and human resources for social ends " ( 1988 , 22 ) . While these types of definitions are useful in some contexts , they are also very difficult to operationalize . Huntington takes a different approach , defining five distinct goals of development : autonomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equity , and stability . A great deal of research in the social sciences in recent decades has focused on one or more of these five goals . Early research under the modernization rubric deemed these goals complementaryall good things go together . Later research focused on the conflictual nature of these goals . Classic studies by Huntington ( 1968 : modernization breeds instability ) , Kuznets ( 1955 : economic growth leads to inequality ) , and O'Donnell ( 1973 : economic growth leads to authoritarianism ) are exemplars of the volumes of research dealing with the conflictual nature of the goals of development . <p> These goals of development are useful to my research for three reasons . First , they are much more easily operationalized than " development . " Second , they allow various empirical tests and opportunities for falsification . Third , having various components of development provides leverage ; it is possible that we can explain a lot with only one causal variable . Having various dependent variables sacrifices parsimony and may make this project more complex than the typical study that focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage is a profitable tradeoff ; in this study I leverage the militarization causal variable . <p> I selected three of Huntington 's five goals as separate dependent variables . There is little disagreement among mainstream scholars that democracy , equity , and economic growth are worthwhile goals . Stability and autonomy are another matter . I do not consider stability to necessarily be a longterm goal of development . Indeed , in my own research on the relationship between economic growth and equity , I conclude that a shakeup of the landed elite ( instability ) is strongly related with longterm economic growth and income equality . Many growthandequity success storiesJapan , South Korea , and Taiwanexperienced tremendous upheaval and instability that was a necessary requirement for a distribution of resources that set the stage for their longterm success ( Bowman 1997 ) . <p> Hirschman also points out that wars and instability are necessary conditions for peaceful resource redistribution ( 1963 , 137 ) . And Olson argues that shocks are needed to break up rentseeking coalitions ( 1971 , 1982 ) . Collier and Collier weigh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : stability may be desirable under some circumstances , but under " other circumstances and from other normative perspectives , stability and the reduction of conflict may be seen as blocking needed change , whereas polarization may open new avenues for change " ( 1991 , 10 ) . Stability is not a goal of development under apartheid or when widespread exploitation occurs . Many Costa Ricans would argue that the 1948 Civil War was positive in the long term but that stability is inherently good now under a democratic regime . Democratic stability is a goal of development ; authoritarian stability is not . <p> The relationship between militarization and autonomy is also not directly examined . " Autonomy " has been extraordinarily difficult to define and operationalize . I see little face validity in measures using United Nations voting behavior as an indicator of autonomy . In the globalized , interdependent world that emerged after World War II , one might also question the meaning and desirability of " autonomy from external forces . " No country , not even the United States , is autonomous from global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships stated in the following hypotheses : <p> Hypothesis 1 : militarization has a negative effect on democracy <p> Hypothesis 2 : militarization has a negative effect on equity <p> Hypothesis 3 : militarization has a negative effect on economic growth <p> While I propose that militarization undermines development , I never claim that the militarization variable explains everything about Latin American development or even that it is the most important factor . Indeed , the multivariate analyses in Chapters 3 and 6 show that many variables affect democracy and development . Rather , I submit , and the evidence confirms , that the relationship is measurable , substantial , significant , and negative . <p> This research design uses both quantitative and qualitative methodologies , similar to Jeffery Paige 's groundbreaking 1978 work . Good qualitative and good quantitative research designs share the same goals and logic ( King , Keohane , and Verba 1994 ) . However , the techniques are sufficiently different that each style has general strengths and weaknesses ( Ragin 1987 ) . Quantitative research generally lends itself to meeting higher standards of replicability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantitative designs are generally better for establishing relationships and their magnitudes ; qualitative research is better for illuminating causal mechanisms and establishing sequence and agency . <p> For my research question , both methods can and will be used . Specifically , quantitative components were designed with the goal of establishing significant relationships and approximating the amount of the variance in the dependent variables explained by the explanatory variable . Qualitative sections are used to recheck the conclusions of the quantitative sections , flesh out causal mechanisms , document sequence and agency , and explore data and variables not amenable to quantification . The use of different methodologies and distinct sources and types of data to test a relationship is often referred to as triangulation . <p> Triangulation results from training distinct methodologies and datasets on the same empirical problem and then analyzing both the discrepant and similar results that obtain ( Tarrow 1995 , 47374 ) . King , Keohane , and Verba define triangulation as using the best methodology to analyze " data collected at different places , sources , times , levels of analysis , or perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive interviews or thick historical description " and concur with Tarrow that triangulation is the ideal in the quest of causal inference in the social sciences ( 1995 , 479 ) . If a large body of scholarship already exists , triangulation can marry existing research from one methodological school with original scholarly work on the same question but with different methods and different data sources . As quantitative research on Latin America is relatively underdeveloped and we have no existing studies on the topic in the time and space domain that interests me , I perform all of the analyses . <p> This research design , therefore , leads to both quantitative and comparative historical chapters . The two quantitative chapters are based primarily on eighteen Latin American cases , although Chapter 6 includes an examination of seventysix LDCs . The comparative historical chapters focus on two countries , Costa Rica and Honduras . In the quantitative sections , my strong preference for studies of change over relatively long periods of time appears . Development is not a shortterm proposition and it may take many years for the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My research on the Kuznets inverted Ucurve has awakened me to the problems of snapshot singleyear crosssectional studies for demonstrations of causation ( Bowman 1997 ) . In this study , I focus on midto longterm trends of change in the dependent variables . <p> The Comparative Historical Case Selection <p> The logic of the comparative method has been described in a number of wellknown works ( Collier 1993 ; Lijphart 1975 ; King , Keohane , and Verba 1994 ) . In a perfect research setting , one could easily gauge the effect of a causal variable on a dependent variable . One would start with two cases identical in every conceivable way . Then , the causal variable or treatment would be applied to one case and a placebo to the other . If the cases were identical in every aspect except the causal variable and an outcome or dependent variable differed greatly in the two cases , then we could conclude that there is some relationship between the causal and the dependent variables . Unfortunately , it is difficult if not impossible to create such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approximate the ideal . The approach is relatively straightforward . Cases should have variance in both the dependent variable and the causal or explanatory variable and little or no variance in other potential control variables that have been identified as having a potential impact on the dependent variable . <p> The selection process for this study began with the choice of Costa Rica as one of the cases , for it had the lowest level of militarization in the region . I then selected the other case . Since the five Central American Republics are often referred to as a single divided nation ( Woodward 1985 ) and are all small countries with relatively small populations , I focused on El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , and Nicaragua . Honduras was selected as the second case , as it matches much more closely the case of Costa Rica on important control variables . Bananas and coffee are the two leading exports and the countries have very similar resource endowments . Neither case had the extensive forced labor conditions of El Salvador and Guatemala , and to a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large marginalized ethnic groups that so strongly shape political conditions in Guatemala ; although both Costa Rica and Honduras have had and continue to have small marginalized ethnic groups . <p> Both had until the middle of the twentieth century agricultural frontiers and an escape valve for those seeking land . Neither had a history of an enduring strong military institution as did Guatemala and El Salvador . Neither experienced a civil war during the era of the Cuban revolution , as did the other three countries . Both share long borders with Nicaragua and faced serious pressures from the United States during the Sandinista years . The Sandinista revolution and Contra wars make comparisons with Nicaragua problematic . Neither Costa Rica nor Honduras had a violently repressive oligarchy . And these countries had the two strongest union movements in Central America circa 1950 . <p> As shown in Table 1.1 , these two countries are remarkably similar on these important control variablesperhaps as similar as any pair of countries in the worldand yet are different in important ways besides militarization . These differences include the level of influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and most notably human capital as measured by literacy . The importance of literacy and human capital in Costa Rica can not be overemphasized . Therefore , as with most twocase studies , the results are to a degree indeterminate . Yet , the real strength of comparative historical research , and the utility of combining it with inferential statistics , is in illuminating the causal mechanisms and showing agency and sequence in the relationships . <p> Chapter Previews <p> Chapter 2 : Militarization : The Causal Variable , the Literature , and the Theory <p> Chapter 2 first precisely defines and conceptualizes the causal **25;579;TOOLONG then presents an overview of the literature on the Third World military and identifies the important gap in the literature that this study fills . The theoretical foundations of much of the research on the military flows out of the groundbreaking work of Andreski ( 1954 1968 ) , Huntington ( 1957 ) , and Janowitz ( 1964 ) . Three other important and distinct subgroups in the militarization literature are also introduced . First , I review the 1960s modernization literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies . Second , I explore the quantitative literature that statistically assesses the relationship between militarization and various goals of development . And third , I incorporate the qualitative civil military literature that is focused on Latin America . A careful examination of these literatures results in a simple typology of Third World militaries . Then , using the explicit theoretical rationale of Andreski , Huntington , Janowitz , and others , I propose that militarization should have a negative impact on development in Latin America even if it has a positive impact in other regions in the developing world . <p> Chapter 2 ends with a discussion of the impact of militarization on state capacity and state priorities in Latin America . I propose that a combination of large militaries , internal military foci , and the international Cold War emphasis on anticommunism rearranged state priorities and undermined state capacity for development . The United States and many Latin American elites might have been in support of democracy and equity in theory , but during the Cold War anticommunism too often trumped democracy and conservative order trumped equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and attention were concentrated on internal order and security , state capacity to pursue the goals of development was undermined . Large militaries , particularly where enemies are fellow citizens , have serious opportunity costs . <p> Chapter 3 : Taming the Tiger : A Quantitative Analysis of Militarization and Democracy in Latin America <p> The chapter argues that militarization in Latin America negatively affects three power relations that are important for democratization : class , transnational , and state . Two dimensions of democracyaverage level of democracy over time and the lowest level of democracy during a multiyear period of timeare regressed against two indicators of militarization : military spending and the number of soldiers per thousand inhabitants . The results strongly support the hypothesis that militarization has a negative effect on democracy in Latin America . Finally , the chapter reveals that the negative impact of militarization on democracy began to diminish in the late 1970s , such that the negative effect is stronger in 197374 than in 198586 . <p> Extant theories of Costa Rican democratic exceptionalism are presented and I argue that they are incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied to capture the causal mechanisms of democratic consolidation for this important case . In the 194858 period , the evidence is unambiguous that democracy was neither consolidated nor largely the result of elite pacts , Costa Rican culture , socioeconomic conditions , nor institutions . I illustrate how class power relations and transnational power dynamics threatened the Figueres regime both in 194849 and in 195358 . The constitutional proscription of the military and the serious weakening of that institution restricted the options of the opposition who were united in their desire to destroy Figueres and who sought violent means to overthrow him . A preference for ballots over bullets only materializes after 1958 as the absence of a military as a deliberative actor affected the calculus of political elites . <p> Honduras shared many similarities with Costa Rica during this period . In 1950 , Honduras did not have a professional and institutionalized military . A moderate social democrat similar to Costa Rica 's Figueres took power in 1957 and initiated an ambitious program of economic , political , and social reform . Like Figueres , President Villeda was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA . Villeda , like Figueres , was often smeared as a " communist . " One major difference between Costa Rica 194858 and Honduras 195463 was the very different trajectories of the armed forces . I detail the emergence of the Honduran military . In 1963 , this new political actor ousted Villeda in a violent military coup . The chapter concludes that it would be difficult to imagine Figueres surviving with a strong Cold War military and that it would be easy to imagine Villeda surviving another day without U.S.supported militarization of the country . <p> Finally , I argue that militarization was not the automatic destiny for Honduras . The decision to professionalize an army or follow the Costa Rican demilitarized example was a major public debate in the 195457 period . The debate continued during the Villeda presidency , and by the electoral campaign of 1963 was again a major national issue that was forcefully decided by the golpe de estado just days before the scheduled election . <p> This chapter has two purposes . The first is to assess the relationships between militarization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second is to illuminate the importance of the boundedness of social explanation and illustrate how militarization has a different effect on equity and economic growth in Latin America than in subSaharan Africa or in the Middle East and East Asia . I first establish that food consumption is a useful indicator of equity . I assess the relationship between militarization and calorie consumption for eighteen Latin American countries for the 196489 period and find that militarization has a strong , highly signifcant , and negative effect on food consumption . The same methodology is then applied to the relationship between militarization and economic growth . The results strongly support the hypothesis that militarization has a negative effect on economic growth . This chapter also compares the militarization/food consumption and militarization/economic growth relationships in eighteen Latin American cases with a universal sample of seventysix LDCs . I reveal how contextual differences in the militarization variable by region can lead to biased findings . <p> Successful social and economic development requires sustained state intervention and two types of resources : economic resources and organizational resources .

This comparative historical chapter analyzes the tradeoffs between militarization and economic development in the 1980s and 1990s , with foci on foreignaid utilization and the tourism industry . I show how a greatly reduced military budget and a decision to pursue citizencentric security rather than doctrines of national security in Costa Rica resulted in the state capacity and resources to transform the economy after the crisis of the early 1980s . In the rest of the Central American isthmus , the quest for internal security led to increased militarization during the Cold War . Large portions of the budget that could have gone to economic restructuring and infrastructure were consumed by the armed forces . Militarization also led to increased uncertainty , shortened time horizons , and a series of crises that thwarted the planning , implementation , and followthrough of the longterm policies that are necessary for economic development . <p> The book makes major contributions to both basic research and policy .

The Future of Labor Reform : Between Flexibility <p> and Rights <p> References <p> Index <p> Chapter 1 : <p> The Politics of Labor Reform in Latin America <p> The reform of national labor laws is one of the most widely implemented recent policy changes in the world . Since the early 1990s , countries as varied as South Korea , Chile , Russia , and South Africa have changed their labor laws . Labor reforms have also provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Portugal . Labor law reform is both widespread and contentious , yet as a political process it remains understudied . <p> These changes in labor laws occurring on a global scale are themselves a response to the pressures of globalization . In most nations , labor legislation was originally crafted to reflect **26;638;TOOLONG relationships embedded in more protected national economies . In recent years , trade liberalization and greater global competitiveness have created new challenges for employers and workers . Pressures for legal and institutional change have naturally followed . Yet labor reform remains among the most difficult changes to implement . Reform advocates have puzzled over why governments delay in passing labor reforms , and they have lamented the reforms partial nature and limited outcomes . <p> Why study labor law reform ? First , labor laws structure the inevitable and recurring conflicts of employment relations . They define the balance of power among government , employers , workers , and unions . The redrafting of a countrys labor laws typically reflects a shift in these power relations and may carry unfavorable consequences for the laws former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inefficient labor markets , labor laws often hold symbolic value , serving as a reminder of a time when workers organizations were more powerful . For unions , relinquishing laws that protect rights may mean accepting an indefinite institutional disadvantage and forfeiting future power . In many countries , labor law reform has become a focal point in the debate over organized labors future under globalization . Labor reform , therefore , provides a good lens through which to view conflicts over political and institutional change . As the Colliers put it , " Labor law is a highly visible and concrete policy statement around which political battles are fought , won , and lost , and around which political support is attracted , granted , and withheld . . . labor law thus provides a valuable point of reference for analyzing the larger political context " ( Collier and Collier 1979 , 971 ) . <p> Second , labor laws are not only about a countrys ability to operate in a global marketa common justification for labor reform . Labor law also spans the arenas of rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workplace and in society . National labor laws are the vehicle for safeguarding internationally recognized human rights of association , organization , and collective bargaining , which have received heightened attention in global trade debates of recent years . Finally , because labor laws affect representative organizations of workersi.e. , unionsthey help determine the extent to which fuller versions of democracy and deeper expressions of citizenship are present and possible . Labor law is also , therefore , a good gauge of a countrys prospective ability to meet social justice claims . <p> This book is about the role of Latin American labor organizations in shaping the design and implementation of labor law reforms at the end of the twentieth century . Despite similar initial prescriptions for change in the direction of greater flexibility , the outcomes of labor law reforms differed throughout Latin America . This study examines why that is by analyzing labor reform processes of the 1990s in six countries : Argentina and Brazil , where moderate flexibility reforms were implemented ; Chile and Peru , where changes in labor law were extensive ; and Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive economic liberalization . <p> I argue that labors efforts to influence reform account in large part for this diversity in outcomes in the region . To make this case , I look at labors strategic interests in labor law and at its ability to pursue those interests during specific rounds of reform . Labors strategic interests in labor law are derived , in turn , from the legal and institutional framework of labor relations , which is often inherited from an earlier period of legal and political incorporation of labor . I refer to this inherited complex of labor laws , institutions , and political alliances as the " political legacy . " This legacy may confer legal , institutional , and political resources to labor organizations , or it may constrain labors access to resources . In this way , the political legacy helps to define the relative strength of labor organizations to defend or promote specific labor law initiatives . Clearly , those labor movements that benefit from more legal and institutional resources are in a better position to resist adverse reforms and to shape the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions dominate . <p> Yet the relative strength of labor does not dictate a specific outcome . Instead , it is labors use of resources in interaction with other factors that explains outcomes . One of these factors is the degree of government resolve or political will to see reform through . Government resolve is shaped by the pressure for reform that it faces from international actors or domestic constituencies . International pressure can be oriented toward expanding labor rights or labor market flexibility . <p> A second important factor for both government and labor is the " transition context . " Most countries in the region have undergone dual transitions : a transition toward democracy and another toward economic opening . The nature of the transitions as well as their timing affects the political environment for labor reform . Democratic transitions tend to favor rights-based reforms and strengthen unions , while market-oriented economic transitions tend to favor labor flexibility and weaken unions . Moreover , the sequence of these transitionswhether democratization comes before economic liberalization , for examplecan affect the relative power of labor to shape reform . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor reform in the region , examining the role of labor , government , and transition contexts in turn . This is followed by a discussion of the political legacies that give rise to distinct contemporary legal frameworks , which in turn shape labors ability to influence reforms . The final section presents the country cases and the method of paired comparisons by which I analyze labor reform processes in the region . <p> &lt;1&gt; Political Dynamics of Labor Reform <p> The political dynamics of labor reform differ from those of economic or other institutional reforms . These differences have been insufficiently studied in the political economy of reform literature , yet they help to explain the contentiousness of labor reform and the relative influence that labor unions wield in this policy arena , despite an overall decline in bargaining power . <p> During the 1990s , studies of Latin American political economy focused on the implementation of market-oriented economic reforms and on accompanying institutional or " second-stage " reforms of health , education , justice , and pension systems . Although most of these studies were concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of nonelite social actors , insofar as these obstructed or facilitated elites reform goals . <p> The portrayal of these actors in each of these literatures differed . The economic reform literature tended to see both labor and business groups as relatively weak . Business groups were regarded as weak for failing to provide the strong base of support governments wanted in order to implement economic reform , and for being uncooperative or indifferent toward reforming governments ( Haggard and Kaufman 1995 ; Nelson 1994 ) . Labor unions were portrayed as weak because they failed to prevent economic reforms that harmed their interests , such as privatization and market opening , and because they failed to propose alternative policies ( Geddes 1995 ) . The institutional reform literature , by contrast , tended to portray unions as effective and powerful challengers to reform . Analysts emphasized unions confrontational responses to reforms and their frequent ability to stall changes ( Haggard and Kaufman 1995 ) . <p> This perception of unions as potentially powerful opponents was further evident in the attention paid in the institutional reform literature to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams has called the " reformers dilemma . " Most approaches discussed in the literature aimed either to gain support for reform or to diminish opposition to it . One approach was to build a positive consensus for reform by constructing pro-reform coalitions ( Nelson 1994 ) . A second approach was consultation , whether through legislative channels or directly with affected groups via bipartite or tripartite pacts ( Nelson 1994 , 19091 ; Haggard and Kaufman 1995 ) . A third approach was compensation , or giving actors a stake in the reform ( Graham 1998 , 336 ; M. Williams 2001 , 27 ) . <p> Yet these approaches downplayed the degree of coercion often required to overcome opposition to reforms . While each of these approaches implied some degree of negotiation and compromise , policymakers who saw standardized solutions ( privatization , flexibilization , decentralization ) to institutional problems were unlikely to find compromise satisfying . Not only did compromise go against the grain of technocratic problem solving , but it risked distortion of the original reform design or , worse , led to the scuttling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by avoiding any forum requiring compromise with affected actors . Actions ranged from repression and coercion to division and political isolation . Consensus , consultation , and compensation were rare ( Teichman 2001 , 191 ; M. Williams 2001 , 27 ) . <p> Indeed , market reform advocates often constructed their perceptions of trade unions in ways that justified strategies that marginalized ( and repressed ) labor . One common characterization of unions was that they were powerful " insiders " who resisted efforts to implement reforms that would benefit weaker " outsiders " ( informal-sector workers , the unemployed , women , and youth ) ( Cortzar et al . 1998 ; Lora and PagTs 1997 ) . Labor reforms were seen as a zero-sum game in which unions gains cost unorganized workers and business . The implication was that trade unions resistance to reform must be overcome . At a minimum , these portrayals complicated any consultative process . They also provided justification for avoiding negotiations with trade unions , and even for promoting reforms that weakened trade union power . These dynamics account in part for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . <p> &lt;2&gt; Labors Role : A Strategic Approach <p> Studies of reform have paid relatively little attention to what factors make labor a more or less formidable opponent . Characterizations of labor as weak vis-a-vis economic reform and strong with regard to institutional changes do not get at the underlying strategic interests and motivations or at the larger contextual issues likely to shape labors effective resistance . Some scholars have argued that the nature of the reforms themselves determines a greater propensity for resistance . For instance , Madrid ( 2003a ) argues that unions opposition to labor reform is more intense , and so more able to delay or stall changes , because labor reform affects union organization , leadership , and membership all at once . Compared with other reforms , labor reforms have the effect of unifying diverse factions of workers and therefore of strengthening an organizations ability to act in defense of its interests . Battles that form around labor reform initiatives may also reinforce a class cleavage , thus placing the issue into more traditional and familiar territory for trade unions ( Etchemendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of labor reform is not felt equally across all groups of workers , and the unity of worker organizations should not be overstated . The effects of reforms aimed at individual workers and at collective interests are different , and unions forced to choose which to defend are more likely to safeguard collective provisions over changes in individual or employment legislation . Moreover , the divisive tactics governments employ in other arenas to pressure groups to make concessions are also found here . Labor unity can dissolve when some unions are allowed to retain restrictions on freedom of association , such as monopoly rules that put competing unions at a disadvantage . <p> While labor unions may respond more forcefully to labor reforms than to other kinds of reform , this still does not explain why unions in some countries are more successful than others in shaping reform outcomes . Nor does it help in understanding labors varied responses to different reform initiatives or to the timing of those initiatives . Rather , how labor respondswhat and when it resistsdepends not only on labors capacity for mobilization or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what matters most . Which provisions in labor law are labor leaders most likely to defend ? Which are they willing to concede ? How do unions choose to make trade-offs or to expend resources during rounds of reform ? Answers to these questions call for greater attention to labors strategic interests in labor reform . <p> One fruitful approach is to focus on trade unions identification and defense of their core interests . Core interests are linked to the groups organizational survival . They are the issues that an organization will defend most forcefully , being willing to bargain or trade on other matters outside the core . Labors identification of core interests and its perception of threat to this core shape where and when it assigns limited resources and when it assumes risks and costs . This focus on core interests makes it is easier to understand why unions may cooperate on some reforms and resist others . For example , unions tend to defend established policies , laws , or provisions that grant them power and resources , such as representational mechanisms that establish union monopolies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups behavior by viewing how it behaveswhat it trades offin order to defend these interests . <p> This strategic approach also calls for a more disaggregated view of labor policy than has appeared in much of the literature . By looking at both individual and collective labor laws and at how they are packaged in reform rounds , we can better evaluate labors strategic interests and choices . Studying these rounds of reform enables us to understand the trade-offs that take place among pieces of legislation in a reform package , as well as the political and economic influences that shape bargaining over reforms . These trade-offs may in turn explain the contradictory outcomes of many labor reforms . They also provide a good indication of what matters most to labor leaders . <p> &lt;2&gt; Government Resolve <p> Labor movements that seek to influence the reform process must contend with the intensity of government commitment to reform , or government " resolve . " This resolve entails governments willingness to confront resistance to reform , which may involve political costs . One of the most important factors shaping a governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to bear on it . In many instances , international pressure may be more effective than domestic pressure because of the high costs of noncompliance . For instance , international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have conditioned loans on flexible reforms of the labor market . International pressure can also function in support of labor rights . To secure a countrys enjoyment of preferential trade status under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences ( GSP ) , Central American governments were pressured to push for improved legal protections for labor rights ( Frundt 1998 ; Compa and Vogt 2001 ) . The International Labor Organization has also acted as a source of pressure for labor rights . <p> Domestic pressure also shapes a governments commitment to labor reform . In recent years employers have been the key domestic group pushing for flexibility of employment regulations . The strength of employers will depend on the unity of employer organizations , their political alliances , the degree of consistency in their demands , the business orientation of the government or party in power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic or political stability if reform is not achieved . Like trade unions , employer organizations may also identify and defend core interests in labor law . <p> The strength of employer pressure may also depend on structural factors that force employers to reduce labor costs and to respond more rapidly to market demands . These factors include the overall degree of trade liberalization and the percentage of the economy affected by trade . Related to how employers respond to these pressures is the degree of protection ( often labeled " rigidity " by pro-reform forces ) of existing legislation , and the ease with which these laws are evaded ( Bensusn 2006 ) . Clearly , where protective laws are easily evaded , employers are less driven to demand reform , although the call for reform may still be there . <p> Finally , structural economic conditions can influence both international and domestic demands for reform . In the classical literature on labor markets , a high unemployment rate is usually evidence of excessively rigid rules and high labor costs . The neoliberal policy response is to ease protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements that employers make long-term commitments to employees . These ideas can shape perceptions of the need for labor reform to address unemployment . <p> A similar link is drawn between protective labor legislation and high levels of informality , yet informal-sector employment does not seem to elicit strong domestic demand for flexibility the way that high unemployment does . Informality indicates a good deal of flexibility in the labor market . It is often a condition that employers can exploit because of the lower costs involved and the flexibility of employment relationships . Informality does , however , present high costs to governments in the form of lost revenues due to the failure to pay taxes and other social charges . It remains a concern of international financial institutions and other international agencies , and is often cited as a reason to adopt reforms aimed at introducing more labor market flexibility . <p> Government resolve is typically most intense when strong international pressure is involved , or where strong domestic and international pressures converge in favor of flexibility reform . This may be counterbalanced , however , by domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up to important elections . <p> &lt;2&gt; Implementation Mechanisms <p> Governments typically pursue one of three mechanisms for implementation of labor reforms : executive decrees , legislative action , or concertation ( social dialogue ) . These mechanisms can be combined , as when concertation over reform proposals becomes the basis for legislation . The governments choice of mechanism may offer a good indication of its commitment to reform . Decrees may be the most direct route to reform but are often limited . By sending proposals to its legislative branch , the executive may indicate a serious commitment to reform , or it may signal others , especially multilateral lending institutions , that the government has made an effort to change labor regulations in good faith . Concertation mechanisms may , but often do not , indicate that priority is being granted to serious reform , although they may serve other important political purposes . I examine each of these mechanisms in turn below . <p> In political systems that make such action feasible , executive decrees have been used to set specific legislation . The advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not first submitted to the Congress for discussion and a vote ; hence it can be implemented relatively quickly and with minimal disruption . Although in most systems such decrees are supposed to be reserved for matters of " urgency and necessity " and therefore limited to crisis measures , they have often been used for labor reform . Governments may consult beforehand with business or labor groups about such decrees , but in most instances they act quickly to thwart opposition prior to implementation . <p> In democracies , however , the reform of labor markets and industrial relations can not be wholly executed by decree . Legislative initiatives sent by the executive branch to Congress typically involve the most comprehensive pieces of labor legislation , and therefore also those that are the most contentious and risk being significantly reformulated . The prevalence of presidentialist systems and divided legislatures in Latin America means that passing reform legislation can be a complex process , since opposition parties can dominate one or both houses of Congress . Legislative proposals are also vulnerable to opposition by affected groups , especially if labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political alignments are in the executives favor , labor reform bills can run into opposition in legislative labor committees , which tend to be dominated by labor deputies or their allies . The politics of the legislature , executive-legislative relations , and national party politics all play a role in determining the fate of labor reform legislation . Labor reform that travels this path typically takes a long time . A period of several years is not uncommon , and the end product may look very different from the initial proposal . <p> Governments may also place a reform proposal before the affected parties , or even request that they arrive at a compromise . Bipartite or tripartite " concertation " arrangements have been used quite often in Latin America as a means to shape labor reform . Typically the stated goal is for business and labor groups to reach a consensus on reform terms . The belief is that , once sent to Congress , an initiative shaped by consensus will weaken any objections of legislators and limit the conflict that could result from interest group pressure . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since agreement among the parties is difficult to achieve . Indeed , sometimes the best way for a government to look like it is trying to move on labor reform while ensuring that no real reform occurs is to toss the task into a bipartite or tripartite negotiation . Successful dialogue very much depends on political context and political will . <p> Given the relative difficulty of passing labor reform legislation , it is remarkable that governments repeatedly expend enormous effort to push reform . One way to understand what may seem like a futile exercise is to note the powerful " signaling " effect of labor reform efforts . Considering the tremendous pressure from international and domestic actors that some governments face , these governments may attempt to pass reforms even when their expectation of success is low . Even a failed effort to reform can signal to investors , international institutions , or domestic constituencies that the government is at least taking steps toward a shared goal . Whether a given executive adopts decrees , goes through the legislature , or seeks consensus , therefore , provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government uses will also shape labors response . Decrees , where trade unions are not consulted beforehand , leave them little option but to mobilize in protest or refuse cooperation if it is needed for effective implementation . Even when labor leaders are consulted , workers or unions that are left out may still resort to protest . Since the ability to mobilize effectively is costly and limited to relatively few labor organizations , decreed laws are an efficient way of implementing reform , although one that often lacks the legitimacy of legislation passed by Congress . <p> Reform initiatives sent to Congress provide another range of possible action by labor unions . Depending on their party ties and the presence of legislative allies , unions can lobby representatives and flex their electoral muscle to press their interests and either defeat or modify the legislation . Finally , concertation or social-dialogue mechanisms enable those unions that are invited to sit at the table to present their positions on reform . But , as noted , this more " participatory " method may be the one least likely to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labors strategic calculations on how to respond to reforms , as well as government resolve to reform , will also be shaped by political and economic transition contexts . The countries studied here underwent two distinct transitions : democratic transitions from periods of authoritarian rule , and market-oriented economic transitions under pressures of globalization ( see Table 1.1 ) . Both democratic and economic transitions often give rise to reform efforts and present distinct constraints and opportunities for unions . Moreover , these contexts shape the substance and direction of labor reforms . For example , labor reforms that coincide with democratization tend to enhance rights and protections , whereas reforms that respond to market policies tend to increase flexibility . This helps us to understand contradictory reform sequences in many countries : periods of protective or rights-based reforms followed by a move toward flexibility a few years later . <p> &lt;Comp : TABLE 1.1 ABOUT HERE&gt; <p> Reforms undertaken during democratic transition periods have tended to reinforce or extend protections to individual workers and to restore or bolster collective rights , such as the right to strike , organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . These reforms typically took place during " first-round " democratic governments , those that followed authoritarian regimes . Scholars have argued that first-round democratic governments enjoyed multiple advantages in implementing a wide range of policiesincluding tough stabilization measuresbecause of the value society places on peaceful democratic transition ( Haggard and Kaufman 1995 ; Nelson 1994 ; Geddes 1995 ) . <p> Yet while transition governments attempted stabilization measures , the experience of Brazil , Argentina , and Spain shows that these were more successful during " second-round " governments that followed the transition regime . In the Spanish case , Nancy Bermeo argues that this was because the core task of the first-round government was the establishment and consolidation of democracy , which took precedence over orchestrating economic recovery ( Bermeo 1994 , 606 ) . Since it was unable to resolve economic crisis , the transition administration became " sacrificial , " leading to the election of a new government headed by the opposition . This government , in turn , was better situated to address economic recovery through stabilization and economic liberalization because it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was an " unintentional sequencing of tasks " between the first two ruling parties after the end of authoritarian rule ( Bermeo 1994 , 602 ) . <p> Bermeos analysis of the sequencing of core tasks during democratic and economic transitions is useful for understanding the similar sequencing of labor reform . Democratic consolidation involved rebuilding democratic institutions , securing political stability , and restoring civil and political rights to citizens . First-round democratic governments found themselves under pressure to restore collective labor rights and protective employment laws that were removed during antilabor military regimes , or else to extend new rights and protections . Even where democratic governments might have resisted implementing labor-friendly reforms , they were often confronted by the relative social and political strength of organized labor . In general , trade unions enjoyed greater legitimacy in this period due to their persecution under the military and their role in the transition to democracy ( Valenzuela 1989 ) . Governments faced a social consensus that saw favorable policy reforms as labors due . This combination of factors often had a stronger bearing on labor reform outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties would play to their labor constituencies . During democratic transitions , nonlabor governments also implemented labor-friendly policies . <p> The premium governments placed on political stability and accommodation during democratic transition produced a generally favorable political context for labor , even when the economy was unfavorable . Governments were less likely to use repression in response to worker mobilizations , and interest in stability meant a higher likelihood that labor would receive concessions . Indeed , strike activity increased throughout the region during democratic transitions , and labor protest against structural adjustment policies was common ( Cox Edwards 1997 , 135 ) . Labor was able to engage in a traditional sectoral strategystrike activitybut it was also able to operate in a number of arenas made available by the return of democracy : political party activity ; working through congressional allies to defend labor interests ; participating in demonstrations with other sectors of civil society ; engaging in tripartite accords or direct negotiations with the state ; and even collective bargaining . In this context , organized labor was not only better able to advocate for labor rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as austerity measures , that it would later find more difficult to resist . <p> Economic transitions presented a different set of challenges to labor and imparted a different tenor to labor reform . Although market-oriented economic reforms may have been initiated or attempted by first-round governments , they were usually deepened and consolidated in second- and third-round democratic governments ( Nelson et al . 1994 ; Haggard and Kaufman 1995 ) . By this time the core task of democratic consolidation had been achieved or was well under way , ceding to a more pressing concern for the implementation and consolidation of economic reforms , which in Latin America typically occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s . <p> With the more systematic implementation of market-oriented economic reforms , the favorable political and economic environment disappeared for unions . Most economic reforms generated higher levels of unemployment and income inequality . Even if not accompanied by legal reform , employment generally became more precarious . For instance , the number of people working in the informal sector increased throughout the region in the 1990s ( International Labor Office 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor market weakened labor organizations by reducing union membership , increasing workforce segmentation , and creating an adverse environment for strikes . The strengthening of business actors , who were often favored by trade liberalization , privatization , and flexible labor market policies , also diminished unions relative power in society . <p> The political environment during economic transitions was also unfavorable for workers and unions . Market rationality and efficiency rather than rights and democracy became the watchwords of government . Unions were often portrayed as privileged special interests that sought to protect union leaders access to sources of wealth and corruption , or as market-distorting institutions that pushed up wages at the expense of the vast majority excluded from the formal labor market . This portrayal of unions in turn legitimated policies and legal reforms that aimed to remove or reduce unions sources of power . <p> Where economic transition preceded democratic transition , labor was often placed at a special disadvantage . In these instances , unions generally moved into the democratic transition weakened by structural economic reforms as well as by legal-institutional changes imposed during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a core task of first-round democratic governments was complicated by a commitment to preserve economic reforms implemented earlier , which often conflicted with the expansion of labor rights . While democratization may have generated a public debate about labor rights , as in Mexico , and even led to movement in this direction , as in Chile , the constraints on expansion of labor rights tended to be greater . <p> In sum , during democratic transitions that preceded market reforms , labor could both resist economic policies and attain and defend organizational gains . During economic transitions that followed democratization , labor was more likely to be forced onto the defensive and to concentrate its resources on organizational survival . The nature of the transition context and its sequencing are important for understanding the strategic options of both government and labor in labor law reform . <p> &lt;1&gt; Legal Frameworks and Political Legacies <p> The creation of early labor legislation in these countries represented a critical watershed in the relationship between the state and labor . The drafting of an initial labor code often reflected labors level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit conflict , secure political support , and establish control over labor . In many cases , these early labor codes also reflected nationalist political and economic alliances that underlay the import-substitution industrialization model of economic development . The initial labor law frameworks , therefore , had a substantial bearing on labors capacity to organize , bargain , and mobilize . They also defined which organizational , financial , and even political resources accrued to labor . <p> Where labor was sufficiently strong to require inducements to cooperate with the state , these were reflected in labor law . Provisions in trade union legislation that stipulated monopoly representation , a role for labor in tripartite structures , automatic dues check-off , and direct subsidies reflected reasonably strong labor movements allied with parties in power . In contrast , weak collective protections signaled weak labor , authoritarian government , or a powerful industrial or landowning class . <p> These foundational labor codes , like most institutions , were difficult to change . This difficulty was even more salient in those cases in which labor provisions were incorporated into national constitutions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rare ; generally this occurred only in cases of revolution or dictatorship , when a radical break with the previous regime made possible the creation of new institutions that would reflect a new balance of power . More commonly , however , legal frameworks produced enduring legacies . <p> Labor relations frameworks followed three distinct historical patterns or trajectories in each of the six countries I examine in this book . Each of these was initially defined by the combined legal/labor relations/political regime established during a critical juncture in each country . Each in turn generated its own legacy , which in some cases resulted in a very different legal and institutional labor relations framework in the contemporary period : <p> The first historical pattern is state corporatist . The initial legal framework originated during the key period of labor incorporation and at the height of import-substitution industrialization in the 1930s and 1940s . The characteristics of this pattern were an initial incorporation of labor by the state through labor and social legislation that combined protection and control . The early state corporatist pattern involved control of labor organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation in ways that permitted a significant degree of state oversight and intervention . Competition among labor organizations was circumscribed by clearly defined jurisdictions , and entry by new groups was restricted . Along with these controls , laws provided for direct subsidies to labor organizations through a variety of mechanisms . This was another means of tying labor to the state and of enabling the state to channel resources to unions with official recognition . Political parties might or might not have been part of this arrangement ; the key factor was the structuring of labor-state relations through legislation . <p> What were the implications of this initial pattern for labor strength and influence in later decades ? What was its political legacy ? We find relatively unified and large labor organizations that were protected from competition by newcomers , held a privileged seat in dealings with the state , and depended strongly on state subsidies . Because of regulations that called for compulsory membership or broad coverage through collective agreements , these unions represented large numbers of workers and therefore wielded some power . Corporatist provisions were difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor groups and others with vested interests in the system . Labor was therefore most likely to defend those provisions that granted collective rights and powers ( including those that ensured predominance of some groups over others ) , and those that provided financial resources to organizations and their leadership . Because of the difficulty in changing these laws , and because of the relative stability they engendered , this pattern exhibits a significant degree of continuity between early legislation and the contemporary period . Argentina and Brazil best represent this pattern . <p> &lt;2&gt; Radical ( Pro-Worker ) Flexible ( Radical Pro-Employer ) <p> This pattern originated in a political regime that overhauled labor laws to install radical pro-worker legislation and policy . Such legislation included expanded employment protections , improved working conditions , and greater tolerance of union organizing and strikes . To qualify as radical , these regimes also enacted regulations that increased worker control at the workplace . The immediate result was greatly expanded mobilization among workers . <p> These changes were profoundly threatening to foreign and national business elites and usually generated a strong reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved not only a change of regime but also a change of labor laws . Since these contexts were politically polarized , the result was not accommodation with the radical regime but rather its defeat . This was reflected , in turn , in the new laws and policies pursued by the victors . Implementation of new regulations had to overcome resistance by the workers who benefited from the previous regime , and the new laws institutionalized the relatively weak position of defeated workers organizations . Radical pro-worker legislation gave way , then , not only to flexible employment relations and reduced costs to employers , but also to strong restrictions on collective power and rights . <p> This patterns legacy was that labor had the most limited influence over labor reforms . Not only were unions too weak to stop flexibilization and curbs on their collective activities , they could not amass the political resources required to recover basic labor rights . It was more difficult to mobilize for new rights than to defend rights already enshrined in law , especially when the broader economic and political environment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be most needed in these cases and could lead to a better equilibrium in industrial relations . Chile and Peru both represent instances of this trajectory , and exhibit the greatest discontinuities in our set of countries . <p> &lt;2&gt; Revolutionary-State Parallel ( Nonenforcement ) Regime <p> In the revolutionary-state pattern the foundational labor legislation was associated with a regime that assumed the mantle of the " revolution . " This was not necessarily a revolution that came from below to overthrow an existing regime , but rather a regime that claimed to rule in the name of popular classes , even though its origins may have been part of a struggle among elite factions . Here labor was allied with the political party in power that claimed revolutionary origins . <p> Labor law contained many provisions favorable to unions . In contrast to the radical regime , however , these legal concessions to labor did not pose a threat in terms of creating an autonomous , mobilized labor movement . This was because labor in this revolutionary-state pattern was allied with the ruling party , such that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The revolutionary-state legacy produced a strong disjuncture between law and practice . Labor relations operated in a " parallel realm " of nonenforcement or selective enforcement of pro-worker legislation . In our cases this took two forms . In one , labor laws were favorable to labor organizations , but the actions of labor were comparatively moderate , since they were constrained by alliances and commitments to the ruling party . The result was a form of collaboration , even collusion , between labor organizations , the state , and employers to maintain stability and labor peace . This collaboration extended to the creation of a " parallel " labor regime that violated the favorable dispositions of labor laws . This was the case in Mexico . In the other form , seen in Bolivia , the constraining commitments to the " revolutionary " party were weaker since the party was not sustained in power , yet the original legislation stood . Protective labor legislation was tolerated by employers owing in large part to the fact that legal enforcement was weak . <p> Under this pattern , labor organizations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor laws . This was because of their alliance with prominent political parties and/or their mobilization potential . There was also relatively less pressure to reform the laws because of the limited enforcement or parallel containment arrangements described above . The result was no reform ( or greatly delayed reform ) of labor legislation despite its strongly protective nature . <p> &lt;2&gt; Labor Strength <p> Political legacies and legal frameworks also shape the relative strength of labor movements . To the extent that these extend and protect trade unions organizational resources , those unions are more likely to defend their interests in potentially antagonistic rounds of labor reform . As noted earlier , however , " strength " and " weakness " do not by themselves explain specific labor reform outcomes . In order to understand how labors capacity is deployedwhether it is " strong enough " to shape the reform processwe have to look at other factors discussed here : labors strategic or core interests , government resolve , and transition contexts . <p> I draw on characterizations of labor strength here to assist in devising the pairings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assess labor strength in Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , Bolivia , Chile , and Peru during the 1990s ( Table 1.2 ) . The focus is on national confederations , since labor law reform negotiations typically involve national organizations rather than local unions . <p> &lt;Comp : TABLE 1.2 . ABOUT HERE&gt; <p> The indicators include two measures of union density , union structure , degree of political unity among peak organizations , and political-strategic orientation of the largest peak organization . Although each one of these measures presents drawbacks , together they combine features of membership , structure , and politics suitable to assessing peak organization bargaining power on national policy issues . The final designations of labor strength also coincide with most assessments found in the secondary literature on labor in these countries . <p> Union density is a common measure of labor strength , but a problematic one . While reliable data on union density exist for advanced industrial countries , in developing countries data collection has often been difficult ( McGuire 1997 , 267 ) . Moreover , high density in some countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership and is therefore less meaningful as an indication of member commitment or mobilization capacity . Nonetheless , taken together with other measures , union density can signal the relative strength of organized labor . <p> Two other measures of labor strength relate to union structure and the degree of political unity where multiple central organizations exist . The assumption is that more centralized structuresa system based on national industrial unions rather than on provincial , municipal , craft , or enterprise-level unionsboth reflect and confer a greater degree of labor power . Likewise , the number of peak confederations and competition among centrals or within these can indicate the degree of labor influence . Simply put , labor is stronger where there is a single peak labor confederation and where internal political or ideological divisions are limited , so that labor speaks with one voice . A single or a dominant peak organization usually indicates greater unity and hence greater negotiating power than multiple confederations , from which the government may pick its allies . <p> A final indicator is the political-strategic orientation of peak organizations . This measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to government initiatives . This measure tries to capture both the extent to which peak organizations engage in general strikes and other forms of collective action and protest , and their political party alliances . In this formulation , " conciliatory " peak organizations had ties to ruling parties during most of the 1990s , whereas those with opposition party ties were " militant . " Militancy here is weighted more heavily as an indicator of labor strength : " Moderately strong " movements ( as measured by density and union structure ) may be able to compensate for a weaker structural position with militancy , whereas otherwise " strong " labor movements that are conciliatory toward government initiatives can be weaker actors when faced with unfavorable reforms , given a lesser propensity to confront their allies . Political-strategic orientation defines why , for example , Brazilian labor appears as " strong " in Table 1.2 despite " lower " measures in the areas of union structure and political unity among peak confederations , whereas Mexican labor is listed as moderate in strength , despite high scores on other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( high , medium , or low ) combines this political-strategic dimension with measures of structure and density . <p> Table 1.3 shows countries paired according to political legacy , labor strength , and reform outcomes . The last is presented in terms of degree of flexibility . One would expect stronger labor movements to exert the greatest influence over labor reform outcomes . Likewise , since unions resist flexible reforms that shift power to management , those cases with the greatest degree of flexibility ( " extensive " reform outcome ) should reflect the weakest labor influence . However , the puzzle evident in this table is that " strong " labor movementsthose of Argentina and Brazilpresent cases of moderate or mixed reform outcomes , while " moderately strong " labor in Mexico and Bolivia is linked to retention of protective legislation with no reform . Weak unions have the least influence over reform outcomes , which is consistent with expectations . <p> This puzzle suggests that there is not a simple linear relationship between labor strength and reform outcomes . While labor strength is certainly important insofar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables also matter . For instance , legal frameworks establish the terrain on which battles over reform are played out , and they shape labors identification of its core interests . Government commitment to reform , as determined by international and domestic pressure , indicates the degree of intensity with which government actors will pursue reform against labor opposition . As noted , this can affect the mechanisms governments employ to design and implement reforms , another factor that can disadvantage labor unions . Finally , transition contexts and sequencing can create more or less favorable political environments for labor organizations in their efforts to influence labor law reform . <p> &lt;Comp : TABLE 1.3 . ABOUT HERE&gt; <p> &lt;1&gt; Approach of the Book : Paired Comparisons <p> This book analyzes labor law reform in six countries : Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Peru , Mexico , and Bolivia . These countries were selected because of similarities on several key dimensions : Since the 1990s they have all been democracies ; labor has been a historically important force in national politics in each case ; and each has pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary on labor reform outcomes , as defined by degree of flexible reform at the end of the 1990s ( see Table 1.3 ) . <p> By the end of the 1990s , Argentinas and Brazils labor laws included flexible reforms , which mostly affected the individual employment relationship . Yet they also retained significant protections in collective legislation that benefited unions , despite government efforts to change those laws . These countries experienced a moderate flexibility of labor regulation overall . Chile and Peru had the greatest degree of flexibility , giving significant power to employers in their dealings with individual workers and unions . This was so even after the expansion of protections in Chile during the democratic governments of the 1990s . Mexico and Bolivia are the only cases in this set that did not significantly change labor laws despite strong economic liberalization . <p> How do we account for these varied outcomes in the face of similar pressures for flexible reforms ? By pairing countries that are quite different on a range of variables yet similar on reform outcome , we can isolate common features that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentina and Brazil are very different in terms of political party system , party ties with labor , and historical incorporation of labor . Until the early 2000s they also had different socioeconomic characteristics , with higher inequality and lower per capita income in Brazil . Yet their labor laws exhibit similar features of state corporatism , and their labor movements rank the highest of the six cases in terms of strength . <p> Chile and Peru differ even more starkly in terms of the stability and size of their economies , histories of labor incorporation ( state vs. party/movement ) , and orientation of their respective military regimes in the 1970s . Yet both countries share a more recent period of radical policy change under a pro-worker regime , which in turn produced a backlash reflected in subsequent governments antiworker policies . In both countries labor also appears in the weakest position . <p> Mexico and Bolivia differ in stability of political regime and size of the economy . While Mexicos PRI ruled for seventy-one years , Bolivia suffered multiple military interventions in politics during the second half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasts with that of Bolivia , one of the poorest countries in the region . Yet in both cases labor ranks as moderate in strength and labor legislation derives from similar revolutionary-state origins . Mexico also shares features of state corporatism , but the mobilizational nature of labor incorporation due to the revolutionary experience in Mexico distinguishes it from Argentina and Brazil and places it alongside Bolivia . Despite similar revolutionary legacies , however , Mexico and Bolivia differ in closeness of labors alliance with the revolutionary party . This alliance was much stronger in Mexico than in Bolivia , where labor and the party split in the mid-1980s , and where the labor movement was an autonomous source of political power , often rivaling that of its party allies ( Malloy 1970 ) . <p> &lt;1&gt; Organization of the Book <p> Chapter 2 gives the context for labor reforms in Latin America , indicates the range and direction of reforms throughout the region , and outlines the theoretical and ideological bases for reform during the 1990s . It provides background on types of reforms proposed and implemented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on trends and patterns that have emerged in the region . It contains a detailed explanation of labor flexibility , discusses the role of international financial institutions in promoting flexibility policies , and looks at where labor rights fit into this policy debate . <p> Chapters 3 through 5 analyze and compare labor reform dynamics in each of the three country pairs . Chapter 3 examines Argentina and Brazil , similar cases with relatively strong labor movements and a state corporatist legacy that explains many of the features of their contemporary labor laws . Both countries also experienced democratic transitions from military rule in the 1980s , followed by a market reform period in the 1990s . In both cases labor flexibility was introduced in the 1990s , but the labor movement managed to stall or defend against changes in collective law even as flexibility reforms proceeded in employment law . The mixed outcome points to the negotiating capacity of strong labor organizations in a context of intense pressure for reform . Although the chapter focuses on the 1980s and 1990s , it also analyzes the labor reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil under President Luis Incio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005 . <p> Chapter 4 compares the labor reform experiences of Chile and Peru . Both countries have labor movements that were once strong and politicized but which have weakened considerably since the 1970s . In both countries a radical pro-worker regime ( Allende in Chile and Velasco in Peru ) instituted policies favorable to labor , and unionization flourished . In reaction , subsequent regimes ( Pinochet in Chile and Fujimori in Peru ) imposed extreme flexibility and antiworker policies together with market reforms . Worker protections in the 1990s were among the weakest in the region . Yet in both cases , partly as a result of international pressure , recent efforts have turned toward more equilibrium in labor law and industrial relations , including closer attention to labor rights . <p> Mexico and Bolivia are regional anomalies , given that they display some of the strongest features of economic liberalization but are among the few countries in the region ( along with Honduras and Uruguay ) that have not reformed their labor laws . Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both countries and the subsequent development of a parallel labor-relations regime that permitted flexibility in spite of protective laws . In Mexico this occurred via collusion of labor with the state and employers . In Bolivia nonenforcement and labors veto power stalled reform . Although labor laws have not changed , domestic and international pressures to reform persist . The chapter analyzes several reform proposals , providing a unique view into policy debates prior to implementation and an indication of what type of labor reform is likely to emerge in the future . <p> The final chapter explores the lessons of this comparison of Latin American countries , assesses the reasons for the failure of reform efforts in the 1990s , and examines prospects for more balanced reform that incorporates labor rights , based on initial developments in the 2000s.

Heidi Gearharts book opens this topic in new and exciting ways , bringing the complex political and spiritual landscape of Romanesque Germany into a fresh dialogue with the manuscripts and art objects associated with Theophilus and his circle . The result is a thoughtful , insightful , and deeply engaging discussion of On Diverse Arts , not merely as a manual for making art but rather as a richly rewarding document that sheds unexpected light on the social , artistic , and intellectual culture of twelfth-century Europe . " Shirin Fozi , University of Pittsburgh <p> Theophilushumble priest , servant of the servants of God , unworthy of the name and profession of monkwishes to all , who are willing to avoid and spurn idleness and the shiftlessness of the mind by the useful occupation of their hands and the agreeable contemplation of new things , the recompense of a heavenly reward ! <p> Theophilus , On Diverse Arts , prologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few texts directly addressing the subject of art survive from the high Middle Ages . Largely functional , often religious , and lacking textual documentation , the images and objects of the Middle Ages seem to be in a world of their own , a contrast to the images and objects of the era of " art . " While the Middle Ages may serve as a foil to modernity in the popular imagination , the very characteristics that make medieval art something " other " the lack of known artists , its functionality , its sacred characterhave encouraged scholars to think about art in new ways . Concepts of originality , for example , or issues of physicality , performativity , agency , and power , have become subjects of study , enriching the field of art history as whole . While it is clear that concepts of the artist and art-making were rather different in the Middle Ages , what precisely those notions were remains largely unknown . The medieval artist is still a mysterious , shadowy figure . This book seeks to she 'd light on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of craft and of art-making in the central Middle Ages . <p> This book is an argument not for an art theory of the Middle Ages , but for a distinctly medieval theory of art . It is an investigation into a system of values according to which artists operated and made objects . Previous scholars have written much about medieval aesthetic theory and the justification of imagery from a theological and Christian point of view , and this is invaluable . Precious little , however , is known about the very human act of making . Despite the paucity of sources and the lack of artists names , I argue in this book that medieval art-making was a subject of thought , of theorization , and of speculation . It was an intellectual as well as a physical activity , a blend of the ideal and the human . At its best , it was performed according to a deliberate set of principles , values , and expectations . <p> One of few witnesses to the theory and practice of medieval art is On Diverse Arts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages . Composed by a monk under the pseudonym Theophilus in the early part of the twelfth century , the treatise comprises three books that describe the arts of painting , glass , and metalwork . In clear , direct Latin prose , the author explains procedures for color mixtures and figure painting , glass dyes and window assembly , and the casting of chalices and liturgical objects . Each book begins with a prologue addressing religious themes , such as Gods creation of man or Solomons building of the temple . <p> Because of its rarity , the treatise has been treasured by scholars , but it is often read out of context , according to modern expectations . The very first line of the text feeds assumptions of medieval modesty . Theophilus , meaning " lover of God , " begins with a declaration of his subservience : " Theophilushumble priest , servant of the servants of God , unworthy of the name and profession of monkwishes to all . . . the recompense of a heavenly reward ! " The instructions that follow have a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relate to the prologues . These characteristics have led many to liken the instructional chapters to cooking or medical recipes and to see the treatise as a compilation with no order or internal organization . Read as piously anonymous , disorganized , and practical , On Diverse Arts has thus been understood to confirm the assumption that medieval artists were humble , uneducated craftsmen : it has contributed to its own myth . <p> It was the author and poet Gotthold Lessing who brought On Diverse Arts to the attention of the academic community in the eighteenth century , when he cited it as evidence that the technique of oil painting was known in Germany long before the age of Jan van Eyck . Lessings argument was intended to counter Giorgio Vasaris Lives of the Artists , which credited Van Eyck with the invention of oil painting , but his interest in the text went much further . As Robert Leventhal has shown , Lessing was highly interested in the gaps between ancient and modern thought , in the fissures and fractious relations between the two . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource that set a pattern for later interpretations . In the next hundred years , the publications of Rudolph Raspe , Sir Charles Lock Eastlake , and Mary Merrifield brought the treatise to the attention of the English-speaking world , and their studies established Theophilus within a canon of texts treating artistic technique . French editions of On Diverse Arts were published around the same time . In German-speaking lands , it became a key text in the history and documentation of art through the work of the Vienna School , particularly that of Albert Ilg and Julius von Schlosser , who included Theophilus in their compilations and publications of primary source materials . These studies brought together a group of manuscripts and texts that addressed issues of artistic technique and categorized them as " recipe books . " In addition to On Diverse Arts , these include the Mappae clavicula ( Little key to techniques ) ; the De coloribus et artibus romanorum ( On the arts and colors of the Romans ) , by a mysterious figure known only as " Heraclius " ; and the Lumen animae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like On Diverse Arts , contains instructions for mixing pigments , making metal alloys , and dyeing glass . De coloribus et artibus romanorum also contains instructions for mixing pigments and coloring glass , as well as gilding silver , but an emphasis on chemical constitutions gives the text an alchemical cast . The Lumen animae , thought to derive in part from On Diverse Arts , is more encyclopedic . Similarities among these texts abound , and although scholars are still sorting out how the sources relate to one another , they are often discussed as a single genre . On the whole , they have been invaluable for the history of technique . Technical treatises , or treatises containing technical information , however , need not only serve this purpose . As Bernard Cerquiglini and others have shown , the functions of medieval texts could be fluid . One of the central tenets of this book is that cultural values are embedded in technical discourse , and that the manuscripts themselves are witnesses to how texts were read and to the values and functions they served . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technique , On Diverse Arts remains little understood . It is uncertain why , or for whom , it was written , or how it was read . Like the idea of the medieval artist , the text may appear transparentwith its clear and concise prose , its practical instructions , and its religious utterancesbut it resists easy interpretation . Self-effacing prose and practical descriptions may seem straightforward , but tropes of humility can belie considerable complexity . In addition , recent studies on the so-called minor arts have brought to light how greatly such small objects , like the censers , chalices , and book illuminations addressed by Theophilus , could evoke wonder for medieval viewers . Instructions , too , I argue , can reveal sophisticated value systems and agendas . Theophiluss instructions contain significant gaps , often glossing over crucial steps of a procedure ; his account of bronze casting , for example , says precious little about the important step of attaching sprues , or air vents , to the mold , making it difficult to believe the instructions were intended to teach on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the manuscripts , the text reads more as a literary work than an instruction pamphlet . Artists are implied , but not named ; processes are described in detail , but images and final objects are not . These discontinuities put pressure on our assumptions about what an instruction manual should be and about what a medieval artist might be . While studies by Jeffrey Hamburger , Lawrence Nees , Robert Hanning , and others are invaluable and have done much to clarify ideas about medieval art-making , there is still much to be done . <p> This study begins with manuscript evidence : The surviving copies of On Diverse Arts are direct witnesses to how the treatise was read in the twelfth century . When manuscripts are read as physical artifacts , with a sensitivity to the interaction of medium and content , new insights emerge . We will read the text not according to modern paradigms of technical analysis , but , as much as possible , according to medieval patterns of thought . Erwin Panofsky once wrote that art theory arose only in the Renaissance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do " something , as in On Diverse Arts , to articulating a philosophical position and methodological strategy , as in Leon Battista Albertis humanist tract On Painting . I argue otherwise . While it may be true that , by modern standards , there are no tracts on medieval art theory per se , in the twelfth century it was not unusual for practical questions to take on philosophical import . On Diverse Arts was of a piece with larger learning trends of its time , and the practical insights and philosophical content it yields are intertwined . Indeed , one of the fundamental premises of this study is that questions of " how " instructions , recipes , practicalitiesare not outside of philosophy but wholly subsumed within it . <p> For twelfth-century readers , particularly those educated in the monastic world in which Theophiluss treatise circulated , theory and practice existed in a dialectical relationship . Hugh of St. Victor , master and teacher at the Augustinian abbey of St. Victor in Paris and one of the most influential thinkers and teachers of the period , made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Didascalicon , his treatise on education and reading . According to Hugh , the theoretical is that which is speculative , while the practical is that which is active , and although the two may appear to be different , theoretical speculation and practical action are both elements of the larger field of philosophy . This understanding of theory and practice resolves the seeming conflict between the religious prologues and practical instructions of On Diverse Arts , which have often been thought to serve entirely different agendas or even to have been written separately . Once we understand theory and practice as interrelated manifestations of philosophy , we begin to see the prologues and instructions as interdependent . Through them , On Diverse Arts describes an ideal mode of behavior and set of actions : Proper practice is defined by theory , and theory is defined by proper practice . Neither exists without the other . It is a rather different conception from the theoretical treatises considered by Panofsky , but it is a philosophical framework nonetheless , and in this book I explore the medievaland Theophilanconcepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly twelfth-century , ideas of theory and practice seriously and read prologues and instructions together , a cogent system of art begins to emerge . <p> It is a major contention of this book that the person of the artist , the practice of craft , and theories of art-making are historically situated ; conceptions of artists and their work were by no means consistent through the many centuries that are dubbed the Middle Ages . Paul Binski has suggested that when " God himself appears as some sort of artificer , it is as a dividers-wielding architect or conditor . . . not as a goldsmith : saints or monks , not God , were workers in Gold . " While his differentiation of media is apt , such images of God as artist , as architect , or as creator in the artistic sense were fleshed out in the later Middle Ages , and did not exist in the earlier period . The change seems to accompany a shift in the status of artists , and while the contours of that shift are yet to be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of this changing world . <p> This study will thus approach On Diverse Arts within its own historical context . Scholars generally agree that the treatise was written in northern Germany , near Cologne or farther to the east , near Paderborn , and that Theophilus was a Benedictine monk . It was probably composed in the first third of the twelfth century , or around 1120 ; the two earliest manuscript copies of the text date to some decades later , around the middle of the century . Both have some connection to a Benedictine monastery , and both can be localized to the region stretching from the lower Rhine to the Weser River Valley . These manuscripts will form the basis of this study . <p> The first , now in Wolfenbnttel , is known to have come from Cologne , for it contains an ex-libris from the Benedictine monastery of St. Pantaleon , one of the wealthiest and best-known abbeys of the city . The second , now in Vienna , has a less certain provenance but was likely written in the region around Paderborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Benedictine abbey of Abdinghof . A third manuscript , younger than the other two , is of even less certain provenance but continues the pattern . Once owned by Lord Harley and now in the British Library , it dates to the late twelfth century , and although its origins are unknown , its script is characteristic of northern Germany . <p> The next three copies show patterns of transmission . One , now in Brussels , dates to the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth and was written in the region of LiFge . The following two copies date to the early thirteenth century and come from England . The presence of early copies there is not surprising , since northern Germany and the Meuse valley had close trading ties with England in the period . Thereafter , the geographical path of transmission is more difficult to trace . Three " nearly complete " manuscripts containing all three books and most of the prologues survive from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; they come from Saxony , the Rhineland , and Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two-thirds of the book , while another eight contain excerpts of varying length . <p> Three existing copies date to the seventeenth century , and two to the nineteenth ; all were made under the auspices of book collectors . Two of the seventeenth-century manuscripts are copies of the oldest twelfth-century manuscripts and were mostly likely produced at the library of the medical doctor and book collector Bernhard Rottendorff , who owned the Vienna manuscript . The third was made for Henry Wanley , advisor to the great collector Lord ( Edward ) Harley ; it is a copy of a partial manuscript now in Cambridge . Charles de lEscalopier , who owned a fifteenth-century copy of the text , had two additional copies of the manuscript made , probably in preparation for his translation of Theophilus published in 1843 . One copy , completed in 1841 , was ordered by J.-Marie Guichard and written by a certain M. Baker ; the other is a duplicate , a less fine copy of Bakers text , which was included in a volume of the letters of Saint Paul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amiens . In all , twenty-seven manuscript copies of On Diverse Arts survive , and they range widely in date , completion , and place of origin . <p> The manuscripts have received relatively little scholarly attention ; only recently has there been a growing awareness of the importance of evidence contained in the extant manuscript copies of the treatise . This book focuses on the earliest surviving copies : the two oldest , at Wolfenbnttel and Vienna ; Cambridge , University Library MS Ee . 6.39 ; and London , BL Harley MS 3915 . These manuscripts reveal possibilities for how twelfth-century readers might have understood the treatise , particularly in the Benedictine sphere of northern Europe . <p> Theophilus has long been identified with the early twelfth-century goldsmith Roger of Helmarshausen . This attribution is largely based on an inscription in the Vienna manuscript that reads Theophilus , qui et Rogerus ( Theophilus , who is Roger ) . Roger , in turn , is known through the survival of a document that probably dates to the late twelfth century but claims a date of 1100 . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or box , made for the bishop Henry of Werl of Paderborn . We do not know for certain whether Theophilus was actually Roger , and it is not the purpose of this study to determine the identity of Theophilus . The identification has in fact been problematic , for it encourages assumptions that the treatise is a practical resource , written by a craftsman with little sophistication . Theophilus may well have been Roger ; he may also have been someone in Rogers circle . The point is that On Diverse Arts is far more learned than previous scholars have recognized . The possibility that art-making and learned writing were not mutually exclusive is a driving force of this study . In order to keep as close as possible to the historical and geographical context of On Diverse Arts , objects attributed to Roger and to his milieu form the corpus of this book and serve as case studies to test and build upon the principles articulated in the treatise . <p> The Context <p> The Benedictine abbeys in which Theophiluss treatise circulated were some of the wealthiest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely tied to imperial powers and had long traditions of art production , as well as sizeable libraries and schools . The abbey of St. Pantaleon , for example , was founded by a monk from St. Maximian , in Trier , an abbey known for its production of manuscripts and metalwork . It was also the burial site of the empress Theophanu and the archbishop Bruno of Cologne , brother of Otto the Great . In Paderborn , the Benedictine abbey of Abdinghof was founded by the bishop Meinwerk , named bishop of Paderborn by the emperor Henry II . LiFge was home to the well-established monastic school of Saint-Laurent , where Rupert of Deutz studied and later taught before becoming abbot at St. Heriberts in Deutz , just outside of Cologne . One of Ruperts students in LiFge was Wibald , who would become the abbot of Stavelot and a great patron of art . Stavelot was an independent principality , and Wibald served multiple roles in the empire . He was an advisor to the emperor Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa and served as abbot to nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abbey founded by Charlemagne . He was even , for a short time , abbot of Montecassino . Stavelot had been reformed in the eleventh century by the abbot Poppo , who had been appointed to the position by the emperor Henry II in 1020 ; in the following years Poppos reforming activities spread , and he is credited for the reforms of the abbeys of St. Maximian in Trier , Saint-Laurent in LiFge , and the imperial abbey of Echternach , in present-day Luxembourg . <p> The abbeys were thus enmeshed in a network that was not only religious but also political and economic . As Tjamke Snijders has shown , relations among personnel could also be fickle , changing quickly in an unstable political environment . In such an environment , allies were all the more important . Connections between abbots , ecclesiasts , and the local aristocracy made possible the easy and frequent exchange of personnel , learning , and books and certainly facilitated the exchange of art objects , relics , and probably even artists themselves . In 1107 , for example , Helmarshausen acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisor to King Dagobert of France , from the abbey of St. Maximian in Trier . The procession passed through Cologne and St. Pantaleon , and a cross now in Cologne was perhaps made for the occasion by Roger of Helmarshausen . Roger , too , may have traveled , as his name is remembered at a number of monasteries along the route , including St. Pantaleon and the abbey of Helmarshausen . <p> The twelfth century was indeed a century of change . As Ute-Renate Blumenthal has pointed out , the imperial support of monasteries that took place in the eleventh century in the name of reform was also the basis of precisely the conflicts that were so problematic in the investiture crisis , and which continued to play out in the twelfth century . The abbey of Saint-Laurent in LiFge , for example , went through periods of reform , as under Poppo , but because it was never placed under the authority of a mother house , as in the Cluniac system in France , the death of one charismatic , reform-minded leader did not necessarily mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbeys were thus deeply embedded in the political system and often had to take sides . In the late eleventh century , for instance , Henry II of Werl-Arnsberg was made bishop of Paderborn by Emperor Henry IV , in effect usurping the See from Henry I , count of Assel , who had been installed by Henrys rival Hermann of Salm , king of the Swabians and Saxons . In a shrewd political move , Henry of Werl seems to have then commissioned a portable altar , now in Paderborn , which , according to a charter of the late twelfth century , was made by Roger of Helmarshausen . The altar depicts Henry of Werl as a successor to Bishop Meinwerk , who had been installed by Emperor Henry II , but had in fact caused problems for the counts of Werl in his attempts to secure independence from lay control . Probably made around 1105 , the altar may be seen as an attempt to legitimize the position of the bishop and solidify ties to the imperial court . It thus highlights the shifting alliances and changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , the production of art and trade of relics could be usefully employed as political tools . <p> Pressures for monastic reform persisted into the twelfth century and came increasingly from outside the Benedictine realm . While the eleventh-century reform movements of Gorze and Cluny had largely been absorbed into the preexisting monastic fabric , the Cistercians and the Carthusians gained large numbers of converts in the twelfth century , in Germany and Belgium as well as in France . Even if , as Van Engen has suggested , the Benedictine houses were less threatened by this second wave of reform , the Cistercians growing presence in the Rhine-Meuse region in the twelfth century reflects the economic and spiritual pressures of the time . The Cistercians were founded at Ceteaux in 1098 , and by the early twelfth century their numbers were quickly increasing . Much of their growth was due to the conversion of older monastic housesfive abbeys in the region of LiFge alone were founded or transferred to the Cistercian order in the span of just sixteen years , from 1132 to 1148 . The abbey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1070 by Calabrian Benedictines and home to a house of canons regular from around 1110 , it was taken over by the Cistercians in 1132 , becoming the first abbey of the order in Belgium . <p> The growing presence of Cistercian monasteries was noted by writers of the time . The author of a small book known as the Libellus de diversis ordinibus et professionibus qui sunt in Aecclesia , for example , described the different monastic orders active in the region of LiFge in the early twelfth century , including Cistercians alongside Benedictines , discussing the habits and strengths of each and treating the different orders with an even hand . The Libellus de diversis ordinibus and the case of the monastery ofOrval reveal a rapidly changing monastic landscape in the region of the Rhine-Meuse . Yet as Giles Constable has shown in his edition of the Libellus , the book also reveals a surprising tolerance and awareness , an understanding that monasticism could take different forms and have different priorities , and a remarkable willingness to agree to disagree . <p> Theophilus probably knew of the Cistercian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; indeed , On Diverse Arts was written in a context where the very notion of monasticism was a subject of discussion . But while some early scholars interpreted On Diverse Arts as a direct response to the growing Cistercian order , and even specifically to the Apologia of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux , there is no evidence that this was the case . It is perhaps more accurate to view the two texts as responding to similar concerns in different ways . Many of the anxieties about art-making in the period extend back into antiquity and have to do with fundamental issues of Christianity and the status of the image and the visibility of God . As Conrad Rudolph has shown , Bernards objections to art were not only doctrinal but also economic , social , and spiritual . Theophiluss treatise takes on some of the same objections to art . He answers them , however , quite differently , particularly with regard to devotional practice , liturgy , and spirituality . On Diverse Arts may not be a direct response to Bernard of Clairvaux , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art and its production . <p> The overarching context of debates about art is closely related to economic changes that were occurring all over Europe , and especially in northern Europe , in the twelfth century . There were two relevant economic shifts , no doubt related : a growth in the market economy and a change in the status of the artist . It is well known that the Benedictine abbeys had long been large landowners , with enormous power and prestige in what was a primarily agrarian economy . Accordingly , many artisans and laymen were doing business mainly on behalf of the local abbey . As the twelfth century progressed , however , trade became increasingly weighted in cities , and merchants and tradesmen did business on their own . <p> The city of LiFge is a good example . In the tenth and eleventh centuries , LiFge grew significantly . A new city wall built by the bishop Notger around the year 1000 encompassed both the old " Holy City , " with the cathedral and bishops palace , as well as a newer part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novus , this neighborhood was a commercial district that bordered the market , effectively expanding it . The district must have been successful , because merchants from the vicus novus in LiFge are mentioned in a late tenth-century toll tariff of London and an eleventh-century toll tariff from Koblenz ; these merchants were known , too , at the markets of Cologne . In 1107 the merchants of LiFge even gained their own market prerogative , or judicium forense , which allowed them further independence and mobility . The nearby city of Huy rivaled LiFge in economic activity . Huy established its own city charter in1066 and purchased a " limitation of seignorial rights " from the bishop . It had thus been home to merchants far earlier , and with its river access it became a center for trade . Clearly the region was undergoing significant economic change in the late eleventh century and into the twelfth . These developments were both a boon to the monasteries and a threat , for as the cities grew , the abbeys gradually lost their economic control . <p> At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twelfth century , artists moved from one abbey to another , as Roger of Helmarshausen seems to have done . Few names are known , but workshop styles emerge and disperse . The characteristic V-fold style attributed to Roger seems to reach its height at the abbey of Helmarshausen in the first decades of the century , and reminiscences of that style may be detected in later objects like the shrine of Godehard at Hildesheim and in manuscripts made for the cathedral of Lund , in Norway . Most evidence that survives for the names of twelfth-century artists dates from the later part of the century , even if it refers to artists from many decades earlier . This is the case with Roger , whose name and profession is known only from the late twelfth-century charter describing the altar of Henry of Werl . By the end of the twelfth century , more artists names survive . As Enrico Castelnuovo has aptly described , the task of studying the persona of the artist is fraught with uncertainty . The artisan Godefried , of Huy , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbey of Neufmoutier as " Godefried , goldsmith , our brother . . . was burgher of Huy , later he became a canon and our brother . He was not superseded in the art of metalwork , by any artist of his time ; he made a large number of reliquaries , shrines of saints in different lands , vases and other objects for the use of kings . " The economic history and scattered evidence of artists names , then , seems to suggest that over the course of the twelfth century , art-making became increasingly professionalized , practiced more and more by artisans in burgher towns like Huy or cosmopolitan centers like LiFge . The cultural values and the historical context that drove these developments is less well understood , as is the shift in conception of the artist . On Diverse Arts is a precious resource in this regard , for it seems likely to have been written precisely in this era and may even have been precipitated by these changes . It is an articulation of the values of artisanship in a shifting world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of texts being written and the nature of those texts . There have been many explanations for these changes in learning , for while they were partly a response to a new influx of texts from the East , they were also fostered by the needs of growing cities , with their new mercantile infrastructure , and the political upheavals and tensions of the investiture crisis . Cathedral schools trained new generations of ecclesiastical officers , and by the mid-twelfth century schools were becoming universities , as at Paris in 1160 and Montpellier in 1180 . <p> The Rhine-Meuse region had been famous for its schools and masters since the Carolingian period . LiFge in particular was home to a famous cathedral school in the eleventh century and into the beginning of the twelfth , a tradition begun under the master Notker of LiFge and continued by his pupil Wazo of LiFge . In the twelfth century it was also home to Reimbald of LiFge , canon of the cathedral and possibly the author of the Libellus de diversis ordinibus . The nearby Benedictine abbey of Saint-Laurent had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulbert of Chartres , was the teacher of Lambert of LiFge , who wrote the first version of the vita of Saint Heribert , later to be revised by Rupert of Deutz , himself a student of the monastic school . Figures like Adelmann and Wazo were renowned for their virtue , manners , and eloquence ; as C. Stephen Jaeger has shown , these men were some of the great exemplars of eleventh-century charismatic teachers . Rupert , too , has long been seen as continuing this tradition , though his work is interesting precisely because it links together the concern for mores and virtu with the rigorous allegories of early scholasticism . Theophiluss fine Latin may be just one piece of evidence that he was educated in this milieu ; tensions within On Diverse Arts may also echo this moment of transition . <p> Seen within the monastic , literary , and pedagogical sphere of the twelfth century , On Diverse Arts emerges as an articulation of a particular mode of thought , an agent and expression of a twelfth-century world . Echoes and insights emerge from reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period , particularly Hugh of St. Victor and Rupert of Deutz . Both Hugh and Rupert were well known in the region as writers and as teacherstheir texts circulated amongst local abbeysand Rupert is thought to have been involved in art as well . Situated within the discursive structures of twelfth-century thought , Theophiluss practice of writing , his mode of thinking , and his manner of describing techniques shed new light on twelfth-century values of art and art-making . <p> In the midst of political , economic , and religious uncertainty , Theophilus defines and defends artistic production . On Diverse Arts reveals the pressures of a twelfth-century world undergoing significant cultural change , and these pressures may well have been the motive for the composition of the text . Theophiluss treatise is neither recipe book nor religious polemic ; his voice is distinct , both in its mode of argument and its ideas . It is precisely by aligning theory and practice that the treatise assigns moral value to the materiality , function , and labor of sacred art . As we shall see , larger questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about technique and spirituality . A re-reading of On Diverse Arts suggests a new mode of organizing our categories of twelfth-century art ; it also suggests that while art operated primarily on a local level , it was nonetheless part of a much larger cultural discourse . Therefore even inconsistencies and oddities in On Diverse Arts are informative , for they reveal a changing world of artistic practice , foreshadowing larger transformations to come . <p> Overview of the Chapters <p> This book is organized around a series of manuscript readings . Evidence from these rich volumes guides a search for correspondences and patterns within the text , bringing to light the structures organizing the treatise and its major concerns : pedagogy , materials , labor , form , and vision . An exploration of these themes guides each chapter . Together , the themes shed light on artistic practice in the period . <p> The first chapter introduces the structure and narrative of Theophiluss text and argues against the traditional reading of On Diverse Arts as a " recipe book . " The examination begins with the Wolfenbnttel manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is followed by Theophiluss On Diverse Arts . This copy of Theophiluss text creates a harmony with that of Vitruvius , suggesting the treatise be read within a broad context of Latin literature . Theophiluss fundamental project , I find , is to define art as a learned and spiritual discipline . I show that the treatise follows a careful structure and that its narrative echoes Augustinian thought , while Theophiluss use of prologues and his embrace of pedagogy places him in a literary tradition that builds on classical thought and may be seen as parallel to Hugh of St. Victor and John of Salisbury . On Diverse Arts therefore emerges as part of a scholarly endeavor that links the " moderns " to the ancients , appropriating sources from antiquity and systematically defining a philosophy of artistic practice . <p> In the second chapter , I suggest that , for Theophilus , art is the transformation of material and is justified by the notion of utilitas , or usefulness . Textual evidence links Theophiluss interest in material to a literary tradition stretching from Pliny to Isidore of Seville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelfth-century texts like the Liber Floridus . His emphasis on metals also has great local significance , since abbeys like Stavelot and Helmarshausen were engaged in mining and the metals trade . Theophiluss treatise aims to justify a profoundly materialist practice as a religious enterprise . It was written just as European culture was experiencing an increasing split between religion and commerce , with urban mercantile economies growing rapidly and ascetic monastic communities becoming increasingly numerous and vociferous . Theophilus declares mining and materialism to be sacrosanct and suggests that art serves God because it transforms earthly materials into useful , even sacred , objects . His argument reaches beyond traditional defenses and brings new complexity to the monastic movements justification of wealth . <p> The third chapter looks at Theophiluss concept of labor and the spirituality of manual work . His instructions , usually dismissed as only technical , are shown to be carefully written , following patterns of exegetical thought and taking much from Saint Augustine . Theophilus defines skill in terms of knowledgeable and virtuous action so that art-making becomes the exercise of rationality , morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his humanity and restore him to God . Invoking the biblical Beseleel as a typological precedent , Theophilus inverts the usual criticism of Jewish embellishment ; the objects made by Beseleel pleased God because his skill was a manifestation of the work of the Holy Spirit . Most scholars have understood Theophiluss allusion to man as imago Dei and his invocation of Beseleel as straightforward justifications of art through biblical exemplars . I see it rather differently . Both allusions are in fact integral parts of a far more sophisticated theory of production , where art is justified by the process through which it is made . At a time when the old Benedictine agrarian and imperial patronage system was facing competition from a new mercantile economy and increasing numbers of lay artisans , Theophilus created a theory of artistic work based on sophisticated Augustinian and Benedictine spirituality . On Diverse Arts changes our very conception of the art object ; it is no longer a finished , self-contained thing but an analogy for mans fallen status and the process of restoration . <p> The fourth chapter examines how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of form . Beginning with the Vienna manuscript , the chapter looks at the values of variety , moderation , and decorum espoused by Theophilus and how they are made manifest in objects attributed to Roger of Helmarshausen . From this examination , we begin to see that Theophiluss reticence regarding iconography and his vague allusions to ornament tell us much about the parameters of art-making . Abstract formal qualities take on new meaning as evidence of workshop consistency , traces of good practice , and witnesses to ingenuity . <p> Taking each theme in turn , the book slowly builds a theory of art that changes how we understand Theophiluss treatise , medieval liturgical art , the history of art theory , and the story of artists . Objects emerge throughout as test cases and take center stage in chapter four . In the conclusion , I bring the themes together and clarify Theophiluss broad concepts of artistic production , proposing a corresponding theory of vision . I confront the assumption that medieval art had no discourse , or that it is to be understood primarily in anthropological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology and visual artifacts constitute separate discourses ; images do something far more than visualize theology . Rather than attempting to make the two equivalent , or make one explicate the other , Hamburger suggests we view theology and religious discourse as " less a body of doctrine than itself a variety of methods . " Similarly , through On Diverse Arts , we discern how ideas about theology , learning , and materiality echo and speak to one another in the making of an object . On Diverse Arts articulates an orderly structure for the discipline of art , creating an ideal and establishing the terms by which it is to be made . Material , labor , and modes of working are all deeply theorized and self-consciously understood . Furnishings of the church , for example , are not simply embellishments or luxuries ; they also carry spiritual , cosmological , and institutional significance . Through the lens of On Diverse Arts , the art object begins to be seen as the result of the process by which it is made . <p> Theophiluss justification of art goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is embedded in the exegetical and pedagogical philosophy of the time , laden with knowledge of the ancients . He proves that art is part of the realm of learning , and he shows us that medieval artistic practice was indeed self-aware , even self-serving . Understood as a part of the larger intellectual context of the twelfth century , and read as a learned treatise , On Diverse Arts helps us to see medieval art on its own terms .

This moral dramatic work by Michael de Carvajal was published by Luis Hurtado de Toledo ( ca. 152390 ) , with a few of his own additions , on October 15 , 1557 , as part of a curious volume titled The Court of Chaste Love and The Court of Death , which brings various works on the theme of courtly love together with Carvajals piece . Complaint of the Indians is not an " escena " ( scene ) in the sense of being one subdivision of an act in a play ; rather , the scenes of The Court of Death , while thematically interrelated and sharing a similar structure , are relatively autonomous dramatic vignettes . <p> In these different scenes , various groups of allegorical or moral characters , representing the different estates of the kingdom as well as different professions and nations , parade before Death . As universal judge , Death attends to their complaints of the injustices they have suffered and hears various petitions , including requests to postpone the final hour or to be given a liberating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights , rich men , prelates , a judge , frivolous nuns , philosophers , bandits , and so on . This macabre procession also includes a variety of other characters : Martin Luther ( Hells secretary ) , a group of Spanish Jews in exile , two Moors , and various American Indians and chieftains who lament their mistreatment and the cruelties committed against them in the New World . The cast of each piece includes a group of saints ( Saint Augustine , Saint Jerome , Saint Francis , and Saint Dominic ) that intervenes , as well as the opposing characters of Flesh , World , and Satan . Death , helped by the saints , lectures the complainants , asks them to reject the pleasures and possessions of the material world , and announces the final and definitive justice of God . <p> Given the number of scenes and their relative autonomy , it is possible that , as Joseph Gillet believes , The Court of Death was never staged , at least as a dramatic unit . On the other hand , William Shoemaker maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the length of The Court of Death is not per se an argument against the possibility of its being performed . In fact , frequent dramatic directions within the textsuch as " The trumpets sound and the Indians enter " in Complaint of the Indianswould indicate that it was written to be performed . Furthermore , the structure of " retablos " or theatrical vignettes could even have facilitated the representation of one or a group of the different " escenas . " <p> In general , information about sixteenth-century theatrical representations is scarce . The fact that we have two references to the staging of a play titled Cortes de la Muerte is remarkable : in 1571 , the " tailor Diego de Berrfo , resident of San Marcos , represented the play El convite de Abraham , winning one of the awards ; the other one was given to Luis de Cerdeo or Cerdea for the theatrical representation of Las cortes de la Muerte .

Columbus went on to explore the northeast coast of Cuba , where he landed on October 28 , as well as the northern coast of Hispaniola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aground and had to be abandoned , Columbus , with the permission of the native leader Guacanagari , left thirty-nine men behind and founded the settlement of La Navidad in what is now Haiti . The native population of the island the Spanish called Hispaniola , Aiti in the native language , was therefore the first to negotiate the new political and economic realities that the Europeans imposed , as well as to endure the ecological and demographic consequences of that arrival . The consequence of arrival , for European and Amerindian alike , was the advent of a modernity whose ruins we still inhabit . Perhaps , in all its poverty and urban decay , its prophetic reflection of those states of exception that haunt the contemporary imagination , Haiti is in fact the most modern country in the world . For the discovery was indeed of a " new " world , and it was one in which we were the cannibals and they the kings , as had been prophesied . <p> The title to this volumeOf Cannibals and Kingsthus hints at such an inversion of historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantasmagorical worlds created by Lewis Carroll , who famously employed a similar phrase . But anthropophagy and kingship have been among the earliest and most persistent of modern anthropological issues , as Michel de Montaignes famous essays " Of Cannibals " and " Of Coaches " well demonstrate ( Montaigne 2007 ) . The chivalric Spanish rescuing of a feminized America from the clutches of cannibal savages was a powerful image in its own day , and we might wonder how far in fact we have traveled from that moment and its symbolism . But its anachronistic aspects were certainly part of the rhetorical claims of the French , Dutch , and English as they sought legal and political access to the fabulously profitable relations of production of war and slavery that had been created in this new and marvelous world . The invention of a " new " world thus presented challenges not just of navigation , logistics , finance , politics , law , and so forth , but also of the self-fashioning of Europe itself . Montaignes Essais , not unlike the writings of BartolomT de Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of who is whatcannibal or king ? savage primitive or civilized modern ? Caliban or Prospero ? Carrolls Walrus and Carpenter talked of many things , including cabbages and kings , a phrase that O. Henry also used in the title of his now largely forgotten 1904 novel set in Central America . Perhaps with conscious irony , one of the native Carib characters in the novel is called Chanca . As will be seen from the writings of Dr. Chanca , companion to Columbus on his second voyage , it was he who firmly associated through ethnological observations the idea that the ethnic identity of " Carib " necessarily entailed " cannibalism . " <p> The documents collected here , and in particular the description of Hispaniola by Ram=n PanT , thus reflect the inception of those ideas and in so doing provide the basis for the primal anthropology that developed over subsequent centuries . The first descriptions of the Caribbean by Columbus and Chanca , and the description of Hispaniola by Ram=n PanT and the deposition of Figueroa , are the key texts through which such ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Guyana by Navarrete then shows how such ideas traveled to the southern continent . <p> In the islands of the Caribbean the colonial cannibals consumption of the native kings was brief and brutal , especially in Hispaniola , Jamaica , and Puerto Rico , where the native population all but disappeared within a few decades . Longer-lasting and more convoluted conflicts occurred in the Lesser Antilles , whose inhabitants offered stout resistance to a succession of colonial powers , as did the native societies of Tierra Firme ( the continental mainland ) . These more extended interactions produced a wide range of novel political and economic responses on the part of the native population . Alongside exterminations and epidemics new political and military formations arose . The ethnopolitical identities referred to by the Spanish as caribe and aruaca were the primary expression of this process in the Caribbean and northeastern South America region ( Whitehead 1988 , 1995 , 2002a ) . For these reasons , none of the indigenous polities in the islands or the coastal mainland that were extant in 1492 survived unscathed . Even where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on regional trade and alliance systems was fundamental , inducing change among groups well before they ever encountered the invaders directly . Such a pattern of effect outrunning its cause was also seen in the spread of European epidemic diseases , which not only proved particularly lethal to native populations , but also provoked a rapid and widespread migration away from the epicenters of disease dispersion . Although the virulence of diseases was enhanced by the geographic constraints on island populations , all apparent population loss in the Caribbean and proximate regions of South America can not be explained by disease ; migrations by sea toward the continent were another factor . <p> Within eight years of Columbuss first arrival , the Spanish Crown sent a royal governor , Francisco de Bobadilla , to try to stabilize the nascent colony on Hispaniola , where Columbus , his family , and their opponents had all but destroyed the indigenous population in a series of brutal military campaigns against both indigenous opposition and the dissenting Spanish factions ( Wilson 1990 , 74110 ) . The critical moment in these events was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives of the valley of Magu ( or La Vega Real ) , the largest and most densely populated native province on the island . Here barely two hundred men faced the combined forces of the principal caciques of Hispaniola , numbering tens of thousands of warriors . However , the military technology and organization of the Europeans , which included armored cavalry , steel weapons , guns , and attack dogs , devastated the native warriors , whose leaders were captured and tortured to death . Out of this destruction the cacique Guarionex emerged to mediate European demands for food , labor , and , above all , gold . By 1497 , following on famine and the first outbreaks of epidemic disease , this appeasement ended when Francisco de Roldn induced various caciques , including Guarionex , to support his opposition to the Columbus family . But BartolomT Columbus forestalled any action by a night attack on Guarionexs villages to seize the rebel caciques , most of whom were executed . Guarionex himself was allowed to live , but functioned essentially as a tool of the Columbus family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1502 . <p> By 1500 most of the complex native polities of Hispaniola had ceased to operate , and , following Ponce de LTons conquest of Puerto Rico in the early 1500s , the kingdoms of the Greater Antilles had effectively collapsed . The few native survivors of this first decade or so of European occupation were incorporated into the burgeoning colonial settlements of the region , and the need for labor was answered by the importation of black Africans as slaves . What percentage of the aboriginal population either fled the Greater Antilles or died there is open to question , but the overall consequence , as the colonial processes that had unfolded on Hispaniola repeated themselves in Cuba , Jamaica , the Lucayas , and Puerto Rico , was the near-complete disappearance of indigenous societies from the islands . However , in Puerto Rico , which was proximate both physically and culturally to Hispaniola and where Ponce de LTon first led an expedition of reconnaissance in 1508 ( CDI 31 , 28387 ) , native resistance on the island itself , though short-lived , was fierce , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of Lesser Antilles . In fact , attacks by Amerindians on the Spanish in Puerto Rico continued throughout the sixteenth century as alliances emerged between the Lesser Antilles caribes and the native populations dispersed and driven out by Ponce de LTons conquest and other Spanish occupations of the northerly islands . By contrast , little resistance was encountered in the Lucayas , the most northerly of the Caribbean islands , where the population was simply " harvested " by slavers from 1509 to 1512 ( CDI 31 , 43839 ) . The emergence of caribes , from the very inception of the European presence in the Caribbean , as an enduring source of resistance to colonial control is thus closely linked to the way in which their characterization as " cannibals , " from the first reports of Columbus up to the present day , was inextricably linked to the self-serving interests of the colonial rule . <p> Few records have been left concerning the occupation of Jamaica , which was initiated by Diego Columbus and completed by Juan de Esquivel in 1509 . Apparently the natives were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foodstuffs , cloth , and hammocks ( Las Casas 1909 , bk 2 , chap . 56 ) . When the new governor , Francisco de Garay , took over from Esquivel in 1515 , the royal factor , Pedro de Mazuelo , complained of the tiny number of natives left on the island , and confidently predicted their total disappearance within a couple of years ( CDI 1 , 258 ) . <p> Columbus had surveyed the coast of Cuba during his first voyage , but official interest did not manifest itself again until 1508 , when the royal governor of Hispaniola , Nicols de Ovando , sent Sebastin de Ocampo to circumnavigate the island . Rumors of gold quickly followed ( CDI 31 , 388 ) . In 1511 a license to occupy Cuba was given to Diego Velzquez de CuTllar , a veteran of the conquest on Hispaniola . CuTllar assembled three hundred troops on the southwestern peninsula of Hispaniola and was joined on Cuba by troops fresh from the conquest of Jamaica . A further contingent from Hispaniola included the future Amerindian apologist BartolomT de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove a critical experience in the formation of his negative views on the European treatment of the native population . With brutal efficiency the two parties of invaders had overrun the island completely by March of the following year ( CDI 32 , 36972 ) . <p> The rapid conquests in these islands of the Greater Antilles contrast strongly with the situation in the Lesser Antilles , which became a refuge not just for native populations , but also for the cimarr=nes ( escaped black slaves ) . Puerto Rico emerged as the southern frontier of Spanish settlement in the Caribbean islands , with the Lesser Antilles becoming occupied only in the seventeenth century , not by Spain but by Spains imperial rivals , the French , Dutch , and English . During the hiatus , the native populations of the Lesser Antilles were able to take advantage of their position on the main shipping lanes between Europe and America to practice a profitable trade with the European vessels that stopped to replenish their drinking water and supplies after the Atlantic crossing ( Hulme and Whitehead 1992 , 4580 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farms and ranches of Puerto Rico were frequently raided by the caribes , who , it was suspected , held not just African and European captives ( including the son of the governor of Puerto Rico ) but also a vast treasure of gold and silver taken from wrecked and plundered shipping . The issue of the caribes therefore remained a preoccupation of the Puerto Rican colonists , who continued to collect evidence of their lawlessness and " cannibalism " in the hope of persuading the Crown to permit the slaving of the Lesser Antilles ( Hulme and Whitehead 1992 , 3844 ) . But Spanish imperial ambition had turned its attention to the wonders of the Incan and Aztec empires , as well as the rich plunder to be had all along the Central American isthmus . The struggle of the Puerto Rican colonists with the caribes little troubled metropolitan Spain until the caribes made alliance with the French , English , and Dutch in the seventeenth century . <p> The Political Economy of Conquest <p> The Antillean archipelago was not only the first locale for the violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first American space to be transformed into " colonies of exploitation " ( Sued Badillo 1995 ) . The available gold deposits in the Greater Antilles quickly made them the epicenter of an ever-expanding economic core within the larger Caribbean region . Gold became the driving force behind a dynamic and diversified economic zone that traded in slaves , foodstuffs , pearls , imported goods , cattle , salt , and exotic woods . Columbuss exaggerated assessment of the regions worth had become true after all , even if he did not live long enough to see it . The significance of Caribbean gold shipments must be appreciated from the perspective of a European economy that had almost exhausted its supplies of that strategic metal . By 1515 the three islands of Hispaniola , Puerto Rico , and Cuba , in that order of importance , were shipping gold to Spain on a regular basis and so stimulating the peopling and exploration of the wider region . Hispaniola was responsible for half of the total of these shipments . These mining economies typically had only basic technologies and an intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were supported by abundant , cheap slave labor , which could be replenished by raiding native settlements , and because gold was so important to the Spanish Crown , the supply kept flowing . <p> Amerindian slavery had begun with Columbus himself as a means to finance his own voyages and the costs of administering the first colony of Hispaniola . In time Columbus was responsible for the enslavement and exportation of some two thousand Amerindians to Spain as war captives . His son Diego was appointed as governor of the Indies just as a serious labor shortage became evident in Hispaniola ; as a result , Diego Columbus was responsible for the shaping of the slave policy to be followed . <p> The slaving was at its most intense between the years 1512 and 1542 . Alonso Suazo , writing from Hispaniola in 1518 , reported that some fifteen thousand slaves had been captured from the Caribbean islands , producing a chaotic situation with consequences for the whole region . In 1545 the government of Hispaniola admitted to the existence of five thousand Amerindian slaves . Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , maintaining this ascendancy for many years , the actual numbers would have been considerably higher ( Sued Badillo 1995 ) . Las Casas cited the coastal regions of Venezuela and Trinidad as the principal source of the slave traffic to Hispaniola and to Cuba . The pearl islands , Margarita , Coche , and Cubagua , lying just off the coast of Venezuela , were the main staging ports for this traffic , underlining the significance of the interactions of aruacas ( native allies ) with the colonists on Margarita , as described by Rodrigo de Navarrete ( see Document 5 ) . Indeed , the strength of this alliance in the second half of the sixteenth century may have been a primary reason why most slaves taken to the Caribbean islands in this period came from the Venezuelan littoral and the Atlantic coast south of the Orinoco River . Caribe opposition to both the Spaniards and aruacas needs to be understood in that light , since it made alliance with the aruacas , particularly the Lokono of the Guyanese Atlantic coast region , critical for the slavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnopolitical groupings of caribes and aruacas can the writings of this period , and its historical outcomes , be properly understood ( Whitehead 1995 ) . The caribes were initially found throughout the Lesser Antillean islands , like Dominica , and they were always viewed as a source of slaves for the colonial economies . Occasionally slaves taken from the Amazon region are also reported , and the map drawn to accompany Rodrigo de Navarretes Relaci=n de las Provincia de los Indios Llaman Aruacas displays the first European knowledge of the fluvial connection of the Amazon and Orinoco watershed . The map text indicates that it was an aruaca , a chief called Jaime , who had communicated this knowledge and led a Spanish expedition into the interior to show them the route . <p> The role of the aruacas , in conjunction with the Spanish , in displacing existing native groups as well as directing Spanish slaving and raiding against their selected enemies has been obscured by the persistent reference to the " cannibalism " of the caribes ; in Spanish writings this occlusion was no doubt partly intentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one displaced native ruler indicates that the political choice of being aruaca also had its consequences . On the arrival of his fleet off the coast at the Caw River ( French Guiana ) , Keymis writes , at first he could get no one to come aboard , since they thought them to be Spanish . Eventually the cacique Wareo was persuaded , who " declared unto us , that he was lately chased by the Spanish from Moruca , one of the neighbouring rivers to . . . Orenoque : and that having burnt his own houses , and destroyed his fruites and gardens , he had left his countrey and townes to be possessed by the Arwaccas , who are a vagabound nation of Indians , which finding no certaine place of abode of their own , do for the most part serve and follow the Spaniards " ( Keymis 1596 , 4 ) . <p> The legal framework laid down by the Spanish Crown allowed for unrestricted slaving of those deemed " cannibals . " This was the reason for The Deposition of Rodrigo Figueroa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justicia 47 , fols. 159 , CDI XI:32 ) , which is included in this volume . Figueroa ethnologically mapped regions where caribes might be captured and where guatiaos ( defined officially as " domestic and tame and friends of the Christians and subject to the service of their highness " ; see also Sued Badillo 2003 , 26162 ) or aruacas were . The pattern of caribe resistance to the Spanish and their allies the aruaca should be interpreted against this backdrop of legal provision and economic interests . The politics of raiding and slaving among the other native groups , all of whom were faced with rapid and dynamic change , was likewise founded on the way in which the categories of colonial ethnology were being deployed politically . Modern anthropology and history have been slow to appreciate this crucial aspect of primal anthropology in the Caribbean . Columbuss observations were not the disinterested scientific notes of an " explorer " ; he in fact elaborated an ethnographic proposal for enslaving the native population that was intended to defray the cost of future explorations and pay for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primal anthropological criterion for distinguishing one supposed type of Amerindian from another was then widely propagated during the following years by Columbuss friends and lobbyists , including Diego Chanca , whose writings are excerpted in this volume . Together they effectively disseminated throughout Europe the notion that cannibal caribes inhabited the Caribbean , as the very place-name suggests . Although this early imagery little benefited Columbus himself , it was eagerly deployed by the colonizers who followed . The first royal decree allowing for the enslavement of the " cannibals " was issued by Queen Isabella in 1503 to encourage new self-financing explorations . As a result , the conquistadores Cristobal Guerra , Alonso de Ojeda , and Amerigo Vespucci , who had lobbied for the reinstatement of slavery , all became involved in commercial expeditions to the Caribbean and Orinoco region . <p> In 1510 the cacique Agueybana led a native uprising in which over half of the two hundred Spaniards on Puerto Rico were killed . Following reports of caribes being involved , the Crown issued a new decree ordering general war on the caribes and allowing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of a caribe territory and association of the caribes with the ethnological marker of " cannibalism . " Diego Columbus was primarily responsible for this new delineation of caribe settlements ; he advocated widening the caribe frontier to the South American continent . However , his suggestion was eventually rejected by the Spanish Crown , possibly conscious of the hidden agenda behind it . This underlines the extent to which Spanish royal policy was itself severely constrained by the practical ethnologies that the colonists in the field of conquest generated . The eloquent text of an educated historian and priest like BartolomT de Las Casas was apt to be trumped by the field reports , in the form of judicial documents and routine government correspondence , generated by the firsthand eyewitnesses " at play in the fields of the lord . " The political nature of ethnic and geographical identification is apparent from the fact that Guadeloupe was not included among the new caribe islands , despite being densely populated and despite the fact that Columbus had personally visited it and described the inhabitants as " cannibals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been devastated and left worthless if opened to slaving . <p> In subsequent years the mining economies plunged the eastern Caribbean and costal Venezuela into near chaos . Slave armadas were organized and sent against different islands , sometimes nearly depopulating them . In the process the Spanish Crown required that the capture of caribes had to have " legal foundations . " In effect , this meant that the governor of Hispaniola was being instructed to supply the Spanish Crown with the cultural information to justify the crude political distinctions promulgated from Spain , just as the early modern " discovery " of witches throughout Europe , which paralleled this " discovery " of cannibals , was an ethnographic exercise partly serviced by the information gathered through systematic torture . Nonetheless , this process produced intellectual debate and political unrest in elite circles of the Spanish Court and church , as did awareness of the growing death rate of the Amerindians in the New World . In response , in 1515 the Crown appointed Francisco de Vallejo to investigate and classify the Amerindians of the mainland to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked the inquiry ( Otte 1977 , 128 ) . In 1519 Judge Antonio de la Gama in Puerto Rico was commissioned to determine the extent of caribe territory , but without result . In later years , as part of the agreement with the Crown to allow missionary personnel into the mainland of South America , BartolomT de Las Casas was also asked to contribute to this emerging colonial ethnology , and his response is instructive : " If ordered to find out which people and in what provinces human flesh was eaten , then to say : I declare such a province to be eaters of human flesh and those do not want friendship with the Spaniards , the result would be the captain with his 120 men would simply make war on them and enslave those taken alive " ( Las Casas 1909 , bk. 3 , 371 ) . Las Casas thus rejected the project that was finally carried out by Rodrigo de Figueroa , at the time a newly appointed justice of Hispaniola and the proud owner of a brand new sugar mill . Figueroas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in this volume ) opened the mainland to slave raiding as the labor force of the mining islands was declining rapidly due to epidemics . Put simply , his report meant that almost a quarter of a century after the conquest had begun , the fate of native peoples still hung on the ethnic distinctions founded on behavior favoring or resisting the Spanish conquest . <p> The Spanish Crown finally decreed a prohibition against Amerindian slavery in the " New Laws " of 1542 . However , local slavers , often supported by local politicians , easily got around the legalities , and in 1547 caribes were again declared subject to slaving ( Sued Badillo 1978 ) . In this way the Spanish continued to adopt native categories into their distorted ethnologies in order to service the needs of colonial conquest , and Amerindians continued to be actively involved in this process , practically and intellectually . As with Christopher Columbus , identification of caribes always involved information claimed to have been supplied by Amerindians . Certainly the European presence polarized many political allegiances amongst Amerindians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see also Sued Badillo 2003 , 26162 ) , the conquest could not have proceeded without the active alliance of native armies and political leaders . Amerindians allied to the Spanish were initially termed guatiao . As the southern continent was opened up by slavers , this term was superseded by aruaca due to the increasing political importance to Spanish colonial plans of the " Aruacas " ( Arawaks or Lokono in their own language ) as described in Navarretes Relaci=n ( Document 5 ; AGI Justicia 47 ) . Like caribe , aruaca implied a political and social orientation , ranging from alliance to submissiveness . Guatiaos , and later those termed aruacas , actively participated in ethnic soldiering for the Spanish conquest . Las Casas understood this process very well when he wrote , " caribes , that was the term that the Spanish used to make free people into slaves " ( 1909 , 380 ) . The filter of caribe and guatiao or aruaca therefore dominates the cultural politics of primal anthropology in the vast majority of early materials , beginning with Columbus . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of judges , lawmakers , and other bureaucrats or self-interested parties , the account of Hispaniola and its native peoples written by Ram=n PanT , significant in its own right , takes on even greater significance as the last glimpse of the native Caribbean world uninflected by the colonial politics of difference . <p> The Ethnology of Conquest <p> In a general context of armed invasion and conquest , the first encounters with the natives of the islands loom largest in the historiography of the region and in the ethnological schema of anthropologies subsequent to the first encounters , both colonial and modern , because the caribe/aruaca distinction was used to ethnologically configure broad swaths of the mainland population , as shown in Figueroas deposition ( Document 4 ) . Ethnological information was thus crucial to the colonial project . The writings collected in this volume reflect precisely this role of providing anthropological intelligence on populations for purposes of their governance or conquest , and the relationship between such intelligence and military-political ambition has remained fraught right up to the present day . These writings also reflect an increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native population was understood , which resulted in a key distinction between , perhaps unsurprisingly , tractable and intractable populations , one directly stemming from Columbuss ethnological distinction between the caribes and the rest of the people of the Caribbean . The selection in this volume of passages from his Letter and extracts from the Journal of his first voyage to America is crucial to appreciating this process of ethnological codification . It will be apparent that in fact the distinction between the caribes and others is far from certain in these writings but continues to gain significance as the Spanish occupation of the Caribbean islands takes hold . <p> When Christopher Columbus ( 14511506 ) sailed east from Spain in the late summer of 1492 , he hoped to find Asia . Instead his fleet arrived in the Caribbean . On the return voyage Columbus wrote a letter ( included in this volume as Document 1a ) to Luis de Santngel , clerk to the Spanish sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella , who had partly financed his voyage . Published in Barcelona in 1493 , the Letter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage became known in Europe . It ran to nine editions before the end of 1494 and was published in many cities outside Spain . According to Columbuss account , at first contact both the Spanish and the indigenous population were cautious but curious ; gifts were exchanged and hospitality offered and accepted . The emphasis in the Letter is on the charm of the islands and the variety of their natural resources , especially precious metals . The people are described as naked and timid , lacking weapons , almost infantile . But the Letter also hints at the existence of more threatening people from an island that is " Carib , " whom Columbus suspects of being man-eaters . It is here that the long and vicious association of " Caribs " and " cannibals " has its origin . <p> Columbus wrote his Journal ( Document 1b ) on most evenings of that first voyage . He probably intended it for the Spanish monarchs , to whom a copy was later given . However , both the original version and the royal copy were lost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish historian BartolomT de Las Casas , which refers to Columbus as " the Admiral . " Before its loss the journal was used extensively by historians like Las Casas and Peter Martyr dAnghiera and by Columbuss brother and biographer , Fernando . Las Casass summary was itself mislaid and not published until the middle of the nineteenth century . Its fate was thus not unlike that of Ram=n PanTs account , which was commissioned by Columbus and likewise survived only in various translated and/or redacted forms . Apparent contradictions of fact and interpretation are evident in the Journal , suggesting a text that had not been extensively rewritten . <p> Diego Alvarez Chanca , a doctor to the Spanish sovereigns , was appointed the surgeon for Columbuss fleet . During Columbuss second voyage in 1494 , the same voyage on which Ram=n PanT arrived in the New World , he wrote his Report to the municipality of Seville , where he was born . Chancas account ( Document 2 ) is widely recognized as the principal source for that voyage , and together with PanTs account it proved an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native population . Although Chanca was not on the first voyage , in describing the progress of the second voyage through the Lesser Antilles he was certainly influenced by Columbuss own expectations . Chanca was quick to identify human remains , perhaps of funerary origin , as firm evidence of the cannibal propensities of the caribes . Chanca develops this initial distinction with various ethnological observations that ultimately allow him to declare unequivocally that " the way of life of these caribe people is bestial . " <p> Although quite different from these journals and letters , Ram=n PanTs account of the natives of Hispaniola also had its origin in ethnological delineation as a prelude to conquest . PanT was commissioned by Columbus himself to reside among the native people of Hispaniola and provide a description of their customs and habits . The resulting document , newly translated for this volume ( Document 3 ) , has had a very complex history , but is the most extensive eyewitness account we have of the people of Hispaniola , who would disappear soon after the Spanish occupation of the island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging colonial society , or fleeing from the epicenter of contact . While " caribes " are continuously mentioned throughout the literature of colonialism in the Caribbean and northern South America , it is only through the earliest accounts , particularly PanTs , that we have any information at all about the indigenous population of Hispaniola . For this reason PanTs Antiquities needs a more extensive contextualization than any other of the materials in this volume . It is both more obscure , because of its fraught history of editing and publication , and more illuminating , both because of the ethnographic nature of PanTs stance as author and because of the simple lack of other sources relating to this time and place . <p> But before a closer examination of PanTs account , we should mention the later writings of Rodrigo de Figueroa ( 1520 ) and Rodrigo de Navarrete ( 1550 ) , which also appear in this volume ( Documents 4 and 5 ) . Like PanTs Antiquities , these writings deal with not with caribes but with the aruacas . The term guatiao , although still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands alone , and disappeared altogether as the alliance with the aruacas came to dominate Spanish regional policy . Neither term really designates a distinct ethnic population . Rather , they were characterizations based on how such populations were seen in relation to Spanish ambitions . In fact , unlike the population of Hispaniola , which although nominally guatiao had fiercely resisted Spanish colonization , the aruacas emerged in the sixteenth century as firm supporters of the Spanish , even accepting black slaves from them to work aruaca tobacco plantations at the mouth of the Orinoco . In this way there was a rewriting of both the political history of the initial occupation through downplaying resistance on Hispaniola , as well as a continuing policy of political discrimination , deriving from the ethnological frameworks created by Figueroa and Navarrete . <p> The result has been that those initial observations by Europeans of the native population have become enshrined in the literature concerning the Caribbean region . Unfortunately , much recent scholarship has continued to reproduce these ideas . Part of the purpose of this volume , therefore , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in the Caribbean was a way of re-forming the political and cultural realities of the indigenous population . Consequently , our perceptions of the native Caribbean are heavily prejudiced by the distinction , first made by Columbus , between the fearsome caribes of the Lesser Antilles and the tractable aruaca or guatiao , later known as Tafno , populations of the Greater Antilles and Atlantic coast of the continent . This fallacious distinction was generalized ultimately across the whole of the northern part of the South American continent , with continuing implications for contemporary anthropology ( Whitehead 2002a ) . <p> Recent scholarship on the native population of the Caribbean has begun to make good that deficiency , but the tenacity of this ethnological dualism partly stems from the historical reason that it was directly adopted into Spanish colonial law , which defined caribes as any and all natives who opposed Spanish occupation in the Caribbean ( Hulme and Whitehead 1992 ; Sued-Badillo 1978 ; Whitehead 1995 ) . The result was that caribes were discovered on the continent as well as the islands , and the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial system of repartimiento ( a forced redistribution of native lands and peoples ) was applied widely . The political orientation of native societies over such issues thus strongly conditioned their political responses to all Europeans . The diplomacy initially exercised toward the caciques of Hispaniola strongly contrasts with the summary military invasions of Puerto Rico , Trinidad , and the Venezuelan littoral , the early hunting grounds for slavers seeking labor to replace the wasted population of the Greater Antilles . Ethnological expectations and definitions became critical political factors , as is shown in the great debate between BartolomT de Las Casas and Juan GinTs Seplveda concerning the humanity , rationality , and governance of the New World population . <p> These ethnological definitions were also responsive to the unfolding needs of the emergent colonial system . For example , in the case of the caribes it was finally necessary for the Spanish Crown to dispatch a special legal mission , under the licenciado ( magistrate ) Rodrigo de Figueroa , to make an evaluation as to the caribe nature of the native populations of the Caribbean islands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process was highly political , in that populations were assigned to the caribe category in a way that served the interests of the mine owners , planters , and slavers of Hispaniola and other Spanish enclaves in the region . Figueroas classification was therefore only tangentially related to substantive ethnological issues , being obsessed with the practice of cannibalism . This is shown both by the fact that populations that were previously guatiao could become caribe and by Figueroas own usage of the term caribe , in which the eating of human flesh is only one , although the most persistent , of the criteria he cites for so classifying a population . Perhaps not surprisingly , neither the judicial report of Figueroa nor the detailed information supplied by Ram=n PanT was sufficient to provide adequate support for policy making by the Spanish Crown . Not only were the ethnological judgments of the colonists often self-serving , but the colonial impact itself resulted in the emergence of new political groupings among the native population , reflecting these new political realties of ethnic and ethnological profiling . As the original population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to turn to the African slave trade for a supply of labor , but they were also , to offset the increasing resistance and depredation from caribes , forced to seek out new alliances among the still little-known peoples of the continent ( Whitehead and Alemn 2009 ) . <p> Preeminent among these new potential allies , and culturally and linguistically related to the peoples of the islands , were the Lokono . Probably the first direct contact between Europeans and the Lokono did not come until the 1530s , when a Spanish fleet under the command of Diego de Ordaz , with orders to explore and settle the Orinoco region , lost one of its vessels off the Atlantic coast south of the Orinoco . Many tales circulated in subsequent years as to what had become of the crew and colonists , including suggestions that they had largely survived the shipwreck and were still living among indigenous groups . Sometime in the 1540s this notion was dramatically confirmed by the appearance of an unnamed morisco in the Spanish settlement of Margarita , center of the Spanish pearl-diving industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of those survivors and to have been living ever since with other Spanish who were rescued by aruacas of the Berbice and Corentyne rivers . This incident is important not only for the historiography of Spanish colonization but also for the likely implication that the aruacas , principally consisting of the Lokono of the Guyana coastal savannas , had consciously developed their knowledge of these strange colonizers through pursuing all kinds of contacts with them . The previously untranslated document of Rodrigo de Navarrete , Relaci=n de las provincias y naciones que los Indios llaman Aruacas , is included here for the important light it sheds on the continuing processes of indigenous response to European colonization and how they were shaped by the fallacious and self-interested ethnological claims initiated by Columbus and elaborated by Figueroa and Navarrete . As will be evident from the Relaci=n , the aruacas were quite aware of the negative imagery surrounding the ethnic ascription caribe , and therefore the need to clearly distance themselves from that ascription . The native population was polarized around the question of how to meet and deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no single strategy was successful over time , and actual responses were often highly variable , even within the same village or household . <p> Navarrettes Relaci=n was relatively unknown in its day and so was not recruited to the kinds of polemical , juridical , political , and cultural roles that Ram=n PanTs Antiquities was . Moreover , if the Antiquities is the first and only glimpse of an evanescent Tafno , then Navarrettes Relaci=n is an early glimpse of the birth of a historical relationship between aruacas and a colonial ( then national ) society that does not disappear but rather increases in significance over time . Contemporary Lokono Arawaks , the historical descendants of the aruacas in Guyana , are keenly aware of their historical legacies , and it transpires that even the Tafno never completely disappeared ( see discussion below ) . Nonetheless , the encounter with Europe was a fundamental disjuncture in native patterns of historical development , and it is the nature of that disjuncture and the new historical trajectories born of that encounter that are reflected in all the materials collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light it sheds on the Lokono and their political and cosmological world . It is far briefer than PanTs account and , as we are told , written by someone who had never visited those lands . Their inhabitants , however , who had long been supplying food to Margarita , had constantly visited and lived with him . As the hub of the Spanish presence in the region , Margarita had manifest impacts on the native polities as far south as the province of the aruacas ( Lokono ) . Current archaeological research suggests that the Berbice River , mentioned by Navarrete as the heartland of the province , was the location of dense urban-scale populations with vast systems of agricultural fields that would have been directly responsible for the aruacas ability to deliver upwards of fifty tons of manioc flour in a single month . <p> Navarrete stresses that the aruacas wish to have contacts with the " Christians " and that they highly value a political , economic , and military alliance with the Spanish . The state of constant war between aruacas and caribes reported at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alliance , which is given a further subtle twist when Navarrete suggests that the aruacas were themselves in the process of driving out the caribes , who were the former rulers of the region . Navarrete notes that great war fleets of aruacas were gathered each summer to raid the caribes , underscoring their military capability in contrast to other guatiaos . His discussion of warfare and prisoners taken in battle is also a rhetorical opportunity to reinscribe the motif of cannibalistic caribes , who transculturate their prisoners spiritually through anthropophagic sacrifice , as opposed to the civilizing aruacas , who do so socially through enslavement . <p> Although Navarrete gives only a crude indication of aruaca cosmology , in contrast to PanTs rich if opaque account of Tafno ritual and mythology , one interesting detail that does emerge is the impressiveness of their astronomical knowledge . In addition , Navarrete says that an academy of teachers and prophets , the Cemetutu ( semitci in modern Lokono ) , was organized to perpetuate social and cultural memory through the formal performance of histories and their inculcation into the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls them . <p> Although the Journal and Letter of Columbus , as well as the deposition of Rodrigo Figueroa and the Relaci=n of Rodrigo de Navarrete , are all of special interest , it is Ram=n PanTs Antiquities that is the most remarkable among the texts of conquest . Commissioned by Christopher Columbus in 1494 , it represents the first systematic attempt to describe a culture of the Americas . Like Chanca , PanT traveled to the New World on Columbuss second voyage . He resided first on the north coast of the island of Aiti ( Hispaniola ) in the province of King Mayobanex and then , in early 1495 , moved south to the province of King Guarionex , where he lived for nearly two years . Despite the brevity of the resulting accountabout eight thousand wordsit is of singular significance to historians and anthropologists of the Caribbean , not just for its ethnographic descriptions of the natives of Aiti , but also for the way in which its many linguistic and textual transformations through the centuries have made it a continuing vehicle for historiographical and ethnological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived is discussed more below , but it is not difficult to see why it should have remained a matter of controversy , given how confusing , if not incoherent , it is . The Antiquities is also an unfinished manuscript , even in its first published form . Added to this is the fact that although it is an attempt at systematic ethnographic representation , it is somewhat enigmatic in its choice of ethnological subject matter . However , the title does tell us much about how PanT conceived of his task , for it is the " antiquity " of the natives that is under implicit comparison with the " modernity " of the conquerors . His very presence in the scenes that he records signals that they belong to a past that is now finished for the peoples of America , supplanted by the future that he represents . <p> The Antiquities opens with a description of the cosmology of the first beings of the native world , the wanderings of the culture hero Guagugiona , and the creation of women by men . PanT goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of idol worship , the vision quest of shamans , and their necromancy , from which vodou may have learned the famed art of zombi making . He also relates information on native attitudes to the Spanish and the prospects for their conversion . PanT himself was certainly aware of the often haphazard nature of his account , which he relates to the character of his informants . In chapter V PanT tells us that " they are not consistent in what they say ; nor it is possible to write in an orderly way what they tell . " Even so , apart from this native " inconsistency , " which is perhaps better understood as evidence of cultural variation , PanT creditably acknowledges in the first chapter his own omissions as an ethnographic observer : " Those I am writing about are of the island Hispaniola ; that means that I do not know anything of the other islands , since I have never seen them . " He does so again in chapter V : " And since they have neither letters nor writings , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I write them well . Hence I believe that I will put first what should be last , and will put what is last first . But all that I write in this way is narrated by them just as I write it , and thus I note it down as I heard it from the peoples of the country . " Certainly this admission makes PanTs text problematic from the point of view of contemporary anthropology , but there were also questions as to his linguistic competency in his own time : " This Fray Ram=n PanT found out what he could , insofar as he understood the languages . For there were three spoken on this island : he knew only one , however , that of a small province . . . called lower Macorix ; and he knew that language only imperfectly . Of the universal language he knew very little , like the rest of the Spaniards , although more than others because no-one . . . knew any of them perfectly except for a sailor . . . called Crist=bal Rodrfguez " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Las Casas adds that " all of this Fray Ram=n says he has understood from the Indians . He says some other things that are confused and of little substance , as a simple person who did not speak our Castilian tongue altogether well , since he was a Catalan by birth " ( chap . 167 ) . Thus , we can never be quite sure if the confusions and apparent contradictions of the text stem from PanTs poor grasp of the indigenous language or his lack of facility with Castilian . Further compounding this situation is that his account survives only as a translation into Italian , so the possible shortcomings of the translator , Alfonso de Ulloa , have to be considered as well . However , there are some more positive considerations in evaluating PanT as an ethnographer . In particular , his length of residence in Hispaniola , especially the years he spent in the province of King Guarionex , described in chapter XXV , suggest that whatever his linguistic capacities , he had the opportunity to observe much of daily life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PanT , as a member of the Hieronymite Order , was a hermit , as he states in the opening sentence of his Antiquities , and this may well have suited him for the ethnographic endeavor with which Columbus had charged him . Like hermits , ethnographers consciously remove themselves from the cultural context of " normal " life in order to gain a particular kind of knowledge . A hermit , of course , will live with no social contacts whatsoever , but the limited nature of social contact in a strange culture , the isolation of not speaking the language everyone else speaks , and the physical rigors of unfamiliar diet , climate , and customs at least suggest that one already prepared spiritually for a hermits life may well have fared better than others . <p> It is also significant that the Antiquities was titled in Spanish as a Relaci=n ( deposition ) , which was a legal form of documentation , like the one made by Rodrigo de Figueroa . Although many subsequent versions and reproductions of PanTs account use this loaded term , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus might have meant by it . But it does allow us , rather than blaming the failings of its creator , to appreciate better why the text came to have the form it does , and why what we might see as fatal flaws are in part due to the legal and political role the document came to play . Editing in any way a legally notarized deposition was no less of a suspect practice then than it is today . Paradoxically , the original is now only known through its simulacra , the first of which was the basis for the translation here , and which itself was produced in pursuit of a legal case by Ferdinand Columbus . <p> Despite its limitations , Ram=n PanTs Antiquities remains the first and only extended description of the myths , rituals , and cosmology of the native people on Hispaniola ; those made by BartolomT de Las Casas and Peter Martyr , despite their criticisms , directly relied on PanTs efforts . Moreover , since the Antiquities was personally commissioned by Christopher Columbus , it is infused with the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Antiquities with the tribulations of the Columbus family is directly relevant to understanding the form in which the manuscript was published . The Antiquities has survived only in an Italian translation made in 1571 by Alfonso de Ulloa , appearing in chapter 62 of Ferdinand Columbuss A Life of the Admiral . This version of PanTs text was incorporated wholesale into Ferdinand Columbuss biographical apology for his father , which accompanied his legal efforts to regain family possessions and titles on the island of Hispaniola . The apology was too controversial to be published in Spanish ; even after Ferdinands death it appeared only in this Italian version . <p> The Antiquities is a compelling and unique document of initial contact with the indigenous population of Hispaniola , which , through exposure to European diseases or flight away from the sites of Spanish settlement , had all but disappeared by the 1530s as colonization of the southern continent picked up pace . The Antiquities was thus by this time already a historical record of a vanished native culture . Indeed , as remarked earlier , the fact that PanT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of the work implies that the indigenous culture he describes , while already anachronistic in the face of Spanish conquest , nevertheless may be useful to record . This is consistent with PanTs role as a missionary evangelist in the territory of King Guarionex . These aspects of PanTs Antiquities also speak to us in a very contemporary way , for they highlight the connections between the ethnological gaze and colonial desire , between the writing of ethnography and its wider cultural meaning and even policy applications . The need for an ethnographic description of Hispaniola stemmed not from an abstract interest in human variety but from a pragmatic interest in the control and conversion of the native population through domination of its leaders . It is for this reason that PanT focuses so much on the cosmological and ritual practices of the Hispaniolan elite , and hardly at all on the forms of everyday life and subsistence . <p> PanTs Antiquities was not the only example of this kind of " official ethnology . " As already mentioned , subsequent to the destruction of the native population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of labor . The slavery of black Africans , which Las Casas briefly advocated precisely as a means to salvage the indigenous population , eventually provided a solution to this colonial dilemma . Rodrigo de Figueroa was commissioned in 1518 to investigate and discriminate caribe populations throughout the Caribbean and coastal South America . Unrelated to the controversies of the Columbian legacy , Figueroas report never achieved the subsequent fame of PanTs Antiquities , but in a similar fashion it attempted to define and locate political authority , cultural proclivity , and military ability , as a prelude to the conquest and enslavement of those populations . In place of the apparently tractable peoples depicted by PanT as a promising context for the establishment of empire , Figueroa portrays the wider Caribbean and mainland as riven by a fundamental cultural dualism in which the cannibalistic and warlike caribes threaten to overwhelm Spains natural allies , the aruaca or guatiaos of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico . This portrayal both licenses the legal enslavement of vast numbers of native peoples and , by allusion to the supposed depredations of the caribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of the Hispaniolan natives . Thus , it is critical that we read PanTs Antiquities not as an isolated and idiosyncratic work , but rather as a text with a political and cultural background to both its production and dissemination . <p> The nature of its transmission requires that we critically assess how the Antiquities functioned in the context of demonstrating Columbus family claims to Hispaniola , since it certainly seems as if Ferdinand was intent on marshaling any and all evidence he could for that purpose . The inclusion of this unfinished and often incoherent text in the Life of the Admiral may in turn stem from the way in which that work was hastily fashioned from the legal materials collected for the Columbus familys legal dispute with the Crown . Ferdinands hobby as a collector of books and manuscripts might have led to a catch-all approach to this task , and , as Ferdinand himself notes , PanTs Antiquities " contains so many fictions that the only sure thing to be learned from it is that the Indians have a certain natural reverence for the after-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 , 153 ) . However , this judgment is misplaced for many reasons , not least because the now-lost Spanish manuscript was also a source for Las Casass accounts of the indigenous population in the ApologTticahistoria ( chaps . 120 , 16667 ) and Peter Martyrs descriptions of the peoples of Hispaniola in De orbo novo decades ( 1516 , dec. 1 , chap . 9 ) . The Antiquities survival and transmission in various forms occurred not just because of its potential value as an ethnological description , but also because it directly underpins a positive evaluation of the reputation of Christopher Columbus through its allusion to a pristine , almost innocent , moment of encounter between Spain and the Indies , before subsequent colonial despoilers destroyed the natives of Hispaniola . In this way , one may come to see its lapses as a product of this context of production , not simply the ethnographic shortcomings of PanT himself , even if these remains a relevant consideration . <p> Challenging the linguistic competence of Ram=n PanT has been one of the major forms of critique of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach since it is full of , even overloaded with , PanTs versions of native terms . At the same time , the Antiquities iconic status as a record of vanished culture entails that the interpretation and usage of those native terms given by PanT , or later variants based on them , have a complex and even politically charged history . For example , the term Tafno , which is currently in vogue to refer to the indigenous population of the western Antilles , centering on Hispaniola , is a purely nineteenth-century invention by the antiquarian C. S. Rafinesque . It derives from the phrase , recorded in the early Spanish documentation , ni-taino , meaning " my-lord . " There is no evidence that this phrase was ever used by native people to designate the ethnic identity of themselves or others , and it does not appear in PanTs writings . Apparently unnoticed by previous commentators on the Antiquities , perhapsdue to an exclusive focus on these linguistic and etymological issues , is that PanT quite clearly states in chapter V , " Hispaniola , which before was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called my emphasis ; and that one and other islands are called Bouhi . " The term guatiao , which has evident phonetic connections with both these native terms , Aiti and Bouhi , was generically used to indicate allies or partners and thus describes culturally similar or nonthreatening groups , with the term caribe designating enemies or strangers . As discussed previously , following Figueroas report the term aruaca , deriving from the name given to native allies of the Spanish colonists on the northern Venezuelan coast , becomes more prevalent than guatiao , signaling the erasure of the indigenous political systems of Hispaniola and the growing importance of the possibilities for alliance and trade with the vast continent of South America . The key point , then , is that such terms were sociopolitical , not ethnolinguistic , in their reference , as was evident in the discussion of Figueroas report above . In that case , we must appreciate that modern usage of these termscaribe , guatiao , aruaca , Tafnostillbears the weight of past and continuing controversy . <p> The persistence of such disputes is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so intricate as almost to defy interpretation and which therefore has been the source of many dubious etymologies . PanT transcribed the speech acts of indigenous people over five hundred years ago , not into his natal tongue ( Catalan ) but into Castilian Spanish . This Spanish version was then translated into Italian for inclusion in a Venetian publication of Ferdinand Columbuss biography of his father , and the original was lost . All subsequent Spanish editions are therefore themselves translations from Italian , as is the newly translated English-language version presented here . The plethora of native words and names , far richer than in any other contemporary , and many later , accounts , is a key feature of PanTs Antiquities . To this day , all the word lists of a supposed Tafno language ultimately derive from Ram=n PanTs transcription of over one hundred terms . As a result , much of the scholarship surrounding the Antiquities has focused almost exclusively on making sense of this orthography and its many transformations since 1494 . The first English translation , based on the Italian version of Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1906 , and the only current English-language edition is JosT Juan Arroms version , translated by Susan Griswold , of his 1988 Spanish edition . Thus , no direct translation of the Italian into English has been made for over a century . <p> Both archaeologists and ethnohistorians , as well as Antilleanist intellectuals , uncritically adopted the term Tafno , overlooking PanTs clear statement that the proper term was Aiti , and in doing so continued the inventive process begun by Rafinesque in the nineteenth century . As we shall see , this has also had an impact on issues of contemporary cultural resistance and survival throughout the Caribbean . However , the field of anthropological and historical linguistics recently has undergone a shift in theoretical perspectives , such that the basic language classifications of twenty years ago are no longer universally accepted as valid . Instead they are often seen as descriptive of little else than the word lists that were used to construct them . There is now a far greater interest in the careful discrimination of historical speech communities , rather than formal linguistic structures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many Amerindian cultures , not least those on Hispaniola , as PanTs Antiquities makes perfectly clear . At the same time , the complex nature of the publication and translations of PanTs Antiquities means that the orthographic analogies by which many have attempted to reconstruct a Tafno language are at best only suggestive , and at worst actually misleading . The hypothetical etymologies that are employed to demonstrate continuities or shared properties with ethnographically recorded languages can therefore create the impression of a speech community that never in fact existed . In the context of PanTs description of the linguistic situation on Hispaniola in chapter XXV of his work , for example , the differences in speech he notes could have been related to social and political rank or even gender as much as ethnic identity . <p> This view of linguistic practice and plurality also has profound implications for a notion of unitary Tafno culture , which in turn has importance for Antilleanist intellectuals and for still-surviving indigenous populations of the Antilles . But this importance is a distinct issue from that of the historical and ethnological accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quite considerable historical and anthropological literature has developed in the last few years concerning both the native population of the Caribbean and the history of native society and culture in South America more generally . These new analyses and the kinds of data on which they are based might now be fruitfully used for a broader reading of PanTs Antiquities and its implicit understandings , as well as the more overt ethnological items with which earlier editions chiefly deal . Moreover , consonant with the current tendency by anthropologists to emphasize individual agency within social and cultural structures , as well as the symbiotic and mimetic nature of social and cultural interchange in the course of colonial encounter , much more can be inferred as to the nature of PanTs ethnographic experience , its wider implications for a reading of his Antiquities , and the context of other contemporary ethnological writings . Thus , the significance of the materials PanT presents , the forms of representation he chooses , and the argumentation by which they are interpreted necessarily become integral to the textual commentary . <p> PanT himself certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how observation is born of expectation as much as experiencea consideration that ethnographers now consider indispensable to their own writings on distant peoples . In point of fact , PanT is ethnographically reflexive on precisely the issue of his lack of a systematic portrayal of native culture , as he is no less frank about missing information that he failed to collect . In this way the text itself may be said to implicitly illustrate the context for PanTs ethnography . Through a close reading of his Antiquities we also may be able to perceive some of the nuances of the varying political interests and ritual proclivities of the native population . This is particularly so in the passages in chapters XV and XVI that discuss the conversion of King Guarionex . Equally in need of further interpretation and commentary are the descriptions of the cimi ( also rendered as zemi in subsequent literature ) cult and its attendant ritual , since earlier editions discuss only the putative etymologies and translations of the names of cimis . But the superfluity of names that PanT displays was perhaps designed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to provide systematic cultural information . The persistent iteration of exotic names thus can be understood as compensating for the other ethnographic " inadequacies " of the text itself . In any case , not all names have a literal meaning , but they are unique descriptors and so need not be considered correct or incorrect . <p> That earlier emphasis on the cultural significance of the etymology and meaning of cimi names generally precludes consideration of other aspects of the descriptions in PanTs Antiquities that contemporary historical anthropologists would consider central , such as the elite nature of cimi worship , or the prophecy of the Spaniards arrival by the zemi Giocauugama , recounted in chapter XV : <p> They say that this cacique claimed that he had talked with Giocauugama , who told him that those who would have survived him would enjoy their rule for a short time , because dressed people would arrive in their country , who would dominate and kill them , and that they would starve to death . At first they thought that these people had to be the cannibali , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do anything else other than grab and run , it had to be other people that the cimi indicated . Hence , they now believe that these are the admiral and the people that he brings . <p> The identification of the Spanish with the " cannibal caribes " is notable in this passage and ironically reflects the actual outcome of the arrival of the " dressed people , " who did indeed utterly consume the population of Hispaniola . The relative scarcity , which Las Casas emphasizes ( 1909 , 65ff ) , of cimi worship outside Hispaniola also seems to directly contradict the idea often inferred by commentators on the Antiquities of a unitary , or even very widespread , Tafno culture . Moreover , both Las Casas and particularly PanT indicate that their observations relate rather more to the practices of the rulers than the ruled . PanT writes in chapter XIII , " I have seen parts of this with my own eyes , while of the other things I narrated only what I learned from many , especially the principal men , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these tales more certainly than the others . " In short , the nature of Ram=n PanTs text can be better revealed through a direct historical ethnography of the Tafno themselves , in addition to the kinds of textual commentary and lexical analysis that have otherwise constituted the main forms of critique . <p> Cosmology and Ritual in the Tafno World <p> Lacking historical background and uninformative as to the wider networks of indigenous political life , PanTs information is only a snapshot of the indigenous world on Aiti . As is inevitable in any ethnographic enterprise , PanTs interests and opportunities were skewed by the social context of his informants . But because his informants were mostly the lords and kings of the provinces he resided in as a guest of Kings Mayobanex and Guarionex , his account gives us significant insight into the cosmology of the indigenous population , particularly the foundational myths of creation and the establishment of political authority and order , topics that would have been of particular relevance for the ruling elite . What kind of " guest " PanT may have been and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstructed , but this context certainly commands close attention to the results of that sojourn . Lacking historical background and uninformative as to the wider networks of indigenous political life , PanTs information is only a snapshot of the indigenous world on Aiti . <p> Central to this mythic charter for the Tafno political order were the myth-histories of the heroes and divinities Guagugiona and Caracaracol , introduced in chapters IV and X , respectively : " Guagugiona left with the women and went looking for other lands , and he arrived at Matinino , where he immediately left the women , and went to another region called Guanin , and they had left the small children by a creek . " This brief passage , with the benefit of wider reading in PanTs own text as well as other contemporary sources and subsequent accounts and ethnographies , summates a key principle in the charter . Thus , the first ancestor , Guagugiona , when he left Aiti for Matinino ( Martinique ) , persuaded the women to accompany him , abandoning their husbands but bringing with them their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw beautiful seashells ( cobo ) . which , following the example of Guagugionas brother-in-law , they descended into the sea to admire . Here they were left by Guagugiona , who then returned with the first guanin ( gold-copper-alloy objects ) and ciba ( magic stones , also called takua ) . In this context the term " caribe " therefore seems to allude to a political , not an ethnic , status , deriving from the mythology of Guagugiona as originator of a political and economic order in which persons are exchanged for things ( gold and jade work ) with groups living in the southern Antillean islands and the continent.The myth cycle establishes the ideological underpinning of an elite trade in which drugs , seashells ( shell necklaces ) , and persons ( women and children ) were exchanged for gold and magic stones ( takua ) , the latter significantly being carved mostly in the form of frogs . Matinino , " the island of women , " represents the site of these exchanges , replicating the pattern of exchange that Spanish sources coded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver 2009 , 157 ) . The connection of Matinino with the Amazon-women myth cycle of the South American continent is reinforced by the origin of the ciba as derived from female water spirits , just as the continental takua were said to be made by the " water mama , " who to this day still supplies the stones for smoothing pottery among the Pomeroon Karia of coastal Guyana , called caribes in Spanish sources . In this symbolic and mythic context , it is not difficult to see why the caribes of Martinique , Dominica , and Guadeloupe , as a result of their intimate connections of war , marriage , and trade with the people of Aiti , were constructed as consumers of persons , or " cannibals . " In this context , it also becomes possible to understand the otherwise contradictory observation that Caonabo , one of the other principal caciques of Aiti , was himself a caribe according to contemporary sources . This again underlines the point that caribe was a political , as much as cultural or ethnic , designation ( see also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the importance of establishing elite male predominance in the system of extra-island exchanges , the myth of the caracaracol men , and in particular the figure of Dimiuan Caracaracol , inscribes male action as also at the source of gender differentiation . PanT writes in chapter VII <p> that one day men went washing themselves ; . . . they were longing to have some women , . . . without being able to find any news of them , but that day . . . they saw coming down from some trees , lowering down along the branches , a certain shape of person , which were neither men nor women , neither had they masculine or feminine characteristics ; which they went to capture ; but they escaped , as if they were eels . . . . They called two or three men . . . to go and . . . seek out for each one of them a caracaracol man , because they have coarse hands ; so they could hold them tight . . . . And so they brought in four caracaracoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that makes the body very coarse . After they caught them , they deliberated on how to make them women , since they had neither a male nor female nature . <p> This the men did : " They went looking for a bird called inriri . . . that makes holes in the trees woodpecker . Likewise , they took those women with neither male nor female nature , and tied their hands and feet , and got the aforesaid bird , and tied it to their body , and thinking they were wood beams it started its usual work , pecking and puncturing in the place where it usually happens that the nature of women is . In this way , then , the Indians say they got women , according to what the elders tell . " PanT follows this account with another disclaimer : " Given that I wrote quickly , and I that did not have enough paper , I could not put in the right place what by mistake I moved to another place . But with all this I am not mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us now return to what we should have put first , namely their opinion on the origin and beginning of the sea . " PanT goes on to relate how , from a monstrous swelling on his back ( clearly depicted in figure 1 ) , one of the caracaracol men , Dimiuan , gives birth to a turtle , first creature of the sea , with the help of his " nameless " brothers . The men thus make women with a woodpecker , and then , in an act of ancestral cannibalism , Dimiuan Caracaracol , by eating the first children of these women , establishes the right of men to consume the progeny of women as wives and slaves . Caught in the act , Dimiuan drops a gourd of water and causes the Caribbean Sea to flow into the world . In these mythic realms , then , men , especially lordly men , are constructed as originators of sociality , its inverse cannibalism , and the geographical landscape of the island ( see map 1 ) . <p> Apart from these charters of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights into the ritual means through which this order was sustained . In particular , the cimis ( which he also calls cimini or cimiches ) were powerful idols of stone , wood , or other plant materials that were kept in the possession of the caciques ( see figs. 46 ) . The text of the Antiquities gives many details about the cimis names , proclivities , origins , and so forth . PanT nicely summarizes their variety in chapter XV : " The majority of those of the island of Hispaniola have many cimini of various kinds . Some hold the bones of the father , or of the mother , or of the relatives , or of the forebears ; and they are made of stone or wood . And of the two kinds they have many : some that speak , others that make food grow , others that make rain , and others that make winds blow . " It is clear from the text of the Antiquities that such cimi were only contingently realized in these material forms and were a class of spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could also be used and dialogued with through the ritual performance of the bohuti ( also called buhuitihu in the text ) . In chapter XXIV PanT gives a very important description of this dialogue and the materialization of the cimi spirit through the making of carved idols . A shaman addresses a tree that has been seen to move its roots : " Tell me who you are , and what you are doing here , and what you want from me , and why you sent for me . Tell me if you want that I cut you , or if you want to come with me , and how do you want that I carry you , and I will build you a house with possessions. So that tree , or cimiche , made idol , or devil , answers , telling him the form in which he wants to be made . And he cuts it , and makes it in the way he ordered him . " <p> One dramatic aspect of the ritual performance of the bohuti described by PanT that has hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the practice of vodou , and particularly the creation of zombies , or resurrection of the dead . Although it is usually thought to have derived exclusively from African practices brought by the black slaves , there are a number of reasons , beginning with PanTs text , to suppose that in fact this aspect of vodou necromancy was also strongly informed by contacts with the still-surviving aboriginal population of the island . Just as the name Haiti obviously derives from the native name Aiti , so too do aspects of the zombi ritual derive from vodou . Moreover , the term zombi is no less plausibly derived from the cognate word recorded by PanT as cimini and in other Caribbean languages , such as Karipuna , as cimi or semi , where also the suffix -iba designates the material and fleshly form that spirit beings might adopt . Zemi-iba ( spirit of flesh ) seems no less likely as the source for this term than the current derivation in Africanist scholarship from the name of a West African deity , one not even associated with resurrection or death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning is to risk committing the same error of etymological obsession that has previously so limited the interpretations made from PanTs text . It is the startling description of zombi making in chapter XVII of PanTs text that is the real evidence here : <p> They take the juice of the leaves and cut the nails and the hair bangs of the dead and they pulverize them with two stones and mix them with the juice of the said herb , and they give it to the dead to drink by the nose or the mouth ; and while they do this they ask the dead person if the doctor bohuti was the cause of his death . . . . And they ask this several times , until the dead person speaks as if he were alive ; in a such way he answers all that they want to know from him , saying that the buhuitihu did not follow the diet , or on that occasion was responsible of his death ; and they say that the doctor asks him if he is alive , and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is dead . And having known what they wanted to know , they return him to the grave , from where they took him , to know from him what we just said . <p> If this were just an isolated report of shamanic resurrection of the dead , it would still have an important bearing on understanding the origins of vodou . But in fact the ability to kill and resurrect is a defining skill of the shaman throughout South America ( Whitehead 2002b ; Whitehead and Wright 2004 ) . In my ethnographic account of kanaima ( dark shamans ) among the Patamuna of Guyana , the power of resurrection , wulukatok in the Patamuna language , is central to shamanic power . As I was told by one informant , " My father was so Amerindian . . . . He no went school , and he could kill and resurrect you in a day ! " ( Whitehead 2002b , 174 ) . Obviously this is not to deny African influence in magic of zombi making , but it is relevant to note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the houngan : while the houngan is a priest and associated with genealogy , family magic , and curing , the bokor is an outsider figure , possibly due to the derivation of this role from indigenous shamanic practices . Within Haitian vodou , zombi making is connected with the Bizango ceremony of the Petwa rite , and Baron Samedi , its principal deity , was actually " born " in America , according to vodou practitioners . The Bizango rite itself stems from the earliest slave transportations from Senegal-Gambia , and rebel communities of such slaves , together with refugee indigenes , are clearly recorded on Aiti from the early sixteenth century onwards . This was the fertile context for a melding of African and American shamanic forms , and there were many contacts , even after the supposed disappearance of the indigenous population , between rebel slaves and remnant native groups . The intellectual trend to derive vodou from West Africa comes much later , following the French occupation of Aiti , so it is relevant to note that " Haiti " was the name given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new black republic at the end of the eighteenth century . A legacy of war magic and dark shamanism among escaped slaves , stemming from Amerindian modes of spirituality , is also signaled by the fact that the rite that initiated the great slave uprising against the French was the Bwa Kayiman ritual , dedicated to the lord of the forests , realm of the Amerindians . <p> The wider context for Caribbean necromancy is not only Amazonian shamanism but also of course the Aztec and their Lord of Night and Sorcery , Tezcatlipoca , whose skull-like face is a recurrent motif in ceremonial objects from Cuba , Haiti , Puerto Rico , and the Dominican Republic . Even more apparent is the similarity in depictions of the Aztec Lord of the Dead , Mictlantecuhtli , and in representations on cohoba equipment ( fig. 2 ) and cimis ( fig. 5 ) , possibly of Machetaurie , Lord of the House of the Dead , mentioned in chapter XII of the Antiquities . Likewise , the " spectacled " figure of Tlaloc , widespread in Central American cultures , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined eyes ( ethnographically associated with shamanic vision ) , especially on masks , which were a prominent part of Central American as well as Caribbean ceremonial equipment . Indeed , a mask with such " spectacles , " as well as other eyepieces made from shell , are all reported archaeologically as well as in contemporary descriptions . <p> It is no less suggestive , then , that Dumbalaa snake spirit in vodoumay also be related to indigenous practice in the way in which the bohuti could be resurrected even after being killed and dismembered , specifically by being licked on the face by a swarm of many differently colored snakes commanded by the bohuti , as described in chapter XVIII : <p> At night they say that many snakes of various kinds come , white , black , and green , and of many other colors , which lick the face and the whole body of the aforesaid doctor , who , as we said , was thought dead and left there ; and he stays there two or three nights ; and they say that while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join again and heal , and that he stands up and walks slowly and goes back home ; and those who see him question him , saying , " Were you not dead ? " but he answers that the cimini came to help him in the form of snakes . <p> The exercise of such dramatic and profound spiritual power was also connected to the ruling caciques through the cohoba cult . PanT comments on the cult just once , in chapter XV , speaking about the bohuti : " To purge himself he takes a certain powder called cohoba , inhaling it by the nose , which intoxicates him in such a way that they do not know what they do ; and they say many things out of the ordinary , in which they affirm that they talk with the cimini , and that they tell them that the illness came from them . " However , the archaeological artifact assembly and other historical accounts , such as that of Las Casas , all suggest that this was an activity not just of the bohuti but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual may be related to his general emphasis on cosmology and spiritual practice rather than the sphere of political order . By the same token , PanT does not mention ball courts or the duho ( ceremonial throne ) at all , yet these items of material culture , as well as the ritual equipment for the cohoba cult of the caciques , consisting of elaborately decorated trays , pestles , mortars , and vomit spatulas ( see fig. 3 ) , are among the key material remains of native culture in the Caribbean ( Bercht et al . 1997 ) . <p> PanT concludes the Antiquities with a sense of the gathering storm of destruction that woul devastate and disperse the native population of Aiti . Having recorded the prophecy of the coming of the " dressed people , " he relates the following incident in chapters XXIVXXV : " Six men went to the house of prayer , which the catechumens , who were seven , had under guard , and by order of Guarionex they told them to take the images that Fray Roman had left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear them apart . . . . As they left the house of prayer , they threw the images on the ground , and they covered them with soil and pissed on them , saying : Now your fruits will be good and large ; and then they buried them in a garden . " Even Guarionex , who had not taken part in the first battle of Vega Real , is by this point clearly more resistant to Spanish dominance . PanTs own opinion on conversion , given in chapter XXVI , makes evident enough why such resistance was growing even among those initially cooperative with the Spanish : <p> Truly the island is in great need of people to punish the lords when they deserve it , make them understand the things of the saint Catholic faith , and train them in that . . . . <p> . . . The first Christian was Giauauuari , in whose house there were seventeen persons , who all became Christians , just by letting them know that there is one God , who made everything and created the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained ; given that , they easily believed . But with the others force and ingenuity are necessary , because not everyone is of the same nature : therefore , if they had a good beginning and a better end , there would be others who would start well and then would laugh at what is taught to them ; for them force and punishment are necessary . <p> So began the conquest of America . <p> Unending Conquest , Enduring Resistance <p> The primal visions in these early texts have great significance in the contemporary cultural politics of the Caribbean , as well as in the persistence of the indigenous peoples they try to describe . The tragedy of the European conquest and colonization of the Caribbean and the rest of the Americas would be hard to overstate . But in the case of the peoples of the Caribbean , this has all too often been assumed to entail their complete erasure , physically and culturally , an assumption that has suited the triumphalist historiography that often informs the " heroic " tale of a few " brave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast and populous territories of their " New World . " But , as in the still-unfolding history of the aruacas , the figure of the all-conquering European obscures the important histories of continuity and survival of native peoples into the present day . Equally , exculpatory emphasis on the impersonal forces of biology and technology , important though they may have been , neglects the fact that the presence of those biologies and the deployment of those technologies were no less the product of European political decisions than the overt violence of slavery , war , and missionary conversion . Despite the virulence of the epidemics that followed the first contacts in the late fifteenth century , there were still plenty of natives against whom wars of conquest and extermination could be waged well into the late nineteenth century , as occurred in the United States . In point of fact , the peoples of Aiti did not disappear or fade away quietly but have remained a physical presence throughout the Caribbean , even if this has been unacknowledged by successive governments that preferred to assimilate such survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged during the sixteenth century ( Whitehead 1999a ) . <p> Political alliance and social interconnection with the cimarrones ( rebel black slaves ) who were imported to support a plantation economy , as well as migration to the smaller islands and mainland of South America , were important factors in the indigenous history of this region . Equally , the emergence of the caribes as both indomitable opponents and vital collaborators in the colonial design of the region encompassed refugee groups from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico . Recognition of this legacy in the idea of nationhood has occurred only recently , but PanTs text has been a vehicle for recovering the importance of native peoples for an Antilleanist historiography of the Caribbean in which , if not fully incorporated as political actors , indigenous people nonetheless loom large as necessary progenitors of Caribbean modernity . Although I have commented above on the indigenous legacies present within vodou and the related mainland practice of obeah strictly as they relate to PanTs text , such legacies within Afro-American cultures have recently begun to be more clearly recognized as a widespread component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Antiquities has captured the imagination of so many is reflected in its continuing relevance to the cultural revival of the Tafno nation and the establishment of the indigenist presence in modern Caribbean society . This process becomes materially and ideologically evident through the production of the idea of the " Tafno " as an aesthetic commodity and as a source of political assertion . As an aesthetic commodity , the term Tafno and recreated images of Tafno persons circulate widely in the Caribbean , particularly in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic , as well as among immigrant communities in the United States . More central to cultural revival has been the formation of a Tafno nation with its own flag , leadership , and promotion of cultural events to re-enact and rehearse " Tafno " culture : <p> We the Tafno People and Nation have been involved in the serious and difficult task of restoration and implementation of the diverse aspects of our culture and heritage . <p> For the past 17 years our main work has been to bring the People together ; reconnecting individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very concept of " being a People " itself had to be brought back . <p> As a result of our work the myth of extinction has been shattered ; Identity established and the culture and ancestral language revitalized . <p> In this process , PanTs text has been a valuable primary source of lexical recovery and suggestions for the re-creation of cultural behavior , as with the zemi ( cimi ) cult . Inevitably , re-creation of the spiritual order has been less a matter of developing shamanic technique and more an aesthetic engagement with the idea of " Tafno " and indigenous resistance to the Spanish . Heroic portraits of Tafno warriors , modern renderings of zemi carvings , re-enactments of Tafno ceremonies and clothing , and an interest in the preservation of archaeological sites are all expressions of this newfound nationhood . PanTs text is at one and the same time idiosyncratic , partial , credulous , and cynical , but in the end it is all that remains of that first moment of violent encounter between the Spanish war fleets and the peoples of Aiti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history in the Americas means that PanTs text will always overcome its shortcomings as history or anthropology and will always be closely studied and commented on , even as our interests in what it may tell us constantly change in conjunction with the shifting cultural agendas and historiographical desires of the day . In a similar way , the documents of Columbus , Chanca , Figueroa , and Navarrete collected here function to establish the counterposed ethnological and political categories of caribe and aruaca ( although the much wider story that Rodrigo de Navarrete shows us , of how not only aruacas but also caribes went on to be " discovered " throughout northern South America , is beyond the scope of this volume ) . By the pairing of these extracts with PanTs account the emergence of these ethnological and cultural categories can be better understood , as can the political persistence of caribes and aruacas , who represent historical responses to the challenges of interacting with a growing Atlantic world . Such processes are over five hundred years old and so have produced ethnic sentiments that express these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honduras , and Belize who represent the descendants of those first caribes thus take pride in their resistant and rebellious history and now see the charge of cannibalism as a source of grim satisfaction , not shame . Of course there is a much wider story told through the documents of Columbus , Chanca , Figueroa , PanT , and Navarrete presented here . Columbus and Chanca firmly inscribe the category of caribe and the connection to supposed cannibalism , which , the text of Figueroa shows us , was deployed with deadly effect in the subsequent colonization of the Caribbean . The text of PanT , like that of Navarrete , is oriented to what were perceived as potentially more tractable elements of the native population . In later writings aruacas and caribes were " discovered " and described throughout northern South America , but the primal anthropology of Fray Ram=n PanTs Antiquities and the other writings presented here were the foundation for the baleful work of conquest and colonialism that underpinned the relentless invention of our new , modern world .

Investigations of production and reception also require an awareness of mediation , or how texts were transferred from writer to audience . The epigraph , taken from Writing Faith : Text , Sign , and History in the Miracles of Sainte Foy , illustrates how Kathleen Ashley and Pamela Sheingorn have situated themselves as modern readers of the medieval miracle stories of Saint Foy . They assert that hagiographical writings are rhetorical texts , ones that are crafted and shaped for particular audiences with specific purposes . In drawing on semiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacuum but has multiple associations , relationships to other signs or sign systems . Any given saints life or miracle story of that saint , therefore , is connected to the larger system of hagiographical writing , even as it has a relationship to the written and oral sources on which it is based , the liturgical or devotional rituals that it supports , the theological ideas that it represents , the historical and political events surrounding its production , and the religious and lay communities that it addresses , or the audiences who experience it . <p> I begin this book , Signs of Devotion , by considering what the rhetorical field of hagiography offers about medieval religious culture . In the past , religious scholars unquestioningly embraced saints lives as sacred texts , others discounted the historical value of hagiographical texts , and still others derided them as second-rate literary exercises that revealed little about language and poetics . Important work has begun to shift these attitudes . The acceptance of saints cults as a legitimate form of academic study rests in large part on the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as women and laborers ) , cultural values and expectations , medieval reading practices , and devotional behavior . The study of saints is inherently a multidisciplinary enterprise , and this has afforded scholars a means to interrogate the complexities of medieval religious life that was not bound by disciplinary rules . That hagiography has achieved a central place in modern academic work is demonstrated by a number of publications . Influential studies have revealed the significance of a single cult to a specific community , where others have demonstrated how a cult was celebrated in various places and in distinct historical moments . In addition , some have shown how groups of saints , particularly the virgin martyrs , are revelatory about medieval attitudes regarding gender and ideology , while other specialists have investigated the generic relation of hagiographical writings to historical or literary texts . Scholars have used a variety of approaches , focusing their work on hagiographical sources , disciplinary objectives , or theoretical understandings of the past and present . All , in some form or other , have provided an entrTe into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reshaping our understanding of medieval religiosity by investigating the ways in which the cult of saints " makes meaning " for devotees . <p> The great majority of this scholarship focuses on universal saints , particularly when attention has been focused on late medieval English devotion . Native saints , those who are venerated only in the locality or region where they lived , or where their remains were interred , have received some attention , as books on the Anglo-Saxon cults of Mildrith , Cuthbert , and Swithun attest . Still , there is a great deal of evidence regarding insular devotional practice , both before and after the Conquest , that has not been assessed , and still less regarding early cults that survived or were reinvigorated post-Conquest . Toward this end , I have focused this study on thelthryth of Ely ( d. 679 ) , who was the most important native female saint in England and one of the most significant of all native English saints . Spanning a nine-hundred-year period , her cult boasts a mass of evidence to document this saints popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thelthryth became such an important signifier for medieval communities from vastly different time periods and social classes . <p> Hagiographical narratives , monastic charters , liturgical texts , miracle stories , estate litigation , shrine accounts , and visual representations collectively testify that the story of thelthryth was an important part of the cultural landscape in medieval England . The abbess was made famous by Bede , who relates that she was an East Anglian princess who had resisted the conjugal demands of two political marriages to maintain her virginity . The early eighth-century historian quotes eyewitness testimony regarding thelthryths chastity within marriage before recording that she divorced her second husband , King Ecgfrith of Northumbria , and forfeited her royal position to become a nun . After her profession , thelthryth founded a monastery at Ely in 672/3 , where she ruled as abbess for six years before dying of a tumor . A translationa ceremonial exhumation and reburialof her corpse , which included an exhumation and reinterment , revealed that her body had not decayed after sixteen years and that the surgically lanced tumor had healed . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained virginity despite her marriages and had received Gods favor . A number of miracles , which were associated with the original shroud and coffin in which she was buried , provided further proof of her sanctity . <p> thelthryths story contains a series of cultural signsroyal asceticism , political marriage , conjugal chastity , monastic patronage , bodily incorruption , maternal nourishmentthat deserve examination . Narratives about the saint are fixated on embodiment : the body as a physical object , the wondrous body , the virginal body , the chaste body , the perfection of the body , the healing of the body , the body as metaphor , the body as empirical proof of holiness , the body as place , the body as referent . Moreover , each of these significations relates to historically specific concerns , such as the developing Anglo-Saxon church , the ideological project of the Benedictine Reforms , and institutional sovereignty during the Norman Conquest . thelthryths body also does cultural work as a site of vanity , pollution , disease , confession , and transformation . These are but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the texts produced to honor her memory , be they written , aural , or visual . In truth , the extensive history of textual production of this cult illustrates the complex ways the imagery of the saint could be recrafted , depending on social or political circumstance . Thus , the methodology that underpins Signs of Devotion demonstrates how we can organize resources from various disciplines to highlight the responses and attitudes toward saints in widely divergent historical moments , and how these can be charted as a means of recording venerative practices and religious belief over time . <p> While Signs of Devotion is hugely indebted to other investigations of sanctity , virginity , and religious practice , it is distinctive within the field of hagiographical research . This monograph is the first longitudinal study of an early Anglo-Saxon cult , providing critical analyses of both written and visual texts dating from the early eighth century to the destruction of the saints shrine at the Reformation . In examining the production and reception of texts , I demonstrate how one national figure provides a central point of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended period of timereligious and lay , aristocratic and common , male and female , literate and nonliterate . This study finds that the figure of thelthryth became a malleableindeed , a multivalentimage that could be readily adapted by a variety of medieval groups , but , more important , it reveals the particular devotional practices of these groups . My intent here is similar , to uncover the ways in which a regional female saints body operates as a cultural signifier in several different historical periods , among quite divergent audiences , using a variety of data:vitae , miracle stories , liturgy , and visual representations . By centering the discussion around issues of textual production and reception , these chapters provide illustrative commentary on English hagiography , cultural belief , and devotional practice . <p> &lt;Table 1 about here , or in next paragraph&gt; <p> Begun after the elevation and translation of the saints body in 695 , the cult developed because of Bedes investment in presenting thelthryth as a central figure of the emerging Anglo-Saxon church . ( See Table 1 for a historical overview of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , early period , the cult flourished after the Norman Conquest and was well supported until the dissolution of the monasteries in the early sixteenth century . Few English cults survived long enough to support the type of inquiry taken up in this book , and far too many scholars have been bound by the periodic division that separates Anglo-Saxon studies from late medieval scholarship . It is significant that the cult of thelthryth is particularly suited to a chronological and multidisciplinary study , in no small part because the saint was venerated for more than nine hundred years . The Saxon cult was invigorated by the support of influential figures , such as Bede in the early eighth century and Bishop thelwold and King Edgar in the late tenth century . Once the cult was adopted by the Normans in the late eleventh century , the Isle of Ely became an important locus of institutional power , and as such the monastic center promoted its own political and economic interests using stories and architectural programs to illustrate the saints power , agency , and autonomy . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of this cult in lay communities of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . The collective textual and visual evidence , which is abundant , illustrates how devotion to the saint was changed or modified over a significant period of history : at one moment , thelthryth is characterized as a model of chastity that Anglo-Saxon lay men could emulate ; at another , she is presented as the patron who wreaks vengeance on those who abuse her properties during the Norman Conquest ; and at still another , she is the pious aristocratic woman who successfully negotiates the social demands of marriage , even as she uses her dower properties to support the development of nunneries . Through these portraits , we learn a great deal about the producers and consumers of this cultand , by extension , we can examine the changing nature of English devotional practice over time . In effect , Signs of Devotion reveals how medieval people actively adapted cults to their own purposes , and these revelations allow us to consider the complex ways in which devotional figures could be utilized for both religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that while saints were perceived as intermediaries between petitioners and God , they could also be recast as intelligible signs that devotees used to negotiate the social , economic , and political aspects of their daily lives . <p> Longevity alone does not account for the value found in studying this English cult . Several other factors contribute to its selection as a model for multidisciplinary study . First , thelthryth was categorized in several ways : queen , widow , virgin , abbess , and saint . Each role provided multiple audiences with a means to identify with her life . Where the Ely monks valued the image of their protector saint and produced collections of miracles during the twelfth century to reclaim properties appropriated during the Norman invasion , aristocratic lay women seemed far more invested in thelthryths conduct as wife and patron . A vita , written in Anglo-Norman in the early thirteenth century by an aristocratic woman , seems to have been produced specifically for women who had been married before adopting a religious career . The proverbial statements included therein are framed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious institutions . The differences between the Ely monks and the aristocratic females as promoters and as consumers of the cult illustrates well how easily this holy figure was appropriated and used to mitigate the behaviors of disparate audiences . <p> &lt;comp : insert table 2 approximately here or in the paragraph below&gt; <p> Second , thelthryths accessibility might well account for the large number of vitae , or saints lives , that survive about her . At least twenty-five versions exist , and the differences between them hint at the various groups who embraced this cult . Table 2 offers a chronological overview of the vitae associated with this cult , and it indicates the author of each , if known , the manuscripts or modern edition in which it can be found , and the language and form in which it is written ( prose is assumed unless otherwise indicated ) . The existence of so many narratives , all deriving ultimately from Bedes account , is evidence of the significance of this cult from its inception through the Reformation . Some lives were written in Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old English , Anglo-Norman , and Middle English . The vernacular texts appear to have been produced alternately for clerical consumption , for the edification of nuns , and for lay devotional reading . For instance , the discussion of Bishop thelwolds refoundation of Ely during the Benedictine Reforms focuses on a mass blessing that accompanies a full-page miniature of the saint in the bishops lavishly decorated benedictional ( BL , Add . MS 49598 ) . When examined alongside an Old Englishlife translated by thelwolds student lfric and presented to an aristocratic lay audience , we see how thelthryth became the iconographic symbol of Benedictine chastity , an image of monastic piety that induced lay men to put aside their wives and join the monastic life of celibacy and piety . A comparison of these materials in tandem shows that thelwold was actively promoting a particular image of the saint and using her story as a means to advance the reformers ideals . Signs of Devotion examines , therefore , several important vitae and the context under which they were produced . Comparing the variations among these texts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimagined for new audiences , even as we consider why late medieval groups had such an investment in maintaining the cult of an early Saxon woman . <p> Third , dedications to thelthryth ( of parishes , chantries , guilds , and altar lights ) indicate how this regional saint was received as a national saint , particularly by those who had little or no access to devotional reading material or to the promotional documents of the cult center . Cultural literacies have been the focus of much scholarship , and , as many have argued , literacy is defined by ones ability to interpret the communitys signs . Because saints were featured prominently in ecclesiastical ornamentation , they provide an avenue to examine the issues of literacy ; religious rituals of devotion demonstrate how these saints were received and understood as cultural icons . My investigation of the iconography of the virginal , female body is not , however , concerned with the emblematic attributes that identify a saint . Instead , iconography here is also understood as part of the semiotic system that is the medieval cult of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are sociohistorical and sociopolitical concerns that are uniquely linked to the context in which a narrative text or visual text is produced . The large number of surviving images in parish ornamentation , for example , illustrate that laity throughout southern England embraced thelthryth and , in at least one circumstance , included her in a complex narrative about virginity and purification . This portrait , which is presented on the parish roodscreen at Ranworth , Norfolk , illustrates the saint as a local incarnation of maternal virginity , an abbess who teaches about the virtues of virginity . The image of thelthryth as abbess and mother exists in direct counterpoint to another of Saint Margaret , the patron saint of pregnant women . The two virgin saints portraits are bookends that frame the elaborate screen , containing its meanings and forcing viewers to draw the images into a collective narrative about womens sexuality and virtue . The Ranworth roodscreen indicates that some knowledge about thelthryths role as abbess circulated among lay audiences in East Anglia . In Signs of Devotion , I am especially concerned with examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult center and locality , even as I focus on the ways in which laity adapted the saints biography for their own ends . My aim , therefore , is not to study the representations of thelthryth as a set of static patterns , but rather to uncover the multivalent representations of this females body over time . <p> The cult of Saint thelthryth , as I have suggested , provides a dynamic lens through which we can examine changing religious behaviors in early and late medieval England . The various groups who showed devotion to the saint were male and female , lay and religious , aristocratic and bourgeois . The actions and reactions of these medieval people demonstrate how the figure was appropriated and transformed in different periods and in different milieux . Tracing the cult over an extended period enables us to document how religious devotion moved from an arena controlled by monastic production to one in which laity produced and challenged the clerical tradition with their own forms of religious devotion . The results of this inquiry add to the body of scholarship that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later Middle Ages , for the evidence provided here indicates that parishioners did not simply receive the narrative produced by the cult center but rather adapted it to meet their own needs . Signs of Devotion emphasizes the complex intersections between clerical and lay devotion , even as it highlights the very different responses presented by religious and lay devotees . Each of the chapters outlined here demonstrates , moreover , that textual production and historical context are inextricably intertwined with issues of language , author , audience , and location . What is more , each individual representation of the saint is connected to the others , so that the chapters , which can be read as discrete entities , are interrelated and show collectively a larger system of signification . While I proceed here chronologically , simply to build on the existing historical context , each of the following chapters should be considered in light of the others and in light of the semiotic analyses provided in all , for only in this comparison will the nuances of any given production become pronounced and specific . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in Bedes Ecclesiastical History of the English People ( ca. 731 ) . Bedes presentation of thelthryth emphasizes how the saints body is tested ( by marriage and asceticism ) , how the body is punished ( by the tumor , which is lanced by a surgeon ) , and how the body is perfected ( by Gods intervention ) . Specifically , this chapter discusses the wound made on thelthryths neck by the surgeon when he punctured the tumor in an effort to save her life . The wound was found healed , marked only by a scar , when the body was translated . Bedes emphatic discussion of this scene and the miraculous healing of the body underscores the marks importance as a signifier . The scar not only positively identifies the holy body but also provides visual evidence of thelthryths perfection post mortem : the mark indicates how the saints body has been literally closed by God as evidence of thelthryths purity during her life . I argue that Bedes rhetorical presentation of the scar as evidence of the perfected body is demonstrative of a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and the visual evidence of body and scar are important symbols of Gods provenance there . <p> Where the first chapter engages the origins of the cult , Chapter 2 focuses on late tenth-century devotion to thelthryth , which Bishop thelwold of Winchester encouraged during the Benedictine Reforms as a means to promote monasticism and clerical chastity . Because thelthryth had abdicated her throne in favor of a monastic life , she became the perfect symbol of chaste monasticism. thelwolds benedictional ( BL , Add . MS 49598 ) , an elaborately decorated service book made for his personal use , includes a full-page miniature of thelthryth in her habit and an inscription that reads " Imago sanctae **33;666;TOOLONG abbatissae ac perpetuae virginis " ( The image of Saint thelthryth , abbess and perpetual virgin ) . The inscription emphasizing her virginity accompanies a blessing that stresses how those who hear thelwolds prayer read aloud can emulate the life of thelthryth by avoiding carnality and adopting the monastic life . Later , thelwolds student , flric , translated Bedes life and added a short anecdote to illustrate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrying and producing children . Read together , these liturgical documents illustrate a deliberate presentation of the saints body , one in which lay men could identify with the twice-married queen who abdicated her elite social position in favor of a spiritual vocation . <p> In Chapter 3 , I explore how the cult was used to protect the monastery at Ely during the Norman invasion . The Liber Eliensis , the monastic chronicle , describes the saint as an avenger who actively threatens those who abuse her properties , her monks , or her church . The miracle stories included in the chronicle , clearly intended as a means of self-presentation , demonstrate how the saints virginal body became a symbol for the autonomy of the island community ; in effect , any attempt to seize the monastic properties was read as a metaphorical rape of the saints purity , which would always be thwarted by Gods intervention . The imagery of intrusion was used to resist Norman appropriation of the Isle of Ely , and William the Conquerors attack was read as an attempted rape of the communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never transgressed is important , and a scene of preservation in the face of rape became so important that the monks later inscribed the cathedral fabric with an image of the saint successfully evading the advances of her royal husband . Despite the passivity illustrated in this visual image , the monastic chronicle makes clear that Elys patron is not a passive victim who awaits Gods intervention . Instead , thelthryth is also presented as an embodied virago who will take vengeance on any who transgress against the monastic community and its holdings . <p> An important change in signification can be seen in a verse translation of the Latin vita offered by the monks , which is the focus of Chapter 4 . La Vie Seinte AudrTe was written in Anglo-Norman between 1179 and 1250 C.E. , likely for an aristocratic , female religious audience . Found in only one manuscripta fourteenth-century codex held by the wealthy nunnery at Campsey Ash , Suffolkthis vita indicates how thelthryths story was appropriated by aristocratic women to define their own lives . The account , which is drawn from the Liber Eliensis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connections between the saints life and the lived experience of thirteenth-century aristocratic women . In particular , the narrative includes proverbial statements that call attention to the audiences experience as married women , statements that allow the audience to imitate thelthryths patronage of religious institutions . The historiated initial that begins this life , moreover , illustrates the saint in a new way ; instead of her customary emblems , thelthryth holds a miniature replica of her church and gestures at it as she recounts her story from a book on the lectern . In effect , the image shows thelthryth teaching other aristocratic women about her life , even as the narrator of this life encourages these women to adopt the saints choices . This chapter ends with a discussion of the imitative practices of one aristocratic woman , Isabella Beauchamp Ufford ( d. 1416 ) , who likely heard this text read aloud at Campsey Ash Priory after she made a vow of chastity there and who may well have read the signs of foundation and patronage provided by Maries vie . <p> Chapter 5 extends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of texts written in the vernacular and the production of visual texts that complemented these narratives . Focused on accounts written in Middle Englishspecifically those included in the South English Legendary ( mid-thirteenth century ) , an anonymous vita written in quatrains and associated with the nunnery of Wilton Abbey ( early fifteenth century ) , and The Kalendre of the Newe Legende of Englande ( printed in 1516 ) this chapter discusses the ways in which the cult was presented to the religious and lay devotees in late medieval England . Of primary importance here are the connections between vernacular narratives and nonaristocratic lay responses , for this chapter considers how secular readers had access to these narratives and why these texts were deemed important for lay consumers . Evidence of lay knowledge comes from the visual texts produced by parishioners to honor the saint . In the Appendix , I provide a list of the known visual images of thelthryth , which number well over one hundred . Commissioned by laity for use in communal and private devotions , most of these images are found in the naves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ranworth , in particular , reveals that parishioners had some access to the content of these vernacular narratives , for the parish incorporated a lesser known detail from Bedes account into a larger narrative about womens sexuality . Chapter 5 , therefore , examines this visual text alongside vernacular redactions of Bede and demonstrates that lay devotion to the saint as maternal nourisher both mimicked and challenged , and at times transformed , the presentations offered by clerical writers . <p> These chapters collectively demonstrate the iconic and symbolic values of thelthryth in medieval culture . Because thelthryth was the most important native female saint , an analysis of her cult offers a useful commentary on English devotional practices and the importance of regional figures to native audiences . I would not claim that the cult is representative of those produced for native saints or that the representations of her are a means to understand the cults of native women , but I do contend that this study complicates our understanding of medieval religiosity and broaches a discussion about the differences between devotion to universal saints and veneration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute the medieval interest in thelthryth to a sense of nationalistic pride ( though this is in evidence in all of the texts ) , we need to consider why native cults were so important in England and how they , as religious systems of signification , were utilized in daily life . As Jocelyn Wogan-Browne asserts , those of us who study hagiography must be aware of the gaps between authors and their texts , authors and their audiences , and the texts and ourselves . These gaps complicate our ability to read medieval texts outside the historical place and time in which they were produced , but in focusing on hagiographical writings as ones structured to provide meaning and as ones that convey meaning regardless of the producers intentions , we are better able to assess the iconic relations of these cultural signs , their correlations , and their associations with other sign systems .

However , wealthy travelers left most accounts , and they frequently saw the New World through the windows of fancy carriages and formed their opinions in conversations with the colonial elite . William Moraleys memoir , first published in 1743 , offers a decidedly different perspective . <p> William Moraley ( 16991762 ) was born in London in 1699 ( listed as 1698 in the " old style " calendar ) . He was trained in the law , but saw his legal education interrupted by a financial crisis . His family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1720s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchmaker . It was not a happy relationship . Moraley was disowned , moved back to London , and was soon impoverished . He then ventured to the British American colonies in 1729 as an indentured servant , where he worked in various capacities , rambled about the countryside on foot , and mingled with white and black bondpeople , laborers , artisans , and other common folk , as well as prominent Indian and colonial figures . He returned to Newcastle and eventually wrote an account of his life and travels . While the very act of writing makes Moraley unusual , his experiences resembled those of many eighteenth-century European migrants , the majority of whom sold themselves into bondage to secure transport to North America . <p> Many journals , diaries , and letters by affluent early Americans survive , but autobiographies , wherein individuals reflect on the course and meaning of their lives , are rare . Benjamin Franklins autobiography , written near the end of his exceptionally successful career , stands out as one of the few eighteenth-century American accounts . More extraordinary still are memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American society and who , unlike Franklin , were unable to ascend the social and economic ladder . <p> Moraleys travels in North America form the central event in his autobiography , originally entitled The Infortunate : or , the Voyage and Adventures of William Moraley , of Moraley , in the County of Northumberland , Gentleman , From his Birth , to the Present Time . Containing Whatever is Curious and Remarkable in the Provinces of Pennsylvania and New Jersey : an Account of the Laws and Customs of the Inhabitants ; the Product , -Soil and Climate ; also the Authors Several Adventures though Divers Parts of America , and His Surprising Return to Newcastle . To Which is Added His Case , Recommended to the Gentlemen of the Law . As the subtitle suggests , he designed the book both to inform and to entertain . He describes various exotic features of North America , both its land and its inhabitants , and narrates his life and escapades in the New World . He also includes three unrelated stories ( in Chapters 2 , 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to pass time on board ship , in a tavern , or to his customers while cleaning and repairing their clocks . The memoir concludes with a detailed justification for his behavior and his failures after returning to Newcastle upon Tyne , England . <p> The remainder of this Introduction provides information to help readers understand and interpret the memoir . It considers the characteristics of labor and migration in the world of William Moraley , the places he visited and the kinds of people he met , the transformation in the nature of families of which he was a part , the occupational groups to which he belonged , the intellectual developments that shaped his thinking , and the literary developments of the era within which he wrote the autobiography , as well as suggestions about how to approach the text .

Dependent upon distance in the most basic aspect of their constructionAlbertis measure for establishing the illusion of pictorial spacethey orient themselves toward their beholders and frame another , coherent world to be observed , desired , aspired to , worshipped , analyzed . Models of response to early modern painting therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , even opposition : the human and the holy , say , or the masculine and the feminine . In holding to its otherness , the painting acknowledges the beholder as subject , directing its figured and enframed surface toward the embodied beholder , who becomes what Thomas Puttfarken calls the object of the pictures intention , an intention to be beheld from a distance . <p> This book is about paintings that largely fail to conform to that model of distance . Instead of addressing embodied beholders as others , they cleave to particular bodies : multiple hands worked on them , multiple hands held them . Often they served to build bridges between individuals . They communicated not only as fields for representation but as intimate personal objects . As small , solid , stable things , they moved easily from studio to studio within a neighborhood , but also from city to city , even across the continent to distant colleagues and patrons . <p> In the summer of 1605 , Jan Brueghel of Antwerp sent one such painting to Cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron , " to send you this poor letter accompanied by a little copper plate rametto , made by me with great diligence , begging your excellency to accept it favorably . I believe that nothing like it has been seen in either oils or in miniature gouache , nor anything more diligent . " The painting he sent was smaller than a modern postcard and showed a mouse and a cut rose with a caterpillar crawling up its stem , a butterfly perched on its largest bud ( fig. 1 ) . These were portrayed against a white ground , playfully mimicking the effect of Joris Hoefnagels botanical and zoological images executed in gouache on parchment , and indeed Brueghels model was a print after Hoefnagels design . But Jans picture was something more solid , for even a small copper plate is a thing of substance . <p> &lt;insert fig. 1 about here&gt; <p> The function of Jans gift was to renew and revise a relationship that had languished for nearly a decade . Jan had left Milan for Antwerp in the summer of 1596 , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rome . No painting by Brueghel had entered Borromeos collection since 1597 , at which point the artist had been continuing a series of pictures , begun during his stay in Milan , that showed hermits in landscape settings . Now , though , Borromeo had contacted him , evidently requesting that he provide landscape and still-life elements for some paintings whose figures had been executed by Hans Rottenhammer ; but Jan sensed greater potential in Borromeos renewed patronage . In nearly a decade back in his homeland , his art had developed in new directions , and he had attained considerable professional stature . Borromeo needed to be made aware of this . The Mouse and Rose announced his new interest in life-sized images of small naturalia , particularly flowers . In the summer of 1605 he was probably painting the first of the large flower still lifes for which he would become famous , since correspondence about the version he sold to Borromeo the following summer indicates that he initiated such works in the spring as flowers began to blossom and continued working on them throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only communicative gift Brueghel had in mind for his patron . In his letter the painter also promised Borromeo that in eight days he would be sending , by way of one Signor Vergaini , another painting . It was to be " of the ordinary size , " that is , the same dimensions as the pictures Brueghel had provided for Borromeo back in Italy , 25 + 35 centimeters , about the size of a modern piece of notebook paper . But the 1605 picture was a new kind of subject , to announce Brueghels more recent interests . Apart from landscapes , with or without hermits , all Jans Italian pictures for Borromeo had been histories : Lots family fleeing the burning Sodom , Christ and his apostles braving a storm on the Lake of Tiberius ( fig. 2 ) , a ferocious vision of the damned suffering torment in hell . But now he was developing a line in allegory : specifically , in cosmological allegory and the imagery of natures abundance . Just a year earlier he had executed , in collaboration with his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goddess Ceres surrounded by four female figures personifying the elements . Van Balen had painted the sensuous nudes , while Brueghel provided the lush landscape overflowing with flora and fauna , the gifts of nature . <p> &lt;insert fig. 2 about here&gt; <p> This was to become a popular composition : the two artists would create at least one fairly exact replica , and Brueghels studio would manufacture many more copies . Brueghel knew , however , that Borromeo needed something subtly different . He would only take a picture that was modest ( thus no nudes ) , and if Jan stuck with " the ordinary size , " his new work would fit neatly into Borromeos established collection and would at once remind the cardinal of their old patronage relationship and suggest a new direction it might take . Hence the painting that followed Brueghels letter was a unique item for a special patron ( fig. 3 ) . It was , as Brueghel tells Borromeo in the letter , " executed with taste and pleasantness . . . . The subject is the goddess Ceres with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by four putti , signifying the four elements : Earth with fruits , flowers , and animals ; Water with many rare shells and various fish and other oddities ; Air with many sorts of birds ; everything well finished . " The picture , indeed , allowed Brueghel to show off his talents , not as a painter of natures individual specimens , but as a cataloguer of its variety . The small surface is crammed with detail . Fruits of the sea spill from the ocean , in the left background , filling the foreground with all sorts of crustaceans and amphibians , while on the right a profusion of rare flowers blossom and beasts of forest and field rest in the distance . The putto representing air flies playfully among local and exotic birds while Fire illuminates the scene with his torch . <p> &lt;insert fig. 3 about here&gt; <p> Brueghels painting carried to its recipient a cornucopia of visual riches , advertising the artists ability to represent profusion in both its subject and its execution . Gathering and multiplying , it provides much and promises more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection among landscapes and histories , it suggests that a future for painting might lie in its mastery of copia , the rhetorical trope that provides a feast for the mind , its eloquent accumulations made to cohere by the force of allegory . Borromeo , like Ceres herself , could hold the whole world in his hands . <p> Small size and intimacy , multiplicity and detail , replication of natures smallest marvels : the qualities Brueghel hoped the great Italian patron would recognize and appreciate in his new work are not the qualities often associated with the art of Brueghels era . Chronologically , Brueghel belongs firmly to the Baroque and was closely tied to two painters whose work is often used to exemplify the Baroque age , Caravaggio and Rubens . He shared patrons , including Borromeo , with the former , may have known him personally , and certainly knew his work : in later years Brueghel , like Rubens , would be instrumental in facilitating the purchase of a Caravaggio altarpiece for the city of Antwerp . And besides being fellow Caravaggio fans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly for major patrons across Europe . Yet Brueghel is all but absent from every survey of this period , and it is not hard to understand why . Baroque art is about grand passions and rhetorical power . It is subjective and self-reflexive ; it is characterized by what Heinrich Wlfflin would call unity rather than multiplicity . Above all , it is big . It can only manifest itself on a grand scale . Baroque art does not want to remain confined but pushes into the space of the beholder . The Baroque has no truck with bits and pieces and scorns the detailed and the modest . All these commonplaces , drawn from surveys of Baroque art , fail wholly to describe the painting of Jan Brueghel . <p> For nearly a century after Wlfflin , characterizing art by stylistic period remained a major goal of art history . This was particularly so for scholars of the Baroque , in part because questions of style change in the arts had been formulated around that period and in part because the period had no coherent definition other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in style categories , it has inherited the legacy of that kind of thinking . The canon favors artists whose works were once useful in defining a period style , and this is one reason Jan Brueghel has never featured as a significant master of his time . <p> Relegated to the status of an artist of merely local importance , Brueghel has been studied by scholars of Flemish painting , and even they have been apologetic about having to deal with him . Marcel de Maeyer is remarkably unenthusiastic about Brueghel in his book on artists of the Brussels court , calling him an " archaizing " painter with a " very local accent , " an artisanal maker of precious curiosities who was never greatly esteemed by his Habsburg patronsthis despite copious evidence to the contrary . In De Maeyers story , even though it is a local one , Brueghel is entirely overshadowed by Rubens . Rubens is the thinking mans artist , transcending the merely Flemish to become a citizen of the world . Indeed , nearly every great cultural center of seventeenth-century Europe lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Antwerp owns Jan Brueghel : even Brussels , De Maeyer makes clear , does not want him . In a 1998 survey of Flemish painting Jan is given three sentences in the section on history painting , four in the section on genre painting , and a brief mention as a painter of architecture ; his landscapes and flowers receive slightly more attention . Here the problem is one of excessive range : when you break painting down by genre instead of by style , Brueghel does not fit nicely into a category . Master of all , star of none . <p> It would be convenient to argue that todays art-historical categories are the problem , that discussion of Jan Brueghel requires repudiation of genres and style and regionalization as principles of analysis . Critics could then place him in a framework that charts cultural character and its changes in terms of epistemology , interpreting his allegories , for instance , in the context of Michel Foucaults preclassical episteme or Hans Blumenbergs theoretical curiosity . This would not be unhelpful , and yet I think that the categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brueghel himself . Of course , he would not have formulated them as the twentieth century did . Terms for genres , for instance , were just developing in Brueghels day , yet nobody can have been more aware than he of the different sorts of subject matter , how they could be conceived of as separate from one another , and their consequent possibilities for creative recombination . And while painters whose Baroque rhetoric transcended regional boundaries to speak across continents may be preferable to the modern sensibility , regional identity was highly meaningful in Brueghels day , and the artist chose to exploit that meaning . While in Italy he was aware that he represented Flemishness to his patrons , that even in working to their tastes and interests he also needed to provide them with qualities they associated with a particular foreign manner . Likewise , when he returned to Antwerp , it was as an artist who had been formed in Italyperhaps not so much in his visual manner as in his priorities , habits of thought , and sense of identity . <p> Nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " Period styles " as art historians use them are often retrospective and anachronistic , but the need to find some style that would be new , modern , fitting for the age , was very much on the minds of artists and writers in late sixteenth-century Italy . Acute consciousness of the need for stylistic modernity had as its corollary an elevation of the importance of an individual signature style . To Giovanni Armenini , writing in 1586 , a good style was the artists ultimate achievement . Facility in invention could be acquired through effort and study , but style was the hallmark of real individual talent . One thing this book argues is that Brueghel made himself into , and presented himself as , an artist of style . <p> In itself that is an old argument . The most frequent accusation against Brueghel is that he is all style and no substance ; for here Jans other crucial connection matters . He is the son of Pieter Bruegel , an artist whose substance is undisputed . Even Jans greatest champion , German scholar Klaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comparison : yes , Jan was aware of theology and philosophy , Ertz shrugs , but basically he asked none of the deep questions that his father had pursued . The comparison is misleading and rests precariously on the genealogical connection ; a painter in 1600 would not have practiced art in the same way as one working in 1560 . Circumstances , expectations , the functions of painting had all changed . Again , though , what might seem like a red herring in framing an understanding of Jan Brueghel is actually critical . It mattered hugely to Jan himself that he was Pieters son . The historians problem lies in comparing the two on the terms set by Pieters art rather than asking what the relationship would have meant in his sons generation . <p> But I think that what has most damned Jan Brueghel to the innermost circle of art-historical hell is the simple fact that he worked on a small scale , often a truly minuscule one . Not always , of course . A few of the later works , particularly those executed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are respectably large , reaching up to 2.5 meters in length and 1.5 meters in height . A reasonable size for many artists of the time , this is gargantuan for Jan Brueghel : to come upon the Allegory of Sight and Smell in Essens 1997 Brueghel exhibition , after room upon room of his other works , was absolutely shocking ( figs. 4a , 4b ) . Here , though , Brueghel was an organizer as much as an artisan , bringing together a dozen colleagues to work on an appropriately massive gift for their rulers . Much more usual for Brueghel himself , especially in the first decades of his career , are works painted on copper plates measuring about 25 + 35 centimeters : what was for Borromeo the " ordinary size " was also ordinary for the rest of Jans patrons . Other works , even ones for the Habsburgs , measure a fraction of that . Tiny landscapes on ivory that could be cupped in the palm of a hand ; histories on copper plates whose details could only be appreciated from a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available models of the Baroque viewing experience provides an adequate way of discussing the aesthetic , and the power , of smallness . But that is necessary to any understanding of what Jan Brueghel was doing and what his contemporaries appreciated about his work . <p> &lt;insert figs. 4 &amp; 5 about here&gt; <p> This is important because Jan Brueghel was not just another neglected cabinet painter producing decor for local burgher homes . Brueghel was an artist of immense ambition , who intended his art to be judged equal to that of the greatest international masters of the time and who to a large extent achieved this . In his own day , he stood with Rubens as one of the two great painters in northern Europe . His works were sought after and appreciated by discerning patrons all over the continent , from Italian cardinals to Polish princes , and this was true from the very beginning of his documented career until its conclusion . Like other artistic superstars of his day , he received multiple gold chains from noble patrons in recognition of his artistic excellence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia herself stood as godparent , as she had done for one of Rubenss children as well . Successful at the highest levels of patronage , Brueghel was equally successful at lower ones . His busy studio provided affordable versions of his work for the market , and the taste for images in his manner would continue through generations of ordinary buyers . <p> In February of 1614 , when Duke Johann Ernst of Saxony stopped in Antwerp on his cultural tour of Europe , he was shown works by the two greatest local painters at a dealers shop and then visited their studios . " Rubens generally paints large pieces , all truly of life size , but artfully beautiful and after life , " his traveling companion noted in his journal . " But Brueghel paints little paintings with landscapes , but so subtle and artful that you can only wonder to look at them . " What was being shown to the cultivated visitor in 1614 was that two distinct types of painting were being practiced in Antwerp , by two artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forms of art . In 1614 Rubens was a relative newcomer : he had only been established in the city for five years . Brueghel , on the other hand , had been working in Antwerp for more than fifteen years and was the center of the citys art world . He supported his junior colleagues career , though , because he knew that Rubenss manner of working would not be in competition with his but would complement it . <p> By situating Jan Brueghels type of painting as an alternative form of visuality in European culture around 1600 , this book seeks to reconsider how pictures were looked at and evaluated in that culture , how they functioned , how and what they communicated . I begin in the present chapter with a brief account of Jans career up until about 1614 , the moment of Johann Ernsts visit to Antwerp . I am interested in how Jan had reached the positionsocial and professionalthat he occupied at that point : what career decisions he had made , how he had used painting to forge connections within and across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic production . In this chapter I also present some basic hypotheses about Jans working practice , his studio , and the general scope of his vast , complex oeuvre . <p> The rest of the book addresses the way Brueghel painted , the effects he achieved , and what relationship his aesthetic had to modes of cognition , analysis , and understanding in the culture of his time . Chapter 2 considers the world of small things , particularly in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands in the 1590s , and looks at the physical situations in which Brueghels paintings were originally encountered . The years around 1600 constituted a period of transition in the history of collecting and display : the Kunstkammer and the picture gallery were both available as models , and I consider what role small art assumed in either type of collection . Small pictures allowed for a close physical connection with the artwork and promoted intimate social exchanges among connoisseurs . Brueghels works functioned brilliantly in this context , for their combination of loose facture and small size elicits a complex dynamic between the senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth-century beholders understood the relation of sight to touch and how touchable art had special cognitive and communicative potential . <p> While chapter 2 treats the general sense of Brueghels way of making art , chapters 3 through 5 examine how his aesthetic played out in specific types of pictures or practices of production . Each chapter considers how attitudes and ideas that Brueghel acquired in Italy inflected the kind of artist he became back home in Antwerp . Chapter 3 looks at Brueghel as a history painter . This entire side of his production has been greatly underestimated . But Jan formed himself at the start of his career as a history painter , and his manner of visual storytelling was unique . Other painters of small histories kept their figures at roughly the same scale relative to the picture surface as did artists working in the " grand manner " ; Brueghel did not , and this altered his work as a narrator . The minuscule actors in his stories , their tiny faces curiously drawn with strokes of paint , are marvels of representation through minimal material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beholders . <p> Of course , Jan had a family tradition in history painting to maintain . And in genre painting , landscape , and allegory . Chapter 4 looks at this fundamental fact of Brueghels life : that he was the son of an artist who was a local cultural icon and whose fame had spread throughout Europe by the time Jan began his career . Artistic dynasties were normal in the Netherlands , and Jans older brother , Pieter the Younger , made a career out of producing copies of their fathers compositions . Jans eldest son was to do the same after his fathers death . But when Jan started painting , there was no precedent for a great masters son aspiring to become an equally great original artist within the following generation . While being his fathers son always mattered to Jan Brueghel , it was upon his return to Antwerp that he had fully to confront what Pieter Bruegels legacy would mean to him . In that context , he made legacy and tradition into sources of inspiration rather than constraint , moving between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replication . <p> My final chapter takes the narrative to that moment in 1614 when Rubens and Brueghel were paired as the greatest artists in Antwerp and considers how , instead of being rivals , the two operated as partners , frequently collaborating in the execution of their masterpieces . Here again , Brueghel revised a local tradition for a new purpose , based in part on ideas he had learned in Italy . Collaboration had been a studio convenience for second-rank Flemish artists of an earlier generation , but Jan first began working in tandem with other painters during his years in Italy . There the method took on a more elevated resonance , for Italian social theory promoted the value of friendship and conversation in generating original thought . Thus a workshop trick for the inept was transformed into a conceptual stimulus for the elite . Uniquely , Brueghel was , in a manner of speaking , multilingual , expert in nearly every type of pictorial imagery in use at the time and therefore able to collaborate conversationally with any of the specialized painters in his circle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubens as an example of how ideas were generated in pictorial conversation . <p> I do not intend to present 1614or actually 1615 , when Rubens and Brueghel collaborated on their Paradise with the Fall of Manas a critical turning point in Jans career . He had yet to produce the Five Senses allegories , the culmination of nearly two decades of encyclopedic thinking and collaborative painting . But I do think that by 1615 Brueghel had fully explored those aspects of his art that were most original and important , and that after that pointand especially after the Senseshe became a less interesting artist . The works that filled his studio at the time of his death , in 1625 , scenes of Dianas nymphs at the hunt produced collaboratively with Hendrick van Balen , were modish and attractive and conformed easily to the general style of cabinet painting of the 1620s . Jan was also , for reasons unknown , far less productive in that last decadeperhaps his health was failing , or perhaps he was fully occupied in supervising a workshop that produced copies of his successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of his life when he forged a career as a strong , independent painter working in an individual manner that did not conform to the standards other similarly ambitious painters were setting . Even while the scale of his works remained small , the scale of his ambition was never other than immense . <p> &lt;1&gt; Crafting a Career <p> Although the Bruegel family is commonly associated with the commercial metropolis of Antwerp , Pieter Bruegel lived in Brussels from at least 1563 , possibly before , until his death . It was there that he married Maria Coecke van Aelst , daughter of painter and tapestry designer Pieter Coecke van Aelst , who had probably been Bruegels teacher back in Antwerp . All of the couples children were Brussels-born : Pieter the Younger in 1564 or 1565 , Maria in 1566 , and Jan in 1568 or 1569 . Since Pieter the Elder died in 1569 , his youngest son never knew him at all . The children were raised by their widowed mother , but she too died when Jan was nine or ten years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family trade : Pieter the Younger went to his mothers cousin Gillis van Coninxloo , while Jan went to his maternal grandmother and learned to paint in watercolors . <p> This , at least , is what Van Mander writes , and it seems a reasonable tale . Painting was a family business , and boys were often sent to a relative to avoid paying apprenticeship costs . It was less common that the relative was a grandmother , but Mayken Verhulst Bessemers was no ordinary grandmother . She was from a great painting family of the city of Mechelen . Of her ten siblings , all either became artists or married artists ; she did both . Her fame was such that she was mentioned by Ludovico Guicciardini as one of the excellent female painters from Antwerp , along with Catherina van Hemessen and Levina Teerlinc . She would therefore have been a very appropriate teacher for her grandson , and most writers have assumed that she instructed him in manuscript illumination , a technique in which water-based paints were used . This would explain much about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story were so straightforward as Van Mander makes it seem . Recent archival research , however , complicates things . It seems that Mayken Verhulst had moved from Antwerp to Mechelen long before she would have become Jans teacher , while Jan himselfand his brotherstayed in Brussels until 1583 . How , then , did they get their early training ? And in what technique were they trained ? <p> About these matters one can only speculate . The Brueghel boys had relatives who worked in the Brussels tapestry industry , and they might have been instructed in this context . Tapestry played a crucial role in the development of several types of imagery that would later be important to Jan Brueghel : forest landscapes , and paradise landscapes with collections of familiar and exotic animals . But that is iconography . It is harder to say what Jan Brueghel could have learned from the techniques of tapestry designers that would have put him on the artistic path he eventually followed . What follow are a few hypotheses . <p> If Jan was trained in a tapestry-design workshop , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think across scales , both important talents for his future career . A worker in a tapestry shop was trained to study a small drawn compositionthe petit patron provided by the designerand translate it into a full-scale cartoon , executed in watercolor . Cartoon painting might have related to Jans grandmothers practice as well . The term Van Mander uses to describe Mayken Verhulsts work , water-verwe , refers to large-scale watercolor painting on cloth and not to small-scale water-based painting on parchment or paper , which he calls verlichterij . Mechelen was famed for painters who worked in watercolor on cloth , and the Verhulst Bessemers family had been workers in that medium . From there it was an easy step to tapestry work , at least in technical terms ; indeed , it is possible that Maykens connection with her future husband , Pieter Coecke van Aelst , began because he was recruiting watercolor painters from Mechelen for his tapestry business , hiring her brother and a cousin . Tapestry cartoons were executed on either paper or cloth , but no extant records indicate which support Brueghels Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . They could also have been producing independent water-verwe paintings , as Mayken probably did . <p> Early watercolor paintings on lightly prepared linen cloths were not as durable as later oil paintings on canvas and have not survived well , but it was a technique with a long tradition in the Netherlands . Van Manders disparaging comments about assembly-line production have given cloth paintings a bad name in art history , but in fact major artists produced original works on cloth . Bosch did , and so did Jans father , Pieter , from his early Adoration of the Magi ( fig. 6 ) to the late Blind Leading the Blind . Fine paintings on cloth could be special , bravura performances fit for the collection of a connoisseur , for to execute a complex , original composition in this medium required considerable mastery and produced a unique effect . The paint was thinly and loosely applied , work had to proceed rapidly , unblended individual brushstrokes remained visible , andunlike in oil paintingmistakes could not be corrected . Certain of these qualities would remain , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eventually develop . <p> &lt;insert fig. 6 about here&gt; <p> Jan would not have been the only artist to move from larger watercolors on cloth to work at a miniature scale . Hans Bol had made the same transition a generation earlier . Bols early works in Mechelen were apparently original high-quality cloth paintings , " to which , " says Van Mander , " he applied great precision and good technique with a sure , precise manner in setting up and finishing his works . " It was only upon his move to Antwerp in 1572 that Bol abandoned that technique and took up verlichterij . Bartholomeus Spranger too dabbled in both small and large watercolor paintings before settling down to oils . <p> The ease with which artists evidently moved between water-verwe and verlichterij suggests that Van Manders brief comments about Brueghels grandmother may not be entirely accurate . It had been assumed that she was a miniaturist in part because this was a more common profession for Netherlandish women to pursue . It does seem feasible that in a family of watercolorists the talented girl could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives designed tapestries and landscapes . That would help explain why her husbands pupil Pieter Bruegel , when he visited Italy , befriended the famed miniaturist Giulio Clovio and how it came about that Clovio owned a small work on ivory by the Flemish master and a miniature on which the two of them had collaborated , as well as two Bruegel landscapes done " a guazzo " probably larger works on cloth . As for Jans training , although Mayken Verhulst lived in Mechelen while her grandson was growing up in Brussels , the cities are very close , and he could easily have spent time studying with her as well as working with his Brussels relatives . I am hesitant to dismiss Van Manders narrative , because Jan Brueghels manner of depicting the human face and figure , which I discuss more in chapter 3 , seems indebted to the figurative habits of manuscript illumination , cousin to independent works of verlichterij . Indeed , Jans whole way of building an image out of tiny disengaged brushstrokes , often with only schematic underdrawing , relates to the techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest training was not as an oil painter . That had to wait until 1583 , when he moved to Antwerp and went to work with Pieter Goetkint , " at whose house , " Van Mander notes , " were many handsome works . " By this he means that Goetkint was an art dealer and , perhaps , that this was an important part of Jans experience with him . Jan could have been employed making copies of originals that passed through the dealers hands , and he may have continued this work with Antoon Goetkint , who continued the family enterprise after his brothers death . <p> Maintaining the business can not have been easy , for the 1580s were a turbulent time in Antwerp . Caught at the center of the Revolt of the Netherlands , the city had been sacked by Spanish troops in 1576 , after which it allied with the rebels and became the capital of the resistance to Spain . That was its status when Jan moved there . Within a year of his arrival the Spanish began laying siege to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farnese , after nearly a year of suffering . Over the following years it experienced further depopulation as Protestants who refused to convert to Catholicism were forced to emigrate to more hospitable locations . Jan remained through Antwerps worst times and somehow supported himself as a painter . <p> Eventually , though , Jan left Antwerp , traveling first to Cologne and then probably to Frankenthal . From there he continued southward and by 1590 was living and working in the city of Naples . Most Netherlandish artists making their Italian voyage had Rome as their goal : it was the place to go for painters eager to absorb the glorious culture of antiquity and the most novel aspects of modernity . Naples , though , was actually a much larger city than Rome . Its population , at nearly three hundred thousand , was thrice that of Antwerp in its heyday . But unlike Antwerp , Naples lacked a strong indigenous artistic tradition . It was therefore a reasonable destination for an artist seeking not instruction but employment . Other Flemish painters were active there at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less discerning local public . Wenceslas Coebergher , who would later become a respected architect and engineer in the Netherlands , executed an altarpiece for a Neapolitan church in the same year that Jan was documented there , and Hendrick Goltzius visited the city a year later . <p> It must also have been important to Jan that his father , on his trip to Italy thirty-five years earlier , had traveled to Naples . Perhaps there were still family connections to potential patrons there . In any event , the first record of Jan in Italy , from June of 1590 , documents his payment for work done for the most illustrious Signor Abbot Don Francesco Caracciolo . For him , Jan has been painting a copper plate for use as the face of a clock . Since this is noted as the final payment , Jan must already have been in Naples for some time . The nature of this commission suggests that Brueghel made a living doing decorative work in the applied arts , which would explain the lack of any firmly attributable early paintings by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegories of time or of the seasons , but the sort of imagery Jan was painting in 1590 remains unknown . <p> Much more , though , is known about the most illustrious abbot Don Francesco Caracciolo , today one of the patron saints of Naples . This young nobleman , born Ascanio Caracciolo , was just a few years older than Jan Brueghel . In 1585 he had moved to Naples , where he studied for the priesthood . Shortly after his ordination in 1587 he joined with the slightly older Augustine Ardorno to form a new religious order , the Minor Clerks Regular . The order was approved by Sixtus V , and in April 1589 the founders took their vows , Ascanio additionally changing his name to Francesco . <p> Caracciolo did a lot of traveling on the orders business : in June of 1590 , when the payment was made to Brueghel , he had just returned from Spain . On a later trip , he would establish the Foundation of St. Joseph at Alcal for the teaching of science . The Minor Clerks also instituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pursuit of a hermits life and the study of science were common for churchmen of the 1590s , and both characterized the men Brueghel would soon work for in Rome . When Brueghel left Naples for Rome , he may have had connections to sources of patronage there provided by the noble abbot and his network . <p> In 1593 Jan scrawled his name on a wall in the Catacombs of Domitilla . He had been in the Eternal City since at least the year before , when he had inscribed on the back of another artists drawing , " Hans brueghel in Rooma sic 1592 . " He thus probably arrived in Rome in the same year as Caravaggio , with whom he would share several patrons . The three years Brueghel spent there were enormously important for his career : working for a solid base of powerful patrons , he invented a new manner of history painting , exploring subjects that he would repeat and refine for years to come . At the same time , he maintained a sideline in landscapes that he could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jans Roman career were a close-knit group of young churchmen . All were committed to the relatively new Roman interest in collecting paintings and were , to varying degrees , interested in the natural sciences and a " naturalistic " aesthetic as well . One , Egidio Colonna , had connections in Naples , where his family worked for the Spanish crown , and might have been Brueghels original link to the Roman circle . He was so interested in Northern art that his collection in 1595 contained little else . His paintings included some of the earliest works securely attributable to Brueghel : two scenes from classical mythology ( Orpheus Sings for Pluto and Proserpina and Aeneas and Sibyl in the Underworld ) , two New Testament narratives ( the Adoration of the Magi and Christ in Limbo ) , and a picture of a hermit saint . All are on copper plates measuring about 25 + 35 centimeters and can be dated to about 1594 . The five paintings are still in the Palazzo Colonna in Rome , meaning that the collections of two of Brueghels five documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second of these is the collection of Cardinal Federico Borromeo . <p> The Colonna were related by marriage to the Borromeo family , and during part of his time in Rome , Borromeo lived in an apartment at the Palazzo Colonna . It was natural that he should have seen the new interesting works in Egidios collection . But his taste in art was rather different : he would never acquire a mythological piece from Jan , and only a few biblical histories . Both men bought hell scenes , but while this was a major interest for Colonna , it was minor for Borromeo . He would even send his hell painting back to Brueghel a decade later with instructions to make changes that would bring it closer to his standards ( fig. 7 ) . The opposite was true of landscapes with a hermits retreat : these Borromeo would order in abundance , though Colonna had only one ( fig. 8 ) . Borromeos broader interest in aestheticized images of the natural world extended to works by Italian artists as well : Caravaggios Basket of Fruit still hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> &lt;insert figs. 7 &amp; 8 about here&gt; <p> Borromeo was an important figure in the Roman art scene . Artists knew and respected him : in 1593 he had become the first " cardinal protector " of the Roman Accademia di San Luca , with the papal brief of encouraging adherence to Counter-Reformation standards of art . Beyond the Colonna family he had other friends who were major collectors , and they too acquired works from Jan Brueghel . One of these was the powerful cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani . To art historians Benedetto has often stood in the shadow of his younger brother , Vincenzo , a trendsetter in Baroque patronage . Though Benedetto too owned several paintings by Caravaggio , Vincenzo was one of that masters greatest supporters . As a writer of essays on painting , sculpture , and architecture , Vincenzo took a notoriously poor view of incidental genres like landscape : he believed in the hierarchy of genres and in standards still recognized today as characterizing the Baroque . Benedetto , though more eclectic in his tastes , was likewise not interested in Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed in his 1601 inventory were all histories , some with landscape settings but others with hell and fire , as in Egidio Colonnas collection . They included a Last Judgment and a Deluge , a Paradise and a Hell , an Adoration and a Burning of Troy , with possibly a second version of the last subject . All were framed in ebony , and he seems to have hung them as pairs , though the subjects are sometimes complementary and sometimes not . <p> Brueghels last major Roman buyer , another member of Borromeos circle and his successor as cardinal protector of the accademia , was Caravaggios second great patron : Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte . His eclectic interests included botany , geography , and alchemyhis brother Guidobaldo was a scientistand he had a particular fascination with clocks , employing a resident orologgario who made clocks for Borromeo as well . Given Jans employment record in Naples , clock painting was another avenue by which he could have entered these circles . Del Monte also had a huge art collection . His postmortem inventory ( 1627 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the inventory was taken . Pictures by Jan Brueghel included an Orpheus and Eurydice , two versions of the Temptation of Saint Anthony , two landscapes and a seascape with ships , a Crucifixion , a Saint John the Evangelist , and an allegory described as Woman with an Arrow . It is possible that del Monte owned as many as seventeen Brueghels , but even counting only the nine attributed in the inventory , he was still the artists most avid buyer during his time in Rome . Moreover , del Monte owned quite a few landscapes by artists other than Brueghel , as well asa real prizea seascape by Pieter Bruegel the Elder . In fact , two of his pictures by Jan dovetail rather well with the painting by his fatherthe seascape with ships and the Vision of Saint John on Patmos ( fig. 9 ) . Dated 1593 , the latter is one of Jans earliest known works . Perhaps del Monte commissioned this and the seascape to accompany the painting he owned by the young artists father . It is in any event clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape aspect of Brueghels work . <p> &lt;insert fig. 9 about here&gt; <p> In Rome , then , Brueghel developed a repertoire of themes that would interest a particular group of influential patrons , and painted them at a consistent size and on the same support . He showed no interest in trying his hand at large-scale work and therefore was not in competition with local painters for public commissions , as Rubens would be a decade later . Jan chose to paint subjects from mythology , the Old and New Testaments , and the lives of select saints . Occasionally his patrons purchased landscapes and seascapes from him , but these generally included either the figure of a saint or some narrative element : for instance , the painting that has the best probability of being del Montes seascape actually shows the sacrifice of Jonah ( fig. 10 ) . Remarkably , nearly every painting listed in the inventories of Jans Roman buyers can be at least tentatively identified todaymany remaining in Italian collectionsand , conversely , almost every subject of an existing painting by Brueghel from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The circuit is remarkably tight . <p> &lt;insert fig. 10 about here&gt; <p> It seems likely that Brueghel was also working for the open market . A number of landscapes , mostly on copper and conforming to Jans " ordinary " dimensions but some even smaller and others larger and on panel , belong to this period of his career . A few were executed in collaboration with the German painter Hans Rottenhammer , trial efforts at a practice at which Brueghel would later become adept . Most of the independent landscapes have not stayed in Italy , many are replications of a few basic designs , and only one is signed and dated , all of which suggests that they were not done for some unknown fifth major patron but for anonymous buyers . Perhaps Cavaliere dArpino acted as a middleman for these works ; the Roman painter-dealer , who had also been in Naples when Brueghel was there , owned at least one and possibly several pictures by Brueghel when his goods were confiscated in 1607 . Jan was also active as a print designer in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Aegidius Sadeler and his future brother-in-law Pieter de Jode . <p> Indeed , Brueghels early drawings would suggest that landscape was his greatest interest at this period . He had brought landscape drawings by his father along with him to Italy , made copies of them himself , and allowed his compatriot Paul Bril to study them , while Bril in turn shared his stash of drawings from the estate of his brother , Matthijs . Brueghel recorded views of Naples as well as Rome , sketched many of Romes great ruins , and did nature studies . These records of visual experience provided a storehouse of motifs to which he would return in later years , but the early landscape paintings rarely relate directly to the drawings , apart from some forest scenes that use not his own but his fathers material . Brueghel was , in other words , working at two sorts of landscapes at once : he was storing up directly observed Italian motifs for future use and painting imagined forests for the current market . <p> Although Jans landscapes evidently had some success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1590s , and painters of ambition , like Brueghel , usually tried to work for a specific patron . Especially younger artists , like Caravaggio or Brueghel , relied on the favor of a protector , to whose house they would " belong , " though their services could be loaned to other connoisseurs favored by their patron . Although not Brueghels biggest buyer in those early years , Federico Borromeo may have held that position . He was the glue that bound together a group of men who belonged to different political factions but shared intellectual and artistic interests : Breughels art became itself an element in that social bonding . And it was with Borromeo that Brueghel left Rome in the autumn of 1595 , traveling to Milan , where his patron had just been appointed archbishop . <p> Milan held Brueghel only briefly , from October of 1595 to the summer of 1596 . Indeed , Borromeos letter of recommendation to the bishop of Antwerp , describing Jan as an upright and highly principled man , is dated 1595 ; this suggests that when Jan left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Milan was just a winter stopover . During that winter Jan sold at least one work to an unknown local buyer , a work that was later used as an ex voto in the cathedral . Beyond that , he lived as a member of Borromeos household and began to paint for him a group of landscapes with hermits , most of them based on prints by Jan and Raphael Sadeler after Marten de Vos . <p> Brueghels career in Italy was on an upward curve in the mid-1590s , so it is hard to understand why , in the autumn of 1595 , he should have begun the journey back to his native land . Rubenss return from Italy in the winter of 16089 makes so much more sense : his success in Italy had been mixed , his home town was about to host the signing of the Twelve Years Truce , its art market was picking up , and an appointment to the court of Albert and Isabella loomed . In contrast , the prospects when Brueghel arrived in Antwerp over a decade earlier were decidedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1596 Philip II declared the Spanish crown bankrupt yet again , leaving his armies in the Netherlands unpaid and restless . Archduke Albert had arrived in Brussels in February of that year to head the government of the Spanish Netherlands . But his older brother Ernst had died in 1595 after scarcely more than a year in that role ; there was no reason to suppose that lasting stability had arrived along with Albert , although such proved to be the case . In any event , by early August 1596 Jan was in Antwerp , standing as godfather at the baptism of his nephew Jan , son of his older brother , Pieter . Pieters family had grown with alarming rapidity during the previous years , putting pressure on his finances : he seems to have run up debt and taken out several loans and was trying to raise money by mortgaging his inheritance . Perhaps his younger brother came home to give him some help out of these difficulties . <p> In his first years back in Antwerp , Jan made several moves that cemented his place within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he joined the St. Lukes painters guild in 1597 , and only four years later , in 1601 , he was acting as its deacon , a position he held again the following year . In 1599 he married Isabella ( Elizabeth ) de Jode . She was the well-to-do orphaned daughter of Gerard de Jode , who had been an art dealer , cartographer , engraver , and publisher . Her sister was married to Jan Snellinck , a painter , tapestry designer , and successful art dealer , who was a distant cousin of the Brueghels as well . The De Jodes , Snellincks , and Brueghels thus became thickly interconnected clans , and over the following years they would often serve as witnesses or godparents for one anothers family members . Jan had become integrated into a strong professional network . <p> Also important was a second organization Jan joined in the late 1590s : the Brotherhood of Saints Peter and Paul , also known as the Romanists . Founded in 1572 , this select group of twenty-five travelers met once a year , in principle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Fugger mansion and other excellent venues : this was the appropriate style for their members , who were from the aristocracy , the higher clergy , the magistracy , and the upper middle class . The bishop of Antwerp had joined in 1597 , as had the brotherhoods first painter , Otto van Veen ; Brueghel came in as the second painter in 1599 . Over the following decade other artists joined , including those with whom Jan would have the closest bonds of work and of friendship : Hendrick van Balen in 1605 , Rubens in 1609 ( the year in which Jan was deacon ) , Sebastian Vrancx in 1610 , and Frans Snyders in 1619 . But the Romanists also offered Jan the opportunity to establish bonds with men well above his social class . For instance , Paulus van Halmale , member of one of Antwerps most powerful and ancient patrician families , stood as coguardian of Jans younger children at the time of his death , along with Rubens , Van Balen , and Cornelis Schut , an important patron . All four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in the same year as Brueghel . All painters had the opportunity through the St. Lukes Guild to hobnob with connoisseurs , who could join the guild as " lovers of art , " but the Romanists gave Brueghel access to an expanded and elevated circle of potential patrons . <p> Jan may also have drawn upon his Roman connections to find buyers at home in Antwerp . The Italian Giacomo Ghisberti is the earliest documented Antwerp owner of one of his works , and another early ownerof a clavicymbal , surely painted on commissionis Emmanuel Ximinez , a Portuguese merchant with connections to the Borromeo family . Jan was also well placed in a circle of art dealers , although few of his works appear in their inventories . While no evidence confirms that Jan himself dealt in other artists paintings , he does seem to have acted as an agent on occasion , acquiring prints for Borromeo or selling to the city of Antwerp an ebony-and-bronze crucifix by Flemish expatriate sculptor Giovanni da Bologna . He also began early on to cultivate new sources of patronage among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint an Assumption of the Virgin for Maria of Bavaria in Graz : her agent had assured her that Brueghel was " one of the three best masters of this time " and the very best in small figures . <p> Jan had been accustomed in Italy to a system where powerful patrons buffered their chosen artists from the vagaries of the market . Finding one in the Netherlands was not simple . When Jan arrived , the court in Brussels was not sufficiently settled to bestow favor upon a young artist , the art-loving burghers of Antwerp were not in the habit of acting as benefactors , and the local aristocracy were not great collectors at all , except for their galleries of family portraits . The signal exception to this last rule was Charles , duc de Cro , a man of extraordinary wealth and refined artistic taste . I suggest in chapter 3 that he did eventually commission one work from Brueghel , but although he had his court artists , Cro was not a frequent buyer of modern artworks , and Brueghel can not have counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find himself a local Maecenas , a patron who was so enthusiastic about his paintings that he purchased them in great quantity . At his death , in 1621 , the educated humanist Nicolaas Cornelis Cheeus owned at least twenty-five works executed fully or partially by Brueghel , of which at least one had been directly commissioned at considerable expense ( fig. 11 ) . Otherwise , Antwerp inventories to about thirty years after Jans death , hence of people who may have purchased from him in his lifetime , rarely record more than one or two Brueghels . Certainly it was not as in Rome , where a few people bought many expensive works by his hand . Also not as it had been in Rome was the subject matter that Jans Antwerp buyers favored . The vast majority of his works that entered collections there were landscapes ( 41 ) , or landscapes by Momper into which Jan had painted figures ( 21 ) . Of the works by Jan in Antwerp inventories ten depict flower bouquets , a subject that had enjoyed surprisingly early local popularity : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , and in fact his uncle had been a flower painter in the previous generation . Inventories also list a dozen paintings done collaboratively with his local costar , Rubens . But Jans own history paintings , allegories , and genre scenes were not popular here , and nobody owned a scene from classical mythology executed entirely by Jan himself . The patterns of purchase of Brueghels works roughly reflect the overall taste of early seventeenth-century Antwerp , which was dramatically different from that of Rome in the 1590s . <p> &lt;insert fig. 11 about here&gt; <p> But Jans output itself reflects a much less abrupt change . He continued to paint mythologies and hell scenes for years after he returned to Antwerp , and developed a whole new line in allegories . I would suggest that these works were intended for export , that he maintained ties to Italy and shipped to agents there subjects he knew would fit that market . As noted above , he renewed his relationship with Borromeo in 1605 , but the cardinal was not his only Italian buyer . Ercole Bianchi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own collectionand facilitating the sale of Jans works to several other parties in Milan . There is good evidence that Jans paintings were still flowing into Roman collections as well . These pictures done for export continued to be executed on copper plates , which are stable and easy to transport . Italy was not the only foreign market eager for his paintings either : collectors in the Dutch Republic purchased valuable items by Jan Brueghel , and it is possible that Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria became an occasional patron in the first decade of the new century . <p> Things were going well for Brueghel . In 1601 he acquired citizenship of the city of Antwerp and became deacon of the St. Lukes Guild , sharing the post the following year with Otto van Veen . Then , in 1603 , his young wife died , leaving him with two small children , Jan and Paschasia . Tying up her estate necessitated going to Frankfurt , but Jan chose to make that business trip into an eight-month-long international voyage , and in late March of 1604 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued first to Frankfurt and then to Prague , where , in the collection of Rudolf II , he saw the original Dnrer drawings after which he made remarkable painted copies ( fig. 12 ) . <p> &lt;insert fig. 12 about here&gt; <p> Jan would travel little after his visit to Prague . Together with Rubens and Van Balen , he did make one more major journey , however , to Haarlem , Leiden , and probably other cities of the Dutch Republic in 1612 . But the Prague trip of 1604 was something of a turning point in Jans career . Just after it he shifted to a new method of production ( described in the next section ) , involving the creation of pattern paintings , which could be reproduced in multiple variants . This was also when he added flower bouquets to his expansive repertoire of imagery , rapidly becoming a famed expert in that type of work . Other life changes occurred at the same time : he bought a fine new house , The Mermaid , in the Lange Nieuwstraat , and he remarried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom he would eventually have eight more children . In the same year he began writing again to Borromeo after nearly a decades silence and working for Albert and Isabellas court in Brussels . The causal sequence here remains unknown : whether Prague reminded Jan that his type of art could find an audience among the international noble elite , whether new financial and familial obligations pushed him to expand his marketing base , or whether Jans new connection to Rudolf suddenly made him attractive to Rudolfs brother Albert . But the following decade would be marked by steady work for both Borromeo and Brussels . <p> Thanks to the survival of Brueghels correspondence and the foundation of the Ambrosiana , it is easy to identify the works executed in Antwerp and shipped to Milan . And Borromeos own writings on art explain what he appreciated about these works : their evocation of the wonders of Gods created world , marvelously replicated and available for contemplation . Borromeos conception of nature held that closeness to God could best be achieved by admiring and praising the glories of creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paintings allowed for prolonged spiritual exercise . The early hermit scenes had already satisfied this need , and most of the pictures Borromeo now purchased from Jan at long distance could equally be used for joyful meditation on nature : the Four Elements series , two paintings of floral bouquets , and two works in which an image of the Madonna and Child is surrounded by a garland of flowers . These are the paintings by Brueghel that Borromeo would praise most fulsomely in his Musaeum ( 1625 ) , a guide to the works with which he endowed the Ambrosiana . He did , however , also purchase different sorts of images from Brueghel : a depiction of Daniel in the Lions Den and several minute oval paintings with winter landscapes or religious histories . Most of the works for Borromeo were produced in the space of a few years , from 1605 to 1610 . <p> These same years were also marked by intense work for the archdukes . By 1606 Albert and Isabella had established a group of artists associated with their court . Several were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from the Romanists and as his codeacon at the St. Lukes guild , and his cousin Jan Snellinck . He was evidently also acquainted with nonartist members of the court , who helped him argue in 1606 for special dispensation from export duties on his paintings . Early in the same year he was , he reported to Borromeo , spending time in the court gardens studying flowers for his still-life painting . In his correspondence over the following years Jan frequently mentions multi-item commissions from Brussels : usually he uses these as an excuse for his delinquency with jobs for Borromeo . The work he describes includes four paintings done in 1609 , eleven particularly complicated paintings in 1610 , and no less than thirty-eight works " di miniatura . . . di mia mano propria " in 1619 , the year in which he moved to a still more elegant home , on the Arenbergstraat . The payments for some of his court commissions were considerable : for instance , he was paid fl. 3,625 in August 1610 , though for what remains unclear . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spread between several residences in their lifetimes and later dispersed to relatives or destroyed by fires . None of the commissions Jan enumerates in his letters can be firmly identified with surviving works known to have been executed for the archducal couple or with ones that appear in their fragmentary inventories . However , the paintings Brueghel did for them certainly included portraits , landscapes , and peasant genre scenes . Many combined two or three of those genres in ways that pictorialized the couples dedication to the common people of the Netherlands and their pride in their residences and estates . Some works were large and on canvas , others minuscule and on copper ( figs. 13a , 13b ) . Brueghel collaborated with court artist Hendrick de Clerck and later with Rubens on mythological scenes for the archdukes ; they also evidently appreciated his religious histories and his floral still lifes . Albert was a particular fan of Jan , along with Rubens and Van Veen : a contemporary biographer reported that in his free time Albert " not infrequently summoned them to himself and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> &lt;insert fig. 13 about here&gt; <p> Soon after Rubens received the title of court painter in 1609 , Jan began lobbying for special privileges as well , particularly freedom from city taxes and guard duties . This was a normal request for a painter who had been successful with Albert and Isabella , and he duly received the privileges he wanted in 1613 , much to the dismay of the Antwerp magistrates who had objected to being deprived of the taxes such a wealthy citizen should be paying . Like most artists who worked for the court , Brueghel was never given an official post there , but his distance from Brusselslike that which Rubens cultivated in his own wayserved him well . Because the archdukes enthusiasm for his work was so widely known , the city of Antwerp gave them several costly gifts of his pictures . Brueghel could capitalize on his identity as an Antwerp artist even when painting for the archdukes . <p> I have only recounted the main documented events in Jans life up to about 1615 , when he was in his mid-forties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cultivated a broad array of patrons across the social spectrum and across the length and breadth of Europe . The buyers of his works were as diverse as the works themselvescardinals and burghers , humanists and theologians , royalty , even a future saint . Sometimes a particular type of work attracted a particular patron ; other buyers had a general appreciation for Jans aesthetic and could be persuaded to purchase a variety of pictures ; indeed , the more Jan varied his repertoire through a spectrum of imagery , from histories and landscapes to genre scenes , allegories , and still lifes , the more works he could sell . <p> Probably because Brueghels patrons are so well known and because they were often important , articulate individuals , the few interpretive studies of Jan Brueghel have tended to explain his work with reference to attitudes and beliefs attributed to one patron or group of buyers . From this point of view , his art comes to embody a philosophy expounded in texts written by or read by people who purchased his paintings . In fact , Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its content , had the ability to say many things to many people . What gives coherence to his works is not a single philosophy that they articulate but the way in which they were made and the kinds of aesthetic experiences they evoke . <p> &lt;1&gt; Works and Habits of Working <p> At the beginning of this chapter I suggested that it was Brueghels failure to fit art historys ideas of the Baroque that had lead to his marginalization in the canon . But another reason scholars do not deal much with Brueghel must be that his oeuvre is so uniquely , impossibly messy . How to reconcile the flower painter with the painter of hell scenes , the maker of tiny landscapes with the great allegorist , Rubenss sometime collaborator with Pieter Bruegel the Elders sometime copyist ? Thousands of pictures have a claim to be associated , in some way , with Jan Brueghel , and more appear on the art market all the time . Add to this the fact that he and his brother , Pieter the Younger , shared to some degree the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also named Jan Brueghel , was trained by his father and made a career out of repeating his fathers compositions . The result is that there is no stable corpus of paintings on which all can agree , and this is to say nothing of Jans drawings , which nobody has systematically investigated . The arguments I make below are based on my own database of paintings that I believe to have been executed by Jan and his collaborators . Jan dated a high proportion of his pictures , but for reasons that become clear below , this does not always help in dating the undated works . I have rejected many later landscapes , while adding a significant number of early history paintings , so that she shape of Jans oeuvre as I see it is quite different from what Klaus Ertz presents in his published catalogues . <p> Particularly difficult to handle are the many paintings that are not autograph but seem to have been produced within Jans orbit , probably in his studio . The matter of Jans studio has muddled any understanding of his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any work that emerged from his studio was his own autograph product . This idea , however , is simply not tenable . While Brueghel was an efficient painter who had ways of maintaining a steady output at a high level of excellence , his method of painting was laborious and time-consuming . To produce hundreds of autograph works and hundreds more related pictures , he needed help , and it is well documented that he had that help . <p> In what follows , I use evidence from paintings and documents to sketch the broad outlines of Brueghels production , pointing out basic trends and consistencies in his work . I also try to suggest how his studio operated , what the strength and limitations of his authorial presence there were , and how this varied depending on the stage of his career and on the type of image being produced . More study is needed on the process and production of almost every individual work or group of works by Brueghel . My hope here is to lay out the parameters for future investigation and to point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I argue that to think of Jan Brueghel as a lone figure churning out huge numbers of pictures , one after another , with an orderly stylistic development is utterly wrongheaded . He was the center of a dense web of workershired hands , apprentices , and collaboratorswho drew constantly upon a rich archive of drawn , printed , and painted materials in their production of new paintings . <p> Who , then , was at work in Jan Brueghels studio , what materials were assembled there for the composition of pictures , and who got to use them ? Two artists can confidently be associated with the studio : Daniel Seghers and Jan Brueghel the Younger . Seghers is the only painter who ever formally apprenticed with Jan , as registered with the guild in 1611 . This stands in sharp contrast to his brother , Pieter the Younger , who regularly took on apprentices , or to Hendrick van Balen , who in 1609 alone registered Heynrick Ingelants , Gilliam Neeffs , Fernande Schuermans , Francoys Denteer , and Johannes Driescheren , as well as the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of running a studio . Van Balen and Pieter Brueghel were teachers and had ways of using the talents , however minimal , of whoever wanted to study with them . Sometimes they landed a great artist , but not often . Jan , on the other hand , only took on a learner when that person had an exceptional talent he could immediately use . Seghers would become an outstanding painter of floral still lifes ; Jan accepted him as an apprentice at a point when he was expanding his own repertoire in that genre and could use a young man of high promise . Jans eldest son , born in 1601 , would have started his training at around age ten , thus at the same time that Seghers arrived . The younger Brueghel probably became a productive member of the studio within a few years , having learned to paint so that his handling would be nearly indistinguishable from his fathers . This was the usual way of things in seventeenth-century Antwerp and simply shows that Jan , unlike Rubens , who did not train his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of local craft traditions . <p> Like Rubens , though , Jan must have hired professional painters to assist him in his work , men whose talents he could test and whom he did not need to train . We can pinpoint a few of these . A painter named Michiel , living with Jan Brueghel , paid fl. 36 in guild dues in 1611 . When Jans son took over the studio after his fathers death , in 1625 , he immediately began paying wages to two men working there : an Elias Voet and S. de Momper . It is likely that they had been his fathers steady help . By 1628 Jan Junior was paying three more assistants , suggesting that the shop habitually employed a sizable staff . Assistants had helped to execute his fathers " autograph " pictures , and those familiar with the workshops practice must have known that , because in his letters to Bianchi Jan the Elder specifies when he has not been assisted in the execution of a particular picture . The assistants also painted works on their own : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borromeo by saying he was busy preparing " many paintings by my assistants to send them to the fair in Paris . " These were not the sorts of paintings Brueghel was sending to the cardinal or even to Bianchi for sale to other refined Milanese collectors ; they were less expensive items for ordinary buyers , people who went to the Paris faira general free marketto find a nice picture to decorate their front room . <p> I will return to what sorts of paintings Jans assistants were producing for the broad art market . But first I would like to consider the surviving evidence for what materials were available to Jans workshop for the production of pictures . By " materials " I refer to visual resources to which a painterincluding Jan himselfcould resort for ideas and formulae in developing a composition . Art historians can be reticent about the common use of such resources , especially by " great " artists , and instead retain the ideal of the single unique image born whole in the mind of the genius and made manifest by his brush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model is less relevant than Jan Brueghel . <p> In his early years as a history painter , Brueghel made liberal use of printed sources . Although he sometimes worked closely after a single print , more often he used selected imagery from an engraving and combined it with his own invention : for instance , a scene of whale hunting by Philip Galle after Hans Bol forms , somewhat improbably , the setting for Johns vision on Patmos ( fig. 9 ) . Jans early hell scenes draw liberally upon details of his own fathers Virtues and Sins series . Working from prints like this was standard practice for Northern artists painting on a small scale in Italy . From a theoretical standpoint it was an atrocity : using prints as a crutch confirmed a painters ineptitude . Patrons , however , did not necessarily see things in this light . Borromeo owned the very prints after Marten de Vos that Brueghel adapted for his hermit scenes ; to him , the translation of the prints into painted imagesthe alteration of scale , addition of color , and greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is likely that Jan owned a set of these engravings as well . Working from prints also facilitated Brueghels early forays into collaborative painting . In their 1595 Allegory of Life , for instance , he and Rottenhammer freely reinterpreted imagery from a single famous print by Giorgio Ghisi ( fig. 14 ) . That base image provided a shared framework upon which each painter could elaborate in turn . <p> &lt;insert fig. 14 about here&gt; <p> In adapting Borromeos print collection to paintings , Brueghel also drew upon a second storehouse of visual motifs : his collection of drawings . Already in Italy he had used drawings by his father and also by other Antwerp artists of his fathers generation . To these he had added drawings of his own : nature studies , drawings of ruins , copies after details of works by Italian masters that impressed him as perfect solutions to figural problems . Many of these early drawings survive , and his paintings imply that more once existed . For instance , Jan was well acquainted with the white horse from Titians Adoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the cardinals favorite painting in his own collection , and the white horse merited special mention in his Musaeum . In a letter to Bianchi , Jan mentions that artists often copied after Titians masterpiece , and evidently he was one of them , for a cousin of that horse appears in two of his own pictures from 1600 : an Adoration of the Magi and , in reverse , an Orpheus Playing for the Animals ( fig. 15 ) . This sort of flipping of a drawing from picture to picturefigures , animals , groupswas common in Jans studio , and a basic horse drawing of some sort must have existed . Then , just as Jan shared his cache of Pieter Bruegel landscape drawings with Paul Bril , so Hans Rottenhammer shared figure drawings with him , including copies from paintings to which Jan had no access . Thus , without ever traveling to Venice , Jan was able to adapt a group of women Tintoretto had recently painted at the Scuola di San Rocco . <p> &lt;insert fig. 15 about here&gt; <p> Like Rubens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in producing pictures . A few still exist , like the panel filled with studies of dogs now in Vienna ( fig. 16 ) . It is perhaps identical with the " largish panel with sketches of dogs " that was in his daughters possession in 1641 , along with another twenty-nine sketches on panel " of various things . " All the surviving oil sketches are of individual animals , that is , single figures available to be used in new arrangements in paintings . The many lost panels could have contained other sorts of imagery that Jan would study from life and repeat in numerous pictures , like the pieces of costly armor that appear in his allegories of fire or histories of Vulcans forge . Motifs were also gathered in drawn form , including the human figures , with their horses and carts and boats , that would populate his country roads and rivers ( fig. 17 ) . Individual elements from such drawings might be extracted for use in paintings over a period of many years . <p> &lt;insert figs. 16 &amp; 17 about here&gt; <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groupings and compositions . Usually the relationship of drawings to paintings is somewhat oblique : rather than full compositional plans , they register an idea that was differently framed in painted form , a motif that became one part of a larger composition , or the spatial coordinates within which a fuller image could be developed . One of the most direct relationships is between a large drawing of a country road and several painted landscapes ( figs. 18 and , e.g. , 19 ) . Yet almost nothing is actually identical between drawing and paintings apart from the general disposition of road , stream , and woodland . The buildings to the left are different ; trees have been shifted around and clearings opened . Most obviously , while the original figures have vanishedthey were only being used to gauge scale within this sittingnew ones have appeared , clustered in sociable groups or driving cattle or sitting in wagons . Many look familiar , having traveled along other roadways painted by Jan and his studio . <p> &lt;insert figs. 18 &amp; 19 about here&gt; <p> Drawings that interlink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted on the fingers of one hand . And for an artist who produced many ambitious history paintings , the lack of related drawings is remarkable . In the few cases where a complete drawing depicts an allegory or a history , there is no directly corresponding painting , as if the drawing represented either a failed interpretation of the subject or an independent work of art . For instance , Brueghels drawing of a village street with Saint Martin dividing his cloak , now in Stockholm , bears no relation to the painting of that subject in Prague ( figs. 20 and 21 ) . But the drawing is almost the same size as the painting , suggesting that it was an independent collectors item , unique and yet generated at around the same time as the painting ; numerous remaining landscape drawings by Jan , some completely unrelated to any painting , must likewise have been made for collectors ( fig. 22 ) . <p> &lt;insert figs. 2022 about here&gt; <p> Jan sometimes made approval drawings ; for instance , when he was working on his Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent a group of drawings to Borromeo to make sure the composition would meet with his patrons approval ( fig. 23 ) . The correspondence about these drawings is interesting on several accounts . Multiple drawings are involved , and Jan asks for the drawings back when he is already finishing the painting . This suggests that while he may have sent some compositional plan for approval , he also sent along study drawings for groups of figures and animals , which were his usual tools for assembling a painting . And although he did not intend to produce multiple versions of Borromeos painting , he wanted to add the drawings to his store in case he needed this group of soldiers or those women with pails in some unrelated composition . Such partial drawings were a crucial element of his studios visual archive . One must have existed for the Prague Saint Martin , for the central figure grouping reappearson a completely different village streetin a picture that was once on the art market in Munich . The windmill in the background of the Munich painting appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saint Martin . <p> &lt;insert fig. 23 around here&gt; <p> The Munich Saint Martin is typical of work produced in Jans studio , using the stock of drawings on hand to assemble a new picture that is related to but does not exactly copy an older picture . Exact copies were certainly madeas was done with the Saint Martinbut variants were more common . Numerous examples can be found in the margins of Jans oeuvre , workshop products that repeat only part of an original painting or combine motifs from several paintings . Sometimes the motifs are from related works : for instance , variants of Aeneas and Sibyl in the Underworld recombine elements from two autograph versions . This is unsurprising , for evidence suggests that drawings within the workshop were bundled and categorized around specific subjects so that they could be looked up and reused efficiently . The testament of Ambrosius Brueghel , Jans youngest son , mentions a Crucified Christ painted by his father ; attached to it is a wooden box " with all the drawings and sketches lying in it . " Ambrosius , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in the workshop-ready form in which he had inherited it . <p> In other cases , workshop pictures use elements that Jan had devised for scenes with completely different subjects , so that genresque figures from history paintings meander down ordinary village streets . Motifs are frequently flipped between pictures : the windmill in the Saint Martin variant appears in reverse in several other landscape paintings . Scale may also change . Copies are sometimes identical in size , but in other cases they vary greatly , so that compositions executed in miniature scale are repeated in quite large variants . All of this is in striking contrast to the way production operated in the workshop of his brother , Pieter the Younger . There , full compositions were repeated as exactly as possible and much the same scale . The rooms full of uncannily identical paintings at the Pieter Brueghel exhibition would never be repeated at a show of Jan Brueghels work . Jans workshop employed more elaborate and flexible techniques of replication and recombination , in his own autograph compositions and in pictures produced by his paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually consumed in the process . Thus the most frequently used drawings would be precisely those that are no longer extant . <p> I have been describing Jans practice as if all of his paintings were equally produced in an ongoing process of repetition and variation , but this is by no means the case . Certain compositions were never copied or closely varied , especially the early histories for his Roman patrons . Throughout his career , the very smallest works tend to be unique items , as are the very large late works done on commission for the Habsburgs . Compositions designed in a round or oval shape are not often repeated . Pictures that seem experimental or anomalous are one-offs : his only known portrait , his few vertical compositions , his copies after Dnrer , and variants on his fathers paintings . Collaborative works are less likely to exist in multiple versions . <p> But some collaborative works also exist in a dozen copies and variants , as do many independent paintings . Even early works , even works done for his best patrons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lake of Tiberius of 1595 ( fig. 2 ) , in Borromeos collection , exists in a copy signed and dated a year later . Egidio Colonnas Adoration of the Magi was the first of a cluster of variants that would be produced when Jan returned to Antwerp . Evidently Jan brought home with him working drafts of his Italian compositions and started up production in Antwerp based in part on those tried-and-true formulae . The low number and high quality of the versions , though , reflect what must have been Jans smaller workshop at the beginning of his career . <p> Eventually Jan must have begun using a larger staff to produce pictures in greater volume , but it is hard to say exactly when this happened , since his working method meant variants could be produced long after the first effort . A few history pictures from the late 1590s exist in many copies , but some of these could have been executed later . More striking is the increase in what might be called " pattern pictures " starting around 1604 . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prague trip and second marriage , Jan evidently switched production models . Many ( though not all ) of his landscape paintings from the next ten years exist in half a dozen or more copies and variants . Sometimes there are as many as twenty variants , of all sizes and on various supports , some even shaped differently ( a small copper oval versus a large rectangular canvas ) , some perhaps autograph , others absolutely awful . Likewise , certain collaborative allegorical compositions , though more complicated to execute , were repeated and varied ad infinitum , while others remained singular ; and some of the labor-intensive flower paintings also exist in multiple versions . <p> I think that Jan often worked on several versions of a composition at once , an efficient way of production that would help explain his large autograph output of rather labor-intensive pictures . One painting could then remain in the studio for the assistants reference in producing variants , while another was signed , dated , and sold off . It also seems possible that when a new picture was being executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him or by his assistants when demand arose . Jan rarely worked with full underdrawings , but a plate or panel with a complete imprimatura and loosely worked-up contours and shadows , plus drawings for figures or figure groups , would have given the basic material needed to complete the image . The numerous " begun copper plates " and " begun panels " that appear in his estate inventory are surely such semifinished works . This would be another way to account for copies and variants , even autograph ones , that were executed years apart . Take , for instance , the listing in Jans estate sale of an unfinished " paradise landscape " along with its copy . Jan had not made an original painting of this subject for about a decade before his death . What was languishing in his studio was probably some unfinished secondary version of an earlier work and a tertiary studio work that derived from it . <p> Ideally , there would be a kind of map that would locate all these works at a greater or lesser distance from Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given work relates to some original by Jan . To some degree both Jan and his assistants must have produced pictures in the same way , generating ( moderately ) new compositions out of fragmentary studies for old ones . His correspondence with Borromeo indicates that Jan sometimes retouched weak studio pieces and felt that the resulting works could pass as originals , a sentiment Rubens would famously express about his own studio work as well . In every way , then , the concepts of a single " original " and secondary copies are compromised by the workings of Jans studio . <p> Although studio variants , even autograph ones , came in different sizes and media , the trend in the course of Jans own works is from copper to panel to occasional canvas and from small size to larger . In his first decade , in Italy and then in Antwerp , the great majority of his works are on copper plates of 25 + 35 centimeters or smaller . In his early years back in Antwerp he painted a handful of quite large works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact , the sizable works of 15981600 are the largest pictures he would ever produce independently , barring much later works on canvas commissioned by Albert and Isabella . But these works are exceptions in his general production of those early years . <p> After 1600 Jan began to work more often on panel , and the average dimensions of his works increase , but averages are deceiving . The larger sizes , especially after 1605 , include many collaborative works , first with Van Balen and then with Rubens . Of the independent works , Jans flower still lifes are often fairly good sized : rendered at " life scale , " an abundant floral arrangement occupies a substantial panel . But in general , Jans works stayed small until the last decade of his life , when he no longer executed many new independent compositions at all . <p> Excepting again the late large pictures made for the court in Brussels , Jans works also maintain a marked consistency in the scale of what is depicted . No matter how large the image , its individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occupy a greater given space ; instead , their number multiplies . Compared to other history painters , even those working on small supports , Jans figurative elements are always tiny relative to his working surface . The larger pictures simply contain extraordinary numbers of personsor flowers or animals or still-life elements . Imagery was built up area by area , with any one section having perhaps several stages of paint application , so that details accumulated gradually until the primary paint layer was hidden under a mass of tiny brushstrokes . <p> Thus , even when Jans support is sizable , its surface is filled with detail to a degree one would expect only in a much smaller picture . Or perhaps " detail " is not exactly the right word : what occupies Jans paintings is brushwork . The surfaces of Jans best pictures are alive with the tiny yet perfectly visible unblended strokes of a fine , fine brush . Even foreground landscape areas where no object is described are composed of a mass of little daubs . Jans preferred support , copper , maintains all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vivid separateness of each stroke . Individual elements are outlined with the brush ; facial features are drawn rather than modeled . The visibility of every touch actually made Jans works relatively easy to copy , made his manner imitable by the workshop . Yet because of its intricacy and bravura application , his facture appears unique , even inimitable , a style of picture making that would be identified as Jans own . In his work , facture and style can potentially be equivalent . <p> In contrast to more efficient techniques being developed by other artists in his lifetime , Jans manner of painting was slow and labor-intensive . But it also made that labor visible . The brushstrokes index time spent in making , and it was important to Jan that this time be recognized . He emphasizes in his letters how long and with how much care he has worked on a given painting , assuring Bianchi , for instance , that he reserves for Borromeo three summer months of every yearprime working time , with long days and good lightand that in that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken as a report of his actual practice but rather as a claim of value registered in time spent , time that is in turn registered in the finished work by visible facture . <p> What type of value does the evidence of labor create , though ? Jan is not expecting payment by the hour like some lowly workman ; his generous compensation is negotiated with Borromeo on the basis of the excellence of his works and the esteem in which his patron holds him . The long working hours , as Jan describes them , are in some sense like those that his contemporary Nicholas Hilliard imagined being spent by the gentleman-amateur , a painter unhurried by crass demands like maximizing production for small marginal benefit . Hilliards ideal painter never flags in his efforts , no matter how practiced he is or what degree of natural talent he possesses . " Then this exhortation give I , " writes the English miniaturist , " that he be diligent , yea ever diligent , and put his whole uttermost and best endeavors to exceell all other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same diligence , or rather more , to effect and perform his worke , than hee did at first in larninge . " <p> " Diligence " is precisely the descriptor to which Brueghel lays claim for his practice and his products , the hallmark of his art . It is a term that appears frequently in his correspondence " I will use all diligence , " he tells Borromeo , " in making the painting of a procession with acts of devotion . " Equally it is a term Borromeo uses to characterize his favored artists work , telling the reader of his Musaeum that Brueghels tiny scenes from the Passion , including the Procession , are executed with " extreme diligence . . . a quality for which this artist is famed throughout Europe . " And in his Discorso Vincenzo Giustiniani , brother of Jans patron Benedetto , also writes of Jan as a master of diligence . <p> Diligenza was a term with a lively currency in Italian art literature , used by artists in writing to their patrons and by theorists in describing artistic practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Borromeo , had picked it up . It was a concept with positive , even lofty connotations . A picture executed diligently had been done out of love of art and a higher aspiration to artistic perfection . Diligence was regularly linked to study and intellectual , rather than manual , exercise : planning and calculation for the heroes of Giorgio Vasaris Lives , observation of nature and conviction in its rendering for Brueghel and Borromeo . Even the least diligent of artists applied diligence when working on a key work for an important patron , like Michelangelo when executing the Doni Tondo . Lucy Cutler has pointed out that diligenza was etymologically linked to ideas of love and devotion , so that when Brueghel labored diligently for the cardinal , he was demonstrating devotion to his patron . That can not , however , have been what Borromeo thought he was famed for throughout Europe . <p> Diligence sounds like a rather arid form of praise to modern earsa diligent scholar , for instance , has double-checked all her footnotes but has no profound insights to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor to compensate for a lack of innate talent , dexterity , or genius . These criticisms of diligence were equally applicable in Brueghels day . When Vasari remarks that in Italy Schongauers and Dnrers prints are commended only for their diligent execution , he is making it clear that they are damned with faint praise . Diligence stands , to some extent , as the opposite of a better-known Renaissance cultural value : facility , a quality linked to , although not identical with , sprezzatura . In his Lives of the Artists , Vasari balances diligence and facility by pairing painters characterized by the opposing qualities . He juxtaposes , for example , the Venetians Battista Franco and Tintoretto as excellent but imperfect masters . Diligent Francos careful , polished works lack boldness and invention , while Tintoretto is " swift , resolute , fantastic and extravagant " but devotes insufficient diligence to each part of the image . The ideal formula , Vasari implies , must be a combination of facility and diligence , but that seems almost impossible to achieve , because the terms reflect such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The visible result of extreme diligence is a highly finished painting , its surfaces polished as smoothly as the cheeks of Bronzinos Medici princesses . Diligence includes the erasure of labors traces . Extreme facility produces a very different surface , one marred by paint strokes that have been applied with apparent haste and inattention and that stand apart from the strict work of descriptive representation . Jan Brueghels paintings conform to neither of these models . Despite his internationally famous diligence , his surfaces are never highly finished ; indeed , they are remarkably textured . The brushwork , though at a miniature scale , remains free and loose , each mark visibly registering the painters command of his art . Jans diligence transcends the limitations Vasari had seen in even the best diligent work , because it simultaneously demonstrates the virtuosity of a painter who is not afraid to show the work of his hand . <p> Although diligence can be an attribute of painters working at a larger scale , it is a quality most often possessed by those who work small .

Why do the citizens of countries with equivalent levels of development , similar macroeconomic policies , and a shared cultural heritage show remarkable differences in their abidance to law and prescribed rules ? This book explains why Chile has been more successful than Argentina in achieving compliance with taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law abidance and conformity to rules . In Tax Evasion and the Rule of Law in Latin America , I argue that countries with established rule-of-law traditions , where norms and rules are widely embraced , have better levels of tax compliance and are capable of developing sound fiscal policies . Conversely , countries whose citizens live on the margins of the law face great difficulties in reversing tax evasion , because they are unable to resolve basic collective-action problems . Countries that reach virtuous equilibria between government enforcement and social adherence to norms are better suited to enter a path of development . <p> Scholars in legal studies , political science , and sociology have studied the role of law in modern states , as well as the social and political benefits of the rule of law . This literature , however , has largely ignored the questions of how law becomes effective , under what conditions stable equilibria are reached , and what mechanisms enable optimal legal behavior . I contend that the effectiveness of law relies heavily on self-enforcement and voluntary compliance , and that citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the best alternative among different possible outcomes . By analyzing the institutionalization of tax behavior , I contribute to an explanation of how voluntary compliance emerges , survives , or fails . Approaching tax compliance from this perspective allows me to uncover many blind spots in traditional theories of voluntary compliance . <p> Tax evasion is just one of many individual acts that defy the ability of states to enforce enacted laws , and it is found everywhere . What distinguishes most developed countries from developing nations is the magnitude of noncompliance . For example , the value-added tax ( VAT ) compliance rate for OECD ( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ) countries is in the 7085 percent range , compared to 4577 percent for Latin America . But even in countries with similar levels of development , we find vast differences in tax-compliance levels . Chile and Argentina have similar tax structures and comparable tax rates and enforcement mechanisms , yet compliance has been far superior in Chile . <p> Taxpayers in Chile conform better to tax laws in part because they perceive their own tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Compliance , however , depends on more than an effective tax administration ( TA ) . Tax evasion has cultural roots in social norms and institutional arrangements . I argue that deterrence is more effective in societies with better norm abidance , because government threats of law enforcement become more credible , thereby nurturing cooperative " compliance equilibria . " In countries where norms are not widely upheld and where laws are consistently violated , on the other hand , citizens develop attitudes and beliefs that inhibit their compliance with rules , contributing to the formation of " noncompliance equilibria . " The failure to develop a culture of conformity to norms biases individual perceptions and limits the effectiveness of government deterrence , leading taxpayers in noncompliant environments to defy government authorities ; these taxpayers believe that noncooperation is rational behavior . In other words , where only suckers get taxed , it pays to cheat . <p> Because nobody likes to pay taxes , there is a need to study the social mechanisms that compel taxpayers to comply in certain environments and to cheat in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar enforcement yields differences in rule conformance . These questions also have important implications beyond fiscal policies . Tax evasion inhibits the creation of healthy economies and sound paths for development . It is harder for states that fail to elicit high tax compliance to gain wide approval , because the quality of public goods in such states diminishes . Conversely , higher compliance is self-sustaining because it enables sound fiscal policies that promote improved consent . <p> This book is about cheaters , about suckers , and about legalists . Depending on the interplay of different variables , cheaters will predominate in one society and legalists in others . In the following pages I examine the motivations that lead people to cheat , comply with , or challenge the government in the field of taxes . It presents an in-depth analysis of a large set of data collected exclusively for this project over many years . It includes six new surveys on tax compliance , individual tax-return and tax-enforcement records on more than thirty thousand taxpayers , and an experimental laboratory study with college students in both Chile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the data-driven research on which this study is based evaluates , among other topics , the effect of government enforcement of tax law , the legitimacy of authorities , the scope of deterrence , and the role of culture . <p> This has larger implications that transcend the field of taxation . At stake is the study of states and societies that seek a clear path for development , for consolidation of democratic regimes , and for pacific resolutions of income distributions and social conflicts . The in-depth investigation of why similar policies and enforcement yield very different outcomes reveals the complexities of developing paths to stability and growth , or to unrest and stagnation . <p> This book sheds light on at least three central questions debated in the literature . First , how does path dependency operate to enhance or constrain the ability of governments to raise revenues ? This is crucial for middle- and low-income nations to enter a development path . In this study , I provide the data and the quantitative approach to explain how culture and social learning affect compliance with laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , this book provides additional insights regarding the nature of the relationship between democracy and taxation . Over the last decades many countries have proceeded on a different track compared to early modern nations such as Britain and the United States , where democracy and taxation developed hand in hand . Re-democratization in countries such as Argentina did not have a meaningful impact on citizens acquaintance to taxation , and social and political instability is tied to these broader processes . This book investigates the peculiar nature of taxation , which is not firmly grounded in representation and citizenship . Third , by going through the painstaking intricacies of citizens tax behavior , this study answers broader questions : how laws and institutional arrangements can effectively produce social and political change , under what set of conditions can change be brought about , and what are the limitations of legal entrepreneurship in social change . Although an all-encompassing answer to these questions is outside the scope of this book , I hope to provide a conceptual framework that articulates a preliminary answer to this puzzle . <p> &lt;strong&gt;Compliance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Problem <p> Although Argentina and Chile have similar levels of development , tax evasion differs markedly in the two nations . More than 85 percent of taxpayers in Argentina acknowledge that they cheated on their taxes during the previous year , and over 50 percent admit to failing to pay more than 20 percent of their legally owed taxes . In Chile , on the other hand , less than 20 percent of taxpayers admit to cheating on their taxes , and very rarely do they fail to pay less than 90 percent of their true tax dues . Income-tax noncompliance in Argentina exceeds 50 percent of legally expected revenues , and 35 to 50 percent of the expected revenue from the compliance-friendly VAT remains uncollected each year . Social security and payroll taxes fare even worse . In Chile , total noncompliance is estimated at less than 35 percent ( Barra and Jorrat 1999 ) , whereas the VAT-evasion rate averaged 22 percent in the 1990s . <p> Worldwide tax-evasion rates differ markedly . For most developed countries , VAT evasion averages 25 percent , whereas for developing nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though incomplete , suggests that differences between developed and developing countries are even larger . For OECD nations , income tax-evasion rates range from 15 to 29 percent , whereas for Latin America income tax-noncompliance rates range from 29 to 75 percent . In this respect , Chile is considerably closer to the OECD standard , and the pattern in Argentina is more similar to that of the rest of Latin America . <p> Tax evasion in Argentina is a well-entrenched phenomenon . In contrast to Chile or the United States , where many taxpayers report cheating in small amounts , taxpayers in Argentina participate in bold , large-scale evasion schemes . In Argentina , evading taxes is not a peripheral activity or a way to make a quick extra buck but rather an institutionalized behavior and a source of revenue deemed legitimate by Argentine society . Chileans also try to maximize benefits and reduce their taxes , yet most taxpayers do so within the margins of the law . Some participate in tax evasion , but the majority of taxpayers who cheat do so marginally . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost revenues in Argentina exceed US$45 billion per year ( 15 percent of GDP ) , in Chile the estimated lost revenues are US$4.7 billion a year ( less than 7 percent of GDP ) . In recent years , the Argentine government has spent more on controlling tax evasion than on programs for fighting poverty and unemployment . In order to collect taxes , Argentina spends three times as much as Chile and over four times as much as the United States . The budget of the tax administration is twice as large as that of the education department and almost three times larger than that of the social-welfare department . <p> Legal and Political Context <p> Political instability and social conflict have dominated Argentina for many decades . From the 1930s to the 1980s , Argentina faced several institutional and social crises that generated a deep but subtle breach of trust in the political system ; despite re-democratization in 1983 , Argentines profound lack of faith in the government remains very much alive . The disenchantment with the countrys social , political , and economic institutions is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social institutions to manage the disastrous fiscal crisis of 2001 is intrinsically tied to this public disenchantment with government . <p> Chile has also been mired in political and social upheaval . A bloody 1973 coup ushered in a sixteen-year military dictatorship that disrupted more stable and pacific mechanisms for the resolution of social and political conflict . Setting aside this interval and a single episode of military rule in the 1920s , however , civilian rule and a proud legal tradition since the mid-nineteenth century have fostered political and judicial traditions in which law abidance and obedience to authority are predominant . As some scholars argue ( Angell 2006 ; Valenzuela 1998 ) , the military dictatorship was an aberration that did not entirely disrupt this pattern . The civilian legalist tradition has been easily recaptured and has yielded strong institutional performance . In fact , Chilean tax compliance was much higher during the 1990s than under the Pinochet dictatorship . <p> Compliance is a symptom of the strength of a countrys institutional legitimacy . Chile is one of the few Latin American countries where obedience to rules is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rule of law is deeply rooted . On the other hand , the evasion of taxes is just one of many rule-breaking behaviors of the Argentines . Argentine noncompliance with many other laws clearly points to a state of anomie and social disintegration ( Nino 1992 ) . Subtly , and sometimes openly , the rule of law is challenged in everyday behaviors in Argentina ( ODonnell 1999 ) . As we shall see , the difference in tax compliance between Chile and Argentina is tied to these broader differences of social and political context . <p> Case Selection <p> The study of compliance with law in general , and taxation in particular , requires a comparative perspective . There is little doubt that a deep understanding of the variables that affect compliance must take into consideration the social ecologies in which these laws operate . A central claim of this bookthat the unit of analysis for tax behavior is not the individuals self-motivation but the environment in which this individual operatescertainly calls for a comparative perspective . <p> Chile and Argentina are ideal cases for this study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than either of them has with any other country in the world . That alone would make them very good comparative cases ; a more important reason , however , is that through this research it is possible to identify the divergent effect that rules and institutions have on social and political outcomes in both countries . <p> Argentina is a representative example of a country that has fallen into the " noncompliance trap . " Over the last century this countrys reversal of development ( Waisman 1987 ) has puzzled social scientists , who have struggled to explain how such benign social and economic conditions ( skilled workforce , homogeneous population , fertile farming land , abundant natural resources ) were dilapidated . This countrys noncompliance is not of mere academic interest : it has a direct effect on the countrys inability to put its finances in order , and it partially accounts for the economic crisis ( including devaluations , huge resource transferring , and freezing of bank deposits ) that led to social violence , the resignation of presidents , and large waves of out-migration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal institutions and cultural attributes that effect compliance , as well as social and political stability . This is why a successful case such as Chile is compared to a social trap such as Argentina . Chile has managed to avoid the noncompliance equilibria that are so common and devastating in the region . For Chile , the compliance equilibrium helps to explain why it has one of the most dynamic and stable economies in the area , and why a higher level of consensus and compromise ( for the most part are absent in the region ) characterizes its democratic institutions . <p> The divergent trend of Argentina and Chile illuminates processes and features that transcend both taxation and Latin America . This study tests hypotheses crucial for the socioeconomic and political outcomes in many countries around the world . Comparative research on these case studies is important because : ( 1 ) individual choices are greatly influenced by the environment , and therefore a systematic comparison of equilibria sheds light on individual outcomes ; ( 2 ) Chile and Argentina are great representative examples of compliance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important differences between these countries ; and ( 4 ) such a comparison sheds light on structural characteristics that affect development and social and political stability . <p> **26;701;TOOLONG on Tax **25;729;TOOLONG <p> Scholars have approached tax compliance from a number of different perspectives and disciplines over the past four decades . Microeconomic theories of tax evasion claim that people pay taxes if their subjective perception of the likelihood of detection and punishment is higher than the cost of full compliance ; such theories maintain that taxpayers calculations about the utility of taxation are only very rarely related to the actual provision of goods and services ( Becker 1968 ; Cowell 1990 ) . Numerous studies , however , have demonstrated that such an invariant assumption about taxpayers rationality does not fully capture the range of human motivations and aspirations ( Tversky and Kahneman 1982 ; Elster 1989 ; Frey 1997 ) . Deterrence theory has emerged as a valuable approach to account for differences in individual decision making . Its advocates point out that costs , benefits , and opportunities are subjectively perceived and should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of government enforcement tools is secondary to the way that this effectiveness is individually perceived ; therefore , differences in compliance are tied both to culture and to actual enforcement of the law . <p> Sociologists and social psychologists have examined the effects of norms and culture on individuals tax behavior ( Grasmick and Bursik 1990 ; Cialdini 1989 ; Lederman 2003 ) but have failed to show how these macro-structures produce micro-behaviors ; these studies have ignored the interesting question of how individuals adopt or reject cultural norms in specific taxation situations . <p> Political scientists have addressed taxation and compliance in two dimensions . A sociopolitical perspective ties the capacity of governments to raise taxes to the " warrior state . " A few recent studies use this perspective within the Latin American context ( Centeno 2002 ; Lopez-Alvez 2000 ) , and they help to successfully explain the emergence of a stronger state in Chile than in Argentina in the nineteenth century . More research is needed , however , to explain how nineteenth-century formations and institutions linger in the present . A second tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convey one of the central principles of taxation : equity . According to this perspective , people comply with taxation law to the extent that they receive tangible benefits from their contributions , fostering a working contract between citizens and rulers . If true , however , it is unclear how the free-riding paradigm was overcome in Chile . Even under a brutal dictatorship from 1973 to 1990 , in which Chileans had no meaningful representation , no voice , and minimal provision of goods and services , Chile still enjoyed high levels of tax compliance compared to other countries of the region . <p> Without an interdisciplinary dialogue , the riddle of tax compliance will remain difficult to solve . In this book , I provide an institutional and interdisciplinary analysis of tax evasion . I follow Nobel laureate Douglas Norths general understanding of individual behavior in conceptualizing how taxpayers make compliance decisions . North writes : " Human behavior appears to be more complex than that embodied in the individual utility function of economists models . . . . People decipher the environment by processing information through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the problems they confront . Both the computational abilities of the players and the complexity of the problems to be solved must be taken into account in understanding the issues " ( 1990 , 20 ) . Regarding the importance of the environment in shaping choices , North adds : " Uncertainties arise from incomplete information with respect to the behavior of other individuals in the process of human interaction . The computational limitations of the individual are determined by the capacity of the mind to process , organize , and utilize information . From this capacity taken in conjunction with the uncertainties involved in deciphering the environment , rules and procedures evolve to simplify the process . The consequent institutional framework , by structuring human interaction , limits the choice set of the actors " ( 25 ) . <p> Using Norths understanding of individual behavior to extend the pure microeconomic perspective , I argue throughout Tax Evasion and the Rule of Law in Latin America that taxpayers decisions transcend the realm of profit maximization . Taxpayers do not purely optimize but rather mostly satisfy personal expectations ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily determined by an evolutionary conceptualization of compliance and responsiveness to rules . Following sociological traditions , I argue that the way individuals perceive costs , obligations , duties , and social sanctions is critical for each compliance decision . Those perceptions evolve from a set of social interactions and structure individual strategic decisions ( Coleman 1990 ) . People maximize utilities inasmuch as they pay as little in taxes as they can . But the environment in which people operate fundamentally shapes how they frame the maximization of their benefits . In that sense , tax evasion depends more on the ecology of taxation than on the optimality of enforcement . Yet institutions do matter a great deal in this context , because they account for the formation of tastes and preferences . Political perspectives are instrumental to showing how states become effective in both generating an equity contract with taxpayers and producing enforcement to deter free riders from undermining the compliance game . Tax evasion , then , should be understood as highly sensitive to social , political , and cultural processes ; any attempt to understand variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cultural , and economic perspectives on the problem . <p> **25;756;TOOLONG and a General Initial **25;783;TOOLONG <p> I begin my analysis of tax noncompliance with three basic assumptions . First , I assume that nobody likes to pay taxes . Given the choice to free ride without being punished , most people would avoid paying taxes yet still benefit from public goods . This assumption , however , does not imply that most people cheat . Some do , and some do not . An analysis of tax compliance must consider the factors that enhance or constrain peoples decisions about whether to cheat . <p> My second assumption is that the distribution of risk-averse individuals and risk takers is similar across nations , except where a causal factor accounts for differences in the distribution . Thus , the starting unit of analysis ought to be the " tax environment . " Tax compliance is exogenous , in the sense that external factors make taxpayers react to their perceptions of social and economic conditions in particular ways . Thus , analysis of the contextual world in which taxpayers operate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax compliance across countries . Variation within a countrys population does exist , of course ; however , this within-country variance is random among different societies . The majority of research on tax evasion has been conducted from a within-country perspective . Such studies lack enough across-country variation to isolate causal explanations . A comparative approach illuminates an under-examined aspect of tax compliance behavior : the way that taxpayers come to perceive their tax environment successfully explains variation in tax compliance . <p> This leads to a third assumption , related to the self-sustaining nature of compliance . Tax decisions are tied to personal and ecological features , such as the routine of making tax decisions , the role of accountants as informants , and the makeup of the tax system . Within the constraints imposed by the tax structure and the filing system , taxpayer decisions become self-sustaining , resulting in an equilibrium that explains the stability of aggregate compliance rates . Nations rarely witness sudden shifts in overall compliance , because taxpayers rarely change their tax decisions from one year to the next . Rather , improvements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers are reluctant to alter tax practices unless they have substantial ( generally firsthand ) information that affects the prior equilibrium . <p> Most taxpayers are not sophisticated rationalizers who evaluate options and estimate risk levels thoroughly , then multiply these by the cost of punishment to arrive at optimal decisions . Rather , they decide using different value scales . Because taxpayers have access to only selective and limited information , they maximize benefits to themselves by relying on a complex set of variables that they can trust as good predictors of " safe " decisions . In a country whose citizens perceive that evasion goes unpunished , where the opportunities to cheat are large , and where the moral inhibitors against tax cheating are very low , we find higher levels of tax evasion . Therefore , I hypothesize that when there is room for individual tax decisions ( i.e. , controlling for the nature of tax system ) , taxpayers arrive at their best choices based on social learning , in which the perceived standardized behavior of peers and the previous levels of enforcement contribute to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a path-dependent explanation of compliance based on culture , enforcement , and tax structures , all of which combine and operate in different scenarios to produce different outcomes . It is based on two general propositions : First , the higher the internalized level of enforcement of norms and rules , the more citizens will tend to comply with rules ( including tax laws ) . Second , after these conditions are met , the friendlier the tax system is to compliance , the lower the level of tax evasion will be . <p> My approach to understanding tax-compliance behavior relies on a particular understanding of voluntary compliance , the role of enforcement , and social mechanisms of decision making in taxation , which I briefly outline here . Chapter 1 will revisit and expand on the discussion introduced in this section . <p> Voluntary Compliance <p> Over the last few decades , economists , political scientists , and sociologists have demonstrated the virtues of cooperation to solve collective-action problems . In the realm of taxes , it has been stated that cooperation is attained through voluntary compliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent but rather that enforcement is secondary to the free decision of taxpayers to report and pay their taxes without the threat of punishment . Margaret Levi has called this behavior " quasi-voluntary compliance " : " It is voluntary because taxpayers choose to pay . It is quasi-voluntary because the noncompliant are subject to coercionif they are caught " ( 1988 , 52 ) . <p> A central element of Levis argument is that voluntary compliance is a rational choice tied to individuals perceptions of fellow taxpayers behavior and to the responsiveness of government . Levi explains : " Taxpayers have confidence that ( 1 ) rulers will keep their bargains and ( 2 ) the other constituents will keep theirs . Taxpayers are strategic actors who will cooperate only when they can expect others to cooperate as well . The compliance of each depends on the compliance of others . No one prefers to be a sucker " ( 53 ) . Levis analysis privileges the extracting capacities of authorities : " To minimize the costs of enforcement and to maximize the output that can be taxed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reciprocity . It is a contingent strategy in which individual taxpayers are more likely to cooperate if they have reasonable expectation that both the rulers and other taxpayers are also cooperating . The key lies in what rulers and other government officials do to create mutual expectations of tax payments " ( 69 ) . <p> In this argument , compliance is an assurance game wherein taxpayers end up believing that rulers will punish free riders and deliver goods and services . Taxpaying is tied to the equity or fairness of the system : rulers must convince taxpayers that the system is fair , that there is equity in taxation , and that the burden of taxpaying is shared . Levis pathbreaking perspective assumes that tax compliance is a cooperation game scheme in which taxpayers opt to engage in mutually advantageous exchanges to maximize utility . According to Scholz and Lubell ( 1998 , 411 ) , " Citizens will meet obligations to the collective despite the temptations to free-ride as long as they trust other citizens and political leaders to keep up their side of the social contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it plainly : " First . . . people have to believe that most others probably pay what they are supposed to , and second that most of the money is used for purposes people consider legitimate . " <p> Will people always line up happily to pay their taxes if these two conditions are met ? Probably not . In the United States , for example , although 99.1 percent of wages and salaries are reported to the IRS , sole proprietors report only 67.7 percent , and informal suppliers report only 18.6 percent ( Bakija and Slemrod 2004 ) . Free-riding temptations are apparently still strong within certain groups in a country where , according to many scholars , quasi-voluntary compliance should work . <p> Economists and tax administrators have always claimed that compliance lies in the power of the stick . Voluntary-compliance scholars like Levi and Scholz focus on fairness but overlook the social conditions that make enforcement effective . I propose to bridge the two perspectives by extending the voluntary-compliance approach , with some caveats . Compliance can be conceived as a cooperation game if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive cooperators . Conditional cooperators in the tax game belong to the second category , but they will actively seek the exit door if they become suckers , thereby becoming active defectors . This take on compliance has important implications for enforcement strategies . Passive cooperators are more concerned with the horizontal fairness of the system ( that everybody pays their share and that there is no cheating ) than with the equity of their payments . More important , enforcement is easier in compliance equilibria , where strategies are geared to convince passive cooperators that everybody else is playing the game fairly ; in noncompliance equilibria , similar enforcement yields poorer results because suckers see cheaters everywhere , and therefore become active defectors . <p> Conditional ( passive ) cooperators expect the ruler first and foremost to punish free riders . But how do taxpayers know that the contract is being honored ? More important , why are rulers able to coordinate conditional cooperation in one social setting while other rulers using the same repertoire of strategies in other contexts can not attain similar results ? In this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apply it to the Latin American context . The chapters that follow will present additional proof of the validity of voluntary-compliance and contingent-consent propositions . States are indeed better off when they generate voluntary compliance , and good governance enables the extraction of revenues . More important , people are willing to pay their share of taxes , but this willingness is contingent on other taxpayers compliance , as well as on the rulers ability to deliver public goods as promised . <p> I depart from Levi , however , in several important ways . First , I propose that compliance and noncompliance equilibria are the most significant constraints on the ability of rulers to extract revenues and on the willingness of citizens to pay taxes . Second , I argue that such equilibria determine the type and viability of different enforcement strategies , which ultimately yield different outcomes . Third , I show by what mechanisms culture affects tax-compliance behavior by demonstrating the coevolution of enforcement and compliance culture . Finally , whereas for Levi and her followers the central unit of analysis is the rulers ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that precondition citizens decisions to enter the quasi-automatic paths of either obeying or defying the laws . These arrangements have profound implications for both the creation of the rule of law and the spiraling declines of failing states . <p> The Role of Enforcement <p> Tax compliance rests on two principles : exchange ( vertical ) equity and horizontal fairness . Most studies of the subject have been devoted to considering how rulers can create the right institutions to enhance vertical equity and trust , but , surprisingly , much less energy has been directed toward understanding how rules can guarantee that cooperators are not being exploited ( horizontal fairness ) . Better compliance can be ensured if states succeed in deterring passive cooperators from defecting in the tax game . <p> Taxpayers are more concerned to avoid being exploited by others than to secure the diffuse public goods that taxes produce . They will , for the most part , forego the benefits of exchange equity if they can successfully free ride . They will accept fate and passively cooperate , on the other hand , if compliance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention on states function from their role as institutions that deliver universal rights ( Levi 1997 ; Scholz 2003 ; Steinmo 1993 ; Rothstein 2005 ) to their role as guarantors of cooperation . I do not underestimate the importance of exchange equity , but I believe that taxpayers are guided by fairness and impartiality first and foremost as they relate to not being exploited . Nothing unravels trust more quickly than the feeling of being a sucker , which creates a strong motive to defect . Thus , any tax-compliance analysis must consider whether a tax environment allows free riders to escape social and political sanctionthat is , whether it is an environment of widespread impunity . <p> Scholars have largely overlooked enforcement because they have perceived it as a technical aspect of taxation . As I will demonstrate , however , enforcement is a key aspect of tax compliance , and it merits serious , in-depth research . Authors such as North ( 1990 ) and Fukuyama ( 2004 ) have shown that enforcement transcends the consolidation of bureaucratic capacities . Moreover , the assumption that tax evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technically skilled , or because these agencies are corrupt , is simply misguided . Argentina , for example , has invested more resources in combating tax evasion than has Chile ; the Argentine tax-agency staff , management , and auditors are as capable as their Chilean and U.S. counterpartsand still tax evasion persists . Clearly , cheaters in Argentina thrive because tax evasion goes unpunished , but why has a good tax administration been unable to reverse cheating ? Why is there greater horizontal fairness in Chile than in Argentina ? Answers to these questions are to be found in the interplay among enforcement strategies and the type of social equilibrium found in a particular country . Enforcement is at the heart of the tax-compliance game because it elicitsor inhibitsthe conditions for cooperation . <p> It is the subjectively perceived credibility of effective enforcement that compels citizens to abide by the rules . The threat of credible sanctions creates a virtuous circle because it both develops social and human capital and economizes on individual cost-driven decisions . Taxpayers who do not have to look for ways to evade taxes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invest these resources in productive endeavors . The perception that rules are being enforced effectively reduces free riding and optimizes resource allocation , and more widespread tax compliance raises revenues and improves the quality of public goods . <p> In order to understand tax compliance , then , it is necessary to consider how taxpayers perceive enforcement , how their perceptions of the fairness and legitimacy of the tax system are formed , and how they process information . We need to proceed in redressing what North ( 2005 ) has recently identified as a lack of theory on learning , standards , and beliefs . This book theorizes about how the ecologies of taxation and the social environment affect individual learning and legal behavior in the tax field . <p> At the center of this book is a debate about how enforcement enhances compliance with laws . This question is relevant for thinking about how to deal with a wide range of social outcomes , such as informal economies and black markets , hiring practices , illegal immigration , environmental pollution , traffic violations , and trade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account the distribution of compliance within a population , and the best strategies of enforcement should be formulated with the compliance ( or noncompliance ) culture of the affected population in mind . It is easier to ensure that rules will be widely obeyed in a law-abiding society ; enforcement agencies have a strategic advantage in such societies because they target a comparatively small pool of cheaters . Hence , their enforcement measures can not be successfully replicated in social settings where the scale of the problem is much larger and where cheaters have a strong incentive to imitate successful free riders . The split potential effect of enforcement calls for differentiated policy strategies : it may be feasible to expand tax laws and make them more complex in law-abiding societies , whereas minimal law should be pursued in noncompliant contexts . <p> The makeup of the equilibria explains why culture matters . " Culture " is defined here in very practical terms as the range of standard procedures , common beliefs , and shared values rooted and widely accepted within a community . A legalist culture is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the community , and in which people adopt strategic decisions with the functioning of legal institutions in mind ( Friedman 1975 , 1985 ) . In a culture of compliance , most people adopt a disposition to comply with the law before undertaking any cost-benefit analysis . Of course , individuals can deviate from compliance if they realize that the costs vastly exceed the benefits . More important , not all members of a compliance culture behave in the same way . At times , existing subcultures are important to individuals , and these may be at odds with the larger culture . For our purposes , culture matters because people rely on it to help them guess their optimal strategies , thereby creating average behavior in equilibrium . In compliance climates , enforcement assures conditional cooperators that cheaters are being punished ; therefore , a culture of compliance thrives . In noncompliance environments , by contrast , there are no conditions for cooperation . Enforcement is effective in compliance equilibria because it reproduces legal culture ; it is usually ineffective in noncompliance equilibria because it can rarely reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent endogenous to the prevailing legal culture . <p> In failing states , laws and regulations are perceived as unenforceable , and they mostly do not deter disobedience . Under compliance equilibria , conversely , enforcement enhances general deterrence and contributes to the image of an efficient administration . Whether such a situation lasts depends , of course , on continuous improvement and the strategic decisions of state agencies . There are three initial elements that account for the effectiveness of enforcement . <p> First , successful enforcement depends on the scale or size of the problem . To the extent that norms and rules in the polity are largely upheld , the effect of enforcement is greater . When more people abide by norms , there is less need for monitoring and large watchdog organizations . Here , an additional marginal unit of enforcement yields bigger marginal units of compliance . Conversely , the larger the number of cheaters , the more difficult it is for regulators or enforcement agencies to achieve comparable results . Thus , a similar level , depth , and scope of enforcement measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first environment , moderate enforcement achieves reasonable compliance , whereas in the second , similar or even more extensive enforcement is inadequate for achieving greater law abidance . <p> Second , in compliance environments , enforcement is geared to limit free riding . In this sense , the role of the enforcer in compliant orders is to signal to passive cooperators that conditions for cooperation are being met . Here , to be a legalist pays off , because cheaters are more likely to be detected and punished ; greater resources are allocated to generate more and better public goods , thereby enhancing a stronger sense of fairness . Moreover , when most people conform to costly laws , they have an incentive to ensure that other people are complying as well , fostering an environment in which horizontal , nonlegal enforcement ( among peers ) supports the vertical enforcement of the legal order . <p> Third , in noncompliance ecologies , enforcement must first generate the basic conditions of cooperation . Because there are so many free riders , the enforcer is always playing catch-up . In compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in noncompliance equilibria , the enforcer must wage an all-out war to transform the status quo . Comparable enforcement measures achieve better compliance results when the enforcer can select targets more efficiently . <p> Mechanisms of Taxation Decision Making <p> This book offers a set of sensible explanations to solve the riddle of tax-law noncompliance in many developing countries . I do not offer a comprehensive theory of enforcement and compliance , nor do I suggest a set of laws to predict outcomes . Rather , I present an empirically driven account of a two-country comparison that can she 'd light on many other cases . I contend that the appropriate approach to the study of tax compliance focuses on social mechanismsthat is , the set of causal patterns that enable explanations for how similar conditions produce disparate outcomes . Given that tax evasion has a strong cultural or ecological component that evolves from social , political , and economic conditions , there is a need to identify the processes that explain how people arrive at decisions that maximize their utilities in a context of bounded rationality . I focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , and the lasting endowment of effective enforcement . <p> Contagionthat is , the way that taxpayers rationally imitate the behavior of peers and other playersis the crucial first mechanism , because it explains how a critical mass of cheaters or legalists is formed and why changes in enforcement very rarely neutralize the powerful effects of imitation . When taxpayers learn that others cheat , they will be inclined to cheat ; if they perceive that most taxpayers comply , they will be inclined to be legalists . <p> The second mechanism derives from the norm of reciprocity for the provision of public goods , which states that people tend to reciprocate for the allowances that they receive . Reciprocity in taxes , however , has not been well specified or convincingly tested . My results suggest that , far from being free riders , most individuals tend to cooperate when they receive allowances in return for their contributions . Whether the political system fairly redistributes tax revenues affects tax behavior , because when people receive public goods , they reciprocate with better compliance . Underlying this mechanism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates horizontally : temptations to free ride can be overcome when individuals believe that other taxpayers are overcoming them . <p> The third mechanism is the lasting effect of enforcement . Individuals make choices based on default rules , which are heavily dictated by perceptions regarding the effect of sanctions , and they are strongly influenced by what they experience or learn from others regarding the effectiveness of tax-law enforcement . Both positive and negative experiences with enforcement have a lasting effect . Taxpayers caught cheating at an early stage assign higher detection capacity to their tax administrations than do those who are never caught . Effective enforcement has a strong evolutionary component , and it is particularly crucial that enforcement be strong at the outset or enactment of any law ( I call this " norm-emerging enforcement " ) . To the extent that citizens perceive that the state is effective in curtailing free riders , they tend to obey the law . This has an enduring effect that allows the tax agency to concentrate its resources on fewer tax evaders , get good results from its enforcement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm-maintenance enforcement " ) . Whereas good , norm-emerging enforcement enhances a self-sustaining equilibrium of compliance , poor enforcement at earlier stages weakens the enforcement capacities of the norm , forging a noncompliance equilibrium . <p> The State and the Rule of Law <p> The erosion of the states enforcement capacities is a sign of its weakness . My analysis of tax behavior and of the rulers inability to curtail free riding sheds light on a broader problem : the weakness of the state and of the rule of law in Latin America . I do not attempt in this book to present a complete theory on this important topic . I do contribute to the understanding of state weakness , however , by providing a conceptual approach to ascertain the nature of certain institutional deficiencies . In appendix D , I provide some reflections that transcend the realm of taxes and consider legal failure in general , a key issue in contemporary Latin America . <p> The recent growing interest in the rule of law has centered on why rulers decide to abide by laws and not transgress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Przeworski 2003 ; Shapiro 1994 ; Weingast 1997 ) . This is , however , an incomplete line of inquiry , because why rulers rule is no more important than why the ruled consent ( Barzel 2002 ) . There is no rule of law if people do not abide by the norms , and there is a latent trade-off between the legitimacy of the norm and the perceived sanctioning capacity of the enforcer . Both the carrot and the stick are needed , but the relative inverse importance of each will dictate the type of policy needed to ensure compliance . <p> As I will argue , the rule of law fosters environments of compliance where rational individuals have a predisposition to comply , because under these equilibria the payoffs of cooperation are perceived as higher from the inception . Compliance environments enable the promotion of fairness and citizenship , which are crucial for reproducing initial compliance equilibria . Therefore , under the rule of law , people perceive that they are more likely to maximize their benefits than they would be otherwise . Countries able to establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those that are not . I maintain that the establishment of the rule of law is a precondition for reducing tax evasion . <p> Given the limited effect of enforcement under noncompliance equilibria , I also argue that governments are better off when they enact a few enforceable taxes than when they enact a variety of taxes that are difficult to collect . Simplicity serves the tax administration . When tax evasion is high , the goal of government should be to reverse the equilibrium , because only a compliant environment produces steady , high revenues . The actions of governments in many underdeveloped countries have been precisely the opposite : to address mounting deficits , most Latin American states levy taxes that quickly became widely evaded , fostering a higher perception of noncompliance . Because populist governments incur larger social expenditures in noncompliance environments , it is more difficult for them to enable a compliance equilibrium . This produces a circular crisis of fiscal deficit , thus prompting the passage of more unenforceable laws . Conversely , minimalist states that are capable of enforcing a few important laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The rule of law depends ultimately on the strength of the state . I claim that we must transcend the narrow approach that conceives of states as a set of predatory rulers that successfully extract revenues from individuals in exchange for security and other services . This is more accurately a theory of government . In this book , the state is construed as set of organizations that operate under and are constrained by certain rules or institutions . In this sense , enforcement agencies are much more than a set of organizations with technical capabilities . Given the type of equilibria in which states operate , enforcement agencies affect the development of rules of law . Rulers in Argentina might want to raise more revenue through taxation and invest heavily in tax administration capacities , but the type of institutions in place constrain their ability to do so . In short , the rule of law depends on strong states , and strong states depend on the type of institutions that gave rise to them and shape them continuously . Successful states are those that , taking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> &lt;strong&gt;On Data and Method&lt;/strong&gt; <p> Most studies of compliance in developing countries use aggregate indicators . Such data can not successfully test individual behavior , nor can it identify the conditions and mechanisms that lead to decisions about law abidance . This book , by contrast , studies taxpayer behavior using individual data collected systematically for this purpose . <p> The empirical study of tax compliance is cumbersome because individual-level data is very difficult to collect . Most government agencies are reluctant or legally unable to allow research on individual tax returns . Even when such information becomes available , it is usually impossible to create data sets that also include individual tastes and preferences , which are needed to explain tax behavior . Therefore , most studies are based on aggregate data and self-reports , which present problems of validity and reliability . <p> In order to provide satisfactory answers to my research questions , I assembled a completely new database drawn from specially requested tax information and newly designed surveys . This data consists of six different surveys conducted in the late 1990s , four in Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted one survey among general taxpayers and another among the recently audited . In addition , for Argentina I conducted similar surveys with tax officials and tax auditors . The tax-return data I collected consists of the individual tax reports of fifteen thousand taxpayers from periods before and after enforcement measures were taken against them . These randomly selected cases have matching control groups . I also conducted an experimental study to test hypotheses about the effect of enforcement on both individual consent and the social mechanisms of compliance . I present further explanations of the data in appendix A. <p> The evidence in the chapters is usually presented very directly and clearly in the form of graphs and tables . I sacrifice in-depth statistical analysis in favor of simplicity , fluidity , and a less technical presentation . Only four simple , multivariate models are included ; readers unfamiliar with regression analysis can skip them without missing the core of the argument . The broad evidence is compelling and speaks for itself . <p> Comparison in taxation is difficult because differences between countries and economies cause problems of interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the logic of the most alike cases . As mentioned above , Chile and Argentina are very good candidates for a systematic comparative analysis , both in terms of their tax structure and their political and economic makeup . <p> **37;810;TOOLONG <p> The first and last chapters encompass broad conceptualizations of law abidance under adverse conditions . Chapter 1 develops the necessary theoretical repertoire for the rest of the book . I explain the merits of the two-equilibria approach , and I systematically discuss the role of enforcement in enhancing compliance through a model that integrates the role of culture , individual costs , and legitimacy . I further examine some of these ideas in appendix B , using simple game situations to explain the logic of my arguments . In appendix C , I use a simulative evolutionary game to explain the joint evolution of enforcement and compliance culture . I demonstrate that enforcement at the emergence stage of the norm , as well as the initial acceptance of the law , matters greatly in later rounds . This evolutionary approach shows that equilibria tend to stabilize under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent individual enforcement is meager . Enforcement has a cumulative effect . <p> Chapter 2 presents a comparative empirical assessment of tax compliance in Argentina and Chile , including some glimpses at other countries . This chapter lays the groundwork for subsequent analysis by defining and measuring the dependent variable . I present estimates for the magnitude of tax evasion , and I develop a set of methods to assess voluntary compliance with the VAT for Argentina and Chile . <p> In chapters 3-7 , I develop a detailed , evidence-driven analysis of tax compliance based on surveys , tax returns , and quasi-experimental data . Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 examine the successes and limitations of enforcement efforts . I analyze data from surveys , courts , and individual tax returns , and I offer disaggregate and self-reported data on this subject for the first time . In chapter 3 , I describe the similarities in the enforcement capacities of Chile and Argentina , and I demonstrate that the certainty of detection in the latter country is perceived as very weak , contributing to greater tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax reforms . Conversely , Chilean taxpayers believe that the tax administration has larger capabilities to detect significant tax evasion . It should be noted that tax-enforcement capacities are similar , although perceptions in both countries differ . <p> Chapter 4 examines the role of sanctions and their impact on tax evasion in an entire populationthat is , their effectiveness as a form of general deterrence . For Argentina , I analyze the effects of penal-prosecution policies , concluding that the criminalization of tax evasion has had very limited results . In the case of Chile , I analyze administrative sanctions and show that they are much more effective in enhancing voluntary compliance . For both countries , I present self-reported data regarding individual assessments of the perceived severity of punishment for tax fraud , and I address problems of institutional coordination . I conclude that the key for effective sanctions is the high probability of their imposition . Impunity is perceived as very high in Argentina , leading to high tax evasion . <p> Chapter 5 undertakes an empirical analysis of individual tax-return data to answer the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enforcement as a form of specific deterrence . I examine the effects of three measures : audits , closure of businesses , and invoicing requirements . The effect of individual enforcement in eliciting future individual compliance is meager in Chile and totally ineffective in Argentina . I conclude that deterrence becomes a tautology : reforms fail because detection of evasion is weak , and detection of evasion is weak because enforcement lags behind noncompliance . Taken together , chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 demonstrate that enforcement yields better results in promoting general deterrence than particular deterrence does , because taxpayers under compliance equilibria believe that cheaters are more likely to be caughtcheaters , rooted in noncompliance practices , very rarely change . <p> Chapter 6 turns to an investigation of the role of culture and social norms in eliciting compliance behavior . I analyze the role of trust , reciprocity , moral obligation , and dutyas well as the role of inhibitors such as shame and guiltin the formation of subjective perceptions of the effectiveness of detection and punishment for tax fraud . I pay particular attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to provide a culturally contextualized explanation of the way that societies come to recognize the significance of compliance in social cooperative endeavors . <p> Chapter 7 presents the results of an experiment conducted with students in both countries to evaluate the effect of social and economic variables on compliance . I describe the basic mechanisms that account for differences in individual compliance . This evidence allows me to speculate on how preferences are formed in relation to tax evasion . <p> The final chapter summarizes the arguments and extends them into guiding principles for policy prescriptions . These concluding remarks have broader implications for the study of law , politics , and the successful emergence of compliance environments . Along those same lines , appendix D examines the conditions for the establishment of the rule of law , represented by the lively image of compliance equilibria .

Bringing together scholars from the disciplines of philosophy , history , political theory , and English literature who embrace diverse theoretical and philosophical approaches and a range of feminist perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hobbes scholars and nonspecialists alike . <p> As a theorist whose trademark is a compelling argument for absolute sovereignty , Hobbes may seem initially to have little to offer twenty-first-century feminist thought . Yet , as the contributors to this collection demonstrate , Hobbesian political thought provides fertile ground for feminist inquiry . Indeed , in engaging Hobbes , feminist theory engages with what is perhaps the clearest and most influential articulation of the foundational concepts and ideas associated with modernity : freedom , equality , human nature , authority , consent , coercion , political obligation , and citizenship . <p> The very idea of a volume of feminist essays on Hobbes may seem at first glance to be puzzling , if not futile . As a theorist whose trademark is a relentlessly logical argument for absolute sovereignty , Hobbes may seem initially to have little to offer twenty-first-century feminist thought . Hobbes makes few references to women throughout his corpus , being explicitly concerned with political power , whichin seventeenth-century England , a period in which Elizabeths recent reign was fodder for a burgeoning literature on patriarchal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . Unlike Locke , who explicitly recognized womens entitlement to authority and respect in the bourgeois family ( and explicitly recognized their need to work in poor families ) , Hobbess comments on women , sex , and the family are scant . Readers of Hobbes might interpret his remarks on gender as offhand , made in passing as he moves through " larger " arguments about power , freedom , and order . <p> Further , Hobbes is often cast as the founding figure of a rationalist hyperindividualistic political vision that is inimical to a twentieth- and twenty-first-century feminism committed to democracy , participation , and mutual relations of care and community . Consider , for example , Jean Bethke Elshtains early characterization in Public Man , Private Woman in 1981 : " If Hobbess epistemology is methodological individualism , his ontology is abstract individualism . " This understanding of Hobbes dominated feminist interpretations ; as Christine Di Stefano noted in her influential Configurations of Masculinity , Hobbess ontology demonstrated a " distinctively modern masculinist orientation to the realm of social life . " <p> Yet despite Hobbess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldor possibly because of ithe has held a fascination for feminists since the early days of feminist political thought . This is especially evident in Teresa Brennan and Carole Patemans " Mere Auxiliaries to the Commonwealth : Women and the Origins of Liberalism " ( 1979 ) and in Patemans later work The Sexual Contract ( 1988 ) , both of which pay particular attention to Hobbes as a figure relevant to unpacking the politics of gender , sex , and the family . At the same time , however , Hobbes has been undertreated in the history of feminist thought . None of the other early feminist classics treat Hobbes as significant enough to warrant a separate chapter . From Susan Moller Okins Women in Western Political Thought and Lorenne Clark and Lynda Langes The Sexism of Social and Political Theory , to Elshtains Public Man , Private Woman and Zillah Eisensteins The Radical Future of Liberal Feminism , Hobbess work only merits a few pages . <p> Did early feminists not deem his thought patriarchal enough to require deeper investigation ? Or did they perhaps think that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation would be fruitless ? Our contributors show that the exercise of unpacking Hobbess assumptions about gender is worth the trouble . But the dearth of feminist analysis of Hobbes is also a product of his larger reception in political thought . In his book Hobbes : A Very Short Introduction , Richard Tuck suggests that Hobbes is the most undertreated of great Western thinkersnot just by feminists , but by historians of political thought of all stripes . As unbelievable as this might seem , especially in light of his frequent designation as the greatest philosopher in the English language , it may be that Hobbess status as a theorist of absolute power writing at the outset of more liberal and , later , democratic ideas about politics has contributed to this eclipse . <p> As we endeavor to give Hobbes his due , as well as to acknowledge a huge debt to some of the important ground broken by the early feminist interpretations , this volume of feminist interpretations seeks to investigate more deeply what his significance for feminism might be . Ranging from an argument that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern abortion rights , to a radical and libertarian theory of sexuality , to an understanding of the will and consent that choice feminism can deploy , to a portrayal of the powerful mother in the state of nature who becomes an outcast in civil society like the she-wolf displaced by the swineherd , feminists have plumbed a rich trove of possibility from the brilliant writings of the man from Malmesbury . This is a Hobbes who will excite some readers , horrify others , but hopefully challenge all . <p> Most emphatically , there is no " straw Hobbes " here , no caricatured picture of Hobbes as theorizing the " atomistic individualism , " " possessive individualism , " or " abstract individualism " of which feminists were enamored in the 1970s and 1980s ; there is no reductionist Hobbesian man incapable of relationship , peace , or love . Rather , emerging from this collection is a picture of Hobbes that is , on the one hand , nuanced and complex , and , on the other , potentially surprising for readers , feminist and nonfeminist alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobbess political thought and legacy , and each reveals a dimension or aspect of the man and his thought that broadens and renders more nuanced our overall image . As a result , we present a collection of essays , almost all original to this volume , that we hope will be of interest to a wide audience , from political theorists to specialists in early modern intellectual history and philosophy , and from feminist political theorists and philosophers , some of whom have been interested in Hobbes and others not , to Hobbes specialists , some of whom have been interested in questions of gender and others perhaps not . And like the diversity of these essays , the authors included here represent a range of disciplines , including philosophy , political science , English literature , and historyan interdisciplinarity needed to obtain the complex portrait of Hobbes that we sought . <p> Indeed , the diverse contributors to this volume demonstrate that Hobbesian political thought provides fertile ground for feminist inquiry . It is fertile in that , in engaging Hobbes , feminist theory engages with what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts and ideas of modernity : freedom , equality , human nature , authority , consent , coercion , political obligation , gratitude , and citizenship . Hobbess rigorous and provocative interpretation and analysis of these concepts are distinctive in the modern canon , demanding the attention not only of his contemporaries but of twenty-first-century scholars as well . Certainly , other political theorists have had more to say on the subject of women ; for example , Aristotles theory of the household in Politics offered considerable material for feminists to chew on , as unpalatable as it may taste to feminists today . Rousseau devoted entire chapters , such as " Sophie , or the Woman " in Emile , and even entire books , such as Julie , or The New Heloise , to commentary on women , sexuality , and the familybut again , putting forth views that arguably make him the figure whom feminists most love to hate . This certainly could explain why volumes on these figures appeared much sooner in the Re-reading the Canon series than the present Hobbes volume . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the relatively few thinkers in the canon of Western political philosophy who entertained the idea that womens subordinate position might be the result of convention rather than nature . While we would be overstating the case if we concluded that Hobbes was a feminist any more than was Plato , Hobbess ability to consider the issue of human equality in a non-gender-specific way is a significant starting point for feminist analysis . <p> Hobbess political writing is fertile ground for another reason as well . Hobbes is not only a foundational thinker but also an immensely creative and rhetorically skillful one . Since the work of Quentin Skinner , David Johnston , Richard Tuck , and others , gone is the acceptance of the earlier commonplace view of Hobbes as only interested in rational argumentation or a science of politics . Why do we still read and debate chapter 13 of Leviathan if not for Hobbess ability to create a lasting image of the state of nature as " solitary , poore , nasty , brutish , and short " ? In the passages in which he recounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would keep the male issue , and in those in which he writes of queens and describes powerful mothers as the " lords " of their children , are many possible references , meanings , and intentions , all ripe for feminist assessment and evaluation . Thus , we believe that Hobbes does have something quite valuable to offer twenty-first-century feminism , even if it is not a progressive theory in support of womens liberation : at his best , he offers a vision of strong , powerful women who can contract with men , raise children independently ( maternity being the first political right ) , and protect their own interests in the state of nature . At the very least , he offers an opportunity to engage and analyze some of the most provocative , problematic , and challenging arguments of Western modernity concerning the place of women in the familywhich , admittedly , are highly ambiguousand the meaning of gender itself . <p> As the first collection of essays dedicated exclusively to feminist interpretation of Hobbes , this volume is meant to redress his frequent absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far the enterprise of feminist political theory has come , from posing the initial questions about womens absence from political texts , and mining the brief references to women in those texts , to querying a whole range of other issues , such as : What are the gendered implications and legacies of Hobbess political thought , especially his ideas of the citizen , the commonwealth , freedom , equality , and the social contract ? What women did Hobbes have in mind when he wrote about Amazons and queens , and what powerful women did he encounter who might have influenced his thinking ? Also , were there women writers and thinkers whom Hobbes might have seen as interlocutors but whom we have written out of intellectual history and especially the history of political thought ? By asking different questions of Hobbes , feminist political theory shows its maturity and generates a range of different answers , not all of which can be fully reconciled . <p> Thus , we make no claims to presenting a unified image of Hobbes in the way that Hobbes sought a unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be all of the things our contributors say he is at one and the same time : Can he be a political theorist interested in forging bonds of community , as some contributors suggest , while also seeking to close opportunities for resistance , as others assert ? Can his arguments open avenues for libertarian sexuality , as some provocatively demonstrate , while also using the concept of gratitude to suggest that subjects owe the sovereign their obedience because they owe him or her their lives , as others argue ? Yet what we are sure of is that each of these authors stakes out a strong theoretical position that is worthy of exploration and that leads us down fruitful paths of interpretation . <p> The volume opens with a conversation between two centrally important interpreters : Carole Pateman and Quentin Skinner . Among feminist interpretations of Hobbes and other canonical " fathers , " Patemans is the most influential in drawing attention to the ellipses in Hobbess thought with respect to gender . Hobbes is notorious for his rather unconventional suggestion of womens and mens equality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly left behind once he makes his case for the necessity of the social contract . In The Sexual Contract , as well as in her article " God Hath Ordained to Man a Helper , " Pateman argued that Hobbes retained some aspects of patriarchalism in his political thought while eschewing others , and that the social contract was preceded by a hidden sexual contract that subordinated all women to all men . Patemans reading of Hobbes exposed the ways in which political theorists arguments about vital concepts , such as freedom and citizenship , are embedded with assumptions about gender and womens statusassumptions that will remain invisible unless they are deliberately drawn out . The Sexual Contract also opened the door for broader feminist inquiry into social contract theory itself ( as well as influencing critical race theory , such as Charles Millss The Racial Contract ) and led feminists to take notice of this important device as a mechanism of patriarchal thinking . Indeed , virtually all contemporary feminist interpretations of social contract theory and of Hobbeseven those that question her approach or conclusionsbuild upon the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives to bear on Hobbess texts . <p> Approaching Hobbess texts from a different angle and with a different set of interests and questions is Quentin Skinner , the leading thinker of what can loosely be called the " Cambridge school . " If we are to truly understand Hobbes , according to Skinner , we must see him as a writer engaged in a political conversation with his mid-seventeenth-century Civil War contemporaries , using the terms and language available to him in the period . For Skinner and other historical interpreters of Hobbes , what matters most is understanding how Hobbes saw his own enterprise , uncovering , to the extent possible , what his own intentions and motivations might have been . It is this approach that has guided Skinners most important works on Hobbes , and the results of this approach have fundamentally changed the dominant reading of Hobbes . Far from being a straightforward apologist for bourgeois property relations , or a cold rationalist or international realist , Hobbes was a writer equipped with the tools of a Renaissance humanisttools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not more so , in the effort to persuade his contemporaries about his theory of politics . Just as Pateman initiated new discoveries with regard to the political significance of social contract theory , Skinner has given us a new sense of Hobbes the man and the writer , one far more nuanced and interesting than was evident previously . <p> Although these two illustrious scholars of political thought engaged in a critical exchange on democratic theory of the 1960s and early 1970s in the journal Political Theory in 1973 and 1974 , they have never dialogued in this manner about Hobbes . In their conversation here , Pateman and Skinner highlight what are , from their perspectives , the central problems to be addressed . For Pateman , it is most important to shine a bright light on " aspects of Hobbess argument that are typically glossed over " in traditional analysis , while for Skinner the central need is to " treat individual texts essentially as contributions " to " some preexisting tradition of discussion and debate . " One of the reasons we proposed this conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the so-called Cambridge schoolhave not generally intersected . Indeed , the approach to reading historical texts that has most influenced Patemana combination of the analytical and neo-Marxist approach evidenced by C. B. Macphersonis the very approach with which Skinners earliest work on Hobbes took issue . Like other historians of political thought , Skinner was concerned about anachronistic readings of Hobbes that had him responding to and thinking about things well outside his field of vision . Patemans forward-looking conclusions , that Hobbes remained committed to a modern form of fraternal patriarchy even as he did away with the older , paternal variant , are bound to be in tension with Skinners , since the historical sensitivity associated with the Cambridge school prevents consideration of a seventeenth-century theorist through twenty-first-century lenses . <p> This conversation is one we find valuable and remarkable on several levels . The differences not only between the two schools represented , but also between our respondents respective disciplines of political science and history , mark various productive tensions about the roles , place , and even possibility of feminism in the history of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming more attuned to gender , as Skinner claims , and is there more of an accepted background assumption that gender matters ? Or are the majority of scholars still tone-deaf to feminist arguments about the centrality of gender , as Pateman claims ? How do answers to those questions differ by disciplinary norms of history , political science , philosophy , and literatureall represented in this volume ? What are the best approaches to take for those interested in questions of gender in canonical figures ? How should we combine the attention to context that Skinner urges with the attention to the logic of the argument that Pateman insists on , when it seems that these different approaches reveal different interpretations of the place of gender in canonical texts ? <p> In terms of Hobbes interpretation specifically , the dialogue leads to additional challenging questions : Is all feminist interpretation of Hobbes historically anachronistic because it considers the role of gender , a concept unfamiliar to seventeenth-century writers ? Does adherence to a historical reading risk overlooking important power dynamics at work , dynamics that may remain invisible unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How are Hobbess patriarchalist aspects to be measured against his gender-egalitarian ones ? Are these two approaches represented by Patemans and Skinners work immiscible , or the source of some productive tensions ? We ourselves found the interaction to offer fascinating insights into possibilities for both feminist and historical interpretation , Hobbesian analysis , and political theory more generally . In discussing these different approaches explicitly , we gain greater insight into each of them and have opportunities to see areas of overlapping interest , including a consideration of how Hobbes viewed the gender of sovereignty , the significance of his concept of the family , the impact of our increasing awareness of seventeenth-century women political writers on the enterprise of Hobbes interpretation , and , finally , the future of Hobbesian interpretation and his ongoing relevance to the politics of the twenty-first century . As the interviewers and editors , we chose to edit this conversation as little as possible in the hope that the reader will enjoy seeing firsthand what these two important intellectuals had to say to each other , in an effort to preserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave openings to provoke further thinking . <p> The essays that follow this interview explore a wide range of approaches and substantive topics that reflect the changes that have taken place in feminist re-readings of the canon and particularly of Hobbes . Building upon this conversation and especially upon the classic questions posed by both Patemans and Skinners work , the first section of essays focuses on some of the key concepts of political theory , such as sovereignty and the meaning of commonwealth , as well as womens absence from civil society , but with some significant differences . Sharon Lloyds essay begins by posing the question that confronts all feminists reading Hobbes : Did women freely consent to their own subordination and , if so , why ? This question was , of course , the animating source of Patemans ( and before that , Brennan and Patemans ) earlier work , but Lloyds essay will give the reader who is unfamiliar with feminism a good introduction to many of the central issues that feminists have highlighted over the past several decades and will set the stage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of Hobbess use of gender but , in contrast to many earlier feminist analyses of Hobbes , posits that there is nothing inherently misogynistic about his concepts or thoughtalthough she does find evidence of a stowaway sexism . What Lloyd calls her " just so " analysis centers on the working of power in Hobbess thought ; she argues that there may be enough small differences of power and strength between the sexes , which , when added up , create an even larger gulf and cause women to enter into pre-civil contracts to ensure their own survival . Yet Lloyds conclusion is not Patemans , and she is clear that there is nothing in Hobbes that necessitates that things move in favor of institutionalized patriarchyit might have gone the other way , maybe even toward matriarchy . <p> Jane Jaquette takes up similar themes of exploring the degree to which patriarchy is inevitable for Hobbes , or just happenstance , and she writes in a similar , if more provocative , vein of trying to recuperate a more sympathetic reading of Hobbes out of the standard observations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual historians , and philosophers would not consider Hobbes a liberal , given his advocacy of absolute authority , and many feminists reject both Hobbes and liberalism as not adequately serving the interests of women . In contrast to Elshtain and others , however , Jaquette positions Hobbes as an important contributor to liberalism and thereby to contemporary liberal feminism . Jaquette wishes " to defend the core liberal values present in Hobbes " and urges feminism to come to terms with the debt it owes him , to discover how it depends on liberal political values . Critiquing " radical " feminist interpretations of Hobbesreadings that throw out the baby of freedom , equality , and individual choice with the bathwater of abstract individualism , authoritarian patriarchalism , and the natural subordination of womenshe seeks to develop a reading of Hobbes that can be useful for feminists of the twenty-first century . <p> By contrast , drawing on Skinners discussion of the gender neutrality of sovereignty , a topic that surfaces in the conversation between Pateman and Skinner , Su Fang Ng considers what she calls its " bestial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either Lloyd or Jaquette . Hobbess portrayal of the original sovereignty of mothers in the state of nature , she suggests , is influenced by the myth of the suckling she-wolf who becomes an important marker of the boundary between the natural and civil states . In a parallel move , she argues , the state itself becomes ungendered and women are excluded from it . This creates more than just an ambiguity about womens place in Hobbess theory ; it shows that gender both underwrites and threatens incoherence for the Hobbesian statewhich may be why Hobbess consideration of women is not explicitly elaborated in his text but is instead buried inside other stories , leaving todays feminist scholars to unearth and decipher it . Yet , Ngs conclusions nevertheless leave spaces for an optimistic reading ; specifically , she suggests that Hobbes finds gendered forms of sovereignty to be primitive , and that in degendering political right , Hobbes " leaves room for new forms of civil engagement by men or women . " <p> The second section of the volume in many ways contributes to the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As influential for feminist scholarship on Hobbes as was The Sexual Contract is the early work of Gordon Schochet , whose groundbreaking essay on Hobbes , patriarchalism , and the family is included here . " Thomas Hobbes on the Family and the State of Nature " appeared in Political Science Quarterly in 1967before " feminist theory " was even a bona fide subfield in the academy . It was subsequently included as a chapter in his equally groundbreaking book Patriarchalism in Political Thought . Schochet himself , of course , did not write this piece as a work in feminist theory ; as Nancy Hirschmann points out in her commentary on the essay , Schochet did not have specifically feminist questions in mind when he first plumbed Hobbess thought on the family . But his work nevertheless led feminists down the important road of investigating what Hobbes was trying to do with his familial analogy . Influenced by , but not wedded to , the methodologies of historical interpretation , he is cited in many early feminist interpretations of Hobbes , including Patemans The Problem of Political Obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as significant journal articles by feminist scholars such as Elizabeth Fox Genovese , Mary Shanley , Virginia Sapiro , Ruth Bloch , and Ruth Perry . Acting as a bridge between these different approaches within political thought , Schochets essay is also important for having raised the issue of patriarchalism and the role of the family among a generation of Hobbes scholars who paid these issues little attention . In later work , Schochet went on to address more explicitly the gendered dimensions of Filmers and Lockes thought and the " significant sounds of silence " surrounding the gender questionsounds that get replicated in the work of historians of political thought as well . For all these reasons , it is fitting to include this original essay that influenced and indeed arguably motivated decades of feminist analysis . <p> In her chapter , Hirschmann links Schochets earlier essay with his more recent work through the concept of gratitude . Gratitude is Hobbess fourth law of nature , but as such it has received much less attention than Schochet and Hirschmann believe it deserves . Hirschmann takes Schochets original essay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer to more explicitly feminist interests , including the question of what happens to women once the civil contract is in place and why . Hirschmann and Schochet agree that gratitude is the " linchpin of Hobbess theory " and that the family serves as a foundation for the state , but Hirschmann argues , against both Schochet and Pateman , that marriage does not precede but rather follows the social contract . If Schochet and thereby Pateman are correct that marriage does precede the social contract , then the only possible explanation for womens ultimate subordination in civil society must stem from their gratitude toward men who spared their lives in the state of nature . Hirschmann finds this possibility useful for its explanatory ability , but ultimately problematic for a feminist recuperation of Hobbes . <p> Taking up the current scholarly interest in womens political thought , the third section of the book includes three essays dealing with Hobbes and the historical women who read and responded to him . Signaling an important development in feminist political theory , this scholarly trajectory is guided by the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only authoritative sources on key political issues facing all human beings . Although feminists have long understood women to be active political subjects , and have demonstrated how women have exercised political agency throughout history and into the present , the move to integrate womens writings on politics into the history of ideas has been slow to follow . The essays in this section survey three women whose critiques of and responses to Hobbes resonate nicely with later feminist analysis : Margaret Cavendish ( 16231673 ) , Mary Astell ( 16661731 ) , and Catharine Macaulay ( 17311791 ) . <p> In the first of these chapters , Karen Detlefsen considers the one woman philosopher and writer who knew and conversed with Hobbes , even if it was only because of her marriage to one of Hobbess patrons , William Cavendish , Duke of Newcastle . Margaret Cavendish had direct access to the most learned circle of individuals in the seventeenth century , which included figures such as Descartes , Gassendi , and Hobbes . There is immense scholarly interest in Cavendish today , primarily among literary historians but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , an examination of Cavendishs and Hobbess mutual intellectual influence and relationship has potential to yield a different kind of feminist interpretation of Hobbes . As Williams friend , employee , and interlocutor , Hobbes spent time in the Cavendish household but likely exchanged little in the way of conversation with Margaret . As she put it , " I never spake with Master Hobbes twenty words in my life . " This is in no way surprising since women in the seventeenth century were not supposed to be the intellectual equals of men and were often limited by their inability to understand or read Latin ; and Cavendish , by her own account , was reserved and shy around people outside her immediate family . Cavendish might have caught more of the male conversations than she let on , however , for according to Detlefsen , Cavendishs thoughts on freedom were in direct response to Hobbes , and they offer a " proto-feminist " conception of freedom and the individual . Detlefsen treats Cavendishs plays as relevant texts of political philosophy , particularly revealing Cavendishs theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify her interpretation . She thereby shows that whereas Hobbess theory takes a strong individualist view , as has been argued and documented by many scholars of Hobbes , Cavendish assumes a more social individual , one who " freely chooses to pursue actions conceived of in terms of how the agent relates to others , close and distant , " in keeping with twentieth- and twenty-first-century feminist accounts of " relational autonomy . " Yet her account of free will is much more robust than that of Hobbes , who reduced will to desire and saw it paradoxically entwined with necessity . Detlefsen maintains that Cavendish " provides a view of womens freedom that escapes some of the less advantageous aspects of Hobbess own view . " <p> Drawing on the ideas of both Mary Astell and Catharine Macaulay as early and cogent critics of Hobbess social contract theory , Karen Green , like Jane Jaquette , questions the tendency of contemporary feminists to dismiss liberalism as having no value for the feminist project . But in contrast to Jaquette , Greens intent is not to defend Hobbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two . Green posits the need to look beyond Hobbes to a broader tradition of women intellectuals who contributed vitally to the foundation of liberal democracy . For example , neither an advocate of rights nor an easy figure for feminists to celebrate , Astell anticipated later feminist critiques of Hobbes by questioning his portrayal of human beings as perfectly autonomous in the state of nature as well as his equation of consent and coercion . In looking back to womens political thought , Green makes a case for a more complex understanding of the roots of liberalism as lying especially in the eighteenth-century republican ideas of Macaulay . In her little-known Treatise on the Immutability of Moral Truth , Macaulay offers a non-Hobbesian argument for a social contract between the people and their rulers based not on consent but on trust . Keeping alive a negative reading of Hobbes for his " egoistic , instrumental rationality , " Greens chapter encourages feminist readers to like Hobbes less while perhaps liking liberalism a little bit more . <p> Wendy Gunther-Canadas chapter continues the conversation on Hobbes with both Pateman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreter who offers her own " challenge to the metanarrative of patriarchy in early modern political thought . " Gunther-Canada draws our attention to the historical antecedents to Patemans critique of Hobbes : in her Loose Remarks on Hobbes , Macaulay had also noted the convoluted dimensions to Hobbess patriarchalism . Cleaving more to the view of Hobbes as a rational individualist thinker , this chapter develops a contrast between what Gunther-Canada calls the calculus of force , which lies behind Hobbess social contract , and the calculation of care , which she sees lying behind Macaulays contractual vision . The contrast between force and care that Gunther-Canada identifies is , indeed , evident in a number of the chapters in the present volume . <p> In the final section of the book , we move some distance away from questions that could have been of interest to Hobbes and more directly into the territory of feminisms current preoccupations . Of course , it can be a challenge bordering on anachronism to theorize about canonical thinkers in terms of issues that press on our contemporary political consciousness . Our students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have thought about the invasion of Iraq , or gay marriage , or other issues of twenty-first-century significance , and we often caution them about making conjectures on a theorists position on a problem he or she could never have even imagined , much less ever actually addressed . Yet feminist analysis is always concerned with issues facing the women of today , and the project of drawing lessons from the canonical thinkers in ways that may help us think through those issues is a valid and important one . Joanne Boucher and Joanne Wright are less concerned with what Hobbes would think about abortion or breast implants , but rather more with how feminist thinking about Hobbesian concepts and categories of analysis can help us , as twenty-first-century feminists , think about those issues . <p> Boucher locates Hobbess argument about self-defense as a potential source of support for abortion rights , noting that even though the sovereign has absolute authority , derived from his or her subjects consent , to make whatever laws he or she wantsincluding laws to outlaw abortionHobbes also allows that if such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . Since it is never in the sovereigns interest to create such conditions , the sovereign would likely permit abortion . Such a position has particular resonance for contemporary thinking about the Supreme Courts decision in Gonzales v. Carhart , which outlaws certain kinds of late-term abortionsspecifically , the " intact " D&amp;C , or " partial-birth " abortioneven though it is notably safer for the woman than the " standard " D&amp;C , which the court let stand and which requires the repeated insertion of sharp instruments into the womans vagina to dismember the fetus in utero , thus greatly increasing the chances of perforation , infection , and death . The courts romanticized concern with the potential well-being of a fetus at the expense of the actual well-being of the female citizen is one that Hobbes would have likely decried on grounds of consistency , if nothing else , since in either procedure the fetus is being killed . What seems more important to the court is the " gruesomeness " of what the male observer is obliged to see . Hobbesian thinking about the sovereigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they engage with womens status as citizens denied the rights of protection that the liberal state is supposed to provide . <p> Joanne Wright similarly takes up issues of immediate political concern for feminism : the rise of choice feminism and its defense of elective cosmetic surgery . In particular , she is interested in the legacy left to contemporary liberal society by Hobbess analysis of consent and the will . For his own political reasons , Hobbes was interested in decentering the problem of coercion and demonstrating through his materialist understanding of the will and freedom that all of our actions are voluntary and a direct reflection of our own will . Yet , from the beginning , feminism has sought to problematize such a collapse of consent and coercion and to show that , although women may appear to be consenting to the dictates of patriarchal society , their consent is underwritten by relations of power and oppression , and so should not necessarily be understood to be an accurate reflection of their abstract " free will . " To draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project of feminism . Yet this distinction has been all but abandoned in this new era of choice feminism , a feminism that is both liberal and Hobbesian in its celebration of choice as the benchmark of freedom , and which is used to justify womens participation in a pernicious " makeover " culture . <p> Susanne Sreedhar returns us to more traditional terrain of exegetical analysis of Hobbess texts , but by focusing on a topic that is central to twenty-first-century feminism , namely sex and sexuality . She mines Hobbess various remarks about sexuality , particularly his references to the Amazons , finding no normative basis for a specific sexual practice and no indication of his moral judgment on sex . Sreedhar uncovers evidence for a more positive vision of Hobbes than we might expect , as potentially sexually progressive and , reminiscent of Lloyds essay , as " neither irredeemably nor even consistently misogynistic . " Indeed , this is perhaps the most positive light cast on Hobbes in this volume . Yet Sreedhar is also mindful of the countervailing evidence for such a portrayal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , Hobbes would have no quarrel with any positive law that severely limits sexual freedoma fear linking Sreedhars and Bouchers chapters and echoed in Hirschmanns suggestion about how patriarchy comes to be . Nor does Hobbes have any moral objection to sexual coercion , for , as we have seen , he strategically blurs the distinction between consent and coercion . Thus , once again , a nuanced understanding is called for , one that sees Hobbess writingsat least in this respectas potentially but not necessarily an ally to feminism . <p> Indeed , a multilayered reading is what we hope to have achieved in this volume . If readers come away from these essays with a more complicated vision of what Hobbes has to offer , on the one hand , and the multiple ways in which feminists can read , interpret , and use Hobbess texts and ideas , on the other , we will consider the exercise of Feminist Interpretations of Thomas Hobbes a success . Of course , there may be no clear answer to the question of what exactly Hobbes offers to feminism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminist critique of his system of thought is deepened . But what is clear is that there is something to be gained in engaging with Hobbes , on his own terms as well as on ours , as we continue the process of clarifying and analyzing feminist priorities .

Maya Accounts 60008 @qwx470008 <p> Index <p> 1 The Invasions of Guatemala <p> In the autumn of 1509 , the two rulers of the small Kaqchikel Maya kingdom that lay among the mountains of southern Guatemala " received the Yakis of Culhuacan , as guests . " Culhuacan is in the Valley of Mexico ; these guests , whom we would call Aztecs , had come from their vast imperial capital of Tenochtitlan . As the Kaqchikels observed in their own chronicle of their kingdoms history , " On the day 1 Toh the Yakis arrived , the ambassadors of the lord Moteksumatzin Moctezuma , the lord of the Mexicas . And this we truly saw , when indeed the Yakis of Culhuacan arrived ; there were many Yakis who arrived , long ago , my sons , while our grandfathers were ruling . " <p> All these Aztec ( or , more properly , Mexica ) visitors comprised a diplomatic and trading embassy . They were clearly designed to impress upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor , perhaps as a prelude to an eventual incorporation into the empirebut the 1509 visitors were not an invasion force . Nor did one come in their wake . A decade passed , during which time the Mexica Empire continued its gradual expansion east toward the Maya kingdoms . This expansion was probably not of great concern to the Kaqchikel rulers , or to their neighbors , the Kiche Mayas . The frontier of Mexica control remained some distance from the Guatemalan highlands , buffered by several small city-states in between ( see Map 1 ) . <p> Furthermore , a busy trade route running from Tenochtitlan into the Guatemalan capital cities surely benefited the Maya elite and kept information flowing about the great empire to the west . Meanwhile , there were local distractions , especially as the Kiches and Kaqchikels continued periodically to wage war against each other . <p> But , had Maya rulers feared that one day the long-distance trade route would bring not merchants but tens of thousands of Mexica and other Nahua warriors , they could hardly have imagined the circumstances that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Kiche and Kaqchikel lords were probably not nervous in 1519 , when Moctezuma sent word of well-armed foreigners entering the Mexica Empire . And the Maya rulers may have sensed opportunity , rather than felt alarm , when in 1521 they learned of the destruction of Tenochtitlan by these new invaders . Nor were they likely to have made a connection between the arrival of the foreigners in Mexico and the epidemics of disease that swept through southern Guatemala in 1519 and 1520 . <p> Still , the balance of power in central Mexico had clearly shifted dramatically in 1521 . In response , both the Kiches and Kaqchikels sent ambassadors north to meet Hernando CortTs , the conqueror of the Mexica Empire . They met him in the Mexican town of Tuxpn in 1522 andaccording to CortTs himself " offered themselves as the subjects and vassals " of the Spanish king . The ambassadors returned to Guatemala with gifts and assurances from CortTs " that if they remained true to their promise they would be very well treated and honored by me and all my company " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native sources mention the Tuxpn meeting , so we can only guess at the intentions or actual statements made by the Maya ambassadors . But had their purpose truly and sincerely been to accept Spanish rule , the story might have ended thereor at least continued with a gradual and relatively uneventful incorporation of the Guatemalan highlands into the new empire ( as happened to the smaller Chontal Maya kingdom to the north ) . But that is not what happened . Instead , the rest of the 1520s brought unprecedented levels of mortality and destruction to the highlands ; the Mexicas and other Nahua warriors came after all , but as allies of the new invaders , whose repeated campaigns of conquest brought an end to the Kiche , Kaqchikel , and neighboring kingdoms . <p> This book is about those invasions . The remainder of this intro-ductory chapter briefly describes who the invaded Maya peoples were , outlines the Spanish campaigns and introduces their Spanish leaders , and explains how Nahuas and other native communities came to participate so heavily in the invasion . The chapters that follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mayas who lived in the sixteenth centurymany of them eye-witness participants in the war . <p> The Mayas of Highland Guatemala <p> The Kiches and Kaqchikels were among the heirs to the most accomplished civilization developed by native peoples in the Americas . We call this civilization " Maya , " although the term would not have meant anything to Mayas in Guatemala ( it was a Yucatec Maya word ) , and there was never a common sense of identity or political unity among all the various groups that we call Maya . At the time of the Spanish arrival , Maya civilization was thousands of years old . But although great cities and city-states had arisen and fallen in the past , there had never been a Maya empire , and in the sixteenth century Spaniards encountered only relatively small Maya kingdoms ( none remotely as large as the Mexica Empire to the west ) . <p> In the thirteenth century elite warrior families in the southern Maya area ( the region that is now highland Guatemala ) had begun to consolidate control over networks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling families were probably local , although like ruling dynasties throughout Mesoamericathey claimed descent from the rulers of an ancient city ( which may have been Tula or Teotihuacan in central Mexico , or ChichTn Itz in Yucatan , or more likely a mythical place inspired by these old cities ) . Whether real or legendary , the notion of invasion from the west by a new ruling elite was well established in highland Maya cultural traditions . <p> Early in the fifteenth century the Kiches founded a new capital of Utatln and began to expand at the expense of their neighbors ; in the words of the Popol Vuh ( or Popol Wuj , the great Kiche book of history and culture ) , " the grandeur and power of the sons of the Kiche grew , when they built the town of the ravines out of stone and mortar . " The most aggressive of the Kiche kings was Kiqab , who " made war on them , and certainly conquered the fields and towns of the people of Rabinal , the Kaqchikels , and the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the soldiers of Kiqab carried his arms to distant parts . " <p> Forging a small empire that stretched west across the highlands and south toward the coast of the Pacific Ocean , Kiqab led the Kiche kingdom to its zenith . But after Kiqabs death in the 1470s , the Kaqchikels rebelled against their status as subordinate allies and successfully founded an independent kingdom to the southeast , centered on a new capital city called Iximche . Repeated attempts to crush the revolt failed , and after the Kiches suffered a major defeat ( with their kings captured and sacrificed ) , the balance of power in the highlands shifted permanently . In the decades before the Spanish-Nahua invasion , the Kaqchikels steadily expanded into the valleys previously dominated by the Kiches ( with whom they continued to fight , defeating them again in 1510 , 1514 , and 1517 , according to the Kaqchikel chronicle ) . Indeed , only the arrival of Pedro and Jorge de Alvarado halted Kaqchikel momentum . <p> The area conquered by the Alvarado brothers was home not only to the Kiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The major groups were the Tzutujil Mayas in the area of Lake Atitln , the Mams in the west , the Poqomams in the east , and the Pipils to the south . Various versions of the invaders encounter with the Tzutujils and the Pipils are found in the accounts presented in Chapters 25 . In the words of the Kiches , commenting on the destruction of Guatemalas Maya kingdoms by the Spaniards and their allies , " they pushed aside all the settlements and fortified centers ; the Rabinal center was brought down ; the Cakchiquel , the Tuhaleb , the Cubulcaal , Cunen Cakquilah , Booh , the Choxanah Xhil people , the structures of the Tzitzol , " none was spared . <p> Pedro de Alvarados Invasion , 15241526 <p> In view of the history of Kiche-Kaqchikel relations in the half-century before the Spaniards landed in Mexico , it seems unlikely that CortTss account of the embassies sent to him by both Maya king-doms in 1522 tells the full or real story . Sixteenth-century Spaniards ( and historians of later centuries ) liked to imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culturally superior invader , but there is no evidence that Kiche and Kaqchikel leaders were in any way surprised or stunned into inaction . On the contrary , they were quick to take the political initiative and adopt multiple diplomatic and military strategies . The Maya envoys may indeed have sworn loyalty to the Spanish king in 1522 , but this embassy of apparent capitulation was surely a cover for a fact-finding mission ; the Mayas must have been keen to learn as much as they could about the Spaniards and their leader , and also to explore the possibility of an alliance that might allow them to defeat their high-land rivals once and for all . <p> Indeed , a follow-up embassy sent west by the Kaqchikels confirms this theory . This second embassy reached Soconusco in 1523 , where the Maya envoys met not with CortTs but with another Spaniard , Pedro de Alvarado . This Kaqchikel embassy was larger than the first , bringing with it gifts of gold , cacao , clothing , and other provisions , as well as a number of slaves ( probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed ) . We can only speculate as to Kaqchikel motives ; were they hoping to buy off the Spaniards and persuade them not to come to Guatemala , or did they aim to consolidate an anti-Kiche alliance ? <p> If their goal was to stop a Spanish visit , the effect of their second embassy was the opposite . CortTs had sent Pedro de Alvarado down to Soconusco " to learn the truth " about reports of Kaqchikels harassing locals in Soconusco and Chiapas " because they are our allies . " Alvarado seems to have read the mission in grander terms , however , persuading CortTs to support his plans for a full-scale conquest expedition into Guatemala . Alvarado had played a prominent role as one of the Spanish captains who had invaded Mexico in 1519 and destroyed the Mexica Empire . He had already acquired a reputation as a cruel and ambitious conquistador ( later rendered almost as a caricature by Las Casas ; see Chapter 3 below ) ; he now headed into Guatemala armed with an adelantado license , a royal permit to invade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . <p> Alvarado left Mexico City on December 6 , 1523 . His force had taken a while to assemble ; it was not huge , but substantial by the standards of the dayalthough its Spaniards were by far a minority within the entire expedition . Like all conquistadors in the great age of Spanish assaults on native America ( the 1490s to the 1550s ) , Pedro referred to his forces as a compafa , " company , " and to its Spanish members as compaeros , " companions " or " comrades " or even " partners , " as all were in a sense partners in a business venture , in which they had invested their lives and property , standing to lose or gain everything . <p> Conquest companies were often family affairs ( Francisco Pizarro took three of his four brothers with him when he invaded the Inca Empire ) , and the Alvarado company was no exception ; Pedros comrades included his three brothers and three cousins . One of the Alvarado brothers , Jorge , was later to play an even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we shall see . There were eight captains , consisting of Pedro himself ( the senior captain ) , his six relatives , and don Pedro Portocarrero ( mentioned in the second letter in Chapter 2 ) . CortTs and Bernal Dfaz both wrote that there were three hundred Spaniards on foot , and another 120 ( CortTss account ) or 135 ( Dfazs version ) on horseback . However , Pedros own letters suggest that there were fewer , perhaps as few as 250 Spanish compaeros in alla hundred of them with horses , the rest on foot . A Nahua warrior from Tlaxcala who participated in the invasion later claimed that there were only two hundred Spaniards . This would have been more than the Pizarro company that invaded Peru , but roughly the same size as CortTss original Spanish invasion force in Mexico , and considerably smaller than many later companiessuch as the one led into Colombia in the 1530s . <p> As was the case with most companies of the era , especially from the 1510s on , Spaniards did not fight alone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freemen , who were seldom mentioned in Spanish accounts ; we do not know how many fought in Guatemala in 1524 , but there were probably dozens . Spanish and black conquistadors alike were greatly outnumbered by native allies or , as Alvarado often calls them , Indios amigos nuestros ( our friendly Indians ) . Pedros pregnant Nahua wife , doa Luisa Xicotencatl ( from Tlaxcalas royal family ) , also came with him , but she was hardly the only Nahuatl speaker ; the bulk of Alvarados forces were Nahuas from central Mexicoat least three thousand of them . Nahua survivors testified that in addition to the thousands of Mexica , Tlaxcalan , Xochimilcan , and other Nahua warriors fighting with the Spaniards , Alvarado also picked up thousands of other native soldierssuch as Mixtecs and Zapotecs in the Oaxaca region as he traveled south toward Guatemala . <p> The expedition reached Tehuantepec in January 1524 ( from which Alvarado wrote to CortTs ) , and shortly afterward entered Soconusco ( where he wrote again ; both of these early letters are long lost ) . Thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexica sway and in 1524 was now loosely under Spanish control , but at the Samal River ( in what is today western Guatemala ) the company reached the Kiche frontier . As described by Alvarado , Bernal Dfaz , and other accounts presented in this book , it was here that Kiche warriors made the first of a series of fierce defensive stands . But the combination of steel swords , horses ( when an open plain could be found ) , and thousands of native allies allowed the invaders to press on again and again . Having crossed the Samal , Alvarado led his force over the mountain pass , only to find a Kiche army awaiting the invaders . <p> The ensuing battle was a crucial one ( sometimes called the Battle of El Pinar ) , as it permitted the Spaniards to use their horses to rout the Kiches , who were subjected to further slaughter at the hands of the Spaniards and Nahuas on foot . Alvarado claims that at one point during the fighting , " I saw more than thirty thousand men coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the entire Kiche population may have been reduced by disease to as low as sixty thousand by this time , but it suggests that the Kiches committed to the clash most if not all of the kingdoms fighting menonly to see thousands slain . Among the dead was the highest-ranking Kiche warrior , whom Alvarado calls " the Captain General of the whole country . " No Spanish or Kaqchikel source names this general , and only Kiche sources from later in the colonial period state that he was called Tecn Umn . But although Tecn Umn may be more legendary than real , he has become one of modern Guatemalas most potent icons ( claimed both by the Guatemalan military and by Maya leaders in the recent civil war ) . <p> Whether mythical or myth-historical , Tecn Umn represents the tenacious resistance of the Kiches to Alvarados invasion . Following El Pinar , the Spanish-Nahua company moved on to the Quetzaltenango valley , where the Kiches again made a stand ( fielding twelve thousand men , according to Alvarado ) . Defeated again , the surviving Kiche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their capital of Utatln ( see Map 1 ; for Alvarados route , see Map 2 in the next chapter ) . Sensing a trap , the adelantado seized the two Kiche kings , burned them alive , and then destroyed the city . In Pedro de Alvarados own account , this was an unfortunate but necessary tactic , a perspective more or less shared by his brother Jorge and Bernal Dfaz ; on the other hand , in the accounts by Las Casas and by the Kiches old enemies , the Kaqchikels , Alvarados actions were gratuitously violent . Accounts by the Kiches themselves are silent on the matter . <p> On April 11 , 1524 , amid the smoldering ruins of the captured Kiche capital of Utatln , Pedro again wrote to CortTs ( the first letter presented in Chapter 2 below ) . Around this time , Alvarados half-Tlaxcalan daughter was born , named doa Leonor after his mother . Meanwhile , the Kaqchikels chose this moment to pursue further their policy of appeasement and alliance with the Spaniards , sending warriors to reinforce the invading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the Kaqchikel chronicle ) . This , in retrospect , was the high point of the campaign : one kingdom defeated and occupied ; the other confirmed as an ally ; baby doa Leonor a symbol of rebirth of the new province of New Spain that would rise from the ashes of the Kiche kingdom . <p> But Alvarado did not stay long in Utatln . The Kaqchikels must have hoped , with their gift of warriors , to manipulate Alvarado into destroying all their enemiesand this they managed to do . First , the combined Spanish-Nahua-Kaqchikel force spent a week consolidating the elimination of Kiche resistance , sweeping through the kingdoms valleys , killing or enslaving villagers . They then descended on Lake Atitln , shattering the Tzutujil Maya army and further extending Alvarados violent reach into the highlands . Alvarado was now employing the stepping-stone technique that the Spaniards had been using in Mexico for five years ( borrowed in part from the Mexicas , who had used it to build their empire over the course of the previous century ) . <p> But instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding force to the south and east ( the company must by now have included thousands of native warriors speaking half a dozen or more languages ) . Encountering various Maya and Nahuatl-speaking groups , most notably the Pipils , Alvarado went as far as the Pacific coast and down into what is now El Salvador . <p> Alvarados own account of the journey into El Salvador and back sufficiently conveys its limited accomplishments . By July Pedro was back in the highlands . He now chose the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche as the capital of the new colony . He renamed it Santiago , and there , on July 28 , he wrote his fourth letter to CortTs ( the second letter presented in Chapter 2 ) . Although on one level the letters were personal messages to a friend and patron , they were also intended to promote and justify Alvarados actions to a larger audience ( including , he hoped , the king ) . The rapid publication of letters to patrons and monarchs by the likes of Columbus and CortTs meant that Alvarado might even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 1525 , just fifteen months after Alvarados last letter was written , the two surviving letters were published in Toledo . <p> Despite the optimistic tone of many passages in the letters of 1524 , a bitterness creeps in at the end of the second letter . Alvarados ambition was to see Santiago rise from Iximche just as Spanish Mexico had begun to rise from Tenochtitlan , with the Kaqchikels harnessed to the machine of Spanish empire building just as the Mexicas , Tlaxcalans , and other Nahuas were . But such hopes were soon dashed , largely as a result of Alvarados own impatience , frustration , and impulsive violence . Alvarados energetic six-month campaign of 1524 had left him in tenuous control of small pockets of the Guatemalan highlandsand yet this was achieved through a level of violence and brutality that was excessive even for a Spanish conquistador . As the Kaqchikels own chronicle recounts ( see Chapter 5 ) , Alvarados demands for tribute , supplies , and labor symbolized by the endless Spanish quest for goldundermined the Spanish-Kaqchikel alliance . The subsequent revolt drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a violent campaign against the Kaqchikels reminiscent of his earlier war on the Kiches . The six years of almost continuous warfare that ensued ( 152430 ) have gone down in history as the " Kaqchikel rebellion . " <p> Later in 1524 , when Pedro set out for Chiapas ( hoping to meet CortTs there ) , he left controlor , more accurately , " control " of highland Guatemala in the hands of his brother Jorge . For with many Spaniards killed or on their way back to Mexico , there were only a handful of them left . Nervously awaiting reinforcements , the remaining Spaniards depended completely on the loyalty of their native allies . When Pedro de Alvarado departed for Spain in 1526 , he left behind devastated Maya kingdoms , ongoing hostilities , and the mere semblance of a new colony . In short , the invasion was a failure . <p> Yet Pedro has gone down in history as Guatemalas conqueror ; indeed , in most summaries of the Spanish invasion of Guatemala written to this day , the conquest is portrayed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent events part of the colonial period . As one historian has noted , Pedros " contribution to the conquest of Guatemala has certainly been overemphasized and exaggerated , often in an attempt to make him a national hero and to compensate for scant documentary evidence . " So who was the real conqueror of Guatemala ? The documents unearthed by historians in recent years , including some of the material presented in this book , suggests that there was no single conquerorthat the thousands of Nahua and other Mesoamerican allies played as much of a role as the Spaniards , and that over a period of six years native " civil war " and epidemic disease wore down the Maya capacity for organized , effective resistancebut if any of the Alvarado brothers were to be granted that title , it would be Jorge . <p> Jorge de Alvarados Invasion , 15271529 <p> After participating in Pedros initial campaign into Guatemala , Jorge had left for Mexico with the other Alvarados in or by 1526 . He returned the following spring with an invasion force that was even larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kiches , and then Kaqchikels , seemed notably recalcitrant in their refusal to submit to Spanish demands without a fight , the Alvarados were surely no less tenacious in their efforts to carve out of the Guatemalan highlands a province to rule . <p> The scale of Jorge de Alvarados invasion surely reflects his firsthand awareness of just how incomplete his brothers " conquest " had been . As one Spaniard who fought in Guatemala testified , " when the adelantado departed from this country , he left it at war , and they the Mayas wished to strip it of Spaniards . " As another veteran said , " when the captain Jorge de Alvarado came to conquer this land . . . the country was at war and was unconquered , for there were few people i.e. Spaniards . " In addition to two hundred or so Spaniards ( many of them veterans from the first invasion , such as his brother Hernando ) , Jorge de Alvarado brought somewhere between five and ten thousand native warriors from central Mexico . They not only fought side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mayas defending their homelands . Most died in battle , but the survivors settled their own communities , primarily in and around the Spanish capital of Santiago ( since moved from Iximche ) . Their role was crucial in allowing Jorge de Alvarado to subdue most of highland Guatemala by the summer of 1529 . <p> Jorge de Alvarado apparently did not write letters detailing his campaigns comparable to those sent by CortTs and Pedro de Alvarado . Yet numerous other sourcessome of which we present in the chapters belowclearly indicate that the battles of 152729 were equal to those of 152426 in scale and significance . Spaniards who fought in both campaigns , many of them testifying within a few years of the second invasion , tended to agree that it was Jorge " who conquered , settled , and founded the city of Santiago in its old site and from there settled the cities of San Salvador , Chiapa , and San Miguel , " and that " those who traveled with that captain , Jorge de Alvarado , in the conquest of that land can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the greatest military force in this land . " <p> Setting up his first base at Olintepeque ( in Kiche territory ) in March 1527 , Jorge de Alvarados campaign began with a massive assault on the Kaqchikel kingdom . Having then secured a headquarters within Kaqchikel territory , at Chimaltenango , Jorge led a series of lesser expeditions against resistance leaders in the surrounding valleys . Two of these , Sinacn and Sequechul , were defeated but not captured for many years , thus passing into history as icons of resistance alongside the legendary Kiche leader , Tecn Umn . In November the Spanish capital of Santiago was relocated , but it was not until March 1528 that the invaders could claim that the region that had been the Kaqchikel kingdom was sufficiently secure to permit permanent settlement and the effective exploitation of the surviving Maya population . Over the subsequent year ( through the spring of 1529 ) , Jorge waged further campaigns , mostly to the south and east as far as El Salvador , but also to the north and northwest , battling remnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bloodshed that had accompanied both Pedros and Jorges invasions circulated in Mexico City , prompting the opening of a formal investigation into their actions . In August 1529 Jorge was forced to turn over the governorship of Guatemala to a judge sent from Mexico , Francisco de Ordua . After five and a half years , the great wars of the Alvarado-led Spanish-Nahua invasion of Guatemala were over . <p> The Alvarado legacy of violence persisted , however . During his eight months as governor , Ordua continued the work of the Alvarados , leading campaigns of conquest and distributing native villages to Spanish conquistadors as encomiendas ( as his predecessors had done ) . And , during the 1530s , Pedro and Jorge were periodically back in Guatemala , putting down Maya " revolts " and imposing new mechanisms of colonial exploitation until Pedros death in 1541 . The Dominican friar BartolomT de Las Casas , who lived in Guatemala in the 1530s , wrote in 1540 that since 1524 the Alvarado brothers and their conquistador colleagues had killed four million native Guatemalans ( see Chapter 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , it illustrates the high price that native Guatemalans paid for the privilege of being placed ( in Pedros words ) " under the dominion of His Majesty . " <p> The Nahua Conquistadors of Guatemala <p> If Pedro de Alvarados invasion of 152426 must be deemed a failure , and if Kiches , Kaqchikels , and other native groups in southern Guatemala were so opposed to Spanish colonial rule , how did Jorge succeed in bringing the war to a close in 1529 ( there were decades of violence against Mayas still to come , but the major wars of invasion were in the 1520s ) ? <p> First , Spaniards enjoyed a technological advantage , mostly in the form of steel swords , although guns were effective on occasion ( cannons are depicted in the Nahua pictorial account from Quauhque-chollan , for example ; see Chapter 4 below ) , and under the right circumstances horses helped Spaniards rout native forces . Second , and equally important ( perhaps more so ) , was the division of the highlands into various small kingdomsthe Kiche and Kaqchikel states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful to the invaders ) , and the other kingdoms and city-states were even smaller . This allowed the invaders to focus their violence on one group at a time , and often to further supplement their forces with local warriors . <p> Third , consistently high casualties in battle , the periodic massacre of civilians , and waves of epidemic disease all served to disrupt organized resistance , weaken morale , and render local resistance forces increasingly outnumbered . Whereas Spaniards and Nahuas were able to return with reinforcements , native Guatemalans had no such opportunity ; with little relief , they were gradually worn down by six years of warfare . <p> Fourth , and in our view most important of all , the Alvarados benefited from the participation of their Nahua allies , their other Mesoamerican allies , and later their Maya allies . These native conquistadors did not merely play a supportive role in the invasion ; they outnumbered Spaniards by at least ten to one , sometimes thirty to one . Not only did they do most of the fighting , routinely softening up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopping up the survivors at the end , but there is evidence that some battles were entirely native engagements ; some Nahua units set out on their own to conquer Maya communities under the Spanish banner . Furthermore , indigenous conquistadors acted as spies and interpreters , often knowing the roads and the nature of the countryside , as well as the nature and customs of the Maya and Pipil enemy ( the Pipils spoke a dialect of Nahuatl , and all groups were fellow Mesoamericans ) . As such they were able to help the Spaniards plan their strategies and to approach their enemies most effectively . And , finally , the native allies did the dirty work of procuring food and other supplies from local populations , and transported these things when locals were not available to do it . <p> If Nahua allies so greatly outnumbered Spaniards , and if Nahuas shared cultural characteristics with Mayas as fellow Mesoamericans ( and , in the case of the Pipils , shared linguistic and ethnic roots ) , why were Spaniards so willing to use them ? And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayas ? Finally , why were Nahuas willing to be Guatemalas conquistadors ? <p> The answer to the first two questions lies in issues of identity . Although Mexicas , Tlaxcalans , Quauhquechollans , Kiches , Kaqchikels , and Pipils did indeed have much in common , common characteristics and shared historical experiences were not enough to transcend their highly localized identities and create a common sense of identity . The common labels assigned to them by the Spanish invaders ( such as indio , " Indian " ) or by us ( such as " Mesoamerican " ) had no meaning to members of these native groups . Even the Nahuas did not see themselves as Nahuas , but as Tlaxcalans , Quauhque-chollans , and so on . It is true that Spaniards tended to call their allies " Indians , " and they were wary of possible defections or shifting loyalties . But Spanish leaders had also learned that native identities were geographically limited and that indigenous alliances across language barriers tended not to happen . In other words , Spaniards knew from experience that Nahua allies made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasions of Oaxaca , Yucatan , and Guatemala . <p> These questions of identity also partly answer the third question : Why did Nahuas do it ? Nahuas did not see Mayas as fellow Meso-americans or Indians , and thus saw no reason not to invade their lands . But their motivations for participation had further cultural roots . For centuries before the Spaniards arrived , the patterns of politics and warfare in Mesoamerica included a simple choice that a city-state was obliged to make in the face of aggressive expansion by another state or kingdom . Choice one for such a city-state was to offer implacable resistance , which might preserve its independence , but if it were defeated it would lose status and wealth ( and its rulers might be sacrificed ) . Choice two was to join the aggressor in an alliance , which would mean the loss of some autonomy as a junior partner , but also the preservation of some status , the protection of the expanding power , and the opportunity for advancement by joining new imperial expeditions . <p> The second choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later during the 151921 Spanish-Mexica war . The Quauhquechollans made it relatively quickly , seeing an alliance with CortTs as a chance to overthrow Mexica domination . The Tlaxcalans , who had picked choice one in the face of Mexica expansion and successfully defended their city-state for decades , initially met the Spanish presence with equal resistancebut before long they too made the same calculation made by the rulers of Quauhquechollan . The Mexicas , of course , opted for choice one , and only through complete defeat and the destruction of their city of Tenochtitlan did they become allies of the invaders . <p> Some Nahuas thus came to Guatemala more willingly than others . Some veterans claimed that there were Nahua lords who voluntarily came with men on the campaigns , " that some Indians from Mexico and from the province of Tlaxcala and its districts had come of their own free will to help and discover and settle the province of Guatemala , and there they stayed , " as one Spaniard later claimed . The Nahua rulers of Xochimilco , in the Valley of Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies of Spain right from the start , in the wars against both the Mexica Empire and the Guatemalan Mayas : <p> We the caciques and Indians who are natives of the city of Xochimilco , which is a part of the royal crown and is five leagues from Mexico City in New Spain , humbly implore Your Majesty and your royal council of the Indies to be informed that we did not make war against nor resist the MarquTs del Valle CortTs and the Christian army . Rather we aided and favored them then and in the time since in whatever has presented itself . So that the MarquTs could take Mexico City , we gave him 2,000 canoes in the lake , loaded with provisions , with 12,000 warriors , with which they were aided and with whom they won Mexico City . As for the Tlaxcalans , since they came from a distant land , fatigued and without supplies , they were aided also . And the true help , after Gods , was what Xochimilco gave . In addition to this , we served Your Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our encomendero . We gave him 2,500 warriors for the journey and all the provisions and other things necessary . As a result , those territories were won and put under the royal crown , because the Spaniards were few and poorly supplied and were going through lands where they would not have known the way if we had not shown them ; a thousand times we saved them from death . <p> In some cases , local rulers had given daughters to Spanish captains as a further means of sealing the alliance , and this may have helped Spaniards retain loyal allied warriors . For example , both Pedro and Jorge de Alvarado married daughters of the Tlaxcalan lord , Xicotencatl . Baptized doa Luisa and doa Lucfa , these women were Tlaxcalan royalty , commanding respect among their own people and granted status ( as their " doa " titles show ) among Spaniards . Each married their Alvarado husbands shortly before their respective invasions of Guatemala , so it is reasonable to assume that the marriages were elemental to the securing of Tlaxcalan troops for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged marriages that sealed alliances did not work , Spaniards used violence or its threat . Encomenderos also exploited their privileges to recruit units of warriors from the towns and villages placed in their " trust . " This was not true of Tlaxcala , because its alliance with CortTs gave it unique privileges under colonial rule , most of which were respected for centuriesincluding exemption from the encomienda system . Xochimilco , on the other hand , was given in encomienda to Pedro de Alvarado andas the letter quoted above showsthis relationship underpinned the Xochimilcan contribution to the invading force of 1524 . Likewise , Quauhquechollan was part of the encomienda held by Jorge de Alvarado . Its lords were thus obliged to send warriors with Jorge , but they also appear to have negotiated an agreement that granted them various privileges , protections , and exemptions , in return for a major investment of personnel in the 1527 expedition . The towns lords wrote to the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City in 1535 that they were " caciques , lords , and principal men of the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this land , and in the company of other caciques they helped the Spaniards to conquer and pacify much of this land with bows and arrows , enduring terrible wars among the barbarians and infidels , suffering enormous travails , placing their lives at risk and in danger . " <p> The phrases used by the Quauhquechollan leaders were typical of such petitions , but they also evoke something of the nature of the Spanish-Nahua invasion . Upon close examination , the Spanish conquests in the Americas , like war in general , turn out to be brutal tragedies without glory or redeeming features . But , as the Nahua conquistadors discovered to their dismayand as the accounts in the chapters below vividly illustratethe conquest of Guatemala was a particularly bloody affair .

The traditional account of the development of printmaking asserts that as the expertise of print designers and block and plate cutters improved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of color diminished . Interior modeling achieved through fine hatching and cross-hatching created the effects of modeling and shading , which had previously been attained by the addition of color . Descriptions like the following are common : " Throughout the XV century it was quite usual for illustrations , like separate woodcuts , to be colored by hand , at first in flat tints , afterwards with shading , and this practice only gradually gave way after Dnrer , at the close of the century , had brought in such reforms in the technique of wood-engraving that the higher class of cuts were accepted as complete in plain black and white . " 1 Here adding color becomes a remedy for perceived technical inadequacies rather than an essential aspect of early print production.2 This is curious given the predominance of painted prints in the &amp;supl ; fifteenth century . <p> From the inception of printmaking in the late fourteenth century , colorists painted woodcuts , metalcuts , and engravings .

The coloring of Last Judgment with Apostles ( cat . no. 1 ) from about 1460 by a German artist is typical , using transparent red , green , yellow , and brown and opaque black paints to color discrete compositional elements .

Typically , portions of the sheet remained unpainted , allowing the white of the paper to show through . The application of the colors is not always precise and in places exceeds the boundaries of the printed lines , suggesting that the colorist swiftly painted a considerable number of impressions . The number of woodcuts colored in this manner demonstrates that the appearance of the color itself was valued over the meticulousness of its application . <p> Early on , religious institutions produced woodcuts and metalcuts for sale as devotional images , pilgrimage and saints-day souvenirs , and talismans against -illness .

The vast majority of these prints are hand-colored . <p> The 1490s mark a turning point in the history of the woodcut . Designers , most notably the Nuremberg artist Michael Wolgemut , transformed the medium by creating prints that demonstrated greater articulation of volume , shading , and light effects . Unlike the woodcuts of his fifteenth-century predecessors , Wolgemuts printed lines provided his compositions with greater three-dimensionality and consequently the appearance of greater naturalism . Yet despite Wolgemuts innovations to the medium , colorists continued to paint the majority of woodcuts from the late fifteenth century . Needless to say , this hardly lessens the merits of Wolgemuts advances , but suggests that his contemporaries did not understand his innovations and the addition of color to be mutually exclusive . <p> The established account of the history of printmaking hinges on Albrecht Dnrer , Wolgemuts premier student . Dnrer is credited with dramatically altering the medium of printmaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his woodcuts surpassed those of his teacher . Dnrer supplemented his contour lines with delicate hatching and cross-hatching , providing his woodcuts with the appearance of light , volume , and , most significantly , a range of tonality from white to black . His talents as an engraver were equally remarkable , creating textures , light effects , and tonality unprecedented in intaglio prints . However , print colorists both during Dnrers lifetime and throughout the sixteenth century continued to paint impressions of his woodcuts and engravings . Although these painted prints may appear jarring to the modern eye , they were not extraordinary to print patrons of the sixteenth century . <p> Printmaking was a significant aspect of the artistic production of many of Dnrers contemporaries . Hans Burgkmair , Lucas Cranach , and Albrecht Altdorfer , among others , are all recognized for their ingenuity and their expansion of the mediums possibilities .

In addition to those prints that resulted from innovative methods of color printing , these artists also produced numerous prints that were more traditionally hand-painted . In fact , the woodcuts and engravings of the most distinguished artists continued to be painted throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries . <p> The primary purpose of this study is to overturn several assumptions : that the addition of color to prints was merely a means to remedy technical deficiencies , that the addition of color obliterated the superior printed matrix , and that the addition of color was separate from the printed design . Rather , color was often integral to the conception and meaning of printed images . If one conceives of hand coloring as an antidote to underdeveloped printmaking techniques , then color should have had no place once the medium matured . Yet , despite this familiar art-historical narrative , color application was practiced and appreciated through the seventeenth century , well beyond the nascent stages of the medium .

South Africa , a country that endured a brutal civil war throughout the 1980s between its black majority and white minority , is a particularly telling example of the capacity of institutions to foster either conflict or cooperation among collectivities with distinct interests . Institutions that fostered violent conflict appeared in South Africa early in the twentieth century . Several pieces of legislation , including the Natives Land Act ( No. 27 ) of 1913 , marked the institutionalization of racial discrimination in that country . The reaction of blacks to such measures was swift and included , most prominently , the formation of the South African Native National Congress ( renamed the African National Congress ANC in 1923 ) . Following the initiation of the policy of apartheid in 1948 , ANC leaders called on the organization to use strikes , boycotts , and other forms of civil disobedience and noncooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing institutional change once the South African government outlawed the ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress in 1960 , efforts to change the rules of the game turned violent and took the form of a civil war in the early 1980s . <p> Despite the bitterness provoked by the conflict , the divided communities of South Africa proved capable of constructing an enduring peace . During the early 1990s , adversaries began the process of crafting a mutually acceptable settlement intended to ensure that minorities enjoyed a degree of influence at the political center and that the majority would be prohibited from using state power to threaten others . The means that the architects of the South African settlement relied upon to accomplish these goals were a series of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . Institutions of this nature fostered an environment in which warring groups could lay down their arms and work together to fashion a peaceful future for South Africa that has now endured for more than ten years . <p> The tragedy associated with the civil conflict in South Africa is not an isolated incident . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-five countries had ongoing civil wars as recently as 1999 . The human costs associated with these conflicts are staggering . One estimate places the total number of deaths directly attributable to civil wars fought since World War II at 16.2 million . Another study calculates that the average number of refugees displaced by the fighting in each of these conflicts is more than one-half million . The indirect costs of these wars extend well beyond the hostilities themselves . Civilians , for example , continue to bear the costs of domestic warfare long after the fighting has ended . The breakdown in the provision of government services following civil wars leaves in its wake crises ranging from the rapid spread of infectious diseases to a higher incidence of violent criminal behavior . <p> This book , which is about the bargained resolution of civil wars , focuses on one means of bringing these conflicts to an end and building an enduring peace . The conventional wisdom is that negotiated settlements of civil wars are not only difficult to construct but are also among the forms of civil-conflict resolution least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African case illustrates , however , civil wars can successfully be ended via negotiated settlements . Drawing on a data set of all civil wars ended through negotiations between 1945 and 1999 , we seek to draw attention to the merits of this particular means of ending civil conflicts as well as to identify those features of negotiated settlements that facilitate a long-lasting peace among former adversaries . <p> Our central argument is that those settlements that include an array of institutions designed to address the issue of central concern to adversaries emerging from civil warthe question of who will control the levers of state powerare the ones most likely to produce an enduring peace . Whatever the issues that may have given rise to armed conflictdiverging ideological preferences ( as was the case in Cambodia , Laos , and Mozambique ) or ethnic divisions ( as seen in Bosnia and Zimbabwe ) after prolonged periods of fighting and large numbers of casualties , the core concern on which armed opponents ultimately fix their attention is the rules governing the use of power . Before they agree to lay aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold state power , how it is to be exercised , and to what end . In the case of negotiated settlements , this is most often accomplished by creating power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . In some cases the negotiated settlements that secure an end to the fighting are complex documents constructed with the assistance of international actors , as was the case with the 1991 Cambodian settlement . Others are simply verbal accords composed by the parties to the conflict , as was true of the 1970 Yemeni settlement . Either way , the power-sharing and power-dividing institutions contained in these agreements are the central mechanisms for establishing enduring , peaceful relations among former enemies . <p> This book is thus also about the role institutions play in structuring peace following civil wars . We argue that institutions perform three valuable functions that facilitate the construction of an enduring peace . First , institutions can be designed to address opponents concerns regarding who is to exercise power and the ends to which that power is to be used following a conflicts termination . Rival groups will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be able to seize power and use it at the expense of others . A case in point is the 1957 National Front Agreement constructed by Colombias long-term rivals , the Conservative and Liberal parties . The two entities fought repeated civil wars during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as each sought monopoly control of the state . Tiring of this cycle of violence , the elite of the two parties resolved to end the conflict by dividing power on the basis of a 50/50 power-sharing formula . For a period of sixteen years , the presidency rotated between the two parties every four years and seats in the congress were split evenly between the Conservatives and the Liberals . By adhering to this power-sharing arrangement , each party was placed in a position of prominence that provided the opportunity to both participate in governance and monitor the behavior of their former adversaries . <p> Second , the process of designing and implementing institutions as part of a negotiated civil war settlement signals the commitment of foes to building an enduring peace . Neither the design nor implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonists must typically abandon their interest in sole control of the state in exchange for the compromises associated with the sharing or dividing of power . The willingness of adversaries to endure these costs over time has the potential to serve as a costly indicator of their commitment to an enduring peace . Such a dynamic is apparent in the price exacted from both the government of the Philippines and the Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) to end their civil war ( 197296 ) . The government conceded a greater degree of political and economic autonomy for the MNLF on their home island of Mindanao than previously had been considered acceptable ; simultaneously , the MNLF compromised its goals by abandoning its separatist demands and instead recognizing the legitimacy of the central states continued participation in the governance of the island . That both the government and the rebels willingly endured these losses in the interest of peace served to enhance the credibility of their mutual commitments to the creation and maintenance of a previously elusive stability . <p> Third , the institutions designed as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be managed in the postwar state . Domestic order is reconstructed following a civil war on the basis of these institutions . If a stable peace is to be secured , groups must have a means , other than relying on the use of force , for resolving their disagreements . By making the design of institutions a central part of the process of ending a civil war , rival groups lay the foundations necessary for building an enduring peace . An example of this can be found in Malaysia . The institutions that formed the basis of that countrys settlement involved communal compromises designed to give Malays a larger stake in the economy while increasing non-Malay participation in the political system . Although these institutions eventually came under challenge and postelection race riots broke out in May 1969 , a history of institutional accommodation made it possible for the countrys communal leaders to act in concert to resolve the crisis . The principal response they devised was a " New Economic Policy " ( NEP ) . The NEP , announced in 1970 , sought to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were believed responsible for interethnic resentment within the state . <p> A central contribution of this book is to develop these claims regarding the role institutions play in fostering peace in order to define what we term an institutional approach to the resolution of civil wars . This approach emphasizes the need to look beyond simply stopping the killing and encourages adversaries also to participate in constructing the institutional underpinnings of a lasting and self-enforcing peace . A durable peace is , after all , as much the product of the rules designed to govern postconflict society as it is of processes that succeed in getting factions to stop shooting at one another and lay down their arms . Unless new rules for managing conflict are agreed upon , groups may well ( re ) arm and initiate another round in the cycle of civil wars , which has been the disturbing pattern of recurring violence in countries such as Angola , Indonesia , and Iraq . <p> Ending Civil Wars : Negotiated Agreements as a Means of Stopping the Fighting <p> Civil wars may end in one of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of military victory . Whether one group of actors triumphs over the other(s) by virtue of its own efforts ( e.g. , Argentinas brief civil war in 1955 ) or whether foreign aid and/or foreign intervention prove decisive in leading one of the factions to win ( e.g. , Guatemalas intrastate conflict in 1954 ) , the outcome is the same : one party claims victory and the other(s) admits defeat . Table 1 demonstrates that this is the most common way by which civil wars have been ended . Of the 108 civil wars that were fought and then experienced a cessation in the fighting for some period of time between 1945 and 1999 , fifty-five ( 51 percent ) were ended through the process of military victory . <p> Second , civil wars may end by adversaries mutually conceding to negotiate a settlement . A negotiated settlement brings together representatives of the opposing groups , none of which acknowledge defeat , to discuss and agree to the terms by which they will bring armed conflict to a conclusion . One of the central characteristics of a negotiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain directly address the question of how power is to be distributed and managed in the postwar state . Civil war adversaries may negotiate a settlement on their own ( e.g. , Colombia in 1957 ) or third parties may facilitate the development of such an agreement . Third-party involvement in the peace process has the potential to take varied forms , including military intervention intended to push for a negotiated settlement of the conflict ( e.g. , the United States in the Dominican Republic in 1965 ) or the offer of good offices to help facilitate such a settlement ( e.g. , the Quakers in the Sudan in 1972 ) . Thirty-eight of the 108 conflicts ( 35 percent ) that ended during the period under consideration experienced a cessation of hostilities as a result of a negotiated settlement . <p> Third , what we refer to as negotiated truces also have been used as a means of securing an end to violent civil conflict . Eleven civil wars since the end of World War II ( 10 percent of the conflicts we consider ) have stopped , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Negotiated truces differ from negotiated settlements in two ways . First , negotiated truces tend to focus on the process and modalities of ending violence in the short term . Much of the content of negotiated truces thus consists of the design of confidence-building measures and discussions of how truces are to be policed and enforced . Although some negotiated truces do include power-sharing and power-dividing institutions , these tend to focus on military and territorial issues such as the creation of safe havens and the means of protecting them . Negotiated truces , in other words , seldom address the challenging question of how power is to be exercised in the postwar state and by whom . Second , negotiated truces differ from negotiated settlements in that the former often make it a point to delay decisions regarding explicitly political issues . As a result , the peace secured by negotiated truces often resembles a type of " limbo " in which the fighting has come to an end but the ultimate state of relations among combatants and the rules of conflict regulation remain unclear , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The negotiated truce that secured an end to the fighting in Morocco following fifteen years of civil war illustrates the difference between negotiated settlements and truces . Civil war broke out in Morocco in 1976 after that country occupied territory formerly claimed by Spain as the overseas province of Spanish Sahara . The conflict pitted the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rfo del Oro ( Polisario ) , a nationalist group seeking to transform the former Spanish Sahara into an independent country , against the Moroccan army . A UN-sponsored truce brought the armed violence to an end in 1991 when a peacekeeping force arrived in the area to organize a referendum on self-determination for the territory . The referendum , originally scheduled for January 1992 , has been postponed a number of times during the intervening years . Despite the lack of any permanent political agreement on the status of the former Spanish Sahara , a tenuous peace remains in place as groups continue discussions regarding the holding of a referendum . <p> A final path by which civil wars may experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of the sets of combatants with third parties involved in the conflict or a peace of sorts is imposed by third parties . This process is apparent in only a handful of civil wars ( four of all civil wars we consider , or 4 percent ) . The 1987 attempt to resolve the civil war in Sri Lanka is an illustration . Sri Lanka experienced a brief two-month respite from civil war stemming from an agreement signed by Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi . India , which had for years lent support to minority Tamil movements seeking to carve a separate state out of the Sinhalese-dominated island , committed itself to securing the surrender of weapons held by Tamil militants and to provide military assistance for implementation of an accord that would have established a system of provincial councils on the island . Although the Tamil militant groups initially cooperated in the implementation of the peace accord the Indian and Sri Lankan governments had constructed without their consent , the agreement began to unravel as members of the minority collectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent . <p> Why focus on negotiated means of ending civil wars ? One reason is that negotiating an end to a war has the potential to be a less costly means of stopping the killing than waiting for one side to achieve military victory . The costs of a civil war may be calculated in a variety of different ways , including the loss of lives , destruction of property , and the damage done to relations with other states . Typically , however , the costs of civil wars are measured in terms of the numbers of lives lost in the conflict . Based on this measure , military victory appears to be a consistently more costly means of ending civil wars than any of the variants of negotiated agreements referred to above . The civil wars that ended via military victory between 1945 and 1999 produced an average of 170,706 battle deaths per conflict during this period . In contrast , the battle death average was 87,487 for wars in which the fighting was brought to an end through a negotiated settlement , 35,182 for wars ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third parties imposed a peace . <p> A second reason for concentrating on negotiated settlements of civil wars is the prospect that this particular means of ending wars may produce a more enduring peace than wars terminated via military victories . Perhaps taking their cue from the study of interstate wars , academics concerned with civil wars typically have argued that military victories are likely to produce a more enduring peace in comparison to negotiated settlements . Recent studies , which take into account the current proliferation in the number of negotiated settlements to civil wars and employ methodologies appropriate to examining the question of the duration of the postwar peace , have , however , cast some doubt on that proposition . Negotiated settlements of civil wars may in fact produce just as stable a peace as military victories . <p> One means of demonstrating this claim regarding the durability of negotiated settlements is to investigate the association between the way civil wars end and the potential for renewed conflict . Between 1945 and 1999 , fifty-five civil wars ended via a military victory ; among these cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to experience renewed fighting . In contrast , negotiated settlements experience a lower failure rate , with peace breaking down in only thirteen of the thirty-eight cases ( 34 percent of the total ) . Five of the eleven negotiated truces ( 46 percent of the total ) experience a breakdown of peace while two of the four settlements negotiated with or imposed by third parties ( 50 percent of the total ) see a return to war . Cumulatively , twenty of the fifty-three civil war cases ( 38 percent of the total ) in which the fighting was ended via a negotiated agreement of some form experience a breakdown in peaceful relations . <p> Although the contrasting failure rates for the different settlement types are instructive , we can not decisively conclude that negotiated civil war settlements prove more stable than do settlements secured via military victory . One reason is that the periods of peace following the civil wars in our data set vary enormously . Greece , for example , experienced fifty years of peace following the military victory that brought an end to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was still enduring at the point at which we terminate our data set ; by comparison , the peace in Kosovo , engineered by a negotiated settlement , had lasted only seven months by the end of 1999 . For this reason , one needs to use a method for comparing the stability of the different settlement types that takes into account not only whether or not civil wars ended via different means experience a return to war but also the length of the time peace endures in each case . Such a method should also account for the possibility that periods of peace that were ongoing at the point in time we cut off our data set may still break down at some point in the future . Recent studies using this method , known alternately as survival , hazard , or event history analysis , have found that both settlement typesmilitary victories and negotiated settlementsdecrease the likelihood of a return to civil war . <p> A final and very practical reason for focusing on negotiated settlements of civil wars is that the bargained resolution of conflict has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fighting . As table 2 demonstrates , the majority of civil wars during the first forty-five years of the postWorld War II era concluded by the process of military victory ; in contrast , during the 1990s negotiated settlements have become the principal means by which civil wars end . We think it is more than mere coincidence that negotiated resolutions have become a favored method of conflict resolution since the end of the cold war . The superpowers once supported or sought to manipulate civil war adversaries for their own ends in countries such as Afghanistan , Angola , and El Salvador by providing both military aid and troops ; with the end of the ideological competition between these two states they have become progressively more involved in efforts to facilitate civil war peace settlements or have stepped aside and allowed international organizations such as the United Nations to do so . <p> These three factorsthe lower costs of ending intrastate conflicts through negotiations in comparison to military victory , the prospects for fostering an enduring peace , and the increasing prevalence of negotiation as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on negotiated agreements as a means of ending civil wars . This study is intended to increase and improve our knowledge concerning the substance of negotiated agreements and how the content of these agreements may facilitate a self-enforcing peace . With this knowledge in hand , the international community may be encouraged to do more to assist in ending civil wars through peaceful means as well as improve the cost-effectiveness of their efforts . <p> Stabilizing Peace : Institutions and the Construction of Order <p> Securing an end to the fighting does not , in and of itself , guarantee that a stable peace will emerge in countries that have experienced civil wars . A durable peace is characterized by more than just the absence of armed conflict . The hallmarks of a stable peace include regularized practices of conflict management and the emergence of a self-enforcing domestic order . Such practices do not , we emphasize , emerge automatically from a formal agreement on the part of adversaries to stop shooting at one another . Stable relations among formerly hostile groups are instead the product of established governing institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the challenges associated with constructing a stable , postwar order in the wake of the negotiated settlement of civil wars , in this book we address three themes related to the creation of a postcivil war conflict-management system . These themes are best framed in terms of the following questions : ( 1 ) What motivates institutional choice in states emerging from civil war ? ( 2 ) What role does the institution-building process play in the creation of a self-enforcing domestic order ? ( 3 ) What institutional arrangements are most likely to facilitate an enduring peace among former adversaries ? We offer a brief discussion of these items below in an effort to provide an outline of arguments developed more fully in later chapters . <p> Determinants of Institutional Choice <p> A core determinant of institutional choice in societies emerging from civil war through the process of negotiation is that no party to the dispute has proved itself capable of victory on the battlefield . The inability of any actor unilaterally to dictate the institutional rules associated with the postwar state encourages a predisposition to compromise given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state structures requires the acquiescence of all relevant actors . <p> Civil war adversaries willingness to compromise , however , is very much shaped by the security concerns these groups bring to the negotiating table . These concerns , including recognition by former adversaries that despite recently killing one another " with considerable enthusiasm and success " they will have to coexist within the borders of a single state , play a central role in shaping institutional choice . As a result , groups seek to design institutions that will provide them with guarantees that the coercive power of the state will not be employed to their disadvantage once they lay down their arms and lack the capacity to provide for their own safety . <p> It is because no single set of antagonists is capable of imposing its will , coupled with the central importance of post-war security concerns , that negotiators are predisposed to create power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . Such institutions encourage groups to " give peace a chance " by providing them with a measure of state power that they might not enjoy in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor the behavior of their adversaries . In this sense , collectivities can better rest assured about their security and begin to engage in more routine interactions . <p> Power-sharing institutions may be constructed to share or divide power among groups along one of several dimensions of state power , notably military , political , territorial , or economic power . The intent of these institutions is to define how decisions will be made by collectivities within the postwar polity as well as to allocate decision-making rights among competing groups . By designing institutions that balance or distribute power among these groups , those responsible for crafting the settlement intend that groups will feel secure enough to settle into the routine of normal politics . Because these institutions also define the new rules of the political game , groups have a means for resolving future intergroup conflicts that does not require a resort to violence . These conflict-management rules thus provide a basis for reconstructing order following civil war . <p> The Institution-Building Process <p> The institution-building process in a postwar environment typically consists of the negotiation , creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages has significant costs associated with it that must be endured by those engaged in the process of compromise . We argue that the costs tied to these stages of the process make the commitment to peace credible , thus laying the foundations for a self-enforcing domestic order . <p> The first stage consists of the decision by the parties to begin the process of negotiation toward a settlement . Group leaders run the risk of being accused by their followers , or outside actors seeking to usurp their authority , of compromising group interests by engaging in dialogue with the enemy . This stage can be particularly costly to governments that , by agreeing to negotiate with the representatives of rebel groups , transform these individuals from " criminals " or " terrorists " into credible political actors recognized by the state .

Although the majority of Sierra Leones population desperately sought an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with what they saw as the legitimization of the RUF , given its notoriety for mutilating civilian victims of the war . <p> The second stage of this process , which consists of the design of institutions within the context of a peace agreement , generates two sets of costs for the leaders of the collectivities that sign on to a settlement . The first cost consists of recognizing the impossibility of achieving war objectives ( including , in most instances , the desire to achieve dominance of the state ) and the necessity of compromise with rivals . The second cost is the strong likelihood that the act of agreement will create divisions within parties to the settlement between those who prove more or less amenable to the bargains that have been reached . The peace accord agreed to by the government of the Philippines and the MNLF in 1996 is a case in point . As noted earlier , this agreement provided for a degree of autonomy for the Muslim-dominated island of Mindanao . Nevertheless , the leadership of the MNLF found itself harshly criticized and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim groups who suggested that the arrangement provided little more than a fatade of self-rule for the region . <p> The third stage on which we focus in the process of institutional construction is the implementation of the rules agreed to as part of the negotiated peace accord . The costs associated with this stage are comparable to those associated with signing a settlementestablishing limits on access to state power and enduring potential challenges from militant interests from within and outside ones own coalition of actorsbut also include having to make tough decisions about committing often scarce resources in order to implement the terms of the settlement . Foot-dragging or the failure to follow through on putting into place the institutions that have often painstakingly been agreed to can undermine a negotiated settlement by casting doubts on parties commitment to peace . This appears to have been a factor in the case of Angolas 1991 Bicesse Accords . Incomplete processes of demobilization and disarmament on the parts of both the Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) and the MPLA were followed by a return to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that peace settlement . <p> The costs associated with these three stages of the process enhance the credibility of commitments to peace . Actors demonstrating a willingness to endure the costs associated with the process of compromise have unambiguously signaled their willingness to pay a price in the interest of fostering a previously elusive stability . Such acts , or costly signals , are important indications of a credible commitment during a period of state and societal transformation in which the actions of the relevant parties are under close scrutiny for signs of cooperation or defection from the postwar arrangement . <p> Institutional Arrangements and the Prospects for an Enduring Peace <p> Neither civil wars ended through military victories nor those resolved through a process of negotiated settlement consistently facilitate a stable peace . Although at present no empirically validated explanation exists regarding why military victories are followed by an enduring peace in the case of some civil wars but not others , the institutional approach to the negotiated resolution of civil wars that we outline above provides us with an effective means of explaining why some negotiated civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the most extensively institutionalized settlementsin other words , those that call for the construction of a variety of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions across the four dimensions of state power identified aboveshould have the greatest potential to produce a stable peace . <p> What accounts for the importance of specifying a diverse array of power-sharing arrangements as part of a peace deal ? Settlements that include institutions designed to cover only one or no dimensions of state power have a strong potential to leave rival parties apprehensive about how and to what ends other dimensions of state power may be used . For example , a commitment to share political power may prove insufficient to a country plagued by the problem of recurrent military coups unless it is coupled with a commitment to power-sharing within the ranks of the military . In the face of such insecurities , groups may be hesitant to commit to a lasting peace unless they feel that all avenues through which their collectivity might be threatened are addressed within the settlement . <p> In keeping with our earlier discussion of the importance of costly signaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce only a small number of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions may be perceived by contending group leaders as indicating a reluctance on their rivals part to incur the costs necessary to build an enduring peace . Settlements that design institutions along several of these dimensions of state power , on the other hand , prove more reassuring to former adversaries regarding their security and the commitment of others to peace . In short , a higher number of power-sharing arrangements reflects a greater willingness to bear heavy burdens in the interest of facilitating a mutual sense of security . <p> Finally , a number of states in which civil war has broken out are weakly institutionalizeda problem that is likely to be even more severe in the aftermath of civil war . Designing a number of institutions that speak to the immediate concerns of groups in the postwar environmentsecurity and the exercise of powercan help address this problem . Not all types of institutions , it should be emphasized , will be perceived by former adversaries as effectively addressing these concerns . Groups seem most likely to commit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role and those they perceive to be relevant to their survival in the aftermath of war . To the extent that power-sharing and power-dividing institutions are created with the active participation of former combatants , they can help provide a foundation for building an enduring peace . <p> Integrating Perspectives <p> This book is written with two audiences in mind . One audience consists of those who have an interest in civil wars and their termination . The other is composed of readers with an interest in institutions , particularly power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . We hope to communicate to these two groups that , at least in the case of the negotiated settlement of civil wars , these two sets of issues are intertwined in significant ways . Armed conflicts emerge when the institutional means of managing conflict rupture or are under challenge . These conflicts , including the means by which they are ended , play an important role in structuring institutional choice . In turn , the institutions designed as part of a negotiated settlement of civil wars have an impact on the possibilities for managing future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship among negotiated civil war settlements , the design of power-sharing institutions , and the prospects for an enduring peace builds on the efforts of international relations scholars to explain war as the product of a bargaining failure . According to this perspective , groups have an incentive to negotiate an efficient solution to conflict because war is inherently costly . The fact that actors are often unable to reach a resolution and instead engage in war is attributed to bargaining failure . Bargaining may fail and war occur if one or more of the following conditions holds . First , a bargaining failure may arise if parties to the conflict have private information and incentives for misrepresenting it to competing parties . Relevant types of information might include , for example , the actors preferences regarding the nature of a bargain . Second , problems of credible commitment constitute another condition under which bargaining has the potential to fail . In order for a bargain to be considered credible , it must be in the interests of all the parties that strike the bargain to stick to its terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to war impossible if the issues over which they are experiencing conflict are somehow indivisible . <p> The bargaining model has been applied principally to the analysis of interstate wars . Research in this area has extended to conceiving the bargaining model as covering all phases of war , with each phase considered part of the bargaining process . These phases are aptly described by Dan Reiter : " Fighting breaks out when two sides can not reach a bargain that both prefer to war . Each side fights to improve its chances of getting a desirable settlement of the disputed issue . The war ends when the two sides strike a bargain that both prefer to continuing the war , and the outcome is literally the bargain struck . Finally , the duration of peace following the war reflects the willingness of both sides not to break the war-ending bargain . " Although some scholars have focused on the difficulty particular conditions pose for successfully negotiating settlements of civil wars , to date no one has attempted to explain how the bargaining model might apply to all phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been addressed , for example , is that contending groups within states often do strike bargains short of war that stick . How can one account for why bargaining succeeds in some cases but fails in others ? How might civil war settlements be designed to overcome a variety of the conditions that produce bargaining failure ? And why do some settlements produce an enduring peace and others do not ? Important answers to all of these questions can be found , we argue , by focusing on domestic institutions . <p> In our view , civil wars break out following a challenge to or collapse of the rules for managing conflict within a state . In the absence of such functioning rules , groups find reaching a bargain short of war difficult . The conditions that can produce bargaining failure come to the fore when conflict-management institutions are absent or deficient . Negotiating a civil war settlement requires addressing these conditions . The best means of accomplishing this task is to negotiate a settlement that includes a number of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . Institutions of this nature can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each group at least some of what it wantsaccess to state poweras well as some of what it must havea means of checking its rivals power in order to provide security for the group . By providing incentives for participation in the settlement as well as minimizing the consequences to a group of anothers defection , power-sharing and power-dividing institutions enhance the credibility of the bargain at hand . In addition , by agreeing to construct a number of these types of institutions , rival groups leaders are , in effect , sending costly signals . The willingness ( or lack thereof ) to send such costly signals communicates information to groups regarding the relevant actors preferences . This can help overcome the problem of private information with incentives to misrepresent . Finally , by devising these new institutions , formerly warring groups ensure that they will have a means for managing future conflicts , thereby providing an opportunity for new and more peaceful modes of interaction to emerge . <p> By emphasizing the role of institutions in fostering an enduring peace following civil war , this book brings together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power sharing in divided societies , and armed conflict . Through this synthesis of different perspectives we provide a unique understanding of the prospects for civil war resolution and point to mechanisms of conflict management whose capacity for shaping an enduring peace typically have been left unexplored . <p> Plan of the Book <p> Building on the idea that institutions are a mechanism by which civil wars can be ended and an enduring peace facilitated , in Chapter 1 we discuss in detail four sets of institutions that are intended to share or divide power among rival groups . These institutions are constructed along the military , political , territorial , and economic dimensions of state power . We argue that these institutions , both individually and collectively , help secure peace based on their substantive and symbolic importance . <p> Chapters 2 , 3 , and 4 are structured to reflect the three phases of the settlement negotiation processthe decision to begin negotiations , the construction of institutions , and the implementation of those arrangements . In Chapter 2 we develop a statistical test intended to identify factors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war will agree to create power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . The results suggest that , in particular , conditions that shape the perceptions of combatants as well as the international environment surrounding the state emerging from civil war play an important role in influencing the likelihood that negotiators will adopt power-sharing and power-dividing institutions . <p> In Chapter 3 we seek to verify that a relationship exists between the adoption of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions following civil war and the duration of peace . We find that the most consistent predictor of postwar stability is the aggregate number of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions specified in a settlement . More specifically , our results suggest that negotiated agreements requiring former adversaries to share or divide authority across as many dimensions of state power as possible have the greatest potential to foster an enduring peace . <p> In Chapter 4 we examine the impact that the implementation of institutions agreed to as part of a negotiated settlement has on the duration of the peace . Given its significance to postcivil war security , we focus on the implementation of military power-sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that states in which former combatants faithfully implemented military power-sharing provisions were more likely to experience a stable peace in comparison to those countries in which parties to the settlement failed to carry out the specified arrangements . <p> In Chapter 5 we illustrate key concepts and supplement the statistical tests of earlier chapters by providing two case studies that focus on attempts at civil war resolution in Angola and the Philippines . Angola has experienced several efforts to negotiate a resolution to its civil waragreements that included , variously , either no or only a nominal number of types of power-sharing or power-dividing institutions and , as a consequence , proved to be short lived . We contrast the Angolan case with the instance of the Philippines , in which all four types of power-sharing or power-dividing mechanisms were specified in the agreement and a stable peace has endured among former enemies . <p> In the Conclusion we review the books central findings concerning the role of institutions in the reconstruction of domestic order following civil war .

But Linehan uses the story to bring into sharp focus a number of usually unrelated aspects of the age : tensions between the mendicant orders and the local ecclesiastical authorities , thirteenth-century religiosity ( female religiosity in particular ) , and collusion in high places , both in Castile and in Rome .

The one I am most interested in is downstream : how can everyday bystanders learn to recognize and meet their shared and institutional political responsibilities for severe violencethe hunger , poverty , famine , civil war , wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocide in which more than 1.4 out of 6.7 billion people are trapped ? It is a question about political education , and one that I believe should be answered from a democratic point of view . <p> While there are no bright lines dividing political responsibility and democratic political education from their moral and legal correlates , there are important differences between the former political categories and the growing concern about the need for greater moral literacy and legal accountability . This distinction between politics on one side and law and morality on the other is not something that can be established a priori . Whether it makes sense to label certain responsibilities for severe violence as political , not just moral or legal , and certain ways of motivating citizens to recognize and meet their political responsibilities as political education , education will depend on the coherence and practical worth of the argument as a whole . It is not something that can be defended in advance . <p> Before addressing the question of democratic political education , however , something must be said upstream about what everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of what they allegedly are responsible for politically , it is impossible to help them recognize and meet their responsibilities for it democratically . <p> This kind of what question is usually about cause and effect . What causes or more generally contributes to severe violence ? While much has been said about what perpetrators and collaborators have done to cause harm and what their victims have suffered , relatively little has been said about the political responsibilities of bystanders who stand outside this causal nexus . The political responsibilities of bystanders stem from their roles as beneficiaries not quite as far upstream . The key what question for these bystanders is what benefits they have received , not whether they have caused or otherwise contributed to severe violence . <p> The practical link between the benefits enjoyed by everyday bystanders ( the what in this study ) and their recognition of these benefits is the citizen-teacher . It is this figure , I will argue , who can help everyday bystanders see where they stand within a complicated network of moral duties and legal and political responsibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sacrifice . Tales of heroic individuals who have committed their lives to helping the poor already exist , and they sometimes inspire others to do the same , at least for a short time . This is not that kind of story . There also have been cases of nearly anonymous rescuers working to protect their neighbors despite great odds against them . This is not that kind of story either . Nor is it a story about courageous humanitarian aid workers risking their lives in refugee camps and war zones . <p> It is a more commonplace story about mapping the rivers and roads of a new territory . This does not mean that there are no existing landmarks to help citizen-teachers guide everyday bystanders . But it does mean that we must be prepared to look in some unfamiliar places , and then step out onto the road before it has been fully paved . This is how Jane Addams , the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and founder of Hull-House , characterized the challenge of " social ethics " : " We are learning that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequestered byway , but by mixing on the thronged and common road where all must turn out for one another , and at least see the size of one anothers burdens . To follow the path of social morality results perforce in the term if not the practice of the democratic spirit , for it implies that diversified human experience and resultant sympathy which are the foundation and guarantee of Democracy . " <p> By " mixing on the thronged and common road , " Addams argued , we can begin to understand our shared and institutional political responsibilities for the suffering of others and the benefits that come our way . This is a story of how to move people off their familiar " sequestered byways " ( the anachronistic liberal map of citizenship ) and onto a yet-unfinished common road . It is not a matter of hypothetically projecting ourselves into the place of another , but making their actual acquaintance in a language both parties understand . Only then will we be able accurately to judge the " size of one anothers burdens . " <p> Addamss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vicariously sharing in the pain of those who endure severe violence by temporarily living among them . This kind of sentimental journey is to be avoided at all costs , and one way to do this is to remember that as we encounter one another on this common road we bring different skills , orientations , and sensibilities that have to be shared in an atmosphere of mutual respect . <p> Violence can take many forms , from physical injury and property damage to psychological trauma . Its causes can be direct and intentional , but it also can be the result of unforeseen , unintended , and catastrophic occurrences . Some would prefer that we restrict the definition of violence to injury and damage done by clearly identifiable agents or sources such as a violent individual or storm . Others widen the definition of violence to include both its background conditions ( e.g. , structural violence , cultural violence ) that indirectly can lead to equally harmful consequences over a period of time , as well as its symbolic manifestations in language and art . They argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the humiliation of minorities ( intentional or not ) , and the manipulation of ideas and symbols can be just as injurious and damaging as a direct assault or a hurricane . <p> Both the restricted and wide definitions of violence pick out important features of unwanted and harmful suffering . What makes some forms of violence , whether widely or narrowly defined , more severe than others ? One answer is the intensity of the pain they cause . Surely , torture is severe violence even though the pain experienced by the victim is not easy to describe . But pain is not the only manifestation of severe violence ; the political element alluded to above is more important for my purposes . What do being dispossessed , being disenfranchised , and being " disappeared " have in common that makes them politically severe ? <p> There are actually two senses in which severe violence is political : what we might call its material and its semantic senses . First , severe violence is materially political because of the decisions and actions , sometimes proximate and sometimes remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the ways in which responsibilities for the benefits and burdens that flow from such violence are shirked , shouldered , or shared ; whether violence rises to the level of severe violence depends on a political struggle over the meaning of these responsibilities . These material and semantic political senses of severe violence are clearly visible in the three forms of severe violence I have in mindfamine , civil war , and genocidewhen discussing how some everyday bystanders have benefited from displacement , dispossession , disenfranchisement , and disappearance . <p> Famine is not a chronic food shortage exacerbated by deteriorating climate conditions . In a material sense famine is an economic and political process of exclusion . Segments of the population lose their ability to purchase food for a variety of reasons ; falling wages , lack of adequate disposable income , rising food prices due to the policies of other countries , and the intentional destruction of the economic infrastructure can all play a part in this . These are not natural processes . They depend on political choices and political power . <p> Famine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations would prefer to define famine solely in terms of mortality rates and malnutrition , it has become clear that defining any particular situation as a famine is politically controversial . For example , to avoid so defining the situation in Niger in 2005 , Nigerian president Mamadou Tandja is reported to have said that there are three signs of a famine : when people are leaving the countryside and going to live in shantytowns ; when people are leaving the country ; and when beggars are widely prevalent . Those three things , he asserted , did not exist in Niger at the time . As self-serving and politically ineffective as this definition of famine is , it underlines the fact that where one draws the line semantically and who can draw it will unavoidably be influenced by political considerations . In this case Tandja was no match for the World Food Programme , and he was not able to make those suffering from famine disappear . <p> Similarly , as civil wars became more prevalent than wars of conquest in the twentieth century , civilians have been threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a political system that can provide some buffer . This not only can contribute to famine conditions inside refugee camps but also can lead to a reign of terror ( often described metaphorically as an epidemic ) , sometimes at the hands of peacekeeping authorities themselves . Civil wars invariably cross state boundaries and spread throughout whole regions , weakening economies , corrupting governments , and poisoning large populations . They are political hurricanes , not localized and entrenched blood feuds . <p> Like the word " famine , " the meaning of the term " civil war " is vehemently contested because of the implications it has for political responsibility . For example , the United States refused to intervene in the violence in Liberia in the early 1990s by characterizing it as a civil war . Madeleine Albright , then secretary of state , lectured the Liberians in language that foreshadowed the sophistic distinction the Clinton administration later would make between " acts of genocide " and " genocide " in reference to Rwanda . By misdescribing severe violence as an ethnic conflict contained within one country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severe violence emanating from Liberia as well as U.S. responsibility for it . <p> Critics of the invasion and occupation of Iraq by U.S.-led forces beginning in 2003 have argued that the action triggered a civil war , while defenders of the invasion and occupation have argued until recently that the situation is more accurately described as an unpopular insurgency against the new legitimate Iraqi government and its supporters . A similar debate occurred during the U.S. war in Vietnam : some critics of the war argued for withdrawal because it was an internal affair that ought to be left to the opposing parties , while defenders of the war characterized it as a defensive action on behalf of South Vietnam against North Vietnamese aggression . <p> Even more than famine and civil war , the definition of genocide indicates just how political a phenomenon severe violence is . In cases of genocide , according to international humanitarian law , groups are intentionally targeted for extinction and humiliation because of who they are . Recent attempts , such as the 2007 Genocide Prevention Task Force cochaired by Madeleine Albright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attempted to define genocide as " large-scale and deliberate attacks on civilians " instead of as directed against the identity of the targeted population . The hope has been that this would make it less political and thus more preventable by multilateral forces , including the United States . <p> What makes genocide especially cruel and humiliating to a people is not so much the vicious intentions of the gTnocidaires as the fact that it is done by the very political authorities responsible for protecting them : the victims have no recourse to the political body to which they belong , and often they must struggle to peel away state-sanctioned euphemisms such as " ethnic cleansing . " <p> In many cases , famine , civil war , and genocide converge . The current situation in Darfur illustrates how civil war can escalate into famine and charges of genocide . The violence that dominated the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the violence that continues to spread from Rwanda throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries in central Africa also illustrate how famine , civil war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean that they always occur together ; not all famines result from or lead to civil war and then genocide . But there are enough cases in which they do appear together to warrant asking questions about what they have in common as forms of severe violence . <p> In short , severe violence is political violence perpetrated against groups of persons who are sometimes exiles or immigrants , sometimes powerless , displaced minorities within an oppressive state , and sometimes groups left in political limbo to fend for themselves when their state has failed . What groups like these have in common is the cruel way they have lost their political voice and have no legitimate political way to regain it . They have been geographically displaced , legally dispossessed , politically disenfranchised , or militarily " disappeared . " Those individuals and institutions that have caused and contributed to this radical depoliticization certainly bear a wide range of moral duties and legal and political responsibilities . They are the perpetrators of severe violence and their collaborators . Those bystanders who have benefited from severe violence bear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutional political responsibility . <p> The examples of severe violence that I use are not controversial : the Nazi Holocaust , apartheid in South Africa , legalized segregation and forced labor in the United States , the civil war and genocide in the former Yugoslavia , and the Rwandan genocide of the Tutsis . My purpose is not to prove that these are forms of severe violence as I define it ; I assume that they are . My purpose is to explore how those of us who accept this description of these events can learn to broaden our understanding of political responsibility for severe violence and teach others to do the same . <p> It would be irresponsible to place anyone , and especially students , in a situation of severe violence in order to teach them about political responsibility . That is the obvious reason why the community service-learning and study abroad programs I use to illustrate the work of a citizen-teacher are not held in refugee camps or war zones . But there are ways students and teachers can become better acquainted with those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Simulations provide one way of doing this , but I argue that these representations of severe violence usually do not encourage empathy and self-understanding . Alternatively , refugee resettlement and support programs exist throughout the developed world , not just in war zones . Deep pockets of suffering exist within relatively rich countries as well as in very poor countries that have managed to avoid outbreaks of severe violence . There are ways of representing these sites of severe violence , both through critical reenactments and interpretations of these reenactments that encourage empathy and greater awareness of political responsibility . <p> Reenactment can refer to a wide range of performances , dramatic renditions , and other symbolic representations that replay key events and moments in history . In the United States , the most well-known form is the make-believe Civil War reenactment performed by volunteers , not professional actors . Reenactments of this type have a celebratory if not always patriotic purpose . In contrast , a critical reenactment , as I will be using this term , can be an embodied performance , an abstract representation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern dance can abstractly reenact a violent event in a critical fashion , and so can a poetry reading . The most defining characteristic of a critical reenactment is its purpose : to raise difficult questions about the shared political responsibilities of bystanders who are neither perpetrators nor victims of severe violence , and to raise these questions in a voice that can motivate these bystanders to reconsider their institutional roles , not just their personal moral duties . <p> Critical reenactors can be stand-ins for the original subjects or they can be the original subjects retracing their steps literally or figuratively . Platos Apology is a critical reenactment of the trial of the historical Socrates . Claude Lanzmanns Shoah is a critical reenactment of one chapter of the Nazi Holocaust . William Kentridges Ubu and the Truth Commission ( pictured on the cover of this book ) is a critical reenactment of one aspect of life in South Africa in the early 1990s . In Kentridges case , he chooses to use puppets to reenact the brutal exploitation that connects apartheid and postapartheid South Africa to avoid further complicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they actively opposed or tacitly supported apartheid , may have still been indirectly responsible for the violence done to street peddlers like the one represented by this trader puppet . This abstract reenactment allows Kentridge to raise the question of his own complicity and the possible indirect responsibility of others without forcing victims of apartheid to repeat their experience in a literal sense . The trader puppet bears witness to his own past suffering and demands that the audience , the actors , and the director ask who these two handlers represent . The purpose of critical reenactment is to help us see for ourselves the expanding boundaries of severe violence , the hand we may have in this process , and the voice we may have in its democratic reconstitution . <p> There are certainly other forms of violence besides famine , civil war , and genocide , and other political ways of responding to them . I do not mean to depreciate the importance of these other forms of violence or the importance of other responses by not including them in this discussion . For example , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most serious threat to political societies in the twenty-first century . I do not address this threat or the more abstract notion of terrorism , but not because I believe that its importance is overstated ; its relationship to famine , civil war , and genocide indeed may prove to be a very close one . <p> Recognizing and accepting shared and institutional political responsibilities as beneficiaries of severe violence will require a process very different from moral argument or legal prosecution . It must begin with something like what South African Breyten Breytenbach has called spiking the self and pickling the heart . <p> Writers , poets , filmmakers , and artists such as Breytenbach , Claude Lanzmann , William Kentridge , Mandy Jacobson , Alfredo Jaar , Antjie Krog , Carolyn ForchT , Wislawa Szymborska , and W. G. Sebald have tried to do just that : prompt us to recognize our shared and institutional political responsibilities as everyday bystanders to severe violence . I describe their work as critical reenactment , a term I explain in more detail below . But these sharp reminders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience able to decipher their complex messages . Another layer of interpretation is needed if these reenactments are to move a larger audience . I refer to the secondary interpreters of critical reenactments as citizen-teachers , and I call this two-staged practice of critical reenactment and interpretation democratic political education . <p> The argument for this particular conception of democratic political education is divided into four sections . Part 1 contrasts the vocation of citizen-teachers with liberal and neoliberal conceptions of citizenship in order to understand one particular set of institutional political responsibilities for the severe violence of forced labor and slavery . Part 2 describes why everyday bystanders to severe violence have difficulty recognizing their shared and institutional political responsibilities , and how this can be changed through critical reenactments . Part 3 presents several examples from my own experience of how citizen-teachers as interpreters of critical reenactments can help everyday bystanders recognize and meet these political responsibilities for severe violence . The conclusion locates the work of citizen-teachers as interpreters of critical reenactments within the context of contemporary theories of development , justice , care , and democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educators should not be strong advocates for political causes . The vocation of the citizen-teacher is not the only role that intellectuals can or should play to heighten awareness of and lessen severe violence . Some intellectuals have spoken in a prophetic voice from within their own community of suffering and oppression for just these reasons . The vocation of the citizen-teacher , however , is not a prophetic one in the sense of calling back those who have strayed from the path of righteousness . The challenge for the citizen-teacher is to help those who do not belong to communities of suffering and oppression to recognize how they have benefited unjustly from the suffering and oppression of others . <p> The goal of this book is to help citizen-teachersand through them , everyday bystanders to severe violencesee themselves within a more democratic frame of reference . This is why suggestive figures of speech , visual images , and poetic voices occupy a central place in the stories I tell . I already have distinguished upstream contributions , causes , effects , and benefits from downstream recognition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyday bystanders will be presented in terms of contrasting allegories and stories that influence ( not merely illustrate ) how recognition may be blocked or enhanced . Political educations reliance on language and innovation is hardly new . What may be new are the global challenges that recognition faces and the speed at which citizens are losing their ability to respond democratically to them . <p> Riparian metaphors of upstream causes , contributions , effects , and benefits and downstream political education and recognition can be complicated . Unlike products in the " flow of commerce , " responsibilities are not always either in or out of the stream of harm and suffering . Some bystanders feel morally obligated to save an innocent victim ( e.g. , the proverbial drowning child ; more on this in chapter 5 ) , and in some of these cases they are criminally negligent if they do n't  . Sometimes their mere marginal presence , even downstream , makes the harm worse ; and if they try to mitigate that harm , they may exacerbate it and increase their responsibilities . <p> Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 372nd Military Police reserve unit of the U.S. Army , a bystander in 2003 during the torture and humiliation of prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . I will return to the way that allegories of rescue and more unusual stories like Abu Ghraib are photographed , filmed , reenacted , and interpreted downstream to hinder or help bystanders recognize and meet their responsibilities . For the moment , I want to use Harmans case as a counterexample to underscore how the political responsibilities that everyday bystanders incur as beneficiaries differ from the political responsibilities of Harmans superiors and her own extraordinary but apolitical responsibilities in this case . <p> The following description , based on interviews with Harman and other military and civilian personnel serving in the Iraq war , comes from the book Standard Operating Procedure by Philip Gourevitch and Errol Morris : <p> The MPs knew very little about their prisoners or the culture they came from , and they understood less . But at Fort Lee , before they deployed , they were given a session of " cultural awareness training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MI Military Intelligence handlersthat Arab men were sexual prudes , with a particular hang-up about being seen naked in public , especially by women . . . . Harman understood . She did n't  like being naked in public herself . To the prisoners , being photographed may have seemed an added dash of mortification , but to Harman , taking pictures was a way of deflecting her own humiliation in the transactionby taking ownership of her position as spectator . <p> As Gourevitch and Morris suggest , Sabrina Harman played an unusual role in a situation in which torture had become a standard operating procedure : " She did not pretend to be a **25;944;TOOLONG ; rather , she wished to unburden herself of complicity in conduct that she considered wrong , and in its cover-up , without ascribing blame or making trouble for anyone in particular . " By photographing these scenes of torture , she hoped to partially exculpate herself . She was willing to document human rights abuses at the same time that she realized her presence as a woman documenting the abuses added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hoped to accomplish as a bystander , not because the torture was extraordinary . In fact , at Abu Ghraib events like those she participated in were not at all out of the ordinary . One might say she contributed to the harm but did n't  plan or instigate it . <p> Harmans role as a " spectator , " however , was not political . She and other low-ranking soldiers were convenient scapegoats for their superiors and politicians precisely because she had one foot in the stream of harm and suffering . The responsibilities of the politicians and officers who encouraged and then lied about these practices are political because of the decisions they made and the orders they gave , and therefore they ought to be held accountable politically . Harmans responsibility was not political in this causal sense : She took orders ; she did n't  give them . She made bad moral judgments , but she did not make any political decisions . <p> Everyday bystanders are not involved in harm and suffering in the extraordinary way that Harman was . Their responsibilities as beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harmans superiors responsibilities were . Unlike Harman , who had one foot in the causal stream of violence , and her superiors , who were firmly anchored farther upstream giving orders , everyday bystanders stand on the banks , not as silent witnesses or frightened rescuers but as beneficiaries of the deposits and changing landscape left in the wake of this stream of harm and suffering . <p> Initially , unlike Harman , everyday bystanders fill the once-filled jobs , hold the once-held offices , occupy the once-occupied homes , farm the once-farmed land , and even parent the once-parented orphans of the disappeared . None of these benefits came Harmans way . Later , everyday bystanders and their offspring attend the schools , cultivate the land , buy the products , and inherit the property made available to them by earlier displacements , disappearances , and less overt acts of ethnic cleansing . Everyday bystanders benefit from continuing harm and suffering through the decisions they make about property , parentage , and labor , even if they are not instigators or unapologetic profiteers . Sometimes these are shared decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are decisions made by the governing bodies of institutions such as private corporations , public universities , or other international nongovernmental organizations . These decisions , whether they are made tacitly or explicitly , are political because they ratify the violence done to the displaced , the dispossessed , the disenfranchised , and the disappeared . <p> It would be a serious mistake to assume that all everyday bystanders are wealthy or powerful , or that they all benefit greatly from the severe violence endured by others . The corporations that opportunistically take advantage of the suffering of others certainly are often well-off and do profit . But the neighbors and small shopkeepers who step in to take over the homes , farms , and stores left behind by those who have fled or disappeared may be no more well-off than the victims themselves were beforehand . It would also be wrong to assume that everyday bystanders do not feel remorse for the way they and their descendants benefit from severe violence , any more than there is a simple way for them to make amends . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a former student who had taken a philosophy course of mine in spring 2007 dealing with the material in this book . As an undergraduate she was active in the Latino community on and off the Michigan State University campus , and she became disillusioned with the universitys commitment to its minority students . To her , the university was standing by as other students baited and harassed international and minority students under the banner of national identity and security . When the university acted , she believed , it did so to support the freedom of speech of those calling for anti-immigrant legislation . <p> She spent her last semester in fall 2007 on a study abroad program in Quito , Ecuador , and decided to stay on to teach English for another year . Her experience in Ecuador , she wrote , helped her to rethink her college education and the problems of injustice in the Latino communities in Michigan and her hometown , Los Angeles . <p> In the e-mail , she reflected on the philosophy course and on an incident that had occurred the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , some of the ideas that were harder for me to graspideas of citizenship and moral responsibilityhelped me confront truths I learned later that same year . My grandfatherwho took care of me my whole lifedied during the last year of college , and so I spent the summer after spring 2007 mourning with my family in LA and learning more about his life . And I actually found out something that was very hard for me to accept . I learned that my grandparents , who had been very poor and struggling immigrants themselves , had actually lived in the house of Japanese immigrants who were taken to internment camps . I 've always considered my family to be hardworking survivors , and people who were victims of so many inequalities . So learning this fact was VERY unsettling . . . and I just could not believe that MY family had benefited from other peoples injustice . But , I worked through it . . . and accepted it . . . but I really think that the themes we discussed in your class gave me the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also to recognize that it was not ok . <p> I have no reason to doubt this students sincerity and gratitude , and I am pleased that the course gave her " the means to process and understand " the complexity of her familys relationship to the Japanese internment in the United States . But there is a general message here that is more significant . Discovering that her family had benefited from racist , anti-immigrant policies not only changed her view of her family , it affected how she understood her own education and the different groups she had encountered during that time . <p> A democratic political education that addresses the political responsibilities of everyday bystanders is not primarily about justifying official apologies or reparations . For some cases , such as the internment of Japanese American citizens in World War II , these may be appropriate , but by themselves they can not sustain democratic dialogues between beneficiaries and victims , especially when some parties have both benefited and suffered from severe violence . Families and communities like those of my student , whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wages at a firm that historically has benefited from severe violence , must be included in these dialogues . Because we can not be sure who falls into this ambiguous category , including ourselves ( see 11 ) , citizen-teachers ought to presume that some of us someday may . It is not such a remote possibility , and it may be the best way to help everyday bystanders recognize that they are not simply guilty ( or innocent ) , and that they are not alone in their political responsibility for severe violence .

Scholars writing in a number of locations on diverse topics found that they were wrestling with similar questions and problems . This volume builds on the intellectual energy of the Berkshire Conference , bringing together revised and expanded papers from workshop participants with research by other scholars across the globe who are exploring the tensions , contradictions , and implications of gender on the political right . <p> We open this volume by situating these essays in the recent history of scholarship on right-wing women . It was only twenty-five years ago that research on the right almost exclusively focused on men , as ideas of gender dualism established men as the only political actors . Right-wing women were simply overlooked or considered unimportant ; certainly , they were not considered active agents in the construction of right-wing ideology or the mobilization of right-wing movements or parties . This has now changed . A booming literature on right-wing women has proven conclusively that rightist activism has almost never been the sole province of men . <p> The first wave of work in this field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Latin America , respectively , addressed basic issues such as how and where women participated in the right . This scholarship showed that women were involved in a variety of right-wing groups and efforts , including those that favored racism , fascism , right-wing terrorism , religious conservatism , and the suppression of labor militancy . It also made clear that right-wing politics were gendered beyond the mere fact of womens participation . Early studies found that many right-wing efforts were deeply committed to a hierarchical , gendered division of social life . Women who participated in rightist politics were often relegated to tasks and roles that their male counterparts regarded as minor or distinctly feminine , such as socializing children into right-wing ideas or providing food for rightist events . <p> This volume also builds on a series of edited collections that introduced a more comparative wave of scholarship . Some of these compendia examined women who were situated in different sectors of the right , while others juxtaposed essays on rightist and leftist women . All plumbed the relationships between different shades of right and feminism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , even though rightists and feminists have occasionally worked together for specific causes . A number of these works also expanded the geographical scope of studies of right-wing women beyond the Americas and Western Europe . <p> An influential volume that appeared in 2002 featured studies of women on the right throughout the world . Despite the quite heterogeneous forms of right-wing politics represented in the articles , the books editors , Paola Bacchetta and Margaret Power , pointed to certain commonalities . One was that women are agents in a variety of movements in India , Africa , the Middle East , and Australia , suggesting that such activism is broader than the global North or West . Second , the disparate cases in Bacchetta and Powers compendium suggest gender essentialism and a dualistic sense of public and private spheres on the right . The authors associate women in rightist movements with private , less visible , and often subordinated aspects of daily life and politics , while identifying the public , visible , and dominant aspects as reserved for men . Right-wing politics , Bacchetta and Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mens authority , even though women may pursue these goals in public , assertive , and aggressive ways that are antithetical to notions of womens proper place . Finally , Bacchetta and Power observed that rightist women differ in their relationship to feminism . Some support womens empowerment as a means to other goals , such as white supremacism or state power . Others vehemently oppose any moves toward social equity , including womens rights . <p> The scholars in our volume take another step toward a global understanding of right-wing women by addressing three interrelated issues about political boundaries . The focus of part 1 , " Transnational and Comparative Studies , " is how right-wing ideas circulate among women across boundaries of space . Building on the knowledge that womens right-wing activism is vital in many areas across the globe , these essays bring to light issues that go unnoticed in studies of a single place . Some emphasize comparison , looking at similarities and differences among women rightists within nations and across the borders of nations and continents . Others focus on transnational flows , exploring how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries . <p> The second focus of this volume is the intricacies of the boundary between public and private that earlier scholars identified as a significant dimension of right-wing politics . Rather than assuming that this binary is a constant in womens right-wing politics , the essays in part 2 , " Privatizing the Public , Politicizing the Private , " probe the origins and permeability of the line between the two . They show that right-wing women can transgress , even erase , such borders as well as uphold them . <p> The volumes final focus is the boundaries of ideology . The essays in part 3 , " Countering the Left , " explore how womens right-wing politics interact with leftist and feminist ideas and practices . Although scholars have often understood the right as a counterforce , characterized more by what it opposes than what it advocates , the relationship between the right and other ideological tendencies is not straightforward , monolithic , or timeless . This is also true for right-wing womens politics . These essays address this complexity by looking in detail at how women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different times and places around the world , thus complicating the binary and boundaries of left and right . <p> The articles gathered in this volume demonstrate the new reach of scholarship on right-wing women . More than half address the period from 1945 to the present , the rest focusing on the earlier twentieth century . As we discuss below , these chapters introduce themes , directions , and questions that will carry scholarship into the next decade and beyond . Each part is organized chronologically to highlight changes over time in womens participation on the right . From a variety of scholarly disciplines and with differing geographic concentrations , the authors create a global perspective that shows how women matter in the national and transnational " connections and interactions " of rightist politics . <p> In the remainder of this essay , we introduce the themes of the three parts .

Because I , and my generation in general , lived in very interesting times : the revolution , the Civil War , and everything connected with the transition from capitalism to socialism , as well as the developing and strengthening of socialism . It was an entire epoch . It fell to my lot to take an active part in the political struggle from the very first days after I joined the party in 1918 . The whole time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War and the Great Patriotic War , and domestic developments in our country , have been treated extensively in the press . But there are " blank spots " that are incomprehensible to many . For a long time they were incomprehensible to me as well . After Stalins death , when we had the opportunity to acquaint ourselves with archival material that had previously been unknown to us , we began to see many things in a different light . Previously there had been only the blind confidence that we had in Stalin , and therefore everything that was done under his leadership was treated as necessary , as the only correct thing that could have been done . But when we ourselves began thinking in a somewhat critical way , we began checking the facts , to the extent possible , against archival data . <p> Many people who meet and talk with me ask if I am going to write my memoirs about the period in which I lived . They all argue , and I myself understand this , that it was a time filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that therefore people would want to know about it from a man who was right there , who lived in those times and held a high position , as happened with me . I would like future generations to have the opportunity to judge for themselves the things that transpired in the period when I was alive . This period was indeed one of great significance . It was a magnificent time because of the grandeur of the actions carried out by the party in reconstructing industry , agriculture , culture , and public administration . At the same time , many things were done that hindered our forward development , and if these things had not been done , our achievements would have been even grander . <p> I understand the concern of these friends who have insistently urged me to take up the pen . A time will come when literally every word of people who lived in our era will become " worth its weight in gold . " This will be especially true of people whose fate it was to be near the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our state was steered in restructuring the sociopolitical life of our country , in the process exerting an enormous influence on developments worldwide . However , I must work without actually having access to archival materials . It is too complicated to try to use such materials , and in my situation now it is probably impossible . <p> I want to be very fair ochen pravdivymthat is , very accurate about the facts , and I will refer to facts so that future generations ( and it is for them that I am writing ) can verify them . I will indicate sources that may be referred to in order to find out about things in more detail , to verify and understand the facts . On many questions that I consider especially interesting for future generations the facts were recorded in minutes . People can acquaint themselves with these in detail . These archival materials are not accessible today , but some day they will become available to everyone .

This was done by our efforts , by the efforts of the people , the party , and the leaders of that time , who were the organizers of the masses . It was my good luck to be one of that number , on various rungs of the ladder at various times , from base-level party organizations all the way up to the top leadership bodiesthe Central Committee of the CPSU , its Politburo and Presidiumand the top posts of chairman of the Council of Ministers and first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU .

I therefore consider it my duty to express my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will satisfy everyone , and it is not my intention to try to do that . My only wish is that , among the opinions that will be recorded in one form or another and that will remain as a legacy for future generations , my opinion too will become known . There were commonly held opinions and there were differences on many particular questions . This is only natural . There is nothing contradictory in this . In fact , that 's how it will be in the future as well . The truth is born out of debate . Even in a single party , standing on the basis of a single , highly principled Marxist-Leninist viewpoint , people can have different conceptions , different shades of opinion , in trying to decide one or another question . Living in a time when a flexible approach is required for solving problems , I know that differing points of view arise , views that may even be sharply opposed to one another , but that does not bother me . <p> I place my reliance on those people who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges . It will be the people themselves who will judge , who will acquaint themselves with this material and draw their own conclusions . I do n't  think that what I say is necessarily the truth . No , each person will find the truth for himself or herself , comparing different points of view on one or another question at one or another time . That is all I wish for . Only a foolish person wants to " cut everyones hair to the same length , " to reduce everything to one and the same level , to denounce as heresy or stupidity or even a crime anything that does n't  fit a certain viewpoint . Let history itself be the judge . Let the people judge . <p> For that reason I ask in advance that I be forgiven for any inaccuracies the reader may find in my memoirs . I am presenting my own personal view . This is how I see things now , how I understand them and write about them . I do n't  want to adapt myself to what others want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold my tongue or suppress the truth . I do n't  want to gloss things over or varnish our reality . Our reality does n't  need varnishing because in itself it is grand and immense enough . It was my good fortune , certainly , to have lived at such a critical , transitional time , a time when we broke up the old way of life , based on capitalist-landowner foundations , tossed it aside , and built a new life on the basis of new theories and a new practice . <p> Theory without practice is dead . What happened with us was that on the basis of the most advanced theory , Marxist-Leninist theory , we laid the groundwork for achievements in practice . This is a very complicated matter , because during this period of transition from capitalism to socialism mistakes and miscalculations , whether intended or not , can not be excluded . As the saying goes , may our descendants forgive us . May they consider the fact that this was the first experience in trying to build socialism . That 's why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a kind of repetition of the first . May we be judged in such a way that allowances are made for the conditions in which we lived and worked . We did our work first , and only afterward did we start to write memoirs , so that the good things created in our history by us , by the party , the working class , and the toiling peasantry , would not be lost sight of , and so that the mistakesand I would also say , the crimes committed in the name of the party and for the party , supposedlywould not be repeated . <p> Today it is clear that there was abuse of power . The reports at the Twentieth Party Congress , and again , to some degree , at the Twenty-Second Party Congress , shed light on the causes giving rise to this abuse . I think that everything was correct that was said on this subject by those two party congresses . Even today I take my stand on the positions adopted then , and it is precisely from that standpoint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eve of the Great Patriotic War and during the war , and then I will continue to lay out the course of events as long as I have the strength to do so , relating how I saw and understood events then and how I evaluate them now . <p> Where to begin ? I think its necessary to begin with the figure of Stalin . Why ? That will become clear ( if I succeed in carrying this project through to the end ) . If I were to try , to some degree , to give an explanation at this point , I could say that before Stalins death we considered everything done under him to have been irreproachably correct , the only thing possible for the revolution to survive , and for it to develop and grow stronger . Its true that in the final period of Stalins life , the time leading up to the Nineteenth Party Congress 1952 and especially just after it , some doubts began to arise in our minds . I am speaking of those who were in his immediate circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , Beria ) . We had no opportunity to test those doubts then . Only after Stalins death , and not all at once , did we find enough party and civic courage to lift the curtain and look behind the scenes of history .

While troubling levels of deprivation and oppression still blot large regions of the globe , people living in todays liberal capitalist societies enjoy unprecedented levels of prosperity as well as a greater degree of civil , political , and economic freedom than has been attained by any other society in history . Those who belong to these societies live longer and healthier lives , achieve higher levels of education , and enjoy more leisure time than almost anyone would have thought possible even a relatively short time ago .

In practice , of course , many Western nations and most nations outside the West fall short of fully embodying the ideals of liberal democracy and market capitalism . Yet in the wake of the discrediting of fascism after World War II and of communism after the events of 1989 to 1991 , there seems to be little serious competition regarding the ideals themselves ; indeed , these ideals are so dominant that one prominent scholar has famously asserted that we live at the end of history . <p> Yet triumphalist statements of this sort are bound to ring hollow for many readers .

Numerous antiglobalizationists , environmentalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communitarians , nationalists , virtue ethicists , cultural declinists , and religious fundamentalists of all denominationstaken together , perhaps most of todays Western intellectualscommonly blame liberal capitalism for exploiting the developing world , creating gross inequalities , harming the environment , promoting atomistic individualism , spreading conformity , and/or making people materialistic , selfish , immoral , and shallow . Of course , few of these thinkers or groups have an alternative vision for the world that is both truly different and truly realistic , but it is precisely the lack of alternative visions that makes these criticisms so important and pressing . The debate over the virtues and vices of liberal capitalism is , then , one of the broadest debates of our time ; it shapes not only how we understand our world but also how we seek to improve it and how we approach the problems of the developing world . A uniquely valuable approach to shedding light on this debate , I believe , is to return to the thought of one of commercial societys first and greatest defenders , Adam Smith , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before turning to Smith and Rousseau , however , a word on terminology is in order . Throughout this book I will be using the term " commercial society " rather than the currently more familiar " liberalism " or " capitalism . " These latter two were not widely used until the nineteenth century and so are anachronistic when applied to the eighteenth-century world of Smith and Rousseau ; they are also laden with unfortunate associations in a way that " commercial society " is not . Early in The Wealth of Nations , Smith offers explains what he means by this term : <p> When the division of labor has been once thoroughly established , it is but a small part of a mans wants which the produce of his own labour can supply . He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labour , which is over and above his own consumption , for such parts of the produce of others mens labour as he has occasion for . Every man thus lives by exchanging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society . ( WN I.iv.1 , 37 ) <p> Building on Smiths description here , we can say that a commercial society is one in which we find an extensive division of labor and hence a high degree of interdependence , the protection of property rights and the rule of law , and a good deal of social , economic , geographic , and occupational mobility . Smith contrasted this kind of society with less developed societies ranging from hunter-gatherer peoples to feudal European states , and today we can also contrast it with societies that have relatively developed but authoritarian or planned economies , such as the fascist and communist nations of the twentieth century . This is not to say that these other forms of society have no commercesome form of exchange is likely inherent in all human societiesbut rather that commerce in these societies is constrained by tradition or command , resulting in less mobility , less interdependence , and often a less extensive division of labor than is found in commercial societies in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divides commercial societies from other forms of society , but the nations that today conform most closely to the loose definition just offered are the member states of the European Union , the United States , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and Japan , with many others around the world now developing quickly in this direction . This type of society began to develop in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , first in Britain and the Netherlands and soon afterwards in other parts of Western Europe and North America . <p> Smith and Rousseau were two of the most thoughtful and most renowned observers of the emerging commercial societies of the eighteenth century , and their attitudes toward these societies differed dramatically . Rousseau ( 171278 ) was almost certainly the most famous critic of the European world of his time . Born in the Calvinist republic of Geneva , he left his native city at the age of fifteen and , after a series of youthful escapades in Savoy ( famously recounted in his Confessions ) , arrived in Paris in 1742 . He lived in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the heady days of the Enlightenment , a time when intellectuals from all over the Western world were gathering in the Parisian literary salons and the philosophes were beginning to mount their fierce attack on the throne and altar of the ancien rTgime . Rousseau attacked the attackers , taking on the " enlightened " principles and ideals of the philosophes in his first major work , the Discourse on the Sciences and Arts , which took the European world by storm when it was published in 1751 and made Rousseau a philosophical celebrity to an extent almost unimaginable today . ( Diderots report on its reception gushed , " It is succeeding beyond the skies ; there is no precedent for such a success " Confessions VIII , 304 . ) After an even more blistering attack on their principles and ideals in the Discourse on Inequality ( 1755 ) , Rousseau began to clash with a number of his erstwhile friends and colleagues , and he eventually became an exceptionally bitter adversary of many of the philosophes ( most famously Voltaire ) . He ran afoul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Emile and The Social Contract ( both published in 1762 ) and was forced to flee France , first to NeuchGtel and later , with the help of David Hume , to England . After nearly seventeen months in London and the English countryside , Rousseaus paranoia led to a much-publicized break with Hume . He returned to France , where he spent most of the rest of his life in relative seclusion with his longtime mistress and eventual wife , ThTrFse Levasseur . He died suddenly in 1778 while working on his autobiographical The Reveries of a Solitary Walker . <p> In sharp contrast to the famed " citizen of Geneva , " Adam Smith ( 172390 ) was celebrated as perhaps the greatest proponent of Europes emerging commercial order . He , too , lived in an " enlightened " society ; Scotland had long been largely dismissed in European literary circles as a relative backwater , but by the late eighteenth century the thinkers of Edinburgh , Glasgow , and Aberdeen were every bit the equals of their French counterparts . Indeed , no less an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to Scotland that we look for our idea of civilization . " Smith was ( and still is ) generally regarded as one of the two leading figures of the Scottish Enlightenment , along with Hume , his closest and lifelong friend . Smith was born in the small port town of Kirkcaldy , and unlike Rousseau he received a first-rate formal education . He studied at the University of Glasgow under the eminent moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson , and then went on to spend six years at Oxford , where he found his teachers rather uninspiring and spent much of his time in self-instruction . After delivering a series of public lectures in Edinburgh , he obtained a position teaching logic at the University of Glasgow in 1751 . A year later he was appointed Chair of Moral Philosophy ( taking over Hutchesons old position ) . Smiths first book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments ( 1759 ) , was enthusiastically received throughout Europe . In 1763 , as a result of his newfound prominence , he was offered a generous salary and lifelong pension to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buccleuch . The pair spent two-and-a-half years traveling on the Continent , where Smith met a number of prominent philosophes and Tconomistes in Paris and Geneva . Upon their return to Britain in 1766 , Smith , a lifelong bachelor , went to Kirkcaldy to stay with his elderly mother . He had been working intermittently on the material that was to become The Wealth of Nations at least since the early 1760s , and he began to delve into it in earnest there . He moved to London in 1773 and added to his already considerable reputation when The Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) was finally published and became a resounding success . Soon afterward he was appointed Commissioner of Customs for Scotland , a job that he held during the last decade of his life , in Edinburgh . <p> Rousseaus critique of commercial society was one of the earliest philosophic critiques of this kind of society , and even today it remains among the most comprehensive such critiques ever offered . Indeed , we will see that most of the serious arguments made today against commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many ways Rousseau presents the greatest challenge to commercial society ; anyone who hopes to make a persuasive defense of this kind of society will have to take all of the many different aspects of Rousseaus critique into account . And Smith , we will see , attempted to do precisely that . Smiths writings contain not only one of the earliest philosophic defenses of commercial society but alsoI would venture to saythe first defense that takes Rousseaus critique into account and that attempts to respond to its concerns . Many of todays proponents of commercial society tend to ignore or dismiss critics of this kind of society ; by contrast , Smith took the most serious critic of his day extremely seriously and was himself deeply concerned about many of the problems that Rousseau identified . <p> While Smith and Rousseau never corresponded and probably never met each other , they did have a number of mutual acquaintances among Europes " republic of letters , " including Hume and several of the philosophes ; so Smith was unquestionably well aware of Rousseaus immense intellectual influence . Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he does directly discuss him in a number of shorter writings and letters . In fact , one of Smiths earliest published writings , a letter to the editors of the Edinburgh Review ( 1756 ) , includes a substantial review of Rousseaus Discourse on Inequality . In this review , Smith translates three lengthy passages from the Discourse that point to some of Rousseaus most profound critiques of commercial society . As we will see , Smith continued to grapple with Rousseaus arguments later in life , and The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations contain his answers to the tremendous challenges that Rousseau posed for him . I do not mean to claim that Smiths books were written primarily as a response to Rousseau or that Rousseau was the thinker who had the greatest impact on Smiththat title undoubtedly belongs to Hume , with Hutcheson and the Stoics as probable runners-upbut I will be arguing that Rousseaus critique of commercial society presented Smith with a challenge that shaped the development of his thought in a decisive way . <p> A deeper more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge posed by Rousseau . Other scholars have recognized , of course , that Smith was not the crude champion of laissez-faire capitalism and unbridled acquisitiveness that he is sometimes taken to beWalter Bagehot noted more than a century ago that " free-trade has become in the " popular mind " almost as much Smiths subject as the war of Troy was Homers " but this view of Smith has long been seen as a caricature among Smith scholars , even if it remains the dominant one in the popular mind . Especially in the outpouring of work on Smith since the bicentenary of The Wealth of Nations in 1976 , many scholars have painted a much more subtle picture of Smiths outlook , one that recognizes that his analysis of commercial society is anything but crude or naive . We will see in Chapter 2 , however , that even these more subtle accounts of Smith generally do not appreciate the full range and extent of his sympathy for the arguments against commercial society . Comparing Smith with Rousseau helps bring out these aspects of his thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social critic rather than as an apologist for commercial society . <p> Far from being an unabashed champion of commercial society , Smith actually shared a number of Rousseaus severe misgivings about the type of society that was emerging in their time . For instance , both he and Rousseau acknowledged that commercial society necessarily produces great inequalities ; that an extensive division of labor can exact an immense cost in human dignity by rendering people feeble and ignorant ; that an emphasis on wealth and material goods can encourage moral corruption ; and that the desire for wealth often leads people to submit to endless toil and anxiety in the pursuit of frivolous material goods . This is not to say that Smith is as harsh a critic of commercial society as Rousseau , or that he does not ultimately defend it . In fact , I think it is even too strong to say that Smith is " ambivalent " about commercial society , as many recent scholars have contended . Smith does unreservedly advocate commercial society , but he also acceptsindeed , insiststhat many problems are associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems is , I believe , the central puzzle of his thought . <p> For many decades , Smith scholars concentrated on a different puzzle in Smiths thought , a puzzle that became known as the " Adam Smith Problem . " This problem was formulated in the nineteenth century by a number of German scholars , who argued that Smiths emphasis on sympathy in The Theory of Moral Sentiments was irreconcilable with the emphasis on self-interest in The Wealth of Nations . This apparent contradiction was the central focus of Smith scholarship for many decades . Contemporary scholars , though , have generally rejected this problem ( at least in its original formulation ) , and for good reason : it is based on the mistaken view that " sympathy " for Smith means benevolence and that " self-interest " means selfishness . There are certainly differences in emphasis between Smiths two major worksas might be expected , since they deal with different subjects ( moral philosophy and political economy ) but in the end I concur with the majority of recent scholars , who believe there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions in Smiths writingswitness here his agreement with many aspects of Rousseaus critique of commercial society even though he defends this kind of society . Smiths defense of commercial society and his acknowledgment of the ills associated with it are not simply split between The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments : some of his deepest criticisms , such as his harsh denunciation of the debilitating effects of the division of labor , are found in the former work , and important parts of his defense are found in the latter work . The tensions in his thought are , rather , found in both of his works . These tensions are real , but as we will see , they are not impossible to resolve . <p> All of that said , the question on which I am focusingWhy does Smith defend commercial society despite his full awareness of its possible drawbacks ? does not immediately present itself as basic to Smiths thought . The main polemical thrust of his writings , after all , is the need to reform the commercial society of his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its full title suggests , An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was written above all to promote and facilitate " the wealth of nations " or economic growth , and Smith argues that the most effective way to attain this end would be to eliminate the mercantilist policies of the eighteenth century and replace them with free enterprise or " the obvious and simple system of natural liberty " ( WN IV.ix.51 , 687 ) . Adopting " the wealth of nations " as ones end only makes sense , however , if wealth and growth are ultimately desirable or beneficial . Smith probably did not feel the need to give the justification of these things a prominent place in his writings , since most of his readers would likely have assumed that they were desirable ; but it is also cleargiven his awareness of and sympathy with Rousseaus critiquethat he knew that the goodness of wealth and of commercial society itself could not be simply taken for granted , regardless of what most people thought . <p> Thus , throughout his works Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rousseaus critique of commercial society . We will examine Smiths responses to Rousseaus critique in detail in Chapters 3 and 4 , but let us note at the outset the key line of reasoning running through each of these responses : his argument that commercial societys faults , though real and important , are not as numerous or as great as those of other forms of society . Smith provides a kind of costbenefit analysis and concludes that , despite its very real problems , commercial societys overall balance sheet remains preferable to those of other societies , for it constitutes a definite improvement over the poverty , insecurity , and dependence that dominated almost all precommercial ages . In other words , commercial society is unequivocally preferable , for Smith , even if it is preferable only on balance . This defense of commercial society was in some ways in the background of Smith writings , but it is necessary to foreground it if we are to understand the foundations of his thought . And it is through a comparison with Rousseau , I believe , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the puzzle in his thought is brought out most starkly . <p> A study of Smith and Rousseau is also useful because their ideas have been so enduring . Few have had as profound ( or profoundly different ) effects on subsequent thought and history as these two thinkers . Smith is often hailed as the founder of economics and of capitalism itself , while Rousseau is frequently credited ( or saddled ) with inspiring the French Revolution , Romanticism , Idealism , nationalism , and even socialism and totalitarianism . It is perhaps impossible to overstate the impact these two thinkers have had ( although many scholars have tried ) . Extravagant statements on this theme are too many to count , so a few representative samples will have to suffice : " After Smith . . . displayed the first true tableau of modern society , all the Western world became the world of Adam Smith : his vision became the prescription for the spectacles of generations " ( Robert Heilbroner ) . " Alfred North Whitehead stated that the history of Western philosophy can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be said with even greater accuracy that the history of economics over the past two hundred years can be adequately characterized as a series of footnotes to Adam Smith " ( Nathan Rosenberg ) . " The world has not seen more than once or twice in all the course of history . . . a literature which has exercised such prodigious influence over the minds of men , over every cast and shade of intellect , as that which emanated from Rousseau between 1749 and 1762 " ( Henry Sumner Maine ) . " There is hardly a respect in which Rousseau does not appear to have had his finger on the pulse of modernity , or in which his thought and its seismic impact did not serve to quicken that pulse " ( Clifford Orwin and Nathan Tarcov ) . These may all be overstatements to one degree or another , but the prevalence of such assertions testifies to just how great the impact of Smith and Rousseau has been . Their ideas and arguments have helped form the framework within which present debates about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great intellectual and historical impact , as well as their sheer prescience and depth of insight , the questions Smith and Rousseau addressed remain our own as well , and to an astonishing degree . Given that the origins of many aspects of todays society can be traced back to their era , Emma Rothschild rightly argues that " some of the disputes of the late eighteenth century are important , in the twenty-first century , because they are also our own disputes . They are not disputes which are repeated over time , or which can illuminate our times . They are our disputes . " The world has , of course , changed enormously since Smith and Rousseaus time : in the eighteenth century , commercial society was based mainly on agriculture and small industry and was found only in one small corner of the world ; that same society is now based largely on services , information , and technology and has spread throughout much of the planet . But because the defining features of todays commercial societiesthe extensive division of labor , the high degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arise around this time , Smith and Rousseaus assessments of commercial societys moral , intellectual , social , and political impacts remain profoundly relevant . Indeed , the fact that commercial societies in the fullest sense were first emerging in their time makes their thought in some ways more valuable for us today , because this means they were observing commercial society as something essentially new and groundbreaking and so were in a better position than we are to see what is truly different about it , to see what is at stake in the arguments about it . A study of their writings can remind us of the alternatives to , and presuppositions of , ideas we now take for granted ; thus they can help us gain a critical distance from our own situation without requiring that we abandon our own questions and concerns . <p> For all of these reasons , then , a return to the thought of Smith and Rousseau is timely in an era when commercial society seems to have triumphedin reality in most of the West and at least in principle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems surrounding this kind of society loom as large as ever . Hence , this book not only provides a much-needed comparison of the thought of Smith and Rousseau and uses this comparison to highlight and resolve the fundamental puzzle of Smiths thought , but also seeks to use their deliberations to clarify and enrich the contemporary debate over the problems and promise of commercial society . <p> Chapter 1 of this book examines Rousseaus three broad arguments against commercial society . The first , which I call the " division of laborers " critique , holds that it is not only labor that is divided in commercial society but also the laborers themselves : people living in this kind of society can have little social or personal unity , according to Rousseau , because of the prevalence of great inequalities and because of the weakness and ignorance produced by reliance on commodities and technology . In the second argument , the " empire of opinion " critique , Rousseaus contends that in commercial society people are invariably dependent on the opinions of others and that this necessarily produces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his third and final argument against commercial society , the " pursuit of unhappiness " critique , Rousseau posits that the acquisitiveness encouraged by commerce expands peoples desires almost beyond measure , thereby ensuring that they spend their entire lives striving and toiling to attain a happiness that will always elude them . These three broad critiques encompass the most significant arguments against commercial society on both sides of the political spectrum , making Rousseaus critique of commercial society one of the most comprehensive ever offered . <p> The rest of the book examines Smiths response to Rousseaus critique . Chapter 2 argues that Smith in fact showed a surprising degree of sympathy with each element of Rousseaus critique of commercial society . It begins by exploring the historical and intellectual relationship between these two thinkers and then examining Smiths review of Rousseaus Discourse on Inequality . Almost half this review is devoted to translations of three lengthy passages from the Discourse that ( surely not coincidentally , given Smiths intellectual concerns ) point to Rousseaus three main critiques of commercial society as discussed in Chapter 1 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply engaged with the problems articulated by Rousseau and that he struggled with them in his later writings : he , too , acknowledged that the division of labor produces great inequalities and can exact an immense cost in human dignity by rendering people feeble and ignorant ; that peoples great concern about the opinions of others can lead to problems such as ostentation and moral corruption ; and that people tend to submit themselves to nearly endless toil and anxiety in the pursuit of " trinkets and baubles , " which in the end provide at best only fleeting satisfaction . The fact that Smith agrees with so many aspects of Rousseaus critique of commercial society helps highlight the fundamental puzzle of his thought : Why did he defend commercial society despite his full awareness of the problems associated with it ? Several possible answers to this question are offered in Chapters 3 and 4 . <p> Chapter 3 outlines Smiths response to the " division of laborers " and " empire of opinion " critiques . Smith acknowledges that the division of labor can produce harmful side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generates astronomical increases in productivity , thereby opening up the possibility of raising the living standards of the poor . The inequalities produced by the division of labor are more than justified , for Smith , not only because everyone is materially better off in commercial society than they are in precommercial societies , but also because the worst effect of inequalitypersonal dependenceis significantly diminished by the interdependence of the market . Furthermore , he argues that the deleterious effects of the division of labor on laborers can be ameliorated through a comprehensive system of state-supported education . As for the " empire of opinion " critique , Smith concedes that people tend to be greatly concerned with the opinions of others ; unlike Rousseau , however , he contends that this is actually a good thing , for this concern can act as the very basis of moral conduct . He maintains that the fact that people see themselves through others eyes gives rise to social standards of propriety and leads people to ( more or less ) follow those standards . Smith further argues that commercial society encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict adherence to societys norms of justice by ensuring that these virtues are the surest path to success : the frequency of interaction in the market imposes restraints on people and obliges them to adapt their behavior to meet the expectations of others . In short , Smith argues that the overall economic and moral balance sheets favor commercial over precommercial societies , even if the former remain far from perfect . <p> Chapter 4 turns to Rousseaus third and in some ways decisive critique of commercial society , the " pursuit of unhappiness " critique , and shows that Smith finds an answer to this critique in the positive political effects of commerce . Smith argues that the most important benefit of commercial society is that it helps provide people with a greater degree of liberty and security than they enjoy in other societies ; extensive commerce does not guarantee an ideal political order , but according to Smith it does tend to lead to advances such as a decrease in personal dependence , the development of the rule of law , and more effective administration of justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the chief obstacles to happiness , commercial societys alleviation of these illsills that have dominated most of human historyhelps promote peoples happiness in comparison to earlier societies . People in commercial society may not enjoy complete happiness , especially since they tend to toil constantly for meaningless luxuries , but neither do they face the degree of dependence and fear that characterized nearly all previous societies . Smiths view of commercial society , then , is far from a triumphal one : there is simply a different mixture of benefits and drawbacks in commercial society , and on the whole it seems to him to offer the preferable mixture , for it provides the best chance for the most people to lead a decent life . <p> This books conclusion offers some reflections on the overall character of Smiths outlook and on what his thought can teach us today . Smiths approach , I maintain , is pragmatic rather than principled or foundationalist ; his defense of commercial society rests on a kind of costbenefit analysis rather than abstractions or ideologies . He is largely correct to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives ; at the same time , however , his sober insistence that there are important drawbacks to commercial society helps call our attention to the need to address its very real problems . An examination of Smiths thought , then , offers a salutary reminder to those contemporary critics of commercial society who mischaracterize him ( and through him , commercial society ) as indifferent to economic inequalities and to issues of character and morality ; but it also serves as a wake-up call for those contemporary defenders of commercial society who mischaracterize him as arguing that we ought to be indifferent to these things . A return to Smiths balanced , pragmatic approach seems worthwhile in an age that abounds with both dogmatic critics and doctrinaire champions of commercial society . Before exploring this approach more fully , however , we will turn , in Chapter 1 , to a detailed examination of Rousseaus critique of commercial society .

In painting and sculpture , they took on a bewildering variety of identities , from Venus , Ariadne , and Diana to Law , Justice , the Arts , and Commerce . Bailey Van Hook argues here that the artists ' concepts of art coincided with the construction of gender in American culture .

Van Hook delineates the modes of representation the American painters chose , which ranged from the more traditional allegorical or mythological subjects to a decorative figure painting indebted to Whistler . Changing American culture ultimately rejected these idealized female images as too genteel and , eventually , too academic and European . <p> Angels of Art is the first study to discuss the predominance of images of women across stylistic boundaries and within the wider context of European art .

The sisters , Kate and Margaret Fox , were to be remembered as the first mediums in history and the founders of the spiritualist movement . Yet the most important location for spiritualisms early history is arguably another one : a lecture theater called the Corinthian Hallthe largest theater in the nearby city of Rochester . It was there , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication for the first time before a paying public . According to reports , nearly four hundred people paid twenty-five cents each to witness the astounding " Hydesville rappings . " This spiritualist demonstration was destined to be just the first of countless public sTances in which religious beliefs mingled with live entertainment , converting spiritualism into a popular attraction for several generations of American and British Victorians . <p> Supernatural Entertainments argues that the rise of the spiritualist movement as a religious and cultural phenomenon was closely connected to the contemporary evolution of the media entertainment industry . Following the history of spiritualism in Great Britain and the United States from its onset in 1848 to the beginning of the twentieth century , the book documents how spiritualist mediums and leaders employed some of the same advertising strategies , performance practices , and spectacular techniques that were being developed within the field of spectacular entertainments . Their sTances offered not just a confirmation of religious beliefs about the afterlife but also a brilliant form of amusement , with sensational effects embellishing a distinctly spectacular environment . More broadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth-century media culture , this book aims to demonstrate that beliefs in ghosts contributed to the rise of the entertainment industry as we know it . Rather than diverging from the ghosts that populated literary , theatrical , and visual culture in the Victorian age , beliefs in spirits should be regarded as part of a broader cultural turn that placed ghosts and other supernatural phenomena at the center of the fictional , the spectacular , and the religious imagination . <p> During the Victorian age , spiritualism was a very significant religious phenomenon in America and Britain , revolving around the belief that it was possible to exchange messages with the spirits of the dead . My claim is that in order to comprehend spiritualisms prominence , it is essential to understand its inclusion in a growing market for leisure activities and spectacular attractions .

The sources examined in this book , however , point to the fact that spiritualist sittings staged in Victorian households also stimulated playfulness and amusement . Creating an opportunity for leisure , private sTances integrated numerous elements that were connected to forms of domestic entertainment in nineteenth-century households , such as amateur prestidigitation tricks , parlor theaters , table games , and rational amusements . It was not by chance that spirit communication was performed through the use of tables , a domestic object frequently used to receive visitors , engage in conversation , and play cards .

" <p> Spiritualist mediums and leaders organized and conducted sTances that were meant to be entertaining as well as uplifting ; in doing so , they adopted strategies that were being developed and employed in the show trade . As James W. Cook points out , one of the most innovative marketing schemes in nineteenth-century show business resulted from the discovery that a degree of uncertainty about the authenticity of an attraction would contribute to the arousal of interest in the public and the popular press . Showmen such as P. T. Barnum understood that doubts about the authenticity of their spectacular feats only added to their appeal , and they would thus openly stimulate public controversies as an advertising scheme . As I demonstrate , spiritualists largely profited from this same strategy : mediums and leaders of the movement found in these controversies a way to grab the attention of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritualism benefited from the powerful publicizing mechanism connected to celebrity culture . Frequently , it was the appeal of famous mediums featured in the popular press that attracted the attention of the public . Celebrity mediums contributed to the cohesion of spiritualist communities by spreading the fame of the movement and by providing a shared ground of recognized personalities . <p> Indeed , one of the most significant characteristics of spiritualism is the extent to which it participated in the formation of modern media culture , defined , as Erkki Huhtamo proposes , as " a cultural condition , where large numbers of people live under the constant influence of media . " From the very beginning , spiritualists employed the newly established popular press as a vehicle for publicity , mirroring the seminal entertainment industry of the Victorian age , which found in the mass circulation of the press new opportunities for broadening its public and reach . Spiritualists published and circulated an astounding number of publications , establishing a circuit of spiritualist print media that played a key role in strengthening their sense of belonging to a dispersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their time , using photography and other visual media to produce images that functioned as religious items as well as attractions and visual curiosities . In short , as the following chapters will show , the rise of spiritualism coincided more than just chronologically with the rise of entertainment media that placed ghostly apparitions and supernatural phantasmagorias at the very core of popular culture . <p> Taken as a whole , my explorations into spiritualisms spectacular character help frame the Victorian supernatural within the formation of a new commodity culture that changed the way public entertainments were planned , administered , marketed , and consumed . As scholars such as Fred Nadis , Sadiah Qureshi , and James Cook have shown , the nineteenth century signaled the growth of forms of live performance based on nontheatrical exhibitions of scientific , magic , anthropological , and human attractions . Freak shows , stage magic , popular scientific lectures , panoramas , and dime museums were part of a long-standing tradition of public display of wonders , by which unfamiliar objects and counterintuitive phenomena were offered to the gaze of curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices originated in the nineteenth century , what was unmistakably new about these attractions was their insertion in circuits of public visibility comprising commercial advertising , large-scale enterprises , and sensational reports heralded by the press . Tony Bennett uses the term " exhibitionary complex " to group the wide range of practices and performances that were offered to a growing public of entertainment seekers . Spiritualist sTances , such as the one performed at the Corinthian Hall , shared many characteristics with these kinds of performances . The sTance was set on a theatrical stage before a paying public and introduced by a short lecture . Advertising and publicity strategies were employed to attract potential audiences . Additionally , as in freak shows and other spectacular exhibits , the subject of attention was a " living curiosity , " a phenomenon that escaped normality to enter the dimension of curiosity and wonder . STances , in this sense , participated in the exhibitionary complex that promoted the consumption of entertainment and leisure activities in the Victorian age . <p> Public demonstrations of spiritualism were also similar in many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelties as sensational attractions . Magic and science in the nineteenth century were not contrasted but rather intimately allied : in an effort to appeal to the senses of their audiences through elaborate spectacular effects and performative strategies , lecturers mingled scientific lectures with stage magic . In London , for instance , the Royal Polytechnican institution devoted to the popularization of science and technologymixed scientific divulgation with up-to-date illusions of stage magic , including in its repertoire the use of optical illusions to create an apparition of ghosts . The inclusion of elements of both science and magic in the exhibitionary complex of the nineteenth century is particularly relevant if we consider that one of the main characteristics of spiritualism , as highlighted by some of the most authoritative scholars in the field , was the insertion of its religious and spiritual viewpoints within a positivistic and scientific framework . Belief in spirit communication required the constant confirmation of empirical evidence : only the accumulation of facts and phenomena made it possible to profess and believe . This attention to empirical evidence came together with the sense , shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " religion and that spirit communication could be experimentally verified . Moreover , spirit phenomena were explained by pointing to the agency of natural phenomena such as electricity , and spirit communication was frequently compared to communication technologies such as the telegraph . This emphasis on science and technology suggests that audiences who gathered for spiritualist demonstrations , not much differently from those who attended scientific lectures , could be attracted by the fascination of magic and , at the same time , by the appeal of scientific inquiry and knowledge . In fact , as scholars have noted , popular scientific lectures as well as stage-magic shows also benefited from the quasi-magical status of natural phenomena such as electricity and magnetism . <p> After the Fox sisters " discovery " of spirit communication , belief in spiritualism spread beyond North America , reaching countries as different and far away as Britain , France , Germany , Italy , and Brazil . This book is mostly concerned with the British and American spiritualist movements , which maintained a relationship of continued exchange during the nineteenth century . The first medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayden ; moreover , many of the most famous mediums , including the Fox sisters , the Davenport brothers , and Daniel Dunglas Home , would travel from one side of the Atlantic to the other . While most historical works on spiritualism have focused on a unique national context , my choice to adopt a transatlantic perspective is meant to underline spiritualisms international dimension . This was a characteristic that the movement shared with the new industrial-based show business . As the British magazine Theatre remarked in 1882 , the " circuits of Bristol , Norwich and York of the last century are now replaced by those of the United States , South Africa , India and Australia , and a modern actor thinks as little of a season in Melbourne or New York as his grandfather did of a weeks starring in Edinburgh . " Just as shows , performers , and attractions moved across exhibition circuits throughout the United States , Britain , Canada , continental Europe , and the rest of the world , so did spiritualist mediums and leaders travel from one continent to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences of believers and curious spectators . In this context , the spiritualist movements of Victorian Britain and the United States exhibited a particularly high degree of mutual integration . This does not mean , of course , that British and American spiritualism were not different from each other . For instance , the United States in particular was regarded by spiritualists all over the world as a place where particular emphasis was given to the spectacular and theatrical character of sTances . As one British medium put it , " American mediums are never lost for want of advertising ; their light is not hid under a bushel . " Yet my analysis of the British and the American spiritualist movements reveals that intermingling with show business , entertainment practices , and consumer culture was characteristic of them both . <p> The time frame of this book spans almost the entire Victorian era , from the foundation of the spiritualist movement in 1848 to the beginning of the twentieth century . During this period , belief in spirit communication spread throughout America and Europe . The invention and commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close provides one possible apex for the rising entertainment industry and , consequently , an opportuneif arbitraryend point for this book . The introduction of the moving image brought forth , as scholars have noted , the changes in the organization , marketing , and fabrication of attractions and celebrities that characterized nineteenth-century show business . Including a discussion of the relationship between cinematic representations of ghosts and spiritualisms visual culture , this book aims to underline the continuity , rather than the rupture , between the spectacular entertainments of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries . <p> While Victorian spiritualism is sometimes depicted as a phenomenon that especially concerned the upper classes , the audiences of spiritualist demonstrations and the participants in spirit sTances were , in fact , quite diverse in terms of class , gender , and , to a lesser extent , even race . Spiritualist communities in America and Britain varied in regard to religious faith , provenience , and social status ; moreover , public events that displayed mediumistic phenomena were organized in theaters as well as more inclusive locations such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sTances and demonstrations were set defies a simplistic characterization of spiritualism as a pastime for the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie . <p> The development of the media entertainment industry was part of a wide range of transformations in the culture , the economy , and the social milieu of both British and American society . While the birth of the entertainment industry is most often identified with the rise of classical cinema at the beginning of the twentieth century , this development was anticipated and readied by the transformations of spectacular entertainments and the show trade in the previous decades . Increasingly during the nineteenth century , large masses of people in Europe and the United States began to participate in leisure activities and recreation . As a result , large audiences became available for the consumption of popular entertainments . In the United Statesfirst in the metropolitan areas along the Atlantic Coast and later in other contextsmanagers and showmen seized the new entrepreneurial opportunities offered by the show trade , developing novel forms of entertainment and employing a range of advertising strategies . They strongly relied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a vehicle for publicity . The rise of American show business was epitomized by the career of showman P. T. Barnum , who managed a system of spectacular attractions , including fairs , popular museums of curiosities , music , stage performances , and freak shows , and became one of the most famous personalities of his time . <p> The creation of new audiences and new exhibition practices also took place in the British context . As Aileen Fyfe and Bernard Lightman observe , while Britain may have already become a consumer society by the eighteenth century , " it was not until the nineteenth century that most of the population had the opportunity to participate in this new world of goods , as products proliferated and the gap between prices and available income lessened . " In the middle of the century , the growth of the middle class and the institutionalization of the Saturday half holiday facilitated the development of an emergent field of showmanship and popular attraction . This was particularly true in metropolitan areas such as London , where the population increased from 900,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 . Here , attractions such as panoramas and dioramas , stage-magic shows , lectures on scientific and cultural issues , freak shows , and cabinets of curiosities rivaled the popularity of theatrical plays . <p> Despite the attention that the history of the spiritualist movement has recently attracted in fields such as Victorian studies , cultural history , and the history of science , little emphasis has been placed on the movements overlap with the rise of the entertainment industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . Spiritualism is usually interpreted through a rigid framework , which leaves out the possibility that faith in spiritualism did not contrast but rather was embedded with the spectacular and entertaining character of sTances . Historical works in this area have mainly focused on political , social , scientific , and religious issues , ignoring the ways in which spiritualism also interacted with entertainment practices and the show trade . As cultural historian Daniel Herman put it , most scholars have addressed spiritualism with " an almost grim seriousness that obscures its playfulness and its willingness to explore the profane as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that spiritualism was also a matter of entertainment and spectacle , their works have focused on the relationship of spiritualism with specific forms of entertainment , such as literature , theater , cinema , or stage magic , or they have not gone much beyond recognizing a degree of playfulness in the spiritualist experience . My analysis of spiritualism suggests that occult beliefs and practices should be interpreted in a more complex way . Spiritualist sTances , in fact , were not only religious rituals and collective investigations into the phenomenon of spirit communication . They were also spectacular and entertaining events . <p> Scholars in media history , such as Jeffrey Sconce and John Durham Peters , have noted that spiritualism originated roughly at the same time that electric telegraphy was introduced in the United States ; early spiritualists appropriated this technology as a metaphorical reference to explain communication with the world of spirits . Spiritualism , however , also coincided with another significant process in the history of media : the rise of show business and industrial entertainment during the nineteenth century . Beliefs in ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different forms ) long before the advent of spiritualism . Yet , in the middle of the nineteenth century , the spiritualist movement succeeded in incorporating these beliefs into the growing market for entertainment and spectacular attractions . The extent to which spiritualism participated in this market is a distinctive characteristic of the movement that most set it apart from previous forms of belief in supernatural and ghostly entities . <p> More than 150 years after the Fox sisters rappings inaugurated the nineteenth-century craze for spirit sTances , ghosts and other supernatural phenomena continue to haunt the imagination of entrepreneurs and performers in show business and the entertainment industry . In this sense , this book is not only a history of the relationship between spiritualism and spectacular entertainments in the nineteenth century . It is also a media archaeology of how the supernatural entered into the very core of twentieth- and twenty-first-century media culturefrom cinema to television , from radio to new media , from comics to video games . By looking at spiritualism in the Victorian age , one might find a signal moment in which belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual and religious experiences . Understanding how this happened provides us with better tools to comprehend the key role played by beliefs in ghosts and other supernatural phenomena in contemporary popular culture .

It is also an enquiry to see how far this attention or experience might be seen as akin to what now we speak of as the aesthetic response to art , an attention to art as art , apart from all the other interests we can have in it . Yet the terms of this enquiry are elusive . For even if we admit the possibility of any such engagement with the artsand as the history of criticism shows , this is not a simple issuewe may feel that it is so private and subjective a response as to be beyond the public narratives of history and of the history of the Renaissance , and , as such , a question to which we might never find full answers . Yet , whatever the conclusions , the issues of such an enquiry are deeply interesting at a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in our account of the culture of the Renaissance and its richness , but also ( here I am speaking more personally ) because they seem to bring into focus , if in historically different terms , something of the confusions and complexities of our own responses as we stand before the works of the Renaissance : while we recognize them as part of history , they also offer us , as objects so often do , immediate , unhistorical aesthetic experiences . To use an example : I know something of the social and historical significance of the picture of the Mona Lisa , painted as it was five hundred years ago , and this is very much a part of its meaning for me , even as I also recognize it as an object before me calling up a response to its beauty and its deep loveliness . <p> To consider these questions raises many difficulties . There are matters of definition ; and even if we can accept the idea of the aesthetic response to artif doubtful still what it consists ofwe may wonder how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renaissance , long before that moment in the Enlightenment when it became a familiar part of the language of criticism . And then there are problems of evidence , for when we turn to the Renaissance itself , we may feel that most of the critical language used then to speak of art and of the responses to works of art is disappointing , falling off , as a recent historian put it , into mere banalities and clichT . At which point we may feel , sadly , that there is nothing more to do beyond recognizing that if we can accept the aesthetic as a philosophical possibility in our responses to art , there is little in the history of language in the Renaissance that seems ever to take note of anything like this . Again the Mona Lisa ; perhaps we might wish to say , with Walter Pater , that its presence is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire . But the nature of this desire , even its very existence , is something of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But this is not the end of the story . Or rather , as I hope to show in all that follows , it may be that when we know where to look , we can indeed find much evidence within the culture of the Renaissance about such a response to art , whatever it is in itself , however at that time it was expressed . And if as philosophers we may worry still about the existence and the character of the aesthetic experience , it might be enough to say , on the model of Wittgenstein , that of course we know what it is , namely , what we all mean by it . And if we come back to look at the critical vocabulary of the Renaissance , we can recognize that , for all the limits of the language , many people did indeed speak of such an idea of pleasure or delight , the delight or art , the art of delight , that a work pleased someone , that someone delighted in art . And there is more , for when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art in the society of Italy , we may sense that a sufficient space was opened up to acknowledge the possibility of such experiences in many of the public activities of the culture , whether in such conversations or in the literary forms of humanism , within the histories of art or in the biographies of the artists . For evidence , we have one magisterial source , Le Vite de pi eccellenti architetti , pittori e scultori italianior , as we will refer to it , The Livesthe treatise about art and artists written by Giorgio Vasari at the instigation of his friend , the writer , collector , and historian Paolo Giovio , published first in Florence in 1550 ( figs. 1 and 2 ) and again in 1568 ( fig. 3 ) in an altered and much expanded edition . This text will be extensively used here for our enquiries about these possibilities , plus much also from humanism and all else , suggested at first by the moral and artistic activities of Dante , Boccaccio , and Petrarch and then elaborated more explicitly over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interests , who based their private and public actions on this rich moral and rhetorical program . <p> &lt;comp : insert figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 about here&gt; <p> These , then , as the title and subtitle of this study indicate , are the two points of the enquiry here : the idea of the delight of art ; and the cultural facts of this response to art in the culture of humanism , as recognized in Vasari . About delight there will always be much to say , as also about Vasari ; but here we need only recognize how easy it was in the Renaissance to take note of this response to things ( we can turn to sources speaking of delight as varied as Boccaccio or Lorenzo de Medici or Pietro Aretino or Isabella deEste ) , be these things jewels or music or the sounds of words or the majesty of a certain abbey . And then we can note how just such a record of delight is there so often in the profuse narrative of Vasari . <p> But texts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we closely examine all that Vasari says of delight both as a response to art and as a property within the art itself , we may sense a certain hesitation always , as we may also note that if necessarily he includes records of such attention in the history he lays out , when , as a critic , he comes to speak of art itself , he generally passes over this possibility , preferring instead to emphasize the properties of art that were more reasoned and more public , namely rule , order , design , and so on , the advances , as he puts it , that had made the achievements of his moment so perfect . Such a contradiction or hesitation , whatever its final meaning , hangs over the whole narrative , as it does over humanist criticism and all the parts of classical rhetoric Vasari uses to define his own particular position . If , as we can show , many of the social and intellectual practices of humanism worked to encourage such an idea of delight , much else in the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block any more open critical acknowledgment of anything of this kind as being either acceptable or proper . The result in our reading of Vasari is then very interesting : the evidence we will use comes perhaps less from his notes on criticism than from the fleeting moments within the narrative that speak of such responses or from the facts of history he recounts or the biographies he writes , which make up so much of the text . We might also add that when we turn to Vasaris account of his first engagement in this project with Giovio , it is clear that such a response to the arts , whatever its exact nature , had became institutionalized as a matter of social practice and as an appropriate way for those Vasari called the gallants and men of lettersand even for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese , in whose presence this conversation took placeto look at art and speak of the reactions possible to the achievements of the artists . But still there was this contradiction . For if this idea of delight was indeed encouraged within humanism , so too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond and within this same tradition that worked to discourage the expression of anything so private , whether the political and cultural programs of Duke Cosimo I , under whom Vasari was to work , or that public discourse on the arts , defined in the language of the academy , the Accademia del Disegno , where also , in the 1560s , he was to play so vital a part . <p> As even those who decry the baleful influence of Vasaris text must acknowledge , it may be seen as the most important account of the visual arts ever written . For , like The Prince and The Courtier , those other exemplary and vital commentaries of the sixteenth century , it not only served to bring together much of what had been said of art within the traditions of humanism , but it demonstrated , in a narrative of incomparable richness , how within those terms a history of the arts could be described and defined . This is not to say that Vasari was ever read as widely as Machiavelli or Castiglione ; certainly there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Prince or The Courtier that appeared so quickly and so often throughout Europe . Indeed , despite all the signs of interest in Vasariwe learn of these volumes becoming soon rare and expensiveit was not until the next century that a new edition of the text itself appeared , in Bologna in 1647 , corrected for what were seen to be its many faults and omissions . But Vasari did not stand by himself ; and if there were moments when his text was ignored , the subject it spoke of had particular authority , as did the artists it celebrated , Leonardo and Raphael and Michelangelo and all the others , whose reputations , if subject ever to change , remained ever an indissoluble part of the culture of Europe . As also , for so many years , did the institutions from which this text came , the courts and academies of Italy . <p> What Vasari wrote is thus an indispensable , even inescapable part of the history of the Renaissance and the history of that history . And even if we can imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eternal fame , all that Vasari said of them , even in criticism , served to confirm their place within the culture of Europe in ways that many later artists and writers would always recognize . There could , of course , be a history of Renaissance art without Vasari , but it is difficult to imagine what it would be . And even if at moments we might feel that we could be better placed to understand the real history of Renaissance art ( whatever that is ) , without such a narrative defining what we do , to ignore what Vasari wrote is at once impossible and self-defeating . Perhaps if ever we feel the need for a first defense against his overpowering influence , we might tally up his various vices and his virtues : that he was too prejudiced in his preferences for Florence and the Tuscans ( as Giovanni Bellori said , writing in the seventeenth century ) , yet he was to be praised ( said Francesco Sussino in the eighteenth century ) for having been the first to attempt anything of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said A. F. Rio in the nineteenth century ) , yet what he wrote , if often coarse and incorrect ( as Alexander Chalmers put it in 1816 in his General Biographical Dictionary ) , was full of information . In the modern moment , criticism took on other tones ; as Bernard Berenson put it , Vasari , with all the naivetT of a Herodotus , wrote down merely the folklore , romance , and gossip of the world of art in which he was reared ; that in all its inventivenes , s his narrative served merely to distract us from looking more carefully at the forms of art , as Robert Langton Douglas said in the first years of the last century . And even now , in both popular and more specialized writings , writers will frame the corrections of fact they are offering or the purpose of their research by first saying that Vasari misunderstood somethingthe importance of Pietro Cavallini , for exampleor that , as with the work of Masaccio and Masolino at the Brancacci Chapel , he did not document the facts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of how we know what we know , is testimony still to his eternal utility . <p> Another commentary about this text has recently been added , that possibly some of it , especially in the historical and critical prefaces , was not written by Vasari himself but by his humanist colleagues , Pier Francesco Giambullari or Carlo Lenzoni or Cosimo Bartoli or Vincenzo Borghini , whodid much more for him than the mere editing or revision we know of from their correspondence . This suggestion has led to an ever more scrupulous reading of the text itself and its sources and historical accountings . But for our purposes such a question does not matter , and however much at moments still we might slip into judging Vasari or speaking of his intentionalityI know I will be guilty of thiswhat is important here is the text itself as a text , whoever wrote it , for whatever reasons . Perhaps , as Hans Belting has suggested , we are at the end of both the history of art and of its narrative ; only time will tell . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that such a history began with this text , as it is equally clear that much of what later was said about the arts , whether this debt was acknowledged or not , had its first groundings or definition in the account of art laid out so clearly by Vasari . As an example , we might take note of the forthcoming studies by Carlo Ginzburg of Vasaris place within the criticism of the nineteenth century , which speak of the continuing force and complexityof his critical authority among the national traditions of Europe . The reasons for such authority are not difficult to understand ; not only did Vasari lay out an account of the arts at a particularly crucial moment in their history , the Renaissance , but he did so in terms that were based on what was acceptable for years , both as politics and as art , within the larger cultures of Europe . <p> Yet in this account , whatever else was there , it was important that Vasari took up a particular and successful stance on the nature of the arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Vasari became over the years ever richer in its texture and discriminations , as the writings of Filippo Baldinucci , Giovan Pietro Bellori , and many other later critics show . But still the possibility of the aesthetic cognition of things , mediating between the generalities of reason and the particulars of sense , if suggested here , was not to reappear openly or publicly for more than two centuries , when at last the traditions of humanism were overwhelmed by philosophical and political forces that called into question both such an account of culture and the forms of actions that kept this culture in its place . By then , in the nineteenth century , all that was recognized of this earlier moment were the examples of its art , the paintings and pieces of sculpture and architecture of the Renaissance , reinterpreted to fit the expectations of a modern conscience , a new Raphael , a new Leonardo , a new Michelangelo . And if any allusions were made to the older values of humanism or to the narratives in Vasari , these appeared most in texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by A. J. Anderson , or in the poems of Robert Browning or the essays of Walter Pater , or in the pictures by Philippe-Auguste Jeanron , a translator of Vasari in the 1840s , where represented again are the classic stories of the artists : the famous episode of Raphael and La Fornarina , or that of Fra Bartolommeo , or that of Tintoretto and his daughter Maria . Much in this vein was done to the story of the end of Leonardo , dying in the arms of his patron and friend , the king of France , as in pictures by Richard Cosway , Ingres , Frantois-Guillaume MTnageot , and others who , with the collapse of the old order , could now only wish for patrons like those of the past , the Medici or Pope Julius II or Pope Leo X , or a sovereign like Francis I who , they believed , had done so much always to support the arts . <p> But the criticism of Vasari was turning now into the practices of history . Like Karl Friedrich Rumohr , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1827 , many historians turned to The Livessuch refreshing reading , as Jacob Burckhardt described itwhether as a source for their own histories of the Renaissance or as a guide to the monuments of art , or even on occasion to track down frescoes in Florence long hidden under whitewash or grime . And at the end of the century , with the opening of the archives , scholars like Gaetano Milanesi , Ugo Scoti-Bertinelli , Wolfgang Kallab , Alessandro Del Vita , and Karl Frey turned new attention to the text of The Lives and to all the other notes and letters of Vasari that had survived and could be used for understanding of what he had done . Of their labors we are still all the beneficiaries . <p> But where then within such a tradition does this study stand ? There has been much interesting work done recently on the idea of the spectator in the Renaissance . Yet when I think back to the first intimations of this study , I gladly recognize how much I was stimulated by a review Michael Baxandall wrote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vasari delivered a few years earlier in Washington by T. S. R. Boase . In phrases of characteristically elusive brilliance , he noted how much was to be read in what he called the Vasarian moralistic tangent , the Vasarian critico-mythic anecdote , and all the other devices that made Vasari , as Baxandall put it , an idiomatic mouthpiece for a collective view of itself that the previous centuries had accumulatively worked out . And 1550 , Baxandall added , was an especially benign moment for such a critical catch . There was much else in this review , but what seemed to me especially important was the particular sense Baxandall suggested of the historical place of Vasari , as well as his emphasis on the range and richness of the language Vasari used to describe the achievements of the artists he spoke of . I have also been much helped by the work on spectatorship by Wolfgang Kemp , and particularly a review he wrote , a decade after Baxandall , of John Shearmans magisterial book , Only Connect : Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , the A. W. Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts , where Boase had spoken . I have also taken much from the work of Robert Gaston on the idea of attention . Most recently , I have been confirmed here by studies on the criticism of the Renaissance by Hellmut Wohl and Philip Sohm , though unfortunately they appeared when this study was almost completed . At a wider range , I have also learned much from the work of Georges Didi-Huberman . <p> Yet , I would like to think , there is a particular distinction in my account of art , even if , like its subject , such a distinction is difficult to define . I noted at the beginning that the subject of this enquiry is attention and the history of that attention . I spoke of my purpose in this way because I hoped to add to our understanding of the particularity of the experience of art in the Renaissance and of the historical presence of the attention which all then , whether artist or spectator , brought to what they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to realize that what is so often referred to as the natural , geometric definition of the beholders point of viewand this was an idea Shearman , after some qualms , seems to have accepted in his accountis deeply charged historically , as is the construction of the ideal beholder of art , who , in this sense , is never truly an ideal . Nor , of course , is our experience of this art , all matters of immediate perception aside , as inescapably we bring to what we see all that history and our knowledge of that historyeven the idea of pure , aesthetic attentionadds to our attention to art . Perhaps such an accounting limits our possibility of any direct experience of art . Yet perhaps not ; for if works of visual art are doomed to be forever voiceless , silent poetry , as the great Simonides put it , in this way we can recognize ourselves as part of the history of spectators , thereby lifting something of such silence to allow us to join the noisy company of all those over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted their delight in it . This , then , may be of comfort . And it is as a symbol of this endless possibility , whatever also scholarship might demand , that I have taken effort here to include so many quotations from Vasari himself and the traces we have of all those now-lost conversations about artists and their works in his narrative , plus all the lesser-known sentences about art and conversation from the classical and humanist writers he quotes and refers to . At this point I am also pleased to say how much I owe in writing this to the work of Paola Barocchi and Salvatore Battaglia , the first being so rich in its documentation of language of Renaissance criticism , the other so clear in its sense of the history of the Italian language and the complex and subtle changes in its meanings over the years . If I seem widely read in the criticism of the Renaissance , this is in large measure because I learned how to make good use of the work of these scholars as I first marked my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that benign moment of criticismto quote Baxandall againwhen Vasari was at work . <p> Two last points . The text of Vasari I use here is that first put out by Gaetano Milanesi between 1878 and 1885 and reprinted , as in the much-thumbed copy I have , in Florence in 1973 . The edition of Vasari by Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi , which they began to publish in 1966 , is more precise philologically , and the printing there of the parallel texts of the editions of 1550 and 1568 is very practical . But when I began to work on Vasari , it was into Milanesi that I sunk my scholarly teeth , and if I stay still with this edition my reason , it is not only from sentimentality but because I sense this is the edition people own and remain still more comfortable with . And then the footnotes . These I have tried to keep as specific as possible , limiting the citation of secondary materials to what has been of most particular value in the historical and critical narrative I have laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material cited here from Vasari and from the other literary sources to allow readers to go without delay to the evidence of language upon which the conclusions in the text are so often based . And if much of this material , whether in Latin or in Italian , is not fully translated , I hope that something will shine through of the complexity and resonance of the language of the artsif also its limitsas it was used by Vasari and his humanist colleagues and those who went before them .

" William Childers , De Gruyter <p> Many scholars have highlighted the richness of early modern writings on the New World , pointing to the complexities of narrative postures taken by writers who were often both participants and commentators on the project of discovery and conquest that Claude LTvi-Strauss once called humanitys most " harrowing test .

In this sense , it has become a critical commonplace that early modern Spanish authors frequently blur boundaries between history , fiction , myth , science , and philosophy , and that their informative reports and chronicles dispatched to imperial authorities are often packaged together with illusions of Eden or Atlantis , rumors of Amazons , and the hyperbolic self-fashionings of those who would seek to transform eyewitness experience into private or political gain . <p> Yet alongside the often-commented-upon inventive and hybrid aspects of the early Spanish accounts of America , one also finds in some of these works a largely unrecognized but nonetheless vigorous spirit of reflection , debate , and experimentation that seeks to delineate methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The broad reach of Spanish imperial expansion in the sixteenth century brought with it intense intellectual controversy that sought to grapple with urgent questions of justice and rights , truth and falsehood , fact and " fiction . " While narrative credibility has always been a concern in historiography , given historys particular claim to truth , the question of how to gauge textual reliability gains new relevance and urgency in works by authors such as Gonzalo Fernndez de Oviedo ( 14781557 ) , BartolomT de Las Casas ( 14841566 ) , and Bernal Dfaz del Castillo ( 1495 ? 1584 ) . Oviedo and Las Casas discuss explicitly the role of imagination and fabrication in history , for the most part as a way of attacking the reliability of rival historians . Although neither one of these authors translated his insights into a consistent method throughout his voluminous writings , one senses in their works a concerted effort to chart boundaries in historical discourse . This critical line of thinking , I suggest , in itself tells us much about these early writers , about the competing pulls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they sought to bring the conceptual tools of sixteenth-century humanism to bear on the New World . In retracing their debates over the nature of historical discourse and the forms appropriate to it , one glimpses ways in which colonial experience appears to have challenged these authors and even inspired them to change some of the assumptions with which they had begun their monumental projects . Their critical commentaries on the writing of history are a treasure trove of insight ; one finds in them an instance of the sort of innovative and creative thinking that Walter Mignolo has highlighted as stemming from cultures in conflict at the frontiers of empire . The importance of this fascinating trove of epistemological reflection and narratological consciousness derives from its ability to reveal conceptual fault lines , such as those in which superstition and magic are contrasted to more " rational " modes of analysis , as in the case of Oviedo , and those in which an inquisitorial rhetoric is harnessed to the critique of empire , as in the case of Las Casas . In the works of both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which supernatural versus natural knowledge , and magic versus religion , are debated as signs of authorial reliability . In addition , their discussions have striking parallels to recent debates concerning the status of narrative in historical discourse . <p> Why , one might ask , has this wealth of ideas at the very foundations of the Spanish-American intellectual and literary tradition not yet been sufficiently recuperated ? The answer may be found in the checkered reception of the writings of colonial Latin America . Neither Oviedos nor Las Casass major historical works were published in their entirety until the nineteenth century , and the early positivist readers tended to view their works as documentary sources whose data needed to be extracted and recomposed into more accurate accounts of events . Pioneering twentieth-century scholars such as Ram=n Iglesia , Edmundo OGorman , and Irving Leonard sought to counteract this approach by reading colonial texts in a more holistic fashion so as to understand the philosophical and cultural codes that shape them . Small but significant changes in critical emphasis , which coincided with the larger poststructuralist questioning of what constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigmatic shift by which the histories of the Spanish West Indies were recuperated and studied for the most part by literary or cultural critics . While the postmodern critique of historys traditional claims to truth , accuracy , and reliability , and the resulting emphasis on the narrative aspects of the practice , have prompted a great deal of debate within the discipline of history , the increasing inclusion of historical texts as objects for literary study has in itself only more recently begun to receive in-depth critical consideration . If the insights that grew out of the intellectual climate of recent years have helped us to see the rich hybridity of colonial works , they may also have obscured an important undercurrent within the texts themselves that seeks to define the norms and boundaries of historical writing . <p> In reconstructing the rich tradition of historiographical reflection in sixteenth-century Spain and its colonies and arguing for its relevance to present concerns , I have drawn on several quite distinct scholarly tendencies . In its early stages , this project sought to investigate the expressions in New World historiography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Golden Age and was inspired by new historicist trends . By undertaking a literary study of historiography , my work was modeled on the rhetorical analyses of cr=nicas de Indias undertaken by scholars such as Margarita Zamora , Rolena Adorno , and Enrique Pupo-Walker , among others . And yet , my findings led me to adopt a methodological approach that , to my knowledge , has not been used in the context of the chronicles of the Spanish-American colonial period . The authors I found most illuminating for understanding the reflection on the writing of history in the context of the New World have explored , in one way or another , the usefulness of narrative theory to gain precision on distinctions between historical and fictive narratives . They include scholars as diverse as FTlix Martfnez Bonati , Dorrit Cohn , GTrard Genette , and Anne Rigney . At the same time , my work has been inspired by an emerging body of scholarship on early modern epistemology and empiricism that seeks to examine the interplay of science and religion in the production of knowledge during the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lorraine Daston . The formidable challenges presented to those who attempted to account for the history of the New World led them to far-reaching insights concerning the writing of history , and their critiques of humanist rhetorical models are often formulated in terms that evoke important political , religious , and scientific concerns . <p> The immediate context for Oviedo and Las Casas was the classical tradition as had been interpreted by Christian humanists . Aristotle , as is well known , wrote that history relates " the thing that has been , " and poetry , " a kind of thing that might be , i.e. , what is possible as being verisimilar or necessary , " thus concluding that poetry is " something more philosophic and of graver import than history . " For Aristotle , then , history is mere chronology , a narration of singular events without any universal signification ( " what Alcibiades did or had done to him " ) . What Aristotle denied to history , the humanists of the sixteenth century delivered . This reversal is perhaps best illustrated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period , of the model inquirerand his textual persona , the narratoras a sage or wise man able to conjure up events and figures beyond his experience and to bring them to life in an exemplary narrative . History , for many humanists , becomes the supreme discipline , overshadowingat least in theorynot just poetry but even moral philosophy . Indeed , it becomes a vehicle for teaching not just singular events but universal truths . <p> It is within the context of the humanists high standards and expectations for historical narrative and the historian that the early chroniclers of the Indies inscribed their work and endeavored to grapple with the challenging material of the New World . Gonzalo Fernndez de Oviedo in the Historia general y natural de las Indias ( 1535 , 1557 , 185155 ) and BartolomT de Las Casas in the Historia de las Indias ( written 152760 , pub . 187576 ) constantly measure their own histories ( and those of others ) against the daunting humanist norms , and yet manage to effect their own reversals , finding audacious narrative solutions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often , they frame their attempts to address the issue in terms of a conflict between history and " fiction , " and also in terms of concerns that continue to preoccupy theorists of narrative and historians alike : the nature of the truth represented , the qualities and perceptive abilities of the narrator , and the credibility of the narrative both in relation to the evidence and to the manner in which it is written . They also frequently formulate their critiques of their rivals works in terms that dismiss them as mere magical or superstitious practice . <p> In Chapter 1 , " Historical Representation in the Spanish Humanist Context , " I examine the ideas of Juan Luis Vives ( 14921540 ) as a paradigmatic expression of humanistic thinking on the writing of history in the early modern period . While Vivess contribution on the method and rhetoric for history has long been recognized , my analysis distances itself from earlier studies by focusing on the properly narrative framework he proposes . Writing in the 1530s , Vives endeavors in his De ratione dicendi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , to define the ideal qualities of the historian and of historical narration , and his treatise became a touchstone for later writers on the subject , both in Spain and elsewhere . His notion of an ideal historical narrative as seeking a mirrorlike objectivity congruent with the norms of probability and of Christian belief has its sources in Augustine and places a heavy burden on the historian . For Vives , the model inquirer is a humanist sage , a sort of " terrestrial divinity " who possesses almost supernatural powers to discern the meaning of events beyond his experience and to represent them as if directly perceived . In this sense , the humanist historian for Vives would seem to possess truly fantastic powers , which must logically derive either from divine inspiration or from the resources of the imagination . Vives links the notion of the historians unnatural perception to his problematic requirements that historiography reflect a vision coherent both with the norms of probability and with the divine plan , as well as to his suggestion that history might escape what he views as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tenuous reliability of everyday discourse . In these idealizing tendencies , as well as in Vivess interchangeable use of terms such as " lies , " " fiction , " and " lying histories , " one finds the sort of imprecision that has bolstered the critical commonplace of a confusion between " history " and " story " in the sixteenth century . Vivess notions of the sweeping perceptive powers of the writer of history resurface in later preceptistas such as Cabrera de C=rdoba and Jer=nimo de San JosT , and in the ironic presentation of humanist notions on history and the historian in Cervantess Don Quixote . <p> In Chapter 2 , " Conjecture and Credibility in the Historia general y natural de las Indias by Gonzalo Fernndez de Oviedo , " I explore a number of ways in which Oviedo both bows to and reformulates the humanist norms in his work . In particular , I show how his innovative method is bound up in a critique of the idea of the historian as a distant sage . The notion of the historian ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjure up an image of the past beyond his experience and present it as if directly perceived , which has such positive connotations in the preceptive tradition , takes on a strikingly negative dimension in Oviedos work , and this author draws on the literature of reproof of superstitions to point to signs of an " unnatural " and therefore unreliable authorial perspective . Such a narrative stance employs a point of view that he associates not with the divine authority of the Christian sage , but with the more dubious conjectures of the armchair soothsayer . In asserting the importance of eyewitness experience in recording New World history , he arrives at the important view that reliability in historical narrative can be sought and measured by the author-narrators adherence to his own natural perspective , that is , by his clearly separating his own words and views from those of others . Oviedos stated refusal to mix his own words or perspective with those of the figures he seeks to represent has far-reaching consequences in terms of the structure ( or lack thereof ) of his work , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the historians authority is necessarily constrained to his natural range of vision , then he operates under considerable restrictions concerning what he can or can not assert as known and certain about the agents and events he represents . Although Oviedo does not always stick to his stated method , the systematic use of distinct perspectives and styles in his work amounts to afor the most partmethodically sustained experiment in historical representation . By the end of his voluminous account , Oviedo takes his own method one step further , urging his readers to become , in effect , model historians , and encouraging them to actively engage themselves in assessing the value of the testimony of others and to sharpen their wits and guard against the deceptions inherent in everyday discourse . One finds a similar sensibilityalbeit one expressed in terms free of the religious concerns of the earlier polemicin the contemporary critique of poststructuralism by scholars of narrative such as Martfnez Bonati , Genette , Rigney , and Cohn ( more on this later ) . <p> Chapter 3 , " Vision and Voice : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " looks at the efforts by this author to exploit and transform Oviedos methodological assumptions and versions of events , turning them against their author , as well as some of the problematic consequences ( in epistemological terms ) that result from this approach for Las Casass own adopted narrative point of view . Even as Las Casas adopts a prophetic tone that would seem to resuscitate the persona of the humanist historian , his polemics with Oviedo , while bitter , advance the understanding of boundaries in historical discourse . Amid the scathing criticisms that he often directs at his rivals , one senses an effort to gain lexical precision . In his critique of Oviedos theory of the New World as the long-lost Atlantis or Hesperides , for example , one finds a consistent effort to separate the material of classical " myth " from that of colonial history . Unlike merely entertaining fictions , Las Casas further suggests , " lies " in history belong to a more insidious form of deception , one that hints at a discrepancy between external utterance and inner belief . Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresies " of his rivals , and in this accusatory mode he presents himself as able to detect through textual evidence the inner betrayals of others . In keeping with his goal of writing an orthodox version of New World history , he portrays himself as a sort of inquisitorial prophet who is able to decipher a divine plan . His curious representation of himself ( often in the same scene ) as both eyewitness and third-person actor constitutes a return to earlier historiographical practices , even as it brings into focus important questions of textual reliability . The widely varying range of what the narrator can perceive in the Historia de las Indias lends his work a peculiar shape , one that tries not only to conform to the compelling model of the Augustinian philosophy of history , but also to answer Oviedos competing narrative experiments . A study of the complex makeup of his narrative self points as well to significant distinctions on the problem of narrative reliability in historical versus fictional texts . <p> In Chapter 4 , " History and Memory : Narrative Perspective in Bernal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nueva Espaa " ( 155081 , pub . 1632 ) , I examine a work that , although written at the margins of both empire and humanist debates over the writing of history , presents similar narrative dilemmas . To a far greater degree than the histories of Oviedo or Las Casas , the Historia verdadera emits perplexing signals as to its own discursive character . The close study of the authors narrative techniques enable us to describe with some precision the textual codes that have permitted his work to so readily be read as " literary " or even " novelistic . " In particular , Bernal Dfazs various uses of the present tense are a distinct feature of his work that signal problems of narrative distance and perspective , permitting the author in places to achieve remarkable insights into the minds of others , a characteristic commonly associated with modern works of fiction . In this sense , we can pinpoint moments in which Bernal Dfazs narrative failures ( in historiographic terms ) constitute some of his most important literary achievements . At the same time , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configurations of the existing historical tradition give evidence of a complex and properly historiographical project . <p> In focusing on debates over the " formal " and epistemological reflections of these sixteenth-century authors , I am not trying to suggest that they lacked doctrinary and political agendas , much less that their historical projects could be understood outside of the power struggles of the Spanish colonial enterprise in America . If I have not included a case from an indigenous perspective , it is not out of disinterest for those who wrote from a culturally different point of view , but rather because such an endeavor would substantially extend the reach of this project ( and likely best be approached using a different theoretical basis ) . The writers I have included for study here all wrote roughly at the same time , participated in similar debates , and confronted similar narrative dilemmas , even as they found quite different solutions to their tasks . By limiting the study to a group of writers who shared some of the same predicaments as well as familiaritygreat or minorwith the humanist program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanist rhetorical model of history challenged authors as distinct in their training and background as Oviedo and Bernal Dfaz . <p> This book intends to break new ground in two ways : by bringing to light a critical line of thinking on the part of early historians of the Indies , and by indicating the ways in which this line of thinking both anticipates and is clarified by more recent efforts to describe the logic and characteristics of historical writing as distinct from those of fiction . In recent decades , much of the literary study of historical texts has been inspired by the work of Hayden White and Roland Barthes , among others , concerning the role of narrative in historical writing . In its most extreme form , this approach has resulted in the reduction of history to rhetoric , as has been noted by Carlo Ginzburg , who also argues that the debate about truth that ensued from this approach is perhaps one of the most pressing intellectual issues of our times . Although Barthes and White are usually associated with the " linguistic " turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located much earlier , and Ginzburg himself has traced its philosophical lineage from the ancient sophists through the skepticism of Nietzsche . In the Anglo-American context , Nancy Partner points to the more recent shift by practitioners of the New Criticism of the 1950s , consisting of a movement away from searching for the " authorial " intention of the literary text to focus instead on the " textual " intention . She suggests that Barthes and later White essentially would extend these insights , which , in the context of New Criticism had been applied for the most part to fictive or poetic texts , to historiography in their attempt to conceptualize textual intention as the locus of the meaning not just in fiction , but in history as well . <p> Whites works in particular have played a central role in the narrative turn in historical studies of the last three decades , and any attempt to sum them up runs some risk of oversimplification , as Richard Vann has noted . Vann points out that Whites adoption of the essay form has meant that his positions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White himself has resisted requests for clarification on some of the evident ambiguities . A case in point is the notable imprecision with which White consistently has equated the writing of history with that of fiction . In an early essay , titled " The Fictions of Factual Representation , " which was included in The Tropics of Discourse : Essays in Cultural Criticism ( 1978 ) , he writes : " historical events differ from fictional events in the ways that it has been conventional to characterize their differences since Aristotle , " but goes on to argue that in their narrative dimensions , historical texts are essentially " fictions " that purport to represent historical facts . In another essay included in this collection , " The Historical Text as Literary Artifact , " he suggests that the same set of historical events could serve as a basis for a narrative configuration that could be either tragic or comic , and that the mode of representation chosen by the historian is " essentially a literary , that is to say , fiction-making , operation . " Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are as much invented as found and the forms of which have more in common with their counterparts in literature than they have with those in the sciences . " Elsewhere in this essay , he equates the " fictive " aspects of historical discourse with ideology . The ideological misuse of history is a concern to which White returns in " The Politics of Historical Representation , " included in The Content of the Form : Narrative Discourse and Historical Representation ( 1987 ) , where , in addressing critics who have accused him of promoting a " debilitating relativism , " he seems to suggest that even factually inaccurate ( and " morally offensive " ) versions of history may play a valid role in nationalistic or revisionist politics . Although in this regard he professes concern for the need to " discipline " the role of the imagination in history to keep it in line with the " rules " of evidence , he states that in his or her inventive faculty , the historian is taken over by " an operation exactly like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her text . Although White somewhat tempers his use of terms such as fiction in later works , he continues to argue , in Figural Realism ( 1999 ) , that literary and historical discourse " are more similar than different since both operate language in such a way that any clear distinction between their discursive form and their interpretive content remains impossible . " Variations in expression on this problem aside , Whites basic tenets boil down to the idea that historiography is a kind of rhetorical discourse more concerned with political effectiveness and persuasion than with truth , and that like fiction , it presents a self-contained textual world . Further , one could say that Whites own formulations of the problemand many of the critical studies inspired by his modelare characterized by the prominence of the loose use of terms such as " fiction " and " rhetoric " in attempting to account for the role of narrative in historical writing . <p> If the broad effect of the narrative turn in contemporary criticism can generally be said to have led to a remarkable range of interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forceful critiques of Whites views have not always crossed traditional disciplinary divides . Several of these critiques have focused on Whites lack of terminological and conceptual precision . Ginzburg , for example , argues that the rhetorical approach in historical studies represented by White has engaged in a telling misunderstanding of the concept of " rhetoric . " This critic devotes a good part of History , Rhetoric , and Proof to recovering what he sees as the foundational concept in Aristotles Rhetoric : the notion that evidence and proof are the definitive ingredients in the discourse of history . Ginzburg argues in essence that proof and evidence are in Aristotle the building blocks for all rhetorical discourse , including history , but that this central concept has been frequently obscured by the notion of rhetoric as a purely persuasive or politically expedient discourse only tenuously connected to the notion of truth . Likewise , literary theorists critical of Whites views have pointed to the wide range of meanings associated with the word fiction . In The Distinction of Fiction Cohn notes the commonplace contemporary confusion in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " untruth " to " all literature " or " all narrative . " She argues that this conflation of terms " is weighted with considerable ideological freight , " and is a product of the contemporary critique of the intellectual grounding of traditional historical practice . <p> So much has been written on this latest episode in the age-old quarrel between history and fiction that any attempt to summarize will fall short . What I would like to highlight here is the contribution of theorists who have argued that the concept of fictionality itself is crucial for understanding the nature of the boundaries between historical and fictive narrative . My own approach will highlight the ideas of Martfnez Bonati , Cohn , and Rigney , whose diverse contributions in accounting for the kinds of imagination that go into historical writing have not , perhaps , been widely recognized . I share with them the idea that it is a mistake to equate the narrative or representational aspects of historical writing with the concept of fictionality . The notion that poetic or fictive discourse is distinct from other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Aristotle it already appears under the clear-cut category of mimesis . In the context of twentieth-century debates , I will draw on FTlix Martfnez Bonatis philosophical account of the distinctive character of fiction , which was first published in 1960 . In this book , and in later essays on the subject , Martfnez Bonati argues that fiction is logically and ontologically distinct from all other kinds of discourse . He posits that the imaginary quality of the fictive narrator and fictions freedom from referential constraints are the fundamental phenomena that distinguish fictive or poetic works from all other types of discourse . Both Rigney and Cohn expand on the implications of the concept of fictionality for understanding the workings of historical narrative . Cohn in particular draws on the work of Martfnez Bonati to specify that , unlike the imaginary narrators of fiction , the writer of history tells his or her tale in his or her own voice , or at least takes responsibility for the account , and refers to events and individuals that by definition are assumed by both author and reader to have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , historical discourse is similar to other forms of nonfictional discourse and to many speech acts of everyday communication . This apparently simple distinction concerning voice has vast logical consequences for what the historian can assert as known and certain and , thus , for the range of his or her voice and vision and , in particular , for the portrayal of character or actors in history . Finally , Cohn echoes the sorts of concerns mentioned by Ginzburg in reminding us that unlike fictional narrative , which has been traditionally studied as having two levels ( story and discourse ) , the territory of historiography is necessarily circumscribed by a third level largely irrelevant in the works of imagination : that of facts , evidence , sources , and their relationship to narrative . By juxtaposing the views of these scholars to those of writers from the conflictive sixteenth-century colonial context , I hope not just to excavate and illuminate an early and valuable critical tradition in Hispanic intellectual history , but also to update discussions of colonial Spanish American historiography with regard to recent theoretical discussions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my knowledge , have not been applied to the context of early modern historiography . <p> While the rhetorical analysis of the chronicles of the Indies has led to an important body of critical work , one to which in many ways I am indebted , it is still a relatively new field whose assumptions and practices have yet to be fully examined . My approach in Territories of History is neither to take on the problem of distinctions between history and fiction in a theoretical fashion , nor to suggest that such boundaries are entirely fixed . My study , rather , consists of an analysis of key sixteenth-century historiographical accounts of the New World , which themselves problematize the relationship of history versus fiction . By juxtaposing the insights of our own era to the epistemological and narratological concerns that pervade these foundational texts of early modern Spanish colonialism , I highlight a common spirit of inquiry and , more generally , test the findings of recent critical efforts to characterize historiographical as opposed to fictional narrative . In their attempts at historiographical orthodoxy as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here invite one to contemplate problems of boundaries in discourse . Given that the recovery of the cr=nicas de Indias as part of the " literary " Spanish American tradition has coincided with , or perhaps even anticipated , the larger poststructuralist questioning of what constitutes " history , " it is important to find such vigorous reflection , debate , and borderline experimentation within these foundational works themselves . In Myth and Archive : A Theory of Latin American Narrative , Roberto Gonzlez Echevarrfa has argued that the " relationships that narrative establishes with non-literary forms of discourse are much more productive and determining than those it has with its own tradition . " If this is indeed the case , it is all the more urgent to understand the particularly narrative characteristics of these " non-literary " forms , as well as the imaginative ways in which they become integrated in the literary heritage . In this regard , the analytical tools that help to underscore discursive boundaries may also assist in describing the manners in which the material of history becomes transformed both into fiction and into a literary tradition .

These holdings , which primarily consist of the collections of several generous donors and remain remarkably intact , reflect the unique connection between American collectors and French artists during this period .

We thank State Archivist Edward Papenfuse and Curator Elaine Rice Bachman for their generous cooperation . <p> Together , all these collections span the nineteenth and early twentieth century , offering the full spectrum of draftsmanship , from preliminary sketches to highly finished drawings and watercolors .

The term French has been interpreted broadly in order to be as inclusive as possible . Certainly , artists who were born and worked in France make up the bulk of the content of the collections considered here . Also included are artists from other countries who were either naturalized citizens of France , as in the case of Karl Bodmer , or who were taught or worked extensively in that country , such as Mary Cassatt and Ary Scheffer .

" Reims is tallerand narrowerthan Chartres . The breathtaking verticality is held in repose by the horizontal accents of the sculpted capitals and the triforium , as well as by the insistent linear grid of colonnettes and stringcourses ( fig. 3 ) . Regularity and consistency in the detailing impart clarity , elegance , and rhythm to the dynamic vertical thrust . The traceried windows are the most original element in this impressive interior . Two rows of windows , the aisle bays below and the clerestories above , all but eliminate wall surface . Each of these arched wall openings has tracery dividing it into paired lancets surmounted by a six-lobed rosette , the interstices between these elements also pierced for glazing . The repetitive doublet-and-rose design binds floor to high vault , while the enhanced dimensions of the clerestoriesaround fourteen meters tall contribute lightness to the rising space . This is a book about what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are studiable . Well before 1825by the mideighteenth centurythe aisle bays had been stripped of their glazing , and no description exists of their subjects or even of formats . That is , we do not know whether the lower windows contained medallions , resembling Chartres or Bourges , or if any of them held grisailles combined with larger figures , as in the axial chapel of Auxerre . Until 1914 the clerestories and the great rose windows survived in some form or reconstruction , and observers made notes and drawings of them . The glass that survived the war , and what was remade thereafter , benefited from the cataloging project of the French Corpus Vitrearum , published in Recensement IV in 1992 . The Recensements very useful bay-numbering system has been adopted in this book ( see fig. 4 ) . <p> The heavy international publicity attendant upon the extensive restorations of the 1920s30s discouraged scholarly interest in the stained glass of Reims .

In 1988fifty years after the completion of his workan appreciation was mounted in the form of an exhibition at Reims accompanied by a publication , RebGtir Reims : La collection photographique Henri Deneux 1870/1938 , edited by Isabelle Balsamo et al . And in 1995 one of Deneuxs descendants donated to the BibliothFque municipale de Reims a precious collection of fifty autochrome photographs detailing the windows , made following the initial bombardments of 1914 . As Sylvie Balcon-Berry has made clear , these pioneer color imageswhile not all sharp or legiblenonetheless allow us to establish the precision and accuracy of the postwar restorations . They are particularly valuable for the nave , where repairs were abandoned for the twelve bays most severely ruined ( Bays 130 through 141 ) . Only the clerestories in the four easternmost nave bays now contain stained glass ; the blankglazing filling the remainder is a stark reminder of what has been lost . <p> The accuracy of the restorations was possible because the glazier Jacques Simon had at his disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his grandfather Pierre and his father Paul Simon , previously in charge of the cathedral glass . Begun in 1848 , these frottis were made directly from the surface of the glass . Paul Simon published several in 1911 ( see my bibliography ) ; a few more exist in copies in the BibliothFque municipale de Reims . These fragile and unwieldy documents have remained in private ownership . I join my voice to those of Balcon-Berry and Peter Kurmann in hoping that the means will be found to inventory , digitalize , and preserve them . A volume on Reims cathedral under the auspices of the French Corpus Vitrearum would then be possible . <p> This book has a different purpose , sustained by the resources noted above as well as by careful reassessment of the evidence left by nineteenth-century witnesses . The subject programs of the Reims glass are the primary focus here , and they are considerably more complex and sophisticated than has been recognized . Their careful investigation is coordinated with current scholarship in the liturgy , historical documentation , physical environment of the cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of advancing our understanding of this great enterprise : the who , when , why , and how of it . <p> Chapter 1 provides an entry to these perspectives . Because the cathedrals subject programs are set forth in the rosaces crowning the lancets , chapter 2 discusses the iconographic importance and uniqueness of the apostles cycles in the chevet rosaces . They are the most complete ensemble since the mosaics of San Marco and emphasize the themes of Faith and Charity opposing Heresy and Avarice . Chapter 3 follows with the iconography and sequential production of the chevet lancets , the arguments based on program , timing of patronage , and style .

Velzquez painted the Adoration in 1619 , when he was a twenty-year-old artist embarking upon his career in Seville . In the Adoration , the holy family , the three magi , and a member of the magis entourage appear beneath an archway in a dusky landscape . ( The paint has darkened over time , making the background difficult to see . ) The figures are rendered with strong colors and intense contrasts of light and shade , which emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful young woman clad in rose and blue , her voluminous drapery falling in angular folds across her body . On her lap sits the Christ Child : the focal point of the composition and the center of illumination . Wrapped in swaddling clothes , the child is plump and rosy cheeked , and he looks with wide eyes at the young magus before him . In turn , the magus genuflects as he proffers his gift , a shining chalice painted with brilliant flashes of illumination . Behind him , the elderly magus is shown in profile , the rough texture of his weathered skin painted with thick brushstrokes heavily laden with impasto . Above them stands the third , middle-aged magus : a black African . He is dressed more sumptuously than any other figure in the composition , with a dangling red-and-gold earring , a long crimson mantle , and a white lace collar . The brightness of his collar draws attention to his face , itself rendered with intricate brushwork , detailing the crease in his brow and the bags beneath his eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his intense gaze helps to draw the beholder into the composition . <p> The Adoration represented a new approach to painting in early seventeenth-century Seville . For Velzquezs contemporaries , the artists youthful works exemplified " the true imitation of nature . " According to early modern theorists , this " true imitation " referred to an ability to paint works of art that displayed not only verisimilitude but the illusion of material reality itself . Those same theorists , however , would also have understood that Velzquezs paintings , although firmly grounded in nature , were not literal transcriptions of visible reality . Like Christian paintings by nearly all seventeenth-century artists , Velzquezs Adoration represented a synthesis of myriad visual sources , an awareness of religious doctrine , and a knowledge of prevailing standards of decorum . Yet Velzquez contended with these considerations in new ways . In the Adoration , he affirmed the veracity of the biblical story through his " true imitation of nature , " as exemplified by the sculptural presence of the figures , the imperfections of their features , and the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregrounditself a reference to the crown of thorns . <p> The Adoration epitomizes the interplay between extraordinary innovation and pictorial convention in Velzquezs early works . Velzquezs ability to blend novelty and tradition was rooted in , if not reducible to , his artistic training and early career in Seville . During his youth , Velzquez apprenticed with the erudite artist and theorist Francisco Pacheco ( 15641644 ) . In Pachecos workshop , he learned to use his study of nature in capturing the power of sacred histories and in rendering the likenesses of illustrious contemporaries . As a young artist , Velzquez adopted and synthesized different genres of painting , combining exalted biblical images with lowly kitchen scenes and representing Christ and the saints in concert with the kitchen servants and African slaves who worked in Seville . Velzquez thus abandoned the style and sometimes even subject matter embraced by most Sevillian artists , including Pacheco himself . In his early works , however , he also demonstrated a close critical engagement with the artistic practices , religious faith , and social mores of his native Seville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in 1599 , Seville was the most culturally vibrant city in Golden Age Spain ( fig. 2 ) . During the artists youth , it was the largest metropolis in Spain and among the largest in Europe , boasting a population as high as 130,000 or 140,000one comparable to those of Venice and Amsterdam and not far behind those of London and Paris . For contemporaries , Seville remained far more urbane than Madrid , a small town that had become the Spanish capital only in 1561 . Among other important cultural figures , two of the greatest writers of the day , Lope de Vega and Miguel de Cervantes , lived for extended periods in Seville . <p> The particular importance of Seville was predicated upon its status as the center of trade between the Iberian Peninsula and the vast reaches of the Spanish empire . From 1503 until 1717 , Seville served as the main Spanish port to the Americas and as the seat of the Casa de la Contrataci=n de las Indias ( House of Trade with the Indies ) , the institution responsible for regulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international trade , the city enjoyed spectacular wealthenough so that one early modern writer claimed that its very streets could have been paved with the gold and other precious metals brought there from the Americas . Sevilles prosperity also contributed to its thriving artistic and intellectual life . Merchants from northern Europe and Italy flooded the city , bringing with them foreign paintings , prints , sculptures , and books . In the sixteenth century , artists such as the Fleming Pedro de Campaa ( 15031580 ) and the Italian Pietro Torrigiano ( 14721528 , the sculptor who broke Michelangelos nose ) imported new artistic styles to Seville . At the same time , artists produced images for the scores of monasteries and convents built during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , and local merchants and aristocrats commissioned works of art to decorate their homes . During Velzquezs youth , the prominent Sevillian nobleman the Duke of Alcal ( one of the artists early patrons ) assembled one of the finest private art collections in Spain : one containing ancient sculptures , works by Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its wealth , however , Velzquezs Seville was also riddled with social problems . As in other prosperous early modern cities , the wealthy Sevillian minority lived side by side with throngs of destitute laborers , servants , and beggars . In keeping with its role as a port to the Americas , Seville was a hub for the transatlantic slave trade . Slave ships headed for the colonies regularly stopped there , and Africans on board were bought and sold by local Spaniards . By the late sixteenth century , the majority of Sevillian upper- and middle-class householdsincluding that of Velzquezs fatherowned slaves of sub-Saharan African ancestry . A number of civic and ecclesiastical authorities feared slave uprisings , associating all " blacks " with a " natural inclination to public crimes . " This was a point of contention , however , and other Church officials argued that Christian salvation could be attained by Africans and Europeans alike . <p> In Velzquezs day , historians and religious thinkers in Seville , like those elsewhere in Spain , were also contending with their citys complicated past . Seville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it had been home to Jews and Muslims until 1492 , when members of those communities were forced either to convert to Christianity or face exile from Spain . When Velzquez was ten years old , the Spanish Crown initiated its mass expulsion of the remaining moriscos ( people of Muslim descent ) , an event that the artist would later commemorate in a painting ( now lost ) for King Philip IV . Sevillian men of letters responded to Spains Jewish and Muslim legacy in part by rewriting its history . Pachecos friends , including the humanist Rodrigo Caro and the cleric Juan de Fonseca y Figueroa ( one of Velzquezs patrons ) , thus embraced contemporary discoveries that supposedly demonstrated the acceptance of Christianity by Spaniards during apostolic times . Their efforts paralleled those of Sevilles powerful archbishop , Pedro de Castro y Quiones , who ardently defended the authenticity of a group of purportedly ancient relics found near Granada . ( The findings championed by these men were soon shown to be forgeries . ) Significantly , even some of those engaged in revising Spanish history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sevilles upper and middle classes , Fonseca himself was of converso ( converted Jewish ) ancestry , and his family had spent more than a century trying to remove the evidence of this " stain " from its lineage . <p> In their concern with Spains religious history , seventeenth-century Sevillians also upheld the tenets of the Catholic Reformation . The bishops at the Council of Trent ( 154563 ) placed particular emphasis upon reviving and maintaining the traditions of the early Church , among them the use of sacred images in instruction and devotion . Consistent with their focus on ancient Christian traditions , the Tridentine bishops stressed the importance of adhering to what they perceived as the veracity of scripture and other canonical texts . In order to fill the gaps left by those accounts , theologians , antiquarians , and artists began to investigate the history of the early Church . Catholic painters were now compelled to represent images of Christ and the saints in strict accordance with textual and pictorial evidence that demonstrated the historical " truth " of the events depicted . Pacheco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Pacheco and his friend Francisco de Rioja , the renowned poet and priest , sought to ascertain the precise manner of Christs Crucifixion . Through a careful study of ancient texts and images , they discovered that Christ would have been crucified with four nails rather than the three nails usually depicted by artists . Pacheco therefore began representing the Crucifixion with four nails ( fig. 3 ) , " conforming in everything , " as Rioja stated , " to what is said by the ancient writers . " As Jonathan Brown has shown , Sevillian painters followed this practice for decades to come . Velzquez himself adopted Pachecos iconography in his emotive Christ on the Cross ( fig. 4 ) , painted nearly a decade after he left Seville . <p> It was within this complex framework of Golden Age Seville that Velzquez was raised . On June 6 , 1599 , he was baptized in the Sevillian parish church of San Pedro , the first of eight children born to Juan Rodrfguez de Silva and Ger=nima Velzquez . The artists maternal grandfather , Juan Velzquez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods to the Americas . In 1596 , Juan Velzquez spent time in debtors prison , but that same year he also offered a large dowry for the marriage of his daughter , Ger=nima . On the paternal side of the family , Velzquezs grandparents are thought to have hailed from Portugal , but little about them is known . The artists father , Juan Rodrfguez , held the post of chief testamentary notary for Sevilles cathedral chapter , which was a lucrative position that required a primary education and held some measure of prestige . <p> Despite his middle-class background , Velzquez fashioned himself as a gentleman and claimed noble parentage later in life . Noble ancestry was requisite for winning an honor pursued by Velzquez from at least the 1630s : admission to the exclusive military Order of Santiago , which conferred knighthoods upon its members . Those seeking admission needed to be of noble blood and of exclusively " old Christian " ancestry . They were also required to prove that neither they nor their parents or grandparents had " practiced . . . manual or base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . . . embroiderer , stonecutter . " As Brown has shown , Velzquez sought throughout his career to transcend his humble origins and at the same time demonstrate that painting was not a " base , " but rather a noble , profession . The artist finally succeeded in 1659 , a year before his death , when he was awarded the knighthood that he so ardently desired . <p> Given the available information on Velzquezs family and on the circumstances of his admission to Santiago , it has been argued that the artist himself was of converso lineage . The evidence for this is intriguing , if circumstantial ; it is perhaps suggested by the occupations of Velzquezs father ( a notary ) and maternal grandfather ( a merchant ) , by the Portuguese origins of his paternal grandparents , and by the artists own attempt to obstruct the Order of Santiagos investigation of his Portuguese relatives . Yet it is important not to exaggerate the significance of Velzquezs religious and ethnic ancestry . Whatever their background , the members of Velzquezs familylike most seventeenth-century Spanish conversoswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the careers of Velzquez and his father . During his years in Seville , Velzquez worked largely as a painter of religious images . Throughout his own life , Juan Rodrfguez de Silva moved up the hierarchy of functionaries employed by the Church , and he was eventually appointed to the coveted position of secretary to Sevilles ecclesiastical judge . <p> Velzquez and the " Gilded Cage " <p> Despite the modest social status of his family , the young Velzquezs association with Pacheco helped him to gain a privileged place in Sevillian society . By all accounts , Pachecos studio represented a rarefied artistic and cultural milieu . In 1647 , three years after Pacheco died , his friend Rodrigo Caro famously emphasized the role played by Pacheco in Sevillian intellectual life . Caro described Pacheco as " a celebrated painter in this city , whose studio was a regular academy of the most cultured minds ingenios of Seville and elsewhere . " <p> Caros remark was later adopted in the first published biography of Velzquez , which was included in the volume of artists lives in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the court painter and native Andalusian Antonio Palomino . Borrowing from Caro , Palomino described Pachecos studio as " a gilded cage of art , academy , and school of the best minds of Seville . " In this context , a " gilded cage " is analogous to an ivory tower : a place where intellectuals devote themselves fully to their studies . Palomino also contended that , while under Pachecos tutelage , Velzquez assiduously studied the theory and practice of painting by consulting the works of " various authors " who wrote " on the elegant precepts of art " and by engaging in the " continual exercise of drawing dibujo , the fundamental element of painting and the principal gateway to art . " ( For contemporaries , the term dibujo was roughly equivalent to the Italian disegno , referring both to the practice of drawing and to its intellectual underpinnings . ) The remarks included in Palominos life of Velzquez are important both for their biographical data and for the insight they provide into the reception of Velzquezs art in the decades following his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also valuable because it relies heavily on a lost biography of Velzquez written by the artists own pupil , Juan de Alfaro ( 16431680 ) . Finally , Palomino provides vivid descriptions of several of Velzquezs early works and helps to locate them within the framework of Sevillian painting . <p> In a groundbreaking study published in 1978 , Jonathan Brown demonstrated that Pachecos studio was not a formal academy but rather a meeting place for a group of friends : " a casual but cohesive association of poets , scholars , and painters . " Throughout this book , I use the term " Pachecos circle " to emphasize the loose connections that united this erudite group of men . During Velzquezs youth , no official academies of art as yet existed in Spain , despite several attempts to found one in early seventeenth-century Madrid . The term " academy " ( academia ) as employed by Caro and Palomino must therefore be understood in its broader sense , meaning a place where painters studied artistic theory and practice and " where men of distinguished minds came together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendship was particularly important to Pachecos associates , who referred to one another as amigos , buenos amigos ( good friends ) , and doctos amigos ( learned friends ) and relied on each other for intellectual and artistic collaboration . <p> More recently , scholars have expanded the portrait of Pachecos circle and of Velzquezs place within it . Two exhibitions of Velzquezs Sevillian paintings ( held in 1995 and 1999 ) have provided rare opportunities for comparing works by the young artist to those by Pacheco and other Sevillians . The catalogues accompanying the exhibitions have also presented new perspectives on Velzquezs intellectual formation and his engagement with the traditions of Sevillian painting . In a monographic study of the young Velzquez , Luis MTndez Rodrfguez has brought to light a wealth of documentary evidence on the artists early life , revealing new information about his finances and showing that he took on an apprenticea certain Diego Melgarin 1620 . MTndez Rodrfguez has also demonstrated the lifelong ties that developed between Velzquezs father and Pacheco ; throughout the years , the two men assisted each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva who arranged for Pachecos burial in 1644 . Jeremy Roe has offered important insights into Velzquezs Sevillian period by examining the writings of Pachecos learned friends . Specifically , he has illuminated little-known texts by Francisco de Rioja , Juan de Juregui , and Juan de Fonseca , Sevillians who would also assist Velzquezs early career in Madrid . In addition , Vicente Lle= Caal and others have demonstrated that Pachecos circle included not only poets and theologians but also cosmographers involved in astronomy and mapmaking at the Casa de la Contrataci=n . <p> Although this scholarship has proved fundamental in elucidating the milieu in which Velzquez was trained , discussions of cultural context have often taken precedence over analyses of the artists paintings themselves . In this study , I therefore seek to bring an investigation of the cultural and social frameworks of Velzquezs career to bear upon a careful consideration of specific works of art . By placing renewed emphasis on questions of imagery and style , this book explores the ways in which Velzquezs paintings developed in relation to the vibrant culture of seventeenth-century Seville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying Velzquezs early paintings , however , is presented by the question of precisely which works can be attributed to the artist . This issue has recently come to the fore with regard to three images ascribed to the young Velzquez by various scholars : an Education of the Virgin ( fig. 5 ) at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven , a Saint John the Baptist at the Art Institute of Chicago ( fig. 6 ) , and an Immaculate Conception ( fig. 7 ) at the Centro Velzquez in Seville . John Marciari first published the Education of the Virgin in 2010 , hailing it as a major addition to Velzquezs oeuvre , but the attribution has been contested by Jonathan Brown , who has disparaged the paintings " poor quality " and asserted that it " can not possibly be the work of the master . " Art historians also remain divided on the authorship of Saint John the Baptist , which has been given to Velzquez by specialists including Javier Ports and Peter Cherry but is simply deemed a product of the school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of scholars have agreed on attributing the Seville Immaculate Conception to Velzquez , with a notable dissension by Alfonso PTrez Snchez , who has ascribed the painting to Velzquezs friend and Pachecos sometime pupil Alonso Cano . <p> The attribution of paintings is a notoriously subjective undertaking , and scholars will doubtless continue to debate the authorship of these three works . To my mind , however , all were painted by Velzquezs Sevillian contemporaries and followers , rather than by the artist himself . In terms of style , these paintings differ in important ways from Velzquezs early production , even as they recall his youthful imitation of nature , strong chiaroscuro , and use of particular iconographical motifs . Unlike the exquisitely composed and technically virtuosic paintings by the young Velzquez , the Education of the Virgin is imbalanced in its composition and almost sloppy in its depiction of heads and hands . In contrast to Velzquezs careful rendering of textures and sensitive portrayal of faces , the still-life elements in Saint John are painted with haphazard brushstrokes , and the Baptist himself is an expressionless man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the composition represents a clear borrowing from Velzquezs autograph version of the theme ( fig. 10 ) , but its depiction of the Virgin suggests the hand of another artist , perhaps indeed Cano . Whereas Velzquezs Mary is a slim girl with a demure countenance and a delicately pretty face , her counterpart in the Seville painting is a bulky figure with bland , ill-defined features . <p> Although probably not painted by Velzquez , works such as the Education of the Virgin , Saint John the Baptist , and the Seville Immaculate Conception are relevant in elucidating the broader artistic context in which he operated . Surely painted by artists active in Seville during or not long after Velzquezs time there , these images are useful in shaping an understanding of the seventeenth-century painters who imitated the young artist . At various points throughout this book , I address the questionone still little understoodof Velzquezs early followers and copyists . Although I focus on works that are universally ascribed to Velzquez , I have considered questions of attribution when exploring broader issues regarding the artists Sevillian production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all the advances in scholarship , then , Velzquezs youth in Seville remains the least understood period of his long career . Beginning at least with Palomino , critics and scholars have acknowledged that Pacheco and his friends played important roles in Velzquezs intellectual formation . But what those roles were remains unknown . This problem is especially difficult because Velzquez developed a pictorial style bearing little resemblance to Pachecos ( see especially figs. 3 , 12 ) . Modern art historians have generally agreed with Palomino , who contended that Velzquez admired Pachecos " erudition " but rejected his " tepid " manner of painting . In general terms , Palominos assertion is surely correct ; Velzquez did abandon his teachers artistic style , even as he came to personify the cultured artist advocated by Pacheco . <p> Yet Palominos statement leaves a number of important questions unanswered . To what extent did Velzquez share the particular theoretical concerns of Pacheco and his friends ? In what ways did Velzquez engage with their works ? Is this engagement evident in his paintings ? Can the writings of Pachecos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions ? Do the young artists paintings conform to the doctrinaire , post-Tridentine precepts so emphasized by Pacheco and his associates ? If so , why do they bear so little resemblance to the works of other contemporary Sevillian artists ? <p> Master and Pupil <p> In order to begin answering these questions , it is important to understand the particular relationship between Velzquez and Pacheco . Velzquez entered Pachecos studio in 1611 at the age of twelve , a fairly standard age for artists to begin the six-year training stipulated ( but not always enforced ) by the Sevillian painters guild . Like many apprentices , Velzquez lived in his teachers house for the duration of his training , and Pacheco assumed responsibility for providing his charge with " food , drink , clothing , and shoes . " Although little is known about the division of labor in Spanish workshops , Velzquez probably assumed the same responsibilities as apprentices elsewhere in Europe , who began by mastering their skills as draftsmen and eventually collaborated on studio commissions , painting secondary elements such as landscapes and still-life objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of conjecture . In his Museo pict=rico , Palomino contends that Velzquez had studied letters ( buenas letras ) before beginning his apprenticeship , and scholars have plausibly suggested that he attended one of the local Jesuit schools , which dominated primary education in Catholic Europe . If so , the young Velzquez would have learned to read and write in Spanish and rudimentary Latin , acquiring an education comparable to that of his father . Adding to the mystery of Velzquezs earliest years , however , scholars have also speculated that he began his artistic training before entering Pachecos studio . In fact , the contract of 1611 indicates that Velzquezs apprenticeship was already under way , having begun " on the first of December of this past year of 1610 . " This date is significant because around that time Pacheco embarked on one of the few extended journeys of his life , traveling northward to Madrid , El Escorial , and Toledo , where he famously met El Greco . Perhaps providing a clue to Velzquezs activities in the intervening months , Palomino argues that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparently irascible Sevillian artist Francisco de Herrera before fleeing to Pachecos studio . In his writings , Pacheco himself may allude to Herrera when he decries the " temerity " of a certain " someone who has sought to claim this glory i.e. , of having trained Velzquez and thus rob me of my laurels in my final years . " <p> Whatever Velzquezs previous education and artistic training , it is clear that Pacheco played the most significant role in the young painters professional development . Evidence suggests that Pacheco was a dedicated and effective teacher . In the prologue to his monumental treatise , the Arte de la pintura ( 1649 ) , Pacheco emphasizes his " desire to teach , " and throughout the text ( especially when discussing religious iconography ) he addresses the needs of painters still learning their art . He also devotes an entire section of the Arte to the training of " three levels of painters , " in which he describes a method of instruction meant to guide the most talented students from the rank of " beginners , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect " painters , capable of inventing their own compositions . Perhaps significantly , Pacheco also helped to train other well-known artists . For example , the painter , sculptor , and architect Alonso Cano spent time in Pachecos studio , where he would have supplemented the education he received from his father , who specialized in designing altarpieces . According to Palomino , the ill-tempered Francisco de Herrera similarly apprenticed under Pacheco . Like Cano , Herrera probably studied with his father ( an engraver and manuscript illuminator ) , but he may have learned to paint large-scale subjects in Pachecos workshop . Finally , Pacheco was the teacher of Francisco L=pez Caro . Palomino describes L=pez Caro as a gifted portraitist , but the artists work is known today only through a signed bodeg=n once attributed to Velzquez . Velzquezs own apprenticeship coincided with those of Cano and L=pez Caro , and he apparently developed long-standing relationships with each of them , who both testified in favor of his admission to the Order of Santiago . <p> Although Pacheco helped to train various painters , the Arte reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long tradition of praising the teachers of famous men , Pacheco compares his relationship with Velzquez to those of various important masters and the pupils who surpassed them . He explains , " I do not consider it discrediting when the student surpasses the master . . . Leonardo da Vinci did not lose in having Raphael for a disciple , nor Giorgione da Castelfranco in having Titian , nor Plato in having Aristotle . " For those familiar with Pachecos paintings , it may seem presumptuous for the artist to compare himself to Leonardo ( who was not , in fact , Raphaels teacher ) and Giorgione . But this statement also sheds light on Pachecos conception of what constitutes a great painter . With these comments , Pacheco likens himself and Velzquez not only to celebrated artists but also to famous philosophers . In so doing , he suggests that he and his student are consummate practitioners of painting as well as men of formidable intellect . As indicated by these comparisons , Pachecos treatise asserts that the best artists are those who combine practical skills with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Velzquez remained intimately connected to Pacheco through familial and professional bonds . In 1618 , Velzquez married Pachecos daughter , Juana . Pacheco contends that he encouraged the match because he had lofty expectations for his former pupil . He explains that after the conclusion of Velzquezs " education and instruction I married him to my daughter because of his virtue , purity of blood , and good qualities , and because of the promise of his natural and great ingenio . " ( For Velzquezs contemporaries , the term ingenio referred to a " natural force of the intellect " needed for the creation and understanding of the various " subtleties " and " inventions " found in works of art , literature , and other fields . ) It is possible that this emphasis on " purity " represented an effort to dispel questions about Velzquezs ancestry . In any case , Velzquezs marriage followed a practice common in Seville and throughout Europe , in which such alliances allowed young artists to benefit from the patronage networks established by their masters . <p> From his earliest years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painting works for the Duke of Alcal , Juan de Fonseca y Figueroa , and for religious institutions whose members formed part of Pachecos circle . Indeed , Pachecos friends would continue to support Velzquezs career even after his move to court in 1623 . Pacheco himself lived in Madrid with Velzquez and his wife from 1624 until 1626 , when Velzquez tried in vain to secure him a position as royal painter . An examination of the Arte also indicates that the two men remained in close contact until Pachecos death , in 1644 . In 1643five years after the Arte was completedPacheco added a marginal note to his finished treatise , boasting of his son-in-laws new status as the kings gentleman of the chamber ( ayuda de cmara ) . Two years later , Pachecos widow moved to Madrid and lived with her daughter and son-in-law until she died , in 1647 . <p> The Arte de la pintura and Pachecos Circle <p> Given the relationship between master and pupil , it is hardly surprising that writings by Pacheco provide the fullest account of Velzquezs place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here because Pacheco worked on the text throughout Velzquezs youth . He began writing the treatise at the beginning of the seventeenth century , and he published several fragments in the late 1610s and early 1620s , finally completing the text in 1638 . Pachecos treatise is important not only for the pieces of information it provides on Velzquez but also for the crucial insight it offers into the critical context in which his most promising student developed his art . <p> The Arte indicates the broad scope of artistic discourse available to the young Velzquez . Modeled in part on late sixteenth-century Italian treatises , the Arte is divided into three discursive books dealing respectively with the history , theory , and practice of painting . The final book also includes a long appendix on religious iconography , the " Adiciones a algunas imgines " ( Additions to Some Images ) . In his superb critical edition of the text , Bonaventura Bassegoda has highlighted the wealth of source material employed by Pacheco , who was conversant with most of the Italian and northern European artistic treatises published before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , works ranging from Giorgio Vasaris Vite ( 1568 ed. ) to Ludovico Dolces Aretino ( 1557 ) and Giovanni Lomazzos Trattato della pittura ( 1584 ) . In his consideration of sacred paintings , Pacheco expands upon the works of Catholic reformers such as Johannes Molanus and Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti , both of whose works emphasize the function of religious images . He also frequently cites the authority of the Adnotationes et meditationes in Evangelia ( 1595 ) by Ger=nimo Nadal , and he admonishes artists to consult the engravings accompanying the textadvice that was taken by the young Velzquez . <p> The Arte furthermore provides a vivid picture of intellectual life in Velzquezs Seville . Brown has shown that the treatise not only represents an expansion of Italian artistic theory ; it is also a direct product of the exchanges conducted by members of Pachecos circle . In the Arte , Pacheco continually alludes to his associates and their writings , and he often synthesizes the scholarship of these local experts with that of artistic theorists from Italy and elsewhere . For example , he emphasizes his close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Sevillian Jesuits , who shared his belief in the importance of sacred images . He also routinely invokes the learning of his personal friend Pablo de CTspedes ( before 15481608 ) , a painter and cathedral prebendary from nearby C=rdoba . CTspedes embodied Pachecos archetype of the " erudite painter , " having trained as an artist in Rome and studied ancient languages at the prestigious University of Alcal de Henares . In addition , Pacheco makes significant use of the writings of the Sevillian poet and painter Juan de Juregui ( 15831641 ) , who likewise studied in Rome and who read and critiqued the Arte as Pacheco prepared it for publication . The local authority most frequently cited in the Arte , however , is the poet and cleric Francisco de Rioja ( 15831659 ) . We have already seen that Rioja helped Pacheco to determine the number of nails used in the Crucifixion . He also testified to the historical accuracy of the inscription on Pachecos Christ on the Cross ( fig. 3 ) , an issue that sparked an intense debate among Sevillian men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pachecos inscription was a " novelty " an anachronism not grounded in Christian historyit was Rioja who publicly came to the artists defense . As made clear by the Arte , Pachecos circle was held together by this strong sense of friendship and intellectual collaboration . <p> In addition to the Arte , other writings by Pacheco and his associates help to round out the picture of the environment in which Velzquez was trained . As Marta Cacho Casal has shown , Pachecos Libro de descripci=n de verdaderos retratos de ilustres y memorables varones ( Book Containing Descriptions of True Portraits of Illustrious and Memorable Men ; probably begun before 1599 ) is an important , if unfinished , treatise containing biographies and drawings of contemporary luminaries , many of them Pachecos personal friends . The Libro de Retratos ( as the text is generally known ) is especially valuable because it provides rare insight into a number of the men , many of them largely forgotten to history , who played crucial roles in shaping discourse as conducted within Pachecos circle . Pacheco also compiled his own writings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poems , short treatises , and even riddles . The manuscripts include texts on a variety of topics : among them a " Discourse in Defense of Priests with Beards " by Rioja , a dialogue on " the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady " by Pacheco , and a witty epithalamium ( a nuptial poem ) by Baltasar de Cepeda written in honor of Velzquezs wedding , an event attended by Rioja and other important local figures . <p> An examination of Pachecos circle elucidates the cultural , intellectual , and religious contexts of Velzquezs formation . As a result of his training in Seville , Velzquez became , in many ways , the paradigmatically learned painter championed by his teacher . According to Palomino , the young artist sought to " feed his mind with every kind of learning , " studying treatises from Vitruvius on architecture to Federico Zuccaro on artistic theory . Whether Velzquez actually consulted such works has been a point of contention among scholars , who have often suggested that the young artists brilliant practice seems at odds with dry academic precepts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different perspective . I argue that what is important is the young Velzquezs ability to bring his practical talents to bear on his awareness of the issues animating the world of letters . During his youth , Velzquez became intimately familiar with the intellectual discourse conducted in Pachecos studio . By the time he died , in 1660 , he possessed a library of 156 books : an extraordinary number for an artist of the time . At that point he owned most of the works that , according to Palomino , he had read as a young man . The majority of the texts in the inventory are closely related to Velzquezs artistic production . He owned works mainly on optics , perspective , and geometry , but he also possessed treatises on history , mythology , and religion . Of course , we can not know whether Velzquez read every book in his collection , but the library serves as important evidence of his intellectual predilections . As suggested by the evidence of the inventory and by the testimony of his paintings , Velzquez aspired throughout his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . <p> Yet despite his close relationship with Pacheco , Velzquez reinvented his teachers definition of a great painter . Whereas Pacheco revealed his learning through his literary works , Velzquez demonstrated a keen pictorial intelligence . Scholars have long acknowledged the role played by this quality in the dazzling technique and subtle invention of late works such as the Fable of Arachne ( fig. 8 ) and Las meninas ( fig. 9 ) . Throughout this book , I argue that Velzquezs visual intelligence is equally apparent in his Sevillian paintings . The young Velzquez used his intense study of nature in his transformation of various sources , including paintings , sculptures , mass-circulated prints , and other forms of visual culture . He also contended with issues of vital concern to Pacheco and members of his circle . Among other themes , his paintings addressed the nature of artistic creativity , the place of religion in everyday life , the role of women in the Catholic Church , and the incorporation of African slaves into Christianity . A close comparison of Velzquezs paintings with texts by local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowthus reveals the artists engagement with key topics of debate in early seventeenth-century Seville . In his early works , Velzquez explored the themes addressed in Pachecos writings , even as he defied many of his masters artistic precepts . <p> Perhaps most strikingly , Velzquez departed from Pacheco in his engagement with nature . Although Pacheco advocated the study of nature , he ( like most theorists ) admonished artists to imitate nature selectively , choosing only " the most beautiful works of God " and painting them in a " lovely manner . " For Pacheco and others , this selective imitation was exemplified by Renaissance masters such as Leonardo , Raphael , and Titian , whose figures were at once " natural " and exquisitely beautiful . The young Velzquez challenged this paradigm . In genre scenes and even in religious works , he departed from Pachecos emphasis on representing only " the best . . . and most perfect . " As we have seen , he depicted the magi in the Adoration ( fig. 1 ) as ordinary men with flawed features , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacheco reserved the highest praise for artists who followed the example of Raphael , he suggested that the realism of Velzquezs works made even the most storied masterpieces seem merely " painted " by comparison . ( I use the term " realism " instead of " naturalism " as a means of distinguishing the plain , sometimes homely types painted by Velzquez from the ideal but " natural " figures painted by Titian and others . ) For Pacheco , Velzquez achieved this " true imitation of nature " through his strong chiaroscuro and especially through his practice of paintingrather than simply drawingfrom live models . This method of " keeping to nature " was a novelty in Spain , and Pacheco argued that it helped to set Velzquezs works apart from those of " the rest . " <p> Even as a youth , Velzquez thus took an experimental approach to his art . He used his realist style in the Adoration and a number of other religious images , in which he gave shape to the truthfulness of sacred histories . The artist thematized his " true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodegones ( a term roughly equivalent to " genre scenes " ; see figs. 3940 , 44 ) , and he challenged the conventions of sacred imagery by painting " inverted " compositions ( figs. 48 , 50 ) : bodegones with small religious scenes in the backgrounds . Although some contemporaries disapproved of these innovations , Velzquezs works were coveted by Sevilles most learned and illustrious collectors . <p> Velzquezs Early Paintings <p> The convergence between Velzquezs art and Sevillian culture is explored in the five chapters that follow . In each of the first four chapters , I concentrate on an individual painting or pair of paintings , representing every genre in which the young Velzquez worked : sacred imagery , portraiture , bodegones , and " inverted " religious scenes . My concluding chapter moves from Seville to Madrid , examining the relationship between Velzquezs early works and his triumph as a court artist . By focusing most of the book on specific paintings , I am departing from the standard monographic format , in which Velzquezs career ( or a period thereof ) is examined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understanding Velzquezs development as a painter , I seek to offer the rich contextual interpretations provided by close readings of individual works of art . Insofar as possible , I therefore consider Velzquezs paintings with regard to their patrons , original locations , and early reception . Throughout , I locate Velzquezs youthful production within the historical , social , religious , and artistic contexts of seventeenth-century Seville . <p> Chapter 1 considers the connection between painting and beholder in Velzquezs early religious images . Specifically , I examine the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception and Vision of Saint John the Evangelist ( figs. 1011 ) as pendants originally conceived for their audience of friars at the Sevillian Calced Carmelite monastery , El Carmen . The paintings illustrate Sevillian religiosity in the late-1610s , when Church officials and pious citizens staged elaborate festivals demonstrating support for the doctrine proclaiming Marys Immaculacy . Velzquezs Immaculate Conception conforms largely to Pachecos prescription for depicting the theme , and both pendants correspond to the iconography of the Carmelite order . Yet Velzquez also transcended contemporary pictorial conventions . By pairing the Immaculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carmelites , whose ancient founder was the first to witness a vision symbolizing the Virgin Immaculate . As elucidated by the writings of El Carmens residents , Velzquez also devised a means of tempering the sexual desire that sometimes accompanied Marian devotion . <p> Chapter 2 turns to Velzquezs early engagement with the traditions of portraiture in Seville . In a new interpretation of a well-known image , I examine Velzquezs constructions of gender and holiness in Madre Jer=nima de la Fuente ( figs. 2526 ) , a portrait commemorating a Poor Clare ( a Franciscan nun ) from Toledo who founded the first convent of nuns in the Philippines . When painting Madre Jer=nima , Velzquez followed Pachecos example of glorifying his subject by capturing her likeness rather than idealizing her features . In comparing the portrait to seventeenth-century biographies of Jer=nima , I argue that Velzquez discovered a way of representing a " virile woman " ( mujer varonil ) a woman of extraordinary fortitudethrough the figures strong outward gaze . He reinforced the portraits impact on its audience of Toledan Poor Clares by depicting Jer=nima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely commissioned by one of Jer=nimas male religious superiors , and it allowed Velzquez to establish contacts with patrons outside of Seville . Significantly for the ambitious young artist , the Spanish royal family supported both Jer=nimas mission and the Toledan convent for which the portrait was painted . <p> In Chapter 3 , I examine what is often considered Velzquezs earliest masterpiece , the Waterseller of Seville ( fig. 40 ) . Shedding light on the critical context of Velzquezs bodegones , I analyze the Waterseller in concert with the artistic precepts of Pacheco and his friends , including the paintings first owner , Juan de Fonseca y Figueroa . Through a detailed consideration of images and texts , I examine Velzquezs challenge to the lowly status of bodegones in seventeenth-century artistic discourse . In the painting , the artist vaunted his lowly subject matter , even as he adopted the lofty conventions of poetry through a series of ingenious visual puns . The Waterseller also offers a key opportunity to consider Velzquezs relationship with Fonseca , who became one of his most crucial supporters at court . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye toward gratifying Fonsecas artistic tastes and erudite interests . At the same time , he created a composition that encouraged Fonseca to draw visual pleasure , intellectual satisfaction , and perhaps even spiritual comfort from a humble bodeg=n . <p> Chapter 4 considers the central role of an African slave in Supper at Emmaus ( fig. 48 ) , a painting that combines a bodeg=n and a religious subject . This chapter provides a framework for examining the intersection of race and religion in seventeenth-century Spanish art . In Supper at Emmaus , Velzquez represented the African woman in the foreground and Christs revelation at Emmaus in the background . I argue that Velzquezs unusual composition gave shape to seventeenth-century debates on the spiritual salvation of African slaves in Seville . Through his use of light and shade , Velzquez created a visual interpretation of discourse on African spiritual " illumination " and developing theories of race . Like contemporary Sevillian preachers , he compared the apparent awakening of an African slave to the sudden realization of Christs unbelieving disciples . Treatises by Sevillian clerics also provide insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed his African subject . By relating previously unexplored texts to Velzquezs image , I suggest that the relationship between beholder and subject in Supper at Emmaus reflected the dynamics between male slave owner and female African slave . <p> My fifth and final chapter provides the first sustained account of Velzquezs transition from his career in Seville to his position as a court painter . When he visited Madrid in 1622 , Velzquez benefited from the patronage of Fonseca and other Sevillians residing at court , who succeeded in making his talents known to the king . Through an examination of writings on courtly comportment , I argue that Velzquez represented himself as an exemplary portraitist , ideally suited to painting Philip IV . This chapter also provides an answer to a question that has long puzzled scholars : why did Velzquez abandon his practice as a painter of bodegones after arriving at court ? Pacheco and other theorists argued that artists who specialized in bodegones rarely won the favor of kings , and Velzquez heeded this contention by focusing on portraiture in Madrid . When he was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skills as a portraitist with his ambitions of becoming a courtier . Employing his realist style , he rendered Philips likeness so convincingly that he was deemed the first artist truly to portray the king . Velzquez thus set the stage for a long career in which the craft of painting and the art of courtly self-fashioning would become almost indistinguishable . <p> Throughout this book , I emphasize the inseparability of the young Velzquez from the visual and intellectual culture of early seventeenth-century Seville . I argue that by expanding on his training in Pachecos studio , Velzquez learned to bring his " true imitation of nature " to bear on deceptively simple compositions , in which the illusion of reality engaged the viewers eyes while the ingenious imagery stimulated his or her intellect . Raised in a milieu that prized the ingenio of poets and painters , Velzquez also invented new ways of representing well-known themes , personages , and stories : the Virgins Immaculate Conception , the likeness of a contemporary nun , and the meaning of Christs Supper at Emmaus . It was this synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sevillian men of letters who so admired his youthful paintings . These early viewers apparently delighted in the elusively magical compositions in which Velzquez often seemed to have re-created reality itself .

On the night of April 14 , 1865 , Washington , D.C. , turned raucous and near riotous , with northerners wanting to exact revenge against anyone connected with the South . Senator William M. Smith of Nevada , a close acquaintance of Abraham Lincolns , recounted the nights chaotic moments in a New York Times article , calling it the " most awful night I ever experienced . " As news spread of the assassination attempts against Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward , Smith recounted how the streets filled with over " seventy thousand " angry and grieving people " wild with excitement . . . all wrought up to the highest pitch . " A sense of fear gripped the nations capital because at that moment , Smith relayed , " no one knew how far the conspiracy extended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill every one of them ; no loyal man is safe with these traitors in the city ! " That significant " bloodshed " did not take place , Smith believed , was out of deep respect for Lincoln . Countering the call for revenge , Smith also heard the calls for mercy : " What would Lincoln do ? " an epitaph that helped curb the appetite for northern vengeance . As Smith observed , " Those words uttered to surging masses of excited men quelled the rising storm . " 1 <p> Smiths memories of Lincolns assassination were published by the New York Times nearly thirty-two years after Lincoln died . His memories joined the thousands of reminiscences published in the aftermath of Lincolns death by those who knew the man and the president . This study takes seriously the linkage between firsthand reminiscences of Lincoln and Lincolns lasting influence on American political thought and the presidency . Every chapter provides different yet convergent scholarly and stylistic evidence for this linkage . As a prelude to the arguments to come , we adduce four reasons for the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and citizen ideals . <p> First , in the absence of Lincolns own diaries and memoirs , much of what we know about his private and public life comes from reminiscences . Ascending in popularity from Lincolns assassination in 1865 until the turn of the twentieth century , this so-called period of reminiscences , or what we refer to as the reminiscence generation , influenced the earliest postmortem biographies written about Lincoln , some of the more enduring public memories of him , and the scholarship produced about his life and presidency . A market for the literary reminiscence that had segmented off from biography preceded Lincoln . Yet Lincolns death powered that market in the United States as never previously experienced . Remembering Lincoln became a national pastime . For profit , posterity , and , not least , heartfelt love and admiration , close acquaintances and distant strangers alike who made sustained or random contact with Lincoln were all too happy to submit their Lincoln memories for public consumption . And profit-minded newspapers and publishers were eager to solicit these submissions because of their popularity among a burgeoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent a unique rhetorical art open to the cultured and uncultured , the learned and the unlearned . Part biography , part eulogy , part memoir , part political portrait , and part day-in-the-life memories , they covered an array of content , from the most public to the most private , even venturing into Lincolns inner thoughts and insecurities . And Lincoln reminiscences integrated a diversity of rhetorical styles and topics that democratized his memory because of their diversity of authorship . Lincoln acquaintances represented virtually every walk of life that mirrored Lincolns biography from his early years on the frontier through his later years as president . Lincoln acquaintances of high and low station produced an assortment of memories that revealed Lincoln through a wider prism than had ever before been amassed to remember a president . There were the " official " memories from politicians and military officers representing revered institutions . There were the " vernacular " memories of those who had been enslaved on southern plantations or who had steered flatboats up and down the Sangamon River for a livelihood.3 Such cross-currents of Lincoln memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiring interest and inviting scorn . <p> Third , Lincoln reminiscences matter because of the competing conceptions of republican and democratic citizenship they upheld . In this book , unless indicated ( see conclusion ) , we do not associate republican and democratic forms of government with contemporary political parties . As the founders debated the Constitution and the first generations of Americans institutionalized it , debates broke out over how much power to invest in the people versus the leaders selected to represent them . Many republican founders feared that democracy would lead to " mob-rule " and called for awarding power , particularly the power of the presidency , to those of advanced means , birthright standing , educational achievement , and cultural refinement . They favored constitutional protections of minorities as well as rulers who practiced beneficence over the people from on high . Those advocating a more democratic vision in nineteenth-century America typically saw beneficence as an excuse for indifferent and aloof rulers and advocated for more inclusive and engaged assumptions for the presidency ( see next section ) .4 In this book we focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency and the peoples say in defining the ideals of character , citizenship , and presidential leadership . Lincoln reminiscences were caught in the vortex of these tensions , and both camps provide insight into the periods assumptions of " citizenship and ethics " and their relationship to the presidency.5 <p> Fourth , Lincoln reminiscences matter because they strengthened a bond between the people and a single president lasting beyond living memory . In newspapers , magazines , books , and speeches , reminiscence authors sketched vivid tapestries of themselves in proximity to Lincoln , keeping him intimately " alive " over generations as no president before him . Lincoln reminiscences reflected shifts in presidential character that both anticipated and helped accelerate the rise of the rhetorical presidency . Future presidents inherited the expectation of creating similar bonds with their constituencies . <p> Lincoln Reminiscences in Context <p> We define a Lincoln reminiscence as a complete text containing a first-person memory ( or memories ) of Lincoln after his death . The author of the text , in other words , was identical to the author of the memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words or more and others in newspaper articles of two hundred words or less . Our focus is on first-person remembrances published in newspapers , magazines , and pamphlets or included in reminiscence biographies , edited collections , and public lectures . <p> This study of Lincoln reminiscences combines rhetorical with corpus research methods . A rhetorical approach allows us to consider how public discourse " shapes human understanding and action . " 6 By situating this rhetorical art form in a nineteenth-century context , we examine Lincoln reminiscences through the periods competing conceptions of U.S. citizenship , character , style , and class . Studying texts in context , Kirt H. Wilson argues , helps us " make sense of the decisions , actions , and values of the past and present . " 7 Such an approach reflects the rhetorical traditions of Ernest Wrage , who argues that reading a collection of texts from a particular era offers insight into " prevailing social ideas and attitudes . " By understanding texts ( Lincoln reminiscences and the debates they inspired ) in their historical context ( 18651900 United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " dissonance " that dominated the political culture at the time of their issuance.8 We can then trace those ideas and conflicts through future texts and contexts to assess their consistencies and changes across generations.9 <p> Using corpus methods , we also seek to understand the stylistic differences of more than three hundred reminiscences across a wide spectrum of stylistic features tagged by a corpus stylistic analysis tool called DocuScope . DocuScope relies on stylistic tagging software that has been widely used to analyze the styles of pre-twentieth-century corpora , including nineteenth-century fiction and Shakespeare . The tag counts and frequencies produced from the DocuScope analysis are statistically analyzed to determine which stylistic features in a collection of texts stand out most . Our stylistic analysis of leading remembrances of Lincoln reveals that divisions over Lincoln memory that had been splitting the nation politically and ideologically were also splitting it stylistically.10 Style becomes a salient component of politics , Robert Hariman contends , because it offers a lens for " understanding social reality , " particularly " the social reality of politics . " 11 For this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the social reality that inspired and divided Lincoln memoirists . <p> We use corpus methods in tandem with interpretive analysisthereby integrating quantitative and humanistic methodsbecause they provide another layer of validation to help us distill " relevant from . . . irrelevant " scholarly claims.12 They further help ensure that our claims about the rhetorical makeup and variation of the Lincoln reminiscences are empirically grounded in actually occurring linguistic patterns and not the sole result of speculative musing or casual assertions . Yet , overreliance on corpus methods can inadvertently introduce an ahistorical myopia by regarding language as an aggregation of isolated patterns bereft of historical context and rhetorical strategy . Here we seek to overcome that potential myopia through an overarching rhetorical framework that countenances language as embedded in historical context and in pursuit of material rhetorical strategies.13 <p> Republican Versus Democratic Visions of U.S. Citizenship <p> Contextually , we ground Lincoln reminiscences in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century political divide among leaders envisioning a nation cut from republican cloth and others championing its more democratic threads . This divide laid out clear philosophical differences playing out time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to antiquity , the meanings of republicanism and democracy were fluid and adapted to U.S. politics in the late eighteenth century . Imagining a new nation born of war and prone to faction , the framers of the U.S. Constitution appealed to republican values . Republicanism placed a premium on public virtuethe idea of prioritizing the " public good " over the interests of the individual.15 A republic depended on a system of representing the people by men of good character . In outlining the features of a " republic " in Federalist Papers 10 and 39 , James Madison wrote of a " scheme of representation " that derived " all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people . " The ideal representatives , Madison argued , exacted a level of " wisdom " to " discern the true interest of their country " as " proper guardians of the public weal . " Madison and many other founders favored republicanism over democracy as the superior form of government because true equality , they feared , resulted in factionalization . As Madison argued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that hold minimal " cure for the mischiefs of faction . " 16 <p> Under a republican vision , a representative government depended on electing noble leaders modeling ideal character traits for the nations citizens to emulate . These traits , according to republican logic , could help mold the rabble into harmonious citizens . Biographies became an important purveyor of this inspiration.17 Parson ( Mason Locke ) Weemss biography of George Washington , The Life of Washington , celebrated Washingtons personification of republicanism , which , according to Weems , accounted for Washingtons ability to inspire " his countrymen with the profoundest veneration . . . as the best of men . " Washingtons republican virtue , in Weemss words , " naturally smoothed his way to supreme command . " 18 In the process of defending a republic and Washington as its first iconic leader , Weems and other Washington biographers seeded the expectation that citizens of a republic had the right to know their leaders as human beings.19 <p> In contrast to life under the British monarchy , the founders conceived republicanism as a " popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governed . " Even as many founders denounced the patrimonial lineages of monarchies , their notion of a republic retained hierarchies valuing leaders of birthright standing.20 Under " republicanism , " Jay Fliegelman argues , citizens had a " double identity as sovereign ( part of the authorizing People ) and as subject ( one of the governed ) . " 21 Republicanism among the founders depended on an assumption of a " deferential public " with " enough confidence in elected officials to let them govern unquestioned. " 22 Many Federalist founders in particular believed that " distinctions in birth " mattered and that a small percentage of the populationpart of the " gentlemen " classwas equipped to lead.23 Madisons Federalist Paper 58 reflected these elitist sentiments ; he fretted that if a " representative assembly " became too large , " the greater will be the proportion of members of limited information and of weak capacities . " 24 <p> Not surprisingly , Federalist elitism met with resistance . Anti-Federalists saw no comfortable distinction between republican leadership and monarchical rule . An anti-Federalist writing under the pseudonym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a few men " could " represent the feelings , opinions , and characters of the great multitude . " 25 Anti-Federalists placed governance in the virtues of " middling Americans " and called for a system where the people " supervised their public servants . " 26 This strain of democratic thinking in the founding generation was palpable but remained a minority strain . In the early years of the nation , the prevailing view was that democracies led to " mob rule , " and few countenanced republicanisms " self-rule " transitioning for the better into truly democratic government.27 <p> The power of the executive also divided the constitutional framers . Jeffrey Leigh Sedgwick explains that the framers grappled with " how to promote a strong yet responsible executive " who did not become an American impersonator of a British king.28 In Federalist Paper 70 , Alexander Hamilton supported a strong executive , correlating the strength of the executive with the strength of the government : " Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government " that protected " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hamilton cautioned , " implies a feeble execution of the government . " 29 The Anti-Federalists fired back , expressing deep-seated suspicions over the force of the executives " energy . " Cato , for example , equated the " president " with the " establishment of monarchy in Great Britain , " known for governing by " favorites and flatterers " and leading to " oppression and ruin . " Catos famous phrase captured the fear : " to live by ones man will became the cause of all mens misery . " 30 Anti-Federalists did accept the need for a single executive . The Federal Farmer acknowledged on January 17 , 1788 , that " a single man seems to be peculiarly well circumstanced " to serve in the executives capacity . But fearing that a sovereign would be " constantly aiming at power and importance , " Anti-Federalists worked to limit the power of the president , with the Federal Farmer concluding that " our security must be in limiting , defining , and guarding the exercise of them powers , so that those given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly or secretly seizing more . " Beyond the checks and balances embedded in the Constitution , the Federal Farmer saw the screening of character as an important curb on presidential abuse . The Farmer insisted that the president be a " great and good man , governed by superior motives . " 31 <p> As the founders aged and a new generation came to power , leaders from the Jacksonian era changed the landscape of American politics . By the 1820s and 1830s , suffrage rights began to expand and immigration was on the rise as white males beyond the propertied class were granted citizenship rights . State legislatures came under greater control of middle-class leaders , and volatile issues took center stage ; a broader cross-current of the population debated slavery practices , suffrage rights , and capitalisms rise . The overreach of presidential power divided the political class.32 And a new rhetoric of democracyone that molded enfranchisement into an emerging middle classbegan to compete with the classic discourse of republicanism and its deference to a gentrified class . With regard to this new democratic surge in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the rules of gentlemen and the deferential politics of the founding era. " 33 <p> Certain leaders started to recalibrate the political landscape to accommodate the new democratic thinking.34 The writings of Davy Crockett , among others , crystallized this changing tenor of American politics . In 1834 Crockett argued that the era consisted of two kinds of peoplethe " gentlemen " class and those who labored on their own behalf . A " gentleman , " Crockett derided , was " not constructed in any useful pursuit by which he could obtain a livelihood . " Crockett chose to praise instead those of " noble ancestry " who may have been " poor but . . . honest . " 35 <p> The growing ideological divide between republicanism and democracy did not neatly split along party lines but instead crossed lines of education , class , and geography . Lincolns own life and his presidential campaign brought these political tensions to the forefront . Two newspapers aligned with the Republican Partythe New York Times and the New-York Daily Tribuneskirmished over whether Lincolns life as a rail-splitter prepared him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touting the need for elite leaders in traditional republican fashion , argued that rail splitting was no presidential qualification at all : " It is not worthwhile to make the mistake of supposing that the fact of splitting rails . . . in early life constitute reasons for electing any man President . " If " Mr. Lincoln were still a mere splitter-of-rails , " the Times reasoned , no one would dream of making him president.37 The more populist Tribune rebuked the Times diatribe , arguing that " the highest offices of the government are open to all , however humble their origin . " 38 From such humble origins , the Tribune insisted , " the mass of the voters " could be more assured of electing " a man who can be trusted to uphold the great interest of free labor . He must know and understand those interests ; he must sympathize with them , for he once was a laborer himself . " 39 <p> In some respects the debate between the Times and the Tribune echoed the old arguments between republican and democratic thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notion of republicanism that associated leadership with birthright.40 The Times advocated for an updated version of republicanism focusing on self-made men rising from humble origins . It was a republicanism allowing for social and class mobility based on individual achievement . This view represented the idea , as old as Pericles , that republics become more democratic when they include every strata of society in competition for upward mobility into the leadership class.41 The Tribune , by contrast , championed a mushrooming form of democracy that put less attention on individual achievement than on a seismic shift of power away from the privileged to the common classes , from the East to the West , from the city to the country , from elites to nonelites . <p> The ongoing ideological debate between republicanism and democracy grew more pronounced in the years following Lincolns death.42 As the words of Crockett and the Tribune foretold , democratic advocates increasingly associated republicanism with " aristocratic pretentions " as well as " snobbery and class interests . " 43 Republican sympathizers remonstrated that the age-old provenance of leadership , based on blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass democracy.44 <p> The tensions between these schools of thought mounted , as industrial growth , railroad expansion , and economic uncertainty produced unprecedented prosperity and economic inequality . The gap between the wealthy and the poor widened along with the animosities between the privileged and the underprivileged . Race politics divided a revengeful and emboldened North against a resentful and embattled South . The country faced economic depressions in each decade from the 1870s through the 1910s , creating in their wake angry and hungry workers and some of the most violent labor strikes in American history . Homelessness grew , family farms folded , and unemployment became a harsh reality for many Americans.45 Henry George , writing in the " progress and poverty " of the 1870s and 1880s , captured the sentiment of those on the bottom of the economic ladder : " amid the greatest accumulations of wealth , men die of starvation . " George described this class divide as " an immense wedge . . . being forced . . . through society . " Those on top , George argued , were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " found themselves " below " the weight of wealth , however , were " crushed " underneath.46 <p> From the perspective of the wealthy , the images of destitute and violent masses created a culture of fear that necessitated efforts to curb democratic excesses and emotional outbursts . As John F. Kasson explains , " the bourgeois code of manners deflected the pressures and inequities of the society back on the individual " in hopes of enhancing " civility " and promoting " self-discipline. " 47 From a view atop the economic ladder , images of poverty exposed a " moral depravity " threatening the nations stability.48 National stability rested on people of strong character emulating the private virtues of " piety , respectability , and self-cultivation. " 49 Etiquette books flooded the reading market to socialize the middling and lower classes on proper cultural and social comportment . Ward McAllister , adviser to the wealthy of New York , suggested in his 1890 booklet , Society as I Have Found It , that " the highest cultivation in social manners enables a person to conceal from the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curb rowdy behavior during vaudeville performances , raucous skirmishes at baseball games , and riotous crowds in city streets.51 Class distinctions were hardened in the writings of those such as Alfred Ayres , who observed in The Mentor from 1894 that " to get angry with an inferior is degrading ; with an equal dangerous ; with a superior , ridiculous . " Ayres concluded , " Few things are more impressive than to see calmness opposed to violence , refinement to vulgarity , and decorum to ruffianism. " 52 <p> Language registers during this period represented character indices and sharpened distinctions between refined , middling , and vulgar linguistic styles . In his turn-of-the-century Slips of Speech book , John H. Bechtel compared " slang " to " chicken pox . " Like chicken pox , he analogized , slang spread easily in areas of poor " sanitary conditions " that lacked the " culture to counteract its influence " over " words . . . of a more serious character . " 53 On matters of style and class , Kenneth Cmiel explains , " Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " versus " elegant prose " and that deepened class antagonisms.54 <p> In the decades following the Civil War , few could ignore the ideological rift between republicanism and democracy . Self-help books , political biographies , campaign speeches , literary masterpieces , Sunday sermons , news stories , and magazine exposTs debated the clashes of citizenship , character , style , and class . Some news and literary writers adapted to the vulgar interests of mass readers , while others saw themselves contributing to the cultural uplift of the many . Some politicians venerated the class of common men while others commemorated men of high achievement . Between 1865 and 1901 , Heather Cox Richardson contends , " a new definition of what it meant to be an American developed from a heated debate over the proper relationship of the government to its citizens . " 55 The Lincoln reminiscences emerged from and actively participated in these contests over the proper relationship between the American citizen and the American president . <p> Studying Lincoln Reminiscences <p> Mid- to late nineteenth-century debates over citizenship , character , style , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding market of Lincoln reminiscences .

Was a self-made president to be celebrated for escaping commonness or for doggedly insisting that his secure grounding in everyday things and values supplied the favored lever for his rise ? Each chapter of this book explores these themes from complementary perspectives . <p> Chapter 1 argues for the profound connection between the Lincoln reminiscences and the expanding publishing market that circulated them .

Lincoln acquaintances crossed every class , educational , and regional boundary and mirrored the larger national debate between democratic versus republican models of citizenship . Where Lincoln acquaintances hailed was highly predictive of the character attributes they praised about Lincoln . Acquaintances from the eastern elite typically remembered a dignified Lincoln befitting republican ideals . Acquaintances from the West recalled a more earthy man free of pretension , exemplifying democratic standards . Regardless of where they lived , many built off of claims of intimacy with Lincoln to suggest they aided him in his ascent to the presidency . <p> Chapter 3 argues that memories of Lincoln reflected not only competing class , educational , and regional understandings of the model character behind the American presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of what to remember about Lincoln or how to remember him .

Lincoln spoke in both styles , but those committed to republicanism remembered him in a predominantly formal style , while those committed to democratic principles remembered him more often in a familiar , folksy style . We support these claims through a comparative stylistic analysis of William H. Herndon and Jesse W. Weiks 1888 biography , Abraham Lincoln ( later dubbed Herndons Lincoln ) , and Allen Thorndike Rices 1886 edited volume , Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln by Distinguished Men of His Time.58 Herndon and Weik and the informants they recruited routinely violated norms of republicanism by remembering Lincoln in a language that mixed everyday words with refined prose .

Those remembering Lincoln from a democratic lens argued that his humble roots propelled his rise to uncommonness . Lincoln would n't have been Lincoln without the springboard of his western background and the inclusive political vision it fostered . Those remembering him from a republican lens argued that Lincolns essence lay in his self-madeness , his ability to escape the constraints of his common roots . And still others remembered Lincoln as a bipartisan " transcendent " figure who had managed in his own person to unify all the tensions that divided the country . <p> The conclusion traces this fault line of primal presidential character and upward mobility into the twentieth century , when two presidentsHerbert Hoover and Franklin Rooseveltdrew lines in the sand over Lincolns commonness and self-madeness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Progressive Era that made Lincoln and his presidency the icon of the common man .

The twentieth century also revived and popularized a " transcendent " Lincoln from the reminiscence generation , a Lincoln who mashed republican and democratic thinking and styles and became a unifying symbol of American diversity , to be hauled out and paraded on epideictic occasions . <p> We close the book by examining the implications of Lincoln reminiscences and the long-standing divides over American leadership and citizenship they incubated .

An African-initiated church born in the 1920s from the preaching and healing campaign conducted by Simon Kimbangu , a Congolese Baptist catechist , in reaction to the colonial situation in the Belgian Congo , Kimbanguism has cultivated a theology of Black liberation by offering a unique understanding of the Bible . <p> Because the Bible was inseparable from the European colonial enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa , its use , circulation , and promotion rapidly became a political instrument as much as a religious one . Consequently , the Christian religion has been among the most effective tools of colonial domination of African natives , who were exposed to the Bible from the fifteenth century onward . When Christian missionaries began spreading the gospel in African societies , they introduced the Bible as a unique account of the history of humanity , which was endowed with a logic of racial classification putting Whites on top and Blacks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were subjugated , Africans had been long prepared to occupy the lowest rung on the ladder of humankind , a position to which they are still assigned today . The most familiar and striking example of this is , no doubt , the biblical myth of the curse of Ham . For this myth to take on ideological and legal dimensions , the Christian colonial message had to bring the dominated to accept their own domination , so that Blacks would participate in and collaborate with their own inferiorization . The philosopher Albert Memmi recalled , " As a child , I often heard people tell me very seriously about the origins of black bondage : we all know that of the three sons of Noah , Shem begat the Semites , who received the law , Japheth begat the northern peoples , who inherited technical skills , and Ham fathered the Hamites , whowell , who did n't  get anything . And that is why Europeans can , with the blessing of Holy Providence , dominate the Africans . This was the first attempt to explain the colonization process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how many columnists of the colonial press used the religious metaphor of a biblical ancestors sin to justify the inferiorization of the Black people , as the Guinean historian Ibrahima Baba KakT explained : " Black people , it is said in Christian schools , are the descendants of Ham , and the curse uttered by Noah against the son of Ham who had disrespected him still weighs on his posterity . This assertion was so categorical and was repeated over so many centuries that it ended up in history books . " 2 <p> Claiming to be universal , Christianity was imposed as the religion of all , regardless of ethnic and racial difference . But the Eurocentric nature of its message entailed a phenomenon of counter-acculturation , which led Africans to observe themselves using all possible modesconcern , questioning , self-deprecating humor , self-criticismwhether or not they defined themselves as believers . For instance , a philosopher from Burundi related a debate he had with some friends on African atheism ; one of them began complaining about the lot of Black people everywhere : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists , He must be evil . I cant forgive Him for letting blacks all over the world be poverty-stricken and despised by every human being . " 3 This view is not unique . It echoes a conversation with one of my maternal uncles , who had never received a formal education and explained his atheism in these words : " For me , God does not exist ; God is just the White man . He s been able to invent the radio , electricity , planes , and the like . " <p> What these two examples reveal is not so much the notion that God is truly evil or is actually the White man , but a critique of the oppressed status experienced by Blacks . This critique was also echoed , from a Christian perspective , by a famous Congolese singer who was very popular in the 1970s , Georges Kiamuangana Mateta ( aka Verckys ) . In his hit " Nakomitunaka " ( I Am Wondering ) , the artist questioned the manner in which Blacks had been Christianized : <p> I am wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( bis ) <p> Where on earth does black skin come from ? <p> And who was our ancestor ? <p> Jesus , the son of God , was a White man . <p> Adam and Eve were White people . <p> All the saints were White people too . <p> Why is that so , my God ? <p> I am wondering ( bis ) <p> My God , I am wondering !

( bis ) 4 <p> This song , which belongs to the tradition of Congolese rumba , was written by Verckys in 1971 and was well known to the Congolese from both sides of the river and to the Angolans as well . It reflects the Eurocentricity behind the Christianization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiteness with perfection , beauty , and purity . When positive values are only represented through White characters , it is impossible to develop a positive image of Blackness . To a certain extent , this approach was the result of the " discovery " of the African continent , which compelled Africans to come to terms with Europeans presence and ultimately to embrace religions designed for others . Black people could only find a place for themselves in this worldview by assimilating it and accepting their condition as slaves or subalterns . But this did not preclude the possibility of a backlash . The song above is an example of the reactions of Black people who , instead of accepting the imposed order , challenged it by questioning the reason for their oppressed situation . <p> The large-scale Christianization of Africa was shaped by the Berlin Conference of 188485 . From then on , Black people were perceived only as children to be disciplined by the White man or as objects of pseudo-scientific studies , to be used for theorizing on evolution . Space does not allow an exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of Black people in the social order , but let me briefly discuss the most relevant one , social Darwinism , which posits a global evolution of all societies , whose growth is supposed to follow three stages , from savagery ( the inferior stage ) to barbarity ( the medium stage ) to civilization ( the superior stage ) . As the French historian +ric SavarFse pointed out in writing about colonial representations of African peoples in the West , " without a doubt , it was the Black manas abstractly defined in many workswho appeared as the most infantilized. " 5 But how to designate African societies ? With a colonial term such as " tribe " ? In terms of race , ethnicity , community , or society ? Until the colonial bureaucrats defined specific usages of the concepts of race and ethnicity , finding the right term was a problem . In the field of science , the Western conception of the African Other was warped by its ethnocentric character , and this was even more true in the field of religion . As Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion " also revealed a hierarchy between " civilized " and " savage " nations , which was invented in the wake of the first contact between the West and the worlds of the Other : " In this new situation and the discursive political climate , dominated **30;971;TOOLONG now be seen as being either hyperreligious or not religious at all , or not religious on the right terms . " 6 <p> The concept of religion has generated a " Tower of Babel of definitions , " as the French sociologist Yves Lambert used to say . The word comes from the Latin religare , which means " to tie " or " to link together , " thus designating the connection between human beings and the deity , as developed by the thinkers Lactantius ( A.D. ca. 260ca. 325 ) and Tertullian ( A.D. ca. 155ca. 220 ) . A second understanding of the term was proposed by the linguist Benveniste , for whom religere meant " to gather or collect ; to accomplish scrupulously , " thereby joining together the authority of tradition and the punctilious performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age when religious affiliations are increasingly shifting all over the world ? In his search for delimiting criteria , Lambert stressed that the human quest for origins was always inseparable from the assumed existence of one or several deities or of a form of transcendence , which may be embodied , such as in the notion of mana , where a living being may be comprehended as a power or entity . It also seems important to distinguish religion from magic and witchcraft " on the basis of the existence or absence of communal activities , since magic and witchcraft are usually practiced in the private sphere . " 7 <p> In the African context , it makes sense to ask whether it is most appropriate to use the concept of religion or the concept of a belief system . Indeed , many scholars have tended to designate as " African religion(s) " a suite of behaviors in which customs and rituals intersect with kinship systems and superstitions , thus creating a hazy notion from which it is difficult to extract any specifically religious content . In his study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French sociologist Philippe Laburthe-Tolra observed , " There was no term to accurately translate religion in their language . . . . In the realm of conscience and belief , the most difficult thing to grasp for a modern Westerner was , no doubt , the sense of a continuous and immanent presence of the invisible world , interweaved in the visible one . " 8 Thus it is possible to retain as functional the definition of religion proposed by Lambert : " a system of beliefs and practices related to supernatural forms of realitywhether they are living beings , entities , or forcesin connection with human beings via symbolic means , such as prayers , rituals or meditation , and giving birth to communal forms of expression . " 9 <p> This definition seems relevant insofar as it encompasses all the elements pertaining to religion , religiosity , or new religious movements establishing systems of beliefs and practices in relation to the metasocial sphere , as well as communal forms of expression . Yet it remains inadequate to account for elements pertaining to identity construction , particularly religious shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contemporary context implies taking into account the motivations , thought patterns , and social interests at work behind the subjective choices of actors , which shape their behaviors . The field of religions is a particularly rich one when it comes to exploring ethnic identities , thought patterns , ethics , and weltanschauungs . Every religion claims to be , in the words of Claude RiviFre , " both a system which accounts for human nature and the universe and an organized system of action seeking to remedy whatever is unpredictable , uncanny , and accidentally tragic in social and individual life . " 10 For Clifford Geertz , " It is a matter of discovering just what sorts of beliefs and practices support what sorts of faith under what sorts of conditions . " 11 Through their actions , words , and behaviors , human beings define their ways of life , their relations to others and the world , and their understandings of the forces at work behind all these interactions . <p> It is thus easy to grasp the religious and political motivations behind the Christianization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach the gospel , actively contributed to the colonial venture by preparing , training , and socializing the colonized peoples so that they would adopt certain types of moral behavior and promulgate a system of beliefs based on White superiority . While the ideology of social hierarchy put into place a specific order for social classification , the processes of social differentiation and hierarchy began to be questioned and contested . Thus , political , regionalist , nationalist , and religious movements emerged among subaltern peoples as challenges to the social order or as movements of counter-acculturation or appropriation of the self-image imposed by the colonizers . One of these Black ideologies was the nTgritude movement , initiated in the 1930s by intellectuals such as AimT CTsaire and LTopold STdar Senghor , who inspired other Black leaders . It was followed by Afrocentric theories developed in the 1950s by Cheikh Anta Diop and ThTophile Obenga , who claimed that African civilizations predated White ones . <p> These new ways of theorizing Blacks and Blackness , though adopted by many , did not remain unquestioned . The following comments by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thesis of the preexistence of African civilizations does not change anything in the present situation of black people . Even worse , there has been a decline of the trailblazers , and one wonders why the first have become last . The knowledge of our creativity is of no use whatsoever if it does not allow us to take up historical initiative in the here and now . " 12 The answer to the question " Why did the first become last ? " is at the core of the quest of African-initiated churches , for they provide answers to the question of Blackness from a different perspective . The paradox of African Christianity is that it has embraced the Bible and the Christian message while implementing resistance to it , so there have been two antagonistic forces : on the one hand , the dominant culture , which aims at maintaining the dominated in an oppressed status , and on the other hand , religious resistance , which has taken all sorts of shapes . In some cases , Africans seem to uncritically accept the Bible that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more actively , transforming it radically into systems of belief addressing their own situation in the here and now . <p> Some African churches have organized a process of counter-acculturation , reversing the stigma , reconstructing their identity , and rereading or reinterpreting the Bible . Throughout the history of the colonization of Africa , the political claim for national independence went hand in hand with religious movements of resistance known today as African independent , African-initiated , or Afro-Christian churches . Operating from within the closed space of the Christian scriptures , which had been introduced as a universal history that Black people had no choice but to internalize , African-initiated churches succeeded in restoring a positive historical or mythical role for them . As Lewis Gordon explained , " Rejecting the thesis of thought as fundamentally white requires liberating it from the economy of rationalizations that assert this . The liberation of thinking , then , becomes also an important dimension of liberation praxis.It requires addressing the dimensions of thought that have been barred from their potential or reach . " 13 To give a satisfactory account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praxis , it is necessary to she 'd light on a number of concepts , namely , prophetism , messianism , millenarianism , nativism , and syncretism . The definitions offered by the American theologian David Barrett , who was an expert on African churches , are the most useful for a study of contemporary Kimbanguism : <p> ( 1 ) A prophetic movement is a religious awakening founded and led by the charismatic figure of a prophet or prophetess , who speaks from within a consciousness of being set apart for some divine purpose , adopts a critical stance towards the established order , proclaims a new religious idea or allegiance , and in the process attracts a considerable following . <p> ( 2 ) A messianic movement is one which , centred around a dominant personality , claims for the leader special powers beyond the prophetic and involving a form of identification with Christ . This definition is applicable to the African scene but differs somewhat from the current usage in the history of religions , where messianism refers to belief in the future advent of any being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future savior who will end the present order of things and institute a new order of justice and happiness . <p> ( 3 ) A millennial movement is one which preaches an imminent millennium , Golden Age or End of the World , involving the overthrow of oppressors from outside Africa , the expulsion or throwing into the sea of the white race , the return or resurrection of a culture-hero or of the ancestors bringing unlimited quantities of material goods , the rejuvenation of the old , and often the reversal of colour roles . <p> ( 4 ) A nativistic movement is an organised attempt on the part of a societys members to revive or perpetuate selected aspects of its culture , usually resulting in a rejection of European culture and a return to the old ways of traditional religion ; often allied with it is an immunity cult rendering initiates immune from European assault . <p> ( 5 ) A syncretistic movement is one which amalgamates the Christian religion with traditional beliefs and concepts , and often with other non-Christian religious systems such as astrology , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lordship of Christ over all other gods , is obscured , challenged or denied , leaving only an outwardly Christian appearance with a pre-Christian content.14 <p> In chronological order , the oldest African messianic movement , Antonianism , was led by a Congolese prophet called Kimpa Vita , also known as Dona Beatriz ( her Christian name ) , in the early eighteenth century . She initiated a nationalist and spiritual revival movement with a discourse that perfectly suited the mentality and expectations of her compatriots , whom she successfully mobilized for the restoration of the kingdom of Kongo.15 <p> The end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth witnessed the emergence of Black African churches in South Africa , first researched by Bengt Sundkler , 16 which fell into two groups : the so-called Ethiopian churches and the Zionist churches . The former were the result of interethnic relations : an African Methodist pastor , Mangena Mokono , left the European churches to create an African independent church in 1892 . Out of this church several other " Ethiopian " religious movements were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bondage . The Zionist churches , which emerged in southern Africa , were syncretic churches that took after Daniel Bryants African American church , the Christian Catholic Church in Zion.17 Quite probably , the Nazareth Baptist Church , initiated by the Zulu prophet Isaiah Shembe in 1911 , played a significant role in the Zionist movement in South Africa , since he insisted on the worship of a Black Christ and on interpreting the Bible in the context of Zulu religion . Another historic African-initiated church discussed by scholars is the Harrist movement , launched by William Harris on the border between Liberia and Ivory Coast . Its goal was to bring Bible-based answers to the colonial problem . <p> The Kimbanguist movement , which is the focus of this book , was initiated by Simon Kimbangu in the early 1920s in the southwestern portion of the former Belgian Congo . Since then , it has become a major African-initiated church , as Jean-Claude Froelich pointed out : " Of all the African churches of classical messianic or prophetic type that were born from a reaction to colonial domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 18 Although it is difficult to know the exact membership of the Kimbanguist Church , which has been a member of the World Council of Churches since 1969 , Kimbanguists officially claim to be 17 million strong . The churchs success has triggered unrelenting interest from sociologists , anthropologists , political scientists , historians , journalists , and theologians . The first scholar who developed an interest in Kimbanguism , who remains the best known , is the French Africanist Georges Balandier . Analyzing Congolese messianic movements as part of the dynamics of social change he was witnessing , Balandier perceived two alternatives : either the messianic movements of Africa were essentially religious , or they betokened the awakening of people who saw themselves as having neither past nor future , but were reacting against violations of their dignity . " They express a passionate desire for change ; and because they assert the universal nature of human dignity , they represent a step towards universality . " 19 Balandiers work is centered around this time-hallowed tradition , which he described in the 1950s as a reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works by Marie-Louise Martin , a Swiss theologian and missiologist . The best known of these is Kimbangu : An African Prophet and His Church . Her theological approach has centered on two main questions : Is the Kimbanguist Church a Christian church or a cult ? Does it run the risk of insisting on syncretic elements that could end up drawing it away from Christ as the only messiah and redeemer ? Her observations throughout the 1960s and 1970s led her to conclude , " It is wrong to call the Kimbanguist Church a cult in the theological sense of the term , since it is in the process of becoming and being a Church , which , I hope , we are all engaged in. " 20 Also worthy of notice is the reference book written by the Congolese historian Martial Sinda , Le messianisme congolais et ses incidences politiques , published in 1972 with a preface by Roger Bastide called " Les Christs noirs . " It describes Kimbanguism and its splinter groups through the prism of Bakongo historical and religious traditions and in the Belgian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive fieldwork in postcolonial Zaire between the 1960s and the mid-1980s are the American anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffeywho analyzed the church through the prism of Kongo cultural patterns and beliefs in his classic Modern Kongo Prophetsand the American sociologist Susan Asch , whose discussion of the Kimbanguist Church was articulated around the relations among religion , politics , and socioeconomic development in Zaire in the late 1970s and early 1980s.21 <p> Yet , since then , no in-depth research has been published on this major African independent church in the postSimon Kimbangu era . My book aims to fill this gap , providing historical data and offering new sociological and theological analyses of the churchs understanding and interpretation of the Bible , grounded in an insiders knowledge of the religion and a native command of the African languages spoken by the members of this church .

To accomplish this , I investigated the massive body of oral traditions , which had remained absolutely untapped by scholars , although it represents for the Kimbanguists a source of faith and wisdom as sacred asand inseparable fromthe scriptures . <p> The present book includes a new analysis , inspired by the American theologian Vincent Wimbush , who suggested that I focus more on the theological appropriation of the Bible by this church and include a comparative study with other African churches . In this book I show how the scriptures are read , understood , and appropriated by these churches , and how they use the Bible as a foundation to assign a history and a future role for African and Africana people . But my documentation of the processes of appropriation of the Bible by African-initiated churches in both colonial and postcolonial times remains mostly centered on Kimbanguism . I chose to keep building on my twenty-year knowledge of this church because it is the most important and famous African-initiated church today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this field of research . My late father , Antoine Mokoko , was one of the first pastors of this church , and my mother , JosTphine Elo , is still a member of the clergy in the Congo-Brazzaville branch of the EJCSK ( +glise de JTsus Christ sur la terre par son envoyT spTcial Simon Kimbangu ) . I thus offer an insiders analysis of Kimbanguism ; my major assets are a mastery of Congolese languages , which helps to decipher the hymns , speeches , and messages addressing believers , and an intimate knowledge of Congolese culture and the Kimbanguist religion . I observe from the inside , combining the findings of participant observation and semi-structured interviews with an analysis of inspired hymns and spiritual leaders speeches . These elements offer a rich potential for cross-disciplinary observation , at the junction of sociology , ethnology , history , Africana studies , and biblical studies . Indeed , the Kimbanguist reading of the Bible reveals a process of self-identification based on a critique of Africana peoples oppressed position throughout the world . How are African history and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afro-centered approach to the Christian scriptures ? How is Blackness reinterpreted through the Kimbanguist reading of the Bible ? <p> The answers offered in this book are developed in three distinct parts . The first exposes the background and context of the European Christian presence in Africa in order to offer a comparative analysis of African-initiated churches as phenomena of appropriation of the Bible and to discuss the role of Kimbanguism as a social movement . The second part is dedicated to an analysis of Kimbanguism and the Bible . It is especially focused on theological sourcesthe interpretive template of the biblical text and subtext that Kimbanguism offers . I show how the Bible is read , understood , and appropriated by Kimbanguists , and I investigate the particular role given to Simon Kimbangu in the Kimbanguist reinterpretation of scripture . Indeed , from being a special envoy of Jesus Christ to the Black people , to the embodiment of the Holy Trinity , Kimbangus presence and sacralization pervade the whole process of understanding the Bible , negotiating a new status for Blacks within and thanks to the sacred text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity . Finally , the third part of this book explores the messianic and millenarian dimensions of this African understanding of the Bible , delving into the complex relations the church has created and maintained with political leaders and exploring the beginning of the fulfillment of Kimbangus prophecy in the increasing presence of African American and African-descended people as sojourners and benefactors in the holy city of Nkamba . <p> A Note About Names <p> In Congolese tradition , last names are not family names , but the traditional names given to each person based on the circumstances of her or his birth , as a tribute to an ancestor , or to ward off evil ( such as sudden infant death ) . This is completely different from the Western system of naming , in which the children of the same father and mother have the same last name . In the years after independence , if the family was Christian , a Christian name was added to the traditional name when the child was christened . Then , beginning in 1972 , the policy of Zairianization " authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional name in a local language , either to replace the Christian name or to serve as a surname in the European sense of the term . This is how the three sons of Kimbangu chose , respectively , the " Zairian " names Lukelo , Kiangani , and Kuntima . This is also why some of the books by Diangienda appear with " Joseph Diangienda " as the authors name , while those written after Zairianization use " Diangienda Kuntima . " The grandchildren of Kimbangu were free to choose their own last names as they wanted ; only some of the children of Dialungana have chosen " Kiangani " as a last name . There is further explanation in chapter 7 about Congolese naming traditions .

Born in Venice , she spent all but her very first years in Paris , where her father was employed as an astrologer and physician by the king , Charles V. After his death in 1380 , Christine and her family suffered the impoverishment and death of her father , followed by the death of her husband . Against the background of these misfortunes she took up the challenge of providing for herself and her family by producing works in poetry and prose that she presented to a variety of royal patrons , and for which she was more or less generously rewarded . Best remembered for her works defending women , Christine was also a moralist and political thinker whose works of advice to princesses , princes , and knights were printed in France and England well into the sixteenth century . <p> During the past twenty years , modern English translations of most of Christines major works have appeared , making her thought at last accessible to a wider audience . The earliest of these translations were of those works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed Christine writing from a womans perspective . These included Le Livre de la citT des dames ( The Book of the City of Ladies ) , Le Livre des trois vertus ( The Book of Three Virtues ) , Le Livre du duc des vrais amans ( The Duke of True Lovers ) , Le Livre de lAdvision Cristine ( Christines Vision ) , LEpistre au dieu damours ( Letter to the God of Love ) , and LEpistre Othea ( The Letter of Othea to Hector ) . Two recent selections from Christines works have also recently appeared , as well as a series of important new editions , and this will surely result in much broader appreciation of Christines writing within the academy . If Descartes with his " I think , therefore I am " deserves to be recognized as the father of modern philosophy , then Christine , with her " I think , therefore I am the spiritual equal of a man " deserves to be recognized as the mother of humanist feminism . Her beautifully argued rebuttal of the Aristotelian charge that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials and dangers of courtly love , and her history of womens achievements provided an unsurpassed model of the defense of women for two hundred years . <p> Of Christines works that are relevant to womens status , at least two , LEpistre Othea and Le Livre de lAdvision Cristine , are also important as commentaries on the political situation in France and they encapsulate versions of her program of advice to the French princes . In general , however , the overtly political treatises produced by Christine between 1406 and 1414 have been slower to make their way into English , perhaps being seen as less marketable . <p> The appearance in 1994 and 1999 , respectively , of translations of Le Livre du corps de policie ( The Book of the Body Politic ) and Le Livre des fais darmes et de chevalerie ( The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry ) is evidence of a welcome broadening of interest in Christines political thought . In these texts she directed her attention toward principles of good government and the defense of the realm , thus engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an example of the genre of the " mirror of princes , " emphasizing the qualities necessary for princely rule . The second is a practical manual that not only emphasizes the personal virtues required by generals and knights , but also describes effective military organization and devotes considerable space to the practical organization of armies and warfare . Our translation of Le Livre de paixwhich , unlike the preceding works of Christine , has never previously been available in translationmeans that of Christines prose political writings only her Livre de prudence and Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V remain to be translated into English . <p> While it is anachronistic to reproduce , when dealing with Christine , the modern division between what is public , political , and characteristically associated with the masculine , and what is personal , poetic , and imagined as feminine , it is apparent that this division has structured the reception of her writing . Her work has attracted the attention of literary theorists , mythographers , and those interested in the representation of women but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the last two decades , a number of important additions have been made to the once slender scholarship on Christine as a political theorist . <p> In first decades of the nineteenth century , Raimond Thomassy provided an overview of the content of Christines political writings and lamented the lack of modern editions of her political works and her unwarranted descent into obscurity . It was not until a century later , with the appearance of pioneering editions by Suzanne Solente , that Christine began to attract the critical attention she deserved . Despite Thomassys early enthusiasm and his insistence on Christines political importance , some early discussions were rather dismissive , suggesting that her works had little political significance . Others stressed her significance as an early nationalist and humanist , and they located her work in a tradition of politically engaged poets associated with the royal court . During the 1980s , appreciation of Christines engagement with contemporary political events was enhanced by Sandra Hindmans study of the political references in the illuminations of her manuscripts . Soon after this , discussions of Christine as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation into English of her more feminist works , and a polemic developed over her status as a feminist thinker and her attitudes concerning the common people . More recently the study of Christine as a political thinker has broadened and deepened . Work has progressed on filling in the context of her political interventions and on her sources , and a clearer picture is emerging of her distinctive contribution to medieval political thought . <p> We continue this trend with this translation of Christines last major work , Le Livre de paix ( The Book of Peace ) . This text contains a mature formulation of her thoughts on good government ; Gabriel NaudT hoped to edit it in the seventeenth century ; and it was highly praised by Thomassy . Arguably , it is " one of the most important of her prose works . " It revisits many ideas she had articulated earlier in Le Livre du chemin de long estude , Le Livre de prudence , Le Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V , and Le Livre du corps de policie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political situation.Although the second and third parts of The Book of Peace show some evidence of having been written in haste , the first part , in particular , develops at length Christines thoughts on the nature of prudence and its relationship to the other virtues necessary to the development of princely rule . It is thus a crucial text for understanding the content and development of her political ideas . <p> Context and Purpose of Le Livre de Paix <p> Christines political philosophy developed during a period of intense civil disturbance and many of her works are prompted by particular crises . In 1392 the young Charles VI experienced the first of a series of mental breakdowns that rendered him often incapable of governing . In 1402 his wife , Isabeau of Bavaria , was given the authority to govern during his " absences , " but her power was soon limited by the need to gain approval from the royal council , which included Charless brother , Louis of OrlTans , and his uncles , the dukes of Burgundy and Berry . Conflicts over royal policy that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Philips death in 1404 , when John the Fearless succeeded his father as duke of Burgundy . Christines works during this period often argued for the virtues and capacities of women , thus suggesting that she advocated a greater exercise of power on behalf of Isabeau , who , as regent , might have controlled the conflict between the nobles , as , at an earlier period , Blanche of Castille had done . Christine also attempted to intervene directly in political events by writing works intended to promote wise and effective government . The intended recipient of at least two of these works , the Livre du corps du policie and Livre de paix , was the dauphin , Louis of Guyenne , Isabeaus oldest surviving son , who , as he grew older , was increasingly in a position to step into the chaos and fill the gap created by his fathers incompetence . A third work that Christine addressed to him , to which she refers in Paix 2.14 and 3.24 as the Coq or LAdvision du Coq , has been lost . <p> The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livre du corps de policie , was written only shortly prior to the assassination of Louis of OrlTans as he left Isabeaus residence near the Porte Barbette on November 27 , 1407 . This crime , which John the Fearless confessed to having organized , plunged the country into a series of crises , standoffs , slaughters , and broken peace accords which did not finally come to an end until the Peace of Arras signed in 1435 between Charles VII , Isabeaus only surviving son , and John the Fearlesss successor as duke of Burgundy , Philip the Good . <p> The composition of The Book of Peace , completed seven years after Louis of OrlTanss assassination , spanned two interludes in the subsequent series of civil disturbances , which were punctuated by various thwarted attempts to bring John the Fearless to justice for the murder of his cousin . In the month before Christine sat down to write the first part of her treatise , the dauphin had distinguished himself by helping to negotiate what turned out to be merely a temporary truce between his cousins , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed that Louis might take over the government on behalf of his incompetent father . Christine begins her exhortation to the dauphin with two chapters praising this " miraculous " intervention on behalf of peace and then turns to encouraging him to continue the peace , using as her text " Omne regnum in se divisum desolabitur et omnis civitas vel domus divisa contra se non stabit " ( Every Kingdom Divided in Itself Will Be Made Desolate , and Every City and House Divided Against Itself Will Not Stand ) . Her use of this text serves to indicate her ties to contemporary public figures involved in the ongoing negotiations to establish peace , negotiations that had been a feature of French life for some years , for this biblical text had become something of a staple for Christine and her contemporaries . She had previously quoted it in French in 1405 . Some years later , the official royal chronicler , the monk of Saint-Denis , Michel Pintoin , reporting the activities of the OrlTanist League of Gien ( which had begun to raise troops to oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1410 ) , lamented that he thought often at this time of the words of the Evangelist : " omne regnum in se ipso divisum desolabitur . " <p> In August of that year an embassy was sent to the duke of Berry , as leader of the league , the ambassadors of which included Christines acquaintances Gontier Col and William of Tignonville . Tignonville , called to speak on behalf of this embassy , also turned to this text for the theme of his oration . Christines use of it so prominently in The Book of Peace suggests a continued interaction with Tignonville , whose message she echoes , and it indicates that in all probability her political alignment was similar to his . He was someone who was acceptable to both sides of the dispute between the Burgundians and Armagnacs , and he was sent on this embassy because he was counted among those whom it was understood " were dear to " the duke of Berry . <p> Christines earlier interactions with the members of this embassy are well attested and show her positioning herself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal on moral and political matters . In the first years of the century , she had exchanged letters with Gontier Col over the morality expressed in The Romance of the Rose . A copy of these letters , which defended the virtue and authority of women , was presented to Tignonville , whose recent translation of The Sayings of the Philosophers had been quoted extensively by Christine in her Epistre Othea . Other recipients of these letters were Isabeau and Louis of OrlTanss wife , Valentina Visconti.In 1412 , when she gave the text that Tignonville had used in his diplomatic speech a prominent place in her own treatise on peace , Christine very likely hoped to remind her reader of that earlier embassy . By associating her work with that diplomatic intervention , she may also have intended to highlight the role that she too had played in past negotiations designed to bring about the peace . <p> Christine is quite deliberate in dating her Livre de paix , as she had been in dating two earlier political epistles that she had written with the intention of influencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had some beneficial effect . The first of these , her Epistre a la reine , had been written on October 5 , 1405 , addressing Isabeau at the behest of some unnamed noble involved in last-ditch negotiations to resolve the crisis then dividing the realm and threatening civil war . This crisis had been caused by an attempt , made by the queen and Louis of OrlTans , to " kidnap " the young Louis of Guyenne in order to prevent him from being dominated by his father-in-law , John the Fearless . This attempt had gone awry when John turned back the young prince , thus countermanding the queens order and insulting her dignity . <p> In 1405 , immediately after Christines letter was written , the king of Navarre and duke of Bourbon , who had been sent as ambassadors to the queen , were finally successful in getting Isabeau to heed their prayers . On October 8 , only three days after the date of Christines letter , the queen moved to Vincennes and began serious peace negotiations . By October 17 Isabeau and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconciliation of the warring dukes . These dates strongly suggest that the letter Christine wrote to the queen was presented to her by a member of the embassy and that , indeed , this letter effectively achieved its diplomatic ends . <p> The second direct political intervention was Christines Lamentacion sur les maux de guerre civile , completed on August 23 , 1410 , just five days after Tignonvilles embassy to the League of Gien . The production of both of these political pleas coincided with moments in the ongoing conflict at which a resolution appeared to have been brokered , only to collapse again soon afterward . In both cases Isabeau of Bavaria was urged by Christine to use her mediating influence to quell the civil disturbances , and in both cases Isabeau was actively pursuing the mediating role that Christine had urged on her . <p> In her Lamentacion , we see Christine again writing a plea for peace during a period of intense political negotiation . Gontier Col and William of Tignonville had been part of the embassy , which also included Jacques de la Marche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auxerre , and which was closely followed by a counter embassy to Paris and the king , led by the duke of Berrys chancellor , the bishop of Bourges . This was succeeded by yet another delegation from the king to the duke of Berry , who was now at +tampes ; this time the ambassadors included the count of St. Pol , Pierre of Navarre , and the archbishop of Reims , Simon Cramaut . Now the queen herself became involved in the negotiations and spent five days attempting to wrest concessions from the duke of Berry . These negotiations were not immediately successful , but they show the queen endeavoring to act in accordance with the prescriptions that Christine had urged in her public plea . At this stage the duke of Berry remained intransigent , and the king prepared to wage war on the OrlTanists ; he was only prevented from doing so by a clever intervention by members of the University of Paris . It was not until November 2 that the Peace of BicOtre , which required all of the dukes to return to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turmoil that necessitated these repeated diplomatic interventions had arisen largely from Charles VIs inability to impose justice . John of Burgundy , having confessed his involvement in the murder of Louis of OrlTans to his uncle , the duke of Berry , and to his cousin , Louis , king of Sicily , was allowed to escape . Early in the following year , Charles VI accepted a dubious justification of this act , prepared by Jean Petit , and pardoned John . Years later , and not long after Christines Livre de paix was completed , this pardon was withdrawn , and the justification of Jean Petit publicly burned . Indeed , the kings pronouncements on the issue of Burgundys guilt were erratic . Even when not suffering from one of his " absences , " he seems to have been highly suggestible and to have vacillated on the issue of Johns culpability according to who had his ear . A few months after the presentation of Petits justification , a moving speech demanding that it be condemned , delivered on behalf of Valentina Visconti , Louis of OrlTanss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer a humiliating public exculpation . The young dauphin , Louis of Guyenne , was present on this occasion . Significantly , in the introductory prayer that Christine addresses to him in the Livre de paix , she chooses to evoke many of the images and texts that had been used in this earlier defense of Louis of OrlTans . <p> Beginning her prayer with the text ( Ps. 8:2 ) that it is from the mouths of babes and sucklings that God is praised , Christine refers to Susanna , unjustly accused of immorality and vindicated by the words of the young David . According to Michel Pintoin , this was one of the texts cited in the address defending the duke of OrlTans , presented on behalf of Valentina , which argued for the necessity of justice . The debate over the nature of tyranny , and what is required for justice , which had been stirred up by Johns assassination of Louis , thus forms the background against which Christines book needs to be read . Christines text suggests , however , that it is John the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a tyrant , and who should fear the just punishment that tyrants deserve . <p> Triangulating on the individuals involved in Christines previous political interventions , it is possible to get a clearer picture of the milieu in which Christine moved and her intentions in writing the Livre de paix . The late Charity Cannon Willard , who prepared the original edition and pioneered Christine studies in the Anglophone world , tended to represent Christines career as beginning with an allegiance to the court of OrlTans , which was transferred to the Burgundian cause after 1403 , when Philip of Burgundy invited her to write the Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V. <p> There are , however , reasons to doubt a clear and simple transfer of allegiance by Christine . One is that she continued to cultivate many patrons throughout her career . Very prominent among these was the duke of Berry , who , while he was at different times associated with both of the warring factions , was closer to the OrlTanists than to the Burgundians . A second is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty obtaining payment for the works she had presented to him . Another has to do with the iconography of the lavish collected works , now British Library Harley 4431 , which Christine offered to Isabeau of Bavaria in 1414 , at about the same time that she completed the Livre de paix for Louis of Guyenne . This collection includes a dedication miniature representing Louis of OrlTans , wearing the symbols of his Order of the Porcupine and receiving the Epistre Othea from Christine . It also displays prominently a golden shield associated with Louis of Bourbons chivalric order of this name and so indicates support for the Bourbon and OrlTanist families who had united together with the duke of Berry in the League of Gien . The last and most important set of reasons for thinking that Christine was not a supporter of John the Fearless have to do with the timing of the Livre de paix , as well as the timing of her earlier interventions , and the people those interventions can be seen to support . <p> In order to understand Christines political position we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caught between the two sides of this conflict and attempted to steer a reconciliatory middle course . One of the nobles similarly committed to reconciliation , and who was involved in both of the diplomatic interventions that drew from Christine epistles promoting the quest for peace , was Charles " the Good , " king of Navarre . With Louis of Bourbon , he was one of the leaders of the 1405 embassy to Isabeau . He did not himself negotiate with the duke of Berry in 1410 , but his son-in-law , Jacques de la Marche , was part of the first embassy in August 1410 , while his brother Pierre , count of Mortain , took part in the second embassy . Charles of Navarre had earlier been instrumental in establishing the Peace of Chartres agreed to on March 9 , 1409 . Following the arbitrary arrest and execution of Jean of Montaigu , the grand master of the kings household , in October 1409 , this peace failed . The king of Navarre once again played an important role when he proposed the terms that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This resulted in both the OrlTanists and the Burgundians leaving Paris for their own estates . Christine named him in her Sept psaumes allegorisTs , which date from the latter half of 1409 , as the person who commanded her to write them . At this stage he was officially the ally of John of Burgundy , but faced with Montaigus execution , he is said to have been disturbed by Johns brutality . The Sept psaumes are thought to have been ordered partly by way of penance , and in translating them Christine powerfully evoked her desire for the French crown to return to its tradition of Christian kingship , epitomized in Charless ancestor Louis IX , and revived by Charles V. <p> Soon after the production of the allegorized psalms , the power of the Burgundian faction in Paris was curtailed . The outcome of the Peace of BicOtre was to remove all rival dukes from Paris , with the exception of Pierre , count of Mortain . The Burgundian provost of Paris , Pierre des Essarts , who had been directly responsible for the arrest and execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first act of the new ministers put in charge of the government as a result of the count of Mortains initiatives . <p> It was during this period , in 1410 , that Christine wrote Le Livre des fais darmes et chevalerie . It would add immeasurably to our understanding of her political position if we were able to identify the knights whom she acknowledges as having helped her by supplying her with the military information she used in this work and who encouraged her to write it . Willard suggests that " the Duke of Burgundy would surely have been the person most likely to commission such a text " and supposes that he was responsible for Christine receiving two hundred livres from the royal treasury on May 11 , 1411 . This last seems unlikely , however , for both Burgundy and Berry had been required to leave Paris in November 1410 , by the articles of the Peace of BicOtre , and Burgundy was not invited to return until September 1411 . Moreover , he did not have a copy of this work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a payment to Christine recorded in his accounts for October 1412 , this is for various books that she had given him some time earlier , for which she had not been remunerated . The tenor of the Livre des fais darmes et chevalerie is implicitly critical of both the dukes of Burgundy and OrlTans , because it limits the right to wage war to sovereign princes . This echoes edicts published early in 1411 by those then in power in Paris prohibiting any noble from raising an army without the express authorization of the royal council . So Christines book was unlikely to have been paid for at the behest of the distant duke of Burgundy and more likely to have been commissioned by one of the people then controlling Charles VIs court . <p> Thus it appears probable that Christines position was royalist and associated with a middle group acceptable to both sides of the conflict , though also in danger from both . One way of understanding her position is to see her as often adopting the role of a spokesperson for Isabeau of Bavaria , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but who had been ineffectual in extinguishing the quarrel between the princes of the blood . This means that Christine was an outright supporter of neither the OrlTanists nor the Burgundians ; she should be seen instead as primarily an advocate for the authority of Isabeau and her oldest son , Louis of Guyenne . The clear intention of the Livre de paix is to bolster Louiss authority . Its dating and content also show Christine to be sympathetic to the OrlTanist perspective , as doesit has been argued abovethe illumination of the queens manuscript , which she presented to Isabeau de Bavaria on the first day of 1414 . <p> Christine tells us that she began her Livre de paix on September 1 , 1412 , after the signing of the Peace of Auxerre . This peace brought to an end the siege of the duke of Berrys town of Bourges and resulted in the restoration of the goods of the executed Jean of Montaigus brothers , Gerard , the bishop of Paris , and Jean , archbishop of Sens . At Louis of Guyennes order , Montaigus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head retrieved from the pike at Les Halles where it had been displayed , and he was given a Christian burial . His son was also invited back from exile to join Louiss court . This peace was therefore something of a victory for the OrlTanists , and the prayers of thanks and relief that introduce the first part of the Livre de paix celebrate their return to Paris , but the peace was soon to collapse once more . <p> It is , indeed , most unlikely that Christine could have been a supporter of John the Fearless after the execution of Jean of Montaigu , given the views that she had earlier expressed in relation to the latter . In her biography of Charles V she had praised him warmly and called him her friend . According to Christine he was an excellent administrator , a friend to the poor , wise , loyal , and honest . Indeed , the thumbnail sketch she had given in that work represented him as having all the qualities appropriate to the good counselor and administrator as she later described them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Livre de paix . Unless he had significantly changed for the worse , she must have been among those who saw his arrest and hurried execution in 1409 as evidence of John the Fearlesss tyrannical exercise of arbitrary power . Indeed it is almost impossible not to read Christines description of the damage done by a hypothetical bad lord as , among other things , a commentary on the treatment of Montaigu . What , she says , will the bad lord do in order to finance his wars , given the dangers of burdensome taxation ? " In Gods name , find out where the rich are , especially what can be got from them ; it will be put about that some of them are traitors , others have been party to some bad contracts , still others have deserved death , and there are enough prepared to testify to it . And thus in diverse ways , by representing cruelty , pillage and tyranny under the color of justice , money will be found , no matter who is disinherited or ruined in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives for the time when she broke off writing her book , as she tells us , because of the failure of the peace . She represents herself as doing this on the last day of November 1412 . It is not clear what took place at this time to convince her that peace had already failed . Orators speaking in January of the next year , who are quoted by Michel Pintoin , seem still to believe that the peace was holding . But Christines pessimism may have hinged on the fact that although Montaigus brothers lands had been restored , a decision was made around this time to uphold the generality of confiscations of property that had been imposed while the duke of Burgundy was in control . Monstrelet suggests that this caused " much silent bitterness and discontent . " Christine explains in the second chapter of the second part of the Livre de paix that she left off writing her book after having come to the end of the first part and explains her failure to complete it thus : " that subject of peace eluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and base people by whose conjurations and conspiracies the good of peace has since been disturbed . " At the end of autumn in 1412 it was decided to call an assembly , which would include the bourgeoisie of Paris , the university , and deputies from the provinces , to discuss the matter of raising money to combat the English , who had landed in Guyenne , and it may be that Christine foresaw that this would also lead to trouble . It was not until the spring of 1413 , however , that Paris was rocked by a wave of civil disturbances , which culminated in the imprisonment of many nobles , including some of Isabeaus ladies in waiting . <p> Whatever caused her premonition of these events , Christine tells us that she put down her pen on the last day of November 1412 and did not take it up again until September 3 , 1413 , after the final ratification of a new peace treaty , which had been agreed on at Pontoise some months earlier . She had turned in the intervening months to writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third part of the Livre de paix . In this Advision du Coq , which she had presented to Louis during Lent in 1413 , she had warned of the ensuing troubles and pleaded with the dukes to show clemency and avoid greed and the civil war consequent on it . <p> At the beginning of March 1413 , while the assembly that had been called the previous autumn was in session , the duke of Guyenne was clearly attempting to assert himself , and for a short time he seemed to be escaping the influence of his father-in-law , the duke of Burgundy . Louis dismissed the chancellor of Guyenne , Jean de Nielle , who had been recommended for the position by John of Burgundy . Jean de Nielle was thought to have insulted the aged chancellor of France , Arnaud de Corbie , in front of the royal assembly , and Louis is said to have risen from his seat and thrown him out of the council chamber . Monstrelet says that Louis " now took the whole government into his hands and insisted that everything should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who were encouraging Louis in this enterprise as Edward , duke of Bar , Louis of Bavaria ( the queens brother ) , and the count of Vertus ( Charles of OrlTanss brother ) . He also observes that John of Burgundy was not happy about these developments , which he saw as attempting to exclude him from the administration , but he did not immediately show his displeasure . A reaction was not long in coming . <p> During February of the same year , the university had taken the opportunity afforded by the general council to complain that there would be no need of further taxation if those responsible for receiving and distributing the kings dues had not enriched themselves at the kings expense . Raymond Raguier , Charlot Poupart , Guillaume BudT , AndrT Giffart , Bureau de Dammartin , Regnier de Boullingny , and the aged chancellor of France , Arnaud de Corbie , were named and blamed for the deplorable state of the kings finances . It was soon after this that matters began to turn very nasty . The duke of Guyennes advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged him to call back Pierre Essarts , who they claimed had proof that the duke of Burgundy had been in receipt of a large quantity of gold that was unaccounted for . Pierre Essarts in fact agreed to show Louis the receipts for this money , thereby making himself " the mortal enemy " of the duke of Burgundy . He returned to Paris and took refuge , with a group of soldiers he had brought with him , in the Bastille of Saint-Antoine , the famous Bastille that had become by the time of the French Revolution . No sooner had he done so than an armed crowd was stirred up by Denys Chaumont , Simon Caboche , and an old surgeon by the name of Jean de Troyes . The agitators claimed that an attempt was being made to take over Paris . The crowd surrounded the Bastille and did not allow Pierre Essarts to leave until he was effectively arrested by the duke of Burgundy and taken to prison . Now it was his turn to be accused of corruption and of having used the kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed on July 1 , 1413 . His head was placed on a pike and his body left to hang from the gibbet , just as he had caused Jean of Montaigus to be , less than four years previously . <p> Following their blockade of the Bastille , the crowd , using as their excuse the dissolute life of the young duke of Guyenne , overran his palace and arrested Edward of Bar , Pierre de Nesson , and a number of the dukes other counselors . Included among them were Jacques de la RiviFre and Jean du Mesnil , who were subsequently killed in prison . The count of Vertus , seeing that he was likely to be the next to be arrested , fled Paris in secret . On May 12 , 1413 , the duke and queen were again accosted by an armed crowd in their palace of St. Paul . This time the queens brother , Louis of Bavaria , and a number of her ladies were also arrested and thrown into prison . Christine expresses her horror at these upheavals and uprisings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of " the mad government of the low-born and bestial people " and " the diabolical low-born people " who massacre ladies , maids , and children without thinking of the consequences . The body politic rent by civil war is monstrous , like a mad person , flaying its own limbs and eating its own members . <p> Christine has been severely criticized for showing no sympathy for the instigators of these uprisings and reacting with horror to this assault on Frances nobility and to any attempt by ordinary working people to take power . For those who see the fifteenth-century mobs as a foretaste of the French Revolution , and evidence of the first stirring of a popular democratic consciousness , Christine appears to be depressingly on the wrong side , heavily wedded to a conception of nobility by birth . For , despite her repetition and approval of Senecas claim , that the nobility that arises from the active pursuit of the virtue of prudence is more to be praised than that which comes from inheritance , she represents the common people as bereft of prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . <p> Whether this shows that Christine was " a conservative even for her own time " depends partly on how one interprets the popular uprisings of 1413 . There is much to suggest that these uprisings were not in fact ideologically driven , but that the duke of Burgundy was using a handful of agents provocateurs to stir up the crowd against the OrlTanist faction , which had , as Monstrelet says , gained the ear of the duke of Guyenne , much to John the Fearlesss displeasure . Among the crowd who attacked the Bastille of Saint-Antoine , where Pierre Essarts was trapped , were a number of nobles who belonged to the duke of Burgundys household and had served him well in his wars . Moreover , there is nothing in the speeches that have come down to us from these agitators to suggest that their aspirations were democratic . Their accusations pointed to members of a particular group of nobles who were claimed to be intent on capturing the king or attacking the Parisians . The crowd was not against nobility in general but opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to overstep their authority . <p> It needs also to be recognized that Christine shows some sympathy for the common people , and that she sees their well-being as included in the common good that it is the princes office to maintain . She makes it clear that a tyrannical prince deserves the punishment that will be the result of his brutality . Nevertheless , it would be a distortion to see anything very radical in Christines prescriptions for good government . She advocates considered , just , and clement rule in accordance with established customs , and she understands the legitimacy of the French crown as deriving from its historically established position . Like Burke , many years later , she understands law as partly gaining its legitimacy from established custom , and she expects a ruler to govern not merely by abstract principles but in accordance with the established customs of the regions within his or her jurisdiction . Thus , any attempt to overthrow a well-established authority is automatically seditious , and all one can expect from the destruction of the native nobility is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impose its own form of order , to the rebels ultimate detriment . <p> Christines clear rejection of popular government and of any direct role for low-born people in the administration of public affairs can be taken as further evidence that she was in no way aligned to the court of Burgundy during this period . For it is generally conceded that the leaders of the popular uprisings of 1413 were acting in Burgundys interests and were more or less under his control . On August 23 , only days before September 3 , 1413 , when Christine returned to singing the praises of peace , John of Burgundy had precipitously left Paris , without taking leave of the Parisians , or waiting to greet his returning cousins . He was not there to see them process through the streets escorted by a cavalcade of knights and squires , led by the chancellor of France at the head of the royal council , and dressed in the violet coats and red and black parti-colored hats that had been sent to them for the occasion by the duke of Guyenne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1413 is a renewal of her earlier celebration of the achievements of Louis who , in the preceding two months , had acted decisively to help prevent Denys Chaumont , Simon Caboche , and Henri of Troyes , the son of Jean , from derailing the events leading toward peace that had been initiated in mid-July by the king of Sicily ( Louis of Anjou ) , Charles of OrlTans , Jean of Bourbon , and the counts of Alenton and Eu at Pontoise . Articles of peace having been agreed on between the ambassadors of this group and the dukes of Berry and Burgundy by the end of July , these terms were sent to Paris to be ratified by the university and parliament . At this juncture the whole process was nearly scuttled when Chaumont , Caboche , and Troyes occupied the town hall , while the rich bourgeoisie , encouraging Louis of Guyenne to put himself at their head , armed themselves in order to impose peace . The threat of bloodshed was avoided partly by the actions of John the Fearless , who had enough leverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders to disperse quietly , and partly through a show of strength on the part of Louis of Guyenne . Placing himself fully armed at the head of the bourgeoisie , Louis ordered Berry and Burgundy to accompany him and marched through the city to the Louvre and then to the Palais , from whence he freed Louis of Bavaria , Edward of Bar , and many others who had been imprisoned during the spring . No sooner freed , these two were given control of the castle of the Louvre and the Saint-Antoine gates , respectively , thus benefiting from the dismissal of Henri and Jean of Troyes a few days earlier . <p> That Christine saw these events as cause for celebration gives one final reason for thinking that her sympathies did not lie with the Burgundians . We should not , however , see her as an unqualified supporter of either Louis of Guyenne or of the OrlTanists . Her lost Advision du Coq had been written at a point in time when Louis came under the influence of a group of relatively young OrlTanists . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it expressed warnings about the direction in which he was being led . Implicit in the Livre de paix are a number of criticisms of Louiss youthful self-indulgence , which indicate that , despite the high hopes that she had had for him in 1412 , Christine was less sure by 1413 that he would follow in his grandfather Charles Vs footsteps and learn to rule himself so as to be able to rule others . She inserts into the discussion of magnanimity , in her second book , a warning against spending too much time in solitude and cautions against all kinds of frivolous behavior , which might lead to his subjects despising him . The nocturnal orgies , debauchery , and other scandalous activities the young duke pursued , despite his mothers prayers and good advice , had provided the pretext for the crowd , which had overrun his palace in May and had arrested Edward of Bar and his other young companions . Despite Christines endorsement of his mothers point of view , the dauphin appears not to have mended his ways , and ten months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris , the young dukes dissolute lifestyle was being blamed on Moy , Montauban , and Croy , companions who were represented as Burgundians . The chancellor of France complained during secret deliberations held in the Louvre on January 9 that the queen and various princes saw well that the duke of Guyenne often refused to attend the Royal Council and that he was surrounded by flatterers who encouraged him in libertinage , laziness , and frivolous pleasures such as staying up late and listening to music . At this juncture the queen attempted to assert her own authority and her right to govern as regent , using Robert le Maton as her spokesperson . <p> Christines Political Ideas <p> Central to Christines understanding of the art of government is that it should be directed toward the common good and be guided by wisdom and the virtue she calls " prudence , " the word used by French medieval authors to translate Aristotles phronesis . In the French translation of Aristotles Politics , commissioned by Charles V as part of a program of translations that Christine praised , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au prince " ( The virtue of prudence only is proper to the prince ) . While the exact interpretation of this phrase is contestable , it expresses two ideas : prudence by itself entails all the virtues , and it is the possession of prudence that is definitive of the good prince . Elsewhere Aristotle says more clearly that " if a man have the one moral virtue of prudence he will also have all the moral virtues together with it . " This Aristotelian framework permeates Christines political writing , although she fundamentally disagrees with Aristotle over womens capacity for prudence , using against him his own claim that prudence is exercised in household management . Christine introduces the Livre de paix with the following explanation of her intentions in writing it : " The first part exhorts my lord of Guyenne to the preservation of peace , and speaks of the virtue of prudence and of what it requires of princely government . " The book is thus structured as an account of the nature of political prudence . <p> It is in the fifth chapter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prudence : " This Prudence serves our spiritual welfare just as much as our corporeal for by her man desires to know God , to love and fear him , and to know the things which lead to salvation and to live by them . For without this knowledge all other prudence is nothing but folly . " In his Ethics Aristotle had explained that phronesis is a virtue rather than an art and had characterized it as " a truth-attaining rational quality concerned with action in relation to things that are good and bad for human beings . " Christines direct knowledge of Aristotles Ethics , whether in Latin , or in the French translation prepared by Nicolas Oresme for Charles V , has been a matter of some obscurity . Nevertheless , elements of her representation of prudence in the first part of her book suggest that she modeled it on Aristotles discussion of prudence in the sixth book of the Ethics . She moves , for instance , as does Aristotle , from discussing the political virtue of prudence to discussing good counselors . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christines material comes from later reformulations of Aristotelian themes . For instance , in the Livre de paix she draws a great deal of material from Brunetto Latinis Livre du TrTsor , which contains a long paraphrase of the Ethics , so her restatement of Aristotle could be largely derived from this source . <p> In her Livre de prudence of 1406 ( a version of which is called Le Livre de la prodhommie de lhomme ) , Christine drew on a set of definitions of the virtues translated from Alan of Lilles treatise De Virtutibus et de vitiis et de donis Spiritus Sancti . Reformulating Aristotles definition , Alan defines prudence as " discepcion de bonnes et mauvaises choses en la fuyte du mal et lelection du bien " ( discernment of good and evil things in the flight from evil and pursuit of good ) . In the Livre de paix this definition is repeated by Christine but applied to discretion : " Discretion . . . is a virtue by which we can distinguish good and evil , and choose the good because it is valuable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or discretion , which derives from reason , is here represented by Christine as the first of the four cardinal virtues and as the mother and guide of all the virtues . <p> Christine was also influenced by Aquinass discussion of prudence in his Commentary on the Metaphysics of Aristotle , from which she translated passages inserted into LAdvision Cristine , written in late 1405 . Aquinass fusion of Christianity and Aristotle , which takes over much from the earlier fusion of Platonism and Christianity found in Boethius and Augustine , forms the background to what one might call Christines political epistemology , her treatment of political wisdom as a branch of theology . For we should take quite seriously her assertion , quoted above , that prudence serves to determine mans spiritual as well as corporeal welfare . For Christine , political theory is a branch of theology , the study of the highest being , which is God . Thus knowledge of how to govern well is inseparable from an understanding of Gods nature . Her outlook is also very much that of her Italian precursor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition that " since knowledge is the highest perfection of our soul , in which our supreme happiness is found , we are all driven by our very nature by the desire to attain this . " So practical knowledge of how to bring about the good contributes to spiritual perfection . The Bibleas the word of God is therefore read by Christine as a repository of political wisdom in which it is demonstrated how immorality leads to the destruction of kingdoms . Christines method in the Livre de paix , which is to expand on and gloss Latin passages that she has gleaned from the Bibleand from ancient authors , can thus be seen as both synthesizing classical and Christian wisdom and continuing Charles Vs program of vernacular translation . <p> In the Livre de paix Christine offers a utopian vision of an intelligent , just ruler , able to take the advice of those who are older and wiser , hard working , peace loving , clement , and at the same time firm in dispensing justice . Despite the lamentable political situation of her time , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible on earth as well as in heaven . Here one can detect the influence of Dante on her political thought . Christines debt to Dante is clearest in her poem Le Chemin de long estude from 14023 . In this dream allegory she is guided on her adventure , as was Vergil in the Aeneid , by the Cumean sibyl . But she is not led through the underworld , as Vergil had been , but into the realm of the celestial spheres that Dante had described in both the Paradiso and Convivio . Passing by the long path of learning , she is taken into the celestial firmament , where she witnesses a debate between Wealth , Nobility , Chivalry , and Wisdom over the qualities required in the monarch who , as ruler of a single Christian empire , would bring peace to earth . We can deduce from this , given that Vergil took the place of the Cumean sibyl in Dantes Divine Comedy , that Christine intends to suggest that the Cumean sibyl stands in place of Dante , who is Christines inspiration . Passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided by the sibyl , she evokes Dante : <p> Mais le nom du plaisant pourpris <p> Oncque mais ne me fu appris , <p> Fors en tant que bien me recorde <p> Que Dant de Flourence recorde <p> En son livre quil composa <p> Ou il moult beau stile posa , <p> Quant en la sive fu entrez <p> Ou tout de paour ert oultrez , <p> Lors que Virgile saparu <p> A lui do n't  il fu secouru , <p> Adont lui dist par grand estude <p> Ce mot : " Vaille moy lonc estude <p> Qui ma fait cercher tes volumes <p> Par qui ensemble accointance eumes . " <p> The name of that pleasant grove <p> Was no sooner learnt by me <p> Than straight away I remembered <p> That Dante of Florence recorded <p> In his book which he composed <p> Where a beautiful style he showed <p> That when he entered the wood <p> And was overcome with dread <p> Vergil appeared to him , then <p> Offering help to him , when <p> He said to him by great study <p> " Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your books <p> And brought us into acquaintance . <p> Her knowledge of this authors works is manifest throughout the poem , particularly in verses 304066 where she paraphrases Dantes argument that in order to put an end to the greed that causes war and dissension , the world needs a single universal monarch who will reign in justice . <p> In Monarchia , arguing that the best possible world order is one in which justice is strongest , Dante quotes a famous line from Vergils fourth Eclogue : " Now the Virgin returns , the reign of Saturn returns . " He tells us that the virgin is also called " justice " or " Astrea " and reads these lines as stating that with the coming of justice there will be a new golden age , repeating the supposed era in which Christ was born and Augustus ruled , and showing in his optimism the influence of the prophetic view of history developed by Joachim of Fiore . In the Livre du chemin de long estude Christine also alludes to prophecies of the coming of the Antichrist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become associated with the Joachimist corpus . She shows her familiarity with this prophetic tradition in LAdvision as well , where she mentions Joachim and attempts to read Biblical history as providing the pattern of historical events . <p> In the Livre du chemin de long estude , Christine assumes the possibility of justice being brought to earth by a single monarch and stages a debate as to the qualities that would be necessary in such a universal ruler . In the Livre de paix her aim is more limited and realistic . It is simply to urge the young Louis to take on the character of the just ruler and to maintain peace in France . Yet even here , the optimistic outlook found in Dante can be detected . Christine inscribes at the head of her chapter in praise of Louis : " Fiat pax in virtute tua " ( Let there be peace in your strength ) a line from the Psalms that encapsulates the hope that temporal power can be both governed by and impose peace . Later in her work , and echoing Dante , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used by Dante to show that , because the sphere of heaven is guided by a single source of motion , Godmonarchy , or undivided rule , which he calls empireis needed for the well-being of the world . In Christines hands Boethiuss claim , that men would be happy , if only the love by which the heavens is ruled were to rule their minds , is applied to Frenchmen : " oh , you men of France , you will be so blessed if you desire it : that is , if you are governed by the love that holds up the heavens and without which nothing is stable . " <p> By 1417 , when Christine sent her Prison de la vie humaine to Mary of Berry , she had apparently given up her optimism that peace could be found on earth . There she developed the theme that the soul is trapped in the body and imprisoned below , only to be released into happiness at death . But she returned to her optimistic and prophetic voice in Le DitiT de Jehanne dArc , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronation of Charles VII in 1429 . In this poem she represents Joan as the fulfillment of the prophecies of Merlin , the sibyls , and Bede , and as having been sent to earth to help Charles VII fulfill the predictions of the Charlemagne prophecy . This prophecy was also part of the pseudo-Joachimist corpus and proposed that a son of Charles would conquer Rome and rule as a new Augustus . Of course , Christines optimism was , once again , unjustified , but Joan at least provided striking proof of Christines belief that women had a part to play in history and could demonstrate all the capacities and excellences available to humanity . <p> Christines prescription for stable government is a well-educated and prudent prince who listens carefully to older and wiser counsel and acts only after the best advice has been taken . Because her political works are responses to specific events and have a primarily didactic purpose , Christine does not explicitly engage in argument in order to justify monarchy , and she skirts around the issue of the monarchs duty to accept advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of absolutism or of the existence of " bridles " on the kings power , as we see one hundred years later in Claude de Seyssels The Monarchy of France . Indeed , although she insists on the importance of taking advice , she is also very aware of the danger of corrupt or incompetent counselors . These must be avoided . Christine advises that the king will need the counsel provided by experienced individuals from all estates who are experts in their fields and have shown themselves to be honest and intelligent . He has a moral obligation to heed such counselors , but she never invokes the right of parliament or even the Royal Council to impose its advice on the king . <p> Christine is very aware of the importance of the appearance of majesty and the dangers of defamatory loose talk that undermines royal authority . In her earlier portrait of Charles V , she had excused herself for having only praised the virtues of this king and his relations , without mentioning their vices , suggesting that it was dangerous to publicly undermine rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Livre de paix also , she works to encourage respect for the monarchy and encourages the dauphin to deserve that respect . He should administer justice promptly and with firmness , make himself a worthy example of the dignity of his office , avoid anger and cruelty , be liberal , clement , and truthful . He should make himself available to his subjects and always dress in a manner appropriate to his station . <p> From a modern point of view this image appears as something of a clichT . If monarchies could only guarantee themselves such monarchs , they might well offer good government , but monarchs are human , and humans , placed in a position of excessive power , are rarely capable of living up to any such ideal . Soon Christines insistence that a king should heed good counsel will develop into the demand that the monarchs power be constrained by counsel . But Christine never discusses such formal constraints on the power of the monarch . Nevertheless , we should not judge Christines originality by what came after but in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this work one can see her stamping her own quite original mark on the tradition of the virtuous Christian prince . Often this emerges as much in the imagery that she uses as in the content of her advice . <p> At the time Christine was writing , the observation that discretion , or alternatives of prudence , was the mother of the virtues was already a well-worn phrase , found , in the first version , in St. Benedicts rule and , in the second , in Abelard , as well as in Cicero and many others . Yet Christine manages to make the idea graphic and takes almost literally the feminine character of the virtue of prudence . In her Epistre Othea , she had made Othea the " goddess of prudence " who offered the young Hector advice on how to attain chivalric virtue . In Livre de paix prudence is called " an excellent daughter of discretion " capable of organizing everything well , and once again , Christines language underscores the feminine character of the virtue . Though she does not point out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running of kingdomsshe had done so elsewhereChristines language conveys an image of the prince as a careful and circumspect manager who differs from the good housekeeper only in the size and importance of the domain for which he must care . <p> She is particularly aware of the importance of what we would now call " good governance " for the economic prosperity of the realm . Magistrates must not be corrupt , they should be elected to their offices by merit , and the practice of allowing positions to be bought should cease . The consequence will be increased economic activity and the encouragement of trade by foreign merchants , who will know that their commercial activities and property rights are secure . <p> The definition of justice as giving each person what is due to them is also well-known , being at least as old as Platos Republic . Christine feminizes the trope and justice becomes " a faithful housekeeper who distributes and shares out for each person that part and portion which is due for their acts , whether they be good or bad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christine asserts that the king who loves justice will be protected and shielded from misfortune and will grow in prosperity . Thus , in her hands , the feminine gender of the abstract nouns develops into a full-blown feminization of the political virtues , which gives her writing a flavor quite different from other medieval and early modern political writers . One sees this same tendency in other works by Christine . In the opening passages of her Livre du corps de policie , she had introduced an image of human happiness as a queen seated on a throne served by the virtues . It is not until one looks at the original source of the passage from Augustines City of God , which Christine has adapted to extract this image , that one recognizes that she has transformed a well-known misogynist trope that derives from Cicero , and which assumes the arbitrariness of female rule , into an allegorical evocation of the nobility and benefits of a feminine ruler . <p> The feminine personification of the virtues in Christines political thought complements her explicit arguments to the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence of attaining the highest levels of human excellence . Her extended argument in the Livre de la citT des dames , illustrated by ancient , early Christian , and contemporary examples , that women are not defective men but capable of all the same kinds of excellence thus builds on a general conception of human nature , which is motivated by a desire for knowledge of the good . In the Livre des trois vertus , Christine represents herself as a bird catcher attempting to populate her city of ladies with virtuous women , and she offers her teaching to women under the guise of the teachings of prudence . Reading her teachings through the modern connotations of this word , one is inclined to hear Christines injunctions as small-minded , self-interested , and cautious . While there is an element of intelligent caution , however , and even craftiness , in the advice that she offers to princesses , it is important to realize that the prudence she is advocating for women is the same Aristotelian phronesis that forms the basis of a princes practical activity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one sees that she has painted a portrait of an ideal Christian monarch who is a wise and prudent ruler , and she has outlined a role that could be filled by a woman as well as by a man . It was , indeed , perhaps filled as well by Elizabeth I of England as by any other monarch of the early modern period . Moreover , the imagery of Elizabeths rule drew on the same sources that we have seen Christine deriving from Dante . Elizabethan eulogists returned to the image of Astrea , the virgin justice , to depict Elizabeths rule , reworking the feminine personification of the virtues to womens benefit , as Christine had done . The extent of Christines influence on this iconography is a subject that has not been fully investigated . Certainly , English translations of the Livre de la citT des dames and the Livre du corps de policie had been printed in Londonin 1521 , without their author being acknowledged , and there is some evidence that the Livre du chemin de long estude was also available . Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes inspired by Christines Livre de la citT des dames , and among the volumes in the royal library there were copies of this work as well as the Epistre Othea and the Livre des fais darmes et de chevalerie . Elizabeth is unlikely to have known Christines Livre de paix , which did not have a wide circulation , and of which only three manuscripts have survived . Yet her actions and the imagery that she used to represent herself have much in common with that developed by Christine . By emphasizing the foundation of good government in prudence , and by demonstrating womens exercise of prudence in many spheres of life , Christine developed what might be called an image of an androgynous ideal of monarchy capable of being exemplified as much by a man as by a woman . Her hopes for Louis of Guyenne were not realized ; he died soon after the battle of Agincourt , without ever having justified the aspirations that Christine had held for him . But Christine has left us in her Livre de paix a passionate and timely call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace .

Many scholars consider them the first Latin autobiography in the West after Augustine 's Confessions . <p> Readers will be stirred and surprised by Guibert 's intense preoccupation with the sinfulness of his soul , his visions of demons and necromancy , and his frank struggle to come to terms with his sexuality . But Guibert is also a valuable witness to his age . In addition to his personal history , his memoirs give a brief chronicle of the abbey of Nogentwhere he served as abbot for some twenty yearsand a vivid account of the bloody uprising of the Laon Commune in 1112 .

Guiberts book is important , not just for the insight into monastic life given by a learned man who was also an accomplished stylist . The section based on his own experience as abbot of Nogent , in touch with ecclesiastical and secular leaders , is one of the most important sources for the history of the revolt of the commune of Laon and the murder of the bishop in 1112 .

Edmund Husserl , Martin Heidegger , Jean-Paul Sartre , and Simone de Beauvoir were prominent among those thinkers preoccupied with conceptualizing the contemporary situation of human beings . Phenomenology and existentialism were the products of these reflections . For Husserl , phenomenology is the study of phenomena , of things as they appear to us in experience and not as they are either in themselves or in reality . Thus Husserl was able to focus on the sense or meaning of phenomena for a pure human consciousness rather than become entangled in mundane debates about reference . Nonetheless , Heidegger , along with most phenomenologists of the following generation , demanded a return to " being-in-the-world , " beginning with our own insertion into the everyday world of useful things and proceeding from there to the reflective acts of " Dasein , " a being who is aware of and brings into question the meaning of its own existence as well as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heideggers conception of human Dasein in the world , Sartre situates human beings in relation to their modes of temporalization in order to differentiate between Being-in-itself ( nonconscious being ) , Being-for-itself ( a transcendence that nihilates any particular being ) , and Being-for-others ( the self as an object for others ) . For Sartre , every transcendent being is a flight toward its projects , which it can only achieve through the nihilation of its own immanence and the objectification of other beings , thereby denying them their transcendence in order to achieve its own . Unsatisfied with the knowing subject of a pure phenomenology , as well as with the conflicts of Sartres transcendent subject , Beauvoir posits an embodied subject who fully expresses the ambiguity of lived experience . This subject has been described as one whose intentionality is imbued with joy and delight at her awareness of the intersubjective world as the site of freedom , a freedom that does not entail objectification of others . Thus , the subjects delight exceeds and overcomes the feeling of anxiety that arises in the encounter with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for an ethics in which the subject recognizes that the ethical will to liberate the other and to delight in the others existence can and must undermine any desire to control them . <p> Although frequently associated with Sartre , through the journal Les Temps Modernes , Merleau-Ponty maintained a critical distance from Sartres subject-object structure with its attendant intersubjective conflicts . Instead , he turned to empirical psychology to articulate a novel theory of the relation between embodied consciousness and nature , defined as the organic , the psychological , and the social worlds . Critical of the philosophical presuppositions of both " objectivism , understood as naturalism in philosophy , behaviorism in psychology , and mechanism in biology ; and on the other hand , what he calls intellectualism , " a form of neo-Kantianism , Merleau-Ponty reinterprets Gestalt psychology to develop his own analysis of the structure of experience insofar as it is given to us phenomenologically . Hence , the title of his first book , The Structure of Behavior.After repeated excursions to the Husserl archives at the University of Louvain , Belgium , Merleau-Ponty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex account of perceptual experience . This inclusion opened Merleau-Pontys thinking to phenomenology as the study of phenomena , that is , to things as they appear to our experience , as well as to the meanings things have in our experience . No doubt , as Sonia Kruks has argued , this view appeared as a claim against the tradition of epistemology . Rather than positing a knower " who can come to have real knowledge of objects that are independent of his or her own existence , " Merleau-Ponty insists that " the relation of knower to known , of subject to object , always takes place in situation . " This leads to the necessity of showing that situated knowledge is not uniquely private but shared , a necessity all the more urgent if we take phenomenology to be the description of experience from the point of view of an individual subjectivity . Thus , while phenomenology in general must pay great attention to the ontological question of what it is to be a " being-in-situation , " given his grounding in empirical psychology , Merleau-Pontys particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perceptual being . <p> The feminist encounter with Maurice Merleau-Ponty can be said to have started with Simone de Beauvoirs 1945 review of Merleau-Pontys PhTnomTnologie de la perception , in which Beauvoir expresses her agreement with the idea of the situated , embodied subject . Our body , she argues , is our manner of being at the world ( Otre au monde ) and it involves itself in the sensible world by taking up and assuming spatial existence . This occurs , according to Merleau-Ponty , when we do not treat space as merely a container in which objects and persons appear , nor understand it as a system unified by a subject who acts , but instead reflect on our situated experience as a third spatiality . What we discover , he argues , is a system of possible actions and a body whose place is defined according to its tasks or interests in the world and according to how it is situated because , for such a body , space is an open field of corporeal possibilities . In order to clarify his point , Merleau-Ponty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which she sees a room only through a mirror that reflects it at a forty-five-degree angle , and the subject will at first see the room as slanted . Anyone walking through the room appears to be leaning and any object falling in the room falls obliquely . Overwhelmingly , the subject feels herself not at home with the room and its activities . But after a few minutes something strange and miraculous occurs : the room , the person walking through the room , and the falling object become vertical . This " miracle " can take place because the body is not some thing in an objectively held space but is located where there is something to be done , an activity to be carried out , no matter how rudimentary . Walking , sitting , opening a door , using an object , all resituate the embodied subject so she feels that she can inhabit the room . As Merleau-Ponty claims , " It is then , a certain possession of the world by my body , a certain gearing of my body to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an embodied , situated subject reflects the bodys potential for certain movements such as sitting , standing , and reaching , and also the demand for vertical rather than oblique planes . Likewise it reflects the spatial environment as something that calls for certain kinds of movements and certain kinds of actions so that not only does the embodied subject inhabit and enjoy space , but she is also open to the influence and power over herself of things and spaces and , also , of other embodied beings . The integration that the embodied subject experiences between herself and her environment takes place when the subjects motor intentions unfold as the world responds in accordance with the subjects expectations . Such a perceptual ground is fundamentally " a basis of my life , a general setting in which my body can coexist with the world , " and so with others . The connection to other living beings arises because every conceivable being , Merleau-Ponty maintains , is related directly or indirectly to this general setting , this perceived world , making it the horizon of all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever perception follows it . In order for this not to result in an infinite regress , Merleau-Ponty opts for a prepersonal orientation for the experiencing subject , a prepersonal , anonymous life that can only be located in the body , a communication with the world that he declares is more ancient than thought , saturating consciousness , yet impenetrable to reflection . These considerations are at the basis of the feminist invocation and feminist critique of Merleau-Ponty . Beauvoir voices no fundamental disagreement with Merleau-Pontys conception of the situated subject , and Merleau-Ponty even argues that it is Beauvoir who laid the foundations for existential phenomenology in her novel She Came to Stay . There , in her account of a woman on the edge of a love triangle , Beauvoir creates a character who discovers that her fundamental communications with others occur less in relation to her intentional consciousness than in her bodily situatedness , her spatial location in a world in which other beings and things are integrated with her own environment . Beauvoir affirms Merleau-Pontys conception when she argues that situated existence must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our body , a previously given or prepersonal spatiality characterizing each body ; a milieu that must remain somewhat opaque but is also the background of our embodied interconnections . <p> Following Beauvoir , it is probably Luce Irigaray who has had the greatest impact on feminist interpretations of Merleau-Ponty . Not only does she rethink Merleau-Pontys conception of spatiality , introducing the concept of the interval and rethinking that of the chiasm , but she also addresses the privilege Merleau-Ponty accords to visibility . For Merleau-Ponty , the chiasmatic relation entails the double and crossed situating of the visible and the tangible and the tangible in the visible , as well as the relation between seer and seen , touching and being touched , such that the seer is looked at by the things she sees and touched by the things she touches . The chiasmatic relation implies , as well , a new ontological conceptualization , that of the flesh , a connective tissue or intertwining constituting both world and body on a prepersonal level . Although she embraces the concept of the chiasmus , Irigaray is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ever turning to herself as site of a positive element , " and so the positive and negative poles always divide themselves between the two sexes . In place of this Irigaray proposes a double loop in which each sex moves out toward the other then back to itself . This , in turn , makes possible the concept of the interval , the intermediate , the space between each double loop in which entirely new relations between subject and object , woman and man , are possible . For Irigaray , without such an interval , no subject can even enter the world , for there would be no spacing for the freedom of questioning between two . Moreover , two sentient beings would have to inhabit the same world in the same way in order to even encounter each other , and the risk that one would overwhelm the other is always present . Following her reformulation of the chiasmatic relation , and to the extent that Merleau-Pontys conception does seem to privilege vision , Irigaray asserts not simply that the visible and the tactile are reversible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by the sound of the mothers voice . As such , the prepersonal realm is much less anonymous than Merleau-Ponty postulates and much more the realm of the maternal-feminine . <p> Merleau-Pontys descriptions of the prepersonal structures of existence that are prior to and the ground of any intellectual relations with the world have been subject to extensive critique for their masculinist bias . Iris Marion Young points out that Merleau-Ponty has attracted the interest of feminist philosophers by locating subjectivity in the body , thereby giving the lived body ontological status as the first locus of intentionality , a pure presence to the world and an openness to its possibilities . Nevertheless , she echoes Irigarays concerns by stating that an epistemology emerging from a feminine subjectivity might well privilege touch over sight and that Merleau-Ponty only occasionally offers a concept of the lived body specific to women , a bodily comportment typical of both feminine existence and of the modes and structures in the world that condition that existence . Others , among them Judith Butler , have praised some aspects of Merleau-Pontys work while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recognition of social and historical factors that are intrinsic to any theory of the body , which is not , for him , coextensive with mere existence . Nevertheless , Butler , more forcefully than Young , has argued that Merleau-Ponty privileges the gaze in matters of sexuality , which he describes in unremittingly heterosexual terms , a perspective that he tends to naturalize , forgetting his previous commitment to historical and cultural life . Michel Le Doeuff is even more explicit in her critique of Merleau-Ponty , arguing that the visible body , perceived by the so-called normal subject , is a womans body seen by the gaze of the man , who will soon move from gaze to gesture , from vision to touch , remaking what he sees , accenting his own erogenous tastes . The disturbing implication of this position is that each woman seen by a man is seen from within the framework of what Le Doeuff takes to be a generalized structure of power , the power of each man to redraw or remake anything he sees no matter how idiosyncratically this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm , where male scholars still publish books about women making use only of the work of other male scholars and implyingusing reasoning very much like that used by Merleau-Pontythat a man has the right to represent women as he wishes . <p> More recently , feminist philosophers have begun a reassessment of the value of Merleau-Pontys philosophy for feminism . Although they do not deny the masculine bias of his thinking , there is , nevertheless , a concerted attempt to take up what is most useful in his work . Sonia Kruks and Gail Weiss , who have both contributed essays to this volume , are significant in this new effort . Kruks traces Merleau-Pontys usefulness to feminist philosophy to the obvious affinities between the ideas of Beauvoir and those of Merleau-Ponty . Kruks argues that " although Merleau-Ponty is . . . well aware that objectifying and alienating relations are not only possible but often central to human existence , his account of the lived experience of the bodythe body that perceives , moves , touches , and acts in this worldis not that of a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she argues , Merleau-Pontys notion of the body is that it is a generality ; in other words , as embodied , subjects inhabit an anonymous or prepersonal realm , which he later called flesh , and which includes both the flesh of bodies and the flesh of the world . It is flesh that provides human beings with a general atmosphere of intersubjective communication prior to cognition and therefore prior to social or gender stratification . For her part , Weiss finds much of value in Merleau-Pontys conception of the body image , the corporeal schema that plays an indispensable stabilizing role in the perceptual process and makes it possible for the perceiver to come into possession of a world . Although the body might be subject to oppression from others or from society , insofar as it is a style of being , a body image , embodied being , is also the condition of the possibility of transformation and openness to possibilities . Most important for Weiss is the idea that , already for Merleau-Ponty , there are a plurality of body images for every embodied being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each being inhabits . Intercorporeality , in Weisss account , arises as an originary openness to others , who , in turn , contribute to the constitution of each self by means of the differential or diacritical structure that organizes both perception and language and that makes it possible to articulate the extent to which the social and the bodily realm intertwine without the latter becoming the cause of the former . <p> Given the importance of Merleau-Pontys contribution to the phenomenological idea of situated embodiment , every chapter in this volume , in some significant manner , reflects on what it means to be a spatially situated and embodied subject and how it is either possible or necessary to make this the basis of both our individual and our intersubjective lives . If Merleau-Pontys claims can be upheld , then the spatial situatedness of prepersonal existence not only grounds and resituates our experience of the environment and things , but more important , also grounds the experience of other human beings as other and resituates them as related to the perceiving subject in the midst of their multiple differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , if , as we claimed above , the bodys place is defined according to its tasks or interests in the world , this will be the case not only with respect to the world of things but also with respect to other human beings . As human beings , our tasks and interests situate our experience . Thus , in this volume , the question will often arise of whether Merleau-Ponty has solved the problematic of sexual difference , especially with respect to the question of the gender of the prepersonal as well as the intentional subject . Many of the chapters in this volume address whether , or the extent to which , the ethics of sexual difference can be successfully formulated by his phenomenology . The answer may well lie in how each of the authors takes up the question of Merleau-Pontys as well as her or his own tasks and interests , for on Merleau-Pontys account , what interests us is what we will seek to ground and situate with respect to our experience and knowledge . <p> The tasks and interests with which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodiment as they encourage or discourage sexual difference in Merleau-Pontys work . In the opening chapter , " Merleau-Ponty and the Problem of Difference in Feminism , " Sonia Kruks lays out the framework for an ethics of sexual difference from the perspective of an intersubjective interpretation of Merleau-Ponty . Although Kruks admits that Merleau-Ponty does mostly conceive of the body as masculine , she argues that embodiment alone is not necessarily a guarantee of intersubjectivity , since embodiment is a site of antagonisms and conflicts as much as it offers positive potentialities for communication and harmonious intersubjectivity . Kruks maintains that feminism has a need to acknowledge both situated knowledges and objective or shared and public knowledges , and she argues that Merleau-Pontys existential phenomenology performs precisely this task . He does this , she thinks , because his philosophical arguments are dialectical , so that his abstract accounts of embodiment must be interpreted through the lens of his later , more complex ideas on culture , language , politics , and history . Merleau-Ponty thus places the perceiver in a situated world that she can not wholly control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which each interacts with the other in order to be what it is . For Kruks , this is the basis of Merleau-Pontys conception of an anonymous and prepersonal embodiment , but it is also the basis of anyones particular point of view insofar as having a body and being able to look gives one a spatial location and so a view of the world . Thus the prepersonal is always also particular and suffused with social significations , and the relation between self and world can thereby be understood to involve both affirmation and negation and so is dialectical . However , the existence of others presents difficulties , and solipsism affirms the extent to which it is possible , on Merleau-Pontys account , for others to exist only as objects for the subject . Kruks proposes that , in the end , what brings us together is our affective bond with others , by which we participate in acts of solidarity with those whose social identities are different from our own . This is the basis of feminist solidarity : since womens bodies and lives are highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of feminine embodiment is adequate to account for solidarity and possible positive intersubjective relations . Yet Kruks seems to acknowledge that intersubjective relations will of necessity be partial , for the dialectical nature of embodiment incorporates a negative moment as well as a positive one so that it is up to us to choose which aspect of our embodiment to live . <p> The felt , affective bond with others that Kruks proposes as the basis of intersubjective relations is precisely the problem taken up in Dorothea Olkowskis chapter , " Only Nature Is Mother to the Child . " Beginning with Merleau-Pontys claim that understanding an experience , as opposed to living through it , tends to produce distortions that never quite capture the authenticity of the lived-through moment and that the childs experience of authenticity and immediacy is an indispensable acquisition underlying maturity , the question Olkowski raises is , Why does Merleau-Ponty insist on the primacy of nature so as to exclude any traces of the childs relation to a mother ? Nowhere in the human cultural world does the child appear to find positive affective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of coexistence or reciprocity , intersubjective attachments appear to be impossible . Even though Merleau-Ponty recognizes that the childs world is originally a world of feeling , he is led to give up the idea of the psyche , the feeling one has of ones own existence , and to replace it with the concept of behavior . In other words , Merleau-Ponty trades off what is feltincluding the felt relation to the mother , who nurtures and cares for the child , for behavior , which can be seen and so is predominantly visual . This move resolves certain crucial problems , such as how the child comes to have an experience of the other . But in dismissing a fundamental tactile or felt experience of the child , Merleau-Ponty gives up the childs felt relation , not just with an other , but with a mother , proposing instead that the child begins in a state in which she is unaware of any self-other differences at all , and then by means of the specular image , comes to see herself and others as separate beings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an undifferentiated world , what could possibly introduce differentiation ? Intersubjectivity may well commence with the felt experience of the child , which begins in the body of the woman who gives birth , who carries the child to term , and who then nurtures and cares for the child . Without this felt , intersubjective life , vision alone does not guarantee that what is seen is understood by the child to be an other or a separate being . This is affirmed in Merleau-Pontys own account by his acknowledgment that specular knowledge of oneself is also alienation , that in gazing into the mirror the child is no longer what she felt herself to be but is only that image in the mirror . Since the feeling component of lived experience has been dismissed by Merleau-Ponty as being too chaotic to offer any meaningful information to the child , the child can only experience herself , the world , and others through the specular image . However , caught up in this image , the child is alienated from herself , from the world , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this empty human world , Merleau-Ponty falls back upon the hypothesis of an originary experience of harmonized nature . Yet , as Olkowski concludes , if the childs felt experience of birth and being nurtured by the mother is nothing but undifferentiated chaos , there appears to be an unbridgeable gap between the experience of the child and the experience of the adult , which vision does not close . <p> In " White Logic and the Constancy of Color , " Helen Fielding addresses intersubjectivity by means of what she calls an underlying theme for Merleau-Ponty , that is , the suppression of lived corporeal creativity and its submission to the minds unifying representational activity . She asks , How does an embodied subject both encounter a sedimented , thus familiarly significant , world and also remain open to new forms of sedimentation ? How can we use our cognition to make sense of what we experience even while remaining alive to the possibilities that our corporeal interactions generate ? One the one hand , Fielding argues that phenomenological description can be used to reveal the invisible operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , she finds that phenomenology also neutralizes its own activities and so obscures the relations of dominance that it creates . Exemplary , in this regard , according to Fielding , are the invisible operations of the phenomenal structures that privilege white skin in Western culture , structures that obscure the privilege they make possible behind a screen of neutrality and normality . Fielding supports the position that the apparent cultural invisibility of white skin is oriented by racially and sexually specific understandings of a mind/body dualism linking mind to a white male and inherently rational European model , while it links the body to a feminine " colored " emotional embodiment . Given that white as a hue is taken to be no color because it is all colors , it is easily made to designate the human norm as well as social norms in which white symbolizes the good . <p> Yet perception demands difference and only color allows differentiation . Because white light best illuminates the structure of objects , uniformly reflecting the varied surfaces of objects , it is almost always favored over colored lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides an important clue to the apprehension of cognitive elements such as concepts . Like a color , a concept can affect the way in which things appear . A concept , such as " humanity , " has a horizon of being that precedes and overlaps with its cognitive dimension . In this manner , both concepts and colors exceed what they signify and represent ; thus , focusing on racism and sexism as they are represented and signified fails to comprehend the ontological foundations that dictate how things and people appear in a racist and sexist horizon . This and other horizons cancel out any stray data that do not conform to their logic . Such tension between creative thinking and adherence to sedimented structures is embedded in Merleau-Pontys work , and Fielding suggests that he did not realize the implications of his perceptual theory for an understanding of creativity . Fielding recognizes and embraces the need for a thought that opens up the potential of the body for dismantling sedimented structures in order to create new ways of relating and signifying and she continues to interrogate Merleau-Pontys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . <p> In the final chapter addressed specifically to intersubjectivity , a critical view of the concept of flesh is proposed by Beata Stawarska . In " The Concept of Flesh , " she argues for the importance of maintaining a self/other distinction in relation to Merleau-Pontys conception of flesh . The concept of flesh has been criticized by feminists for articulating human experience in terms of universal categories and so failing to acknowledge the gender-specific experience of the body . Stawarska is concerned also with an analogous effect of universalizing , that is , the massive reduction of the intersubjective experience of the body to the body proper as manifested in the encounter with other embodied persons . She notes how Merleau-Ponty describes the intrasubjective bodily experience of touching ones own hand in which touching and being touched are reversible . He claims that the same principle operates between bodies , since active touching can always be reversed into passive being touched , or the seer can become the seen . The problem , according to Stawarska , is that in making the move from intracorporeality to intercorporeality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is erased and the sensible difference between what is mine and what is other disappears . As a result , the concrete specificity of any corporeal dynamic gets submerged in a collapse into the universal model of reversible self-touching . This is a result , she argues , of the masculine frame of mind that continually misrepresents the structures of intersubjectivity as well as gender in its tendency to reduce the other to the same . Thus the male regards his body as a direct and normal connection to the world and sees himself as the essential and sovereign subject for whom the other recedes to the status of an inessential and dependent object . The latter tendency makes it impossible to account for an authentic relation with the other . <p> Stawarska acknowledges that Merleau-Ponty conceived of flesh as a prototype of being , thus as apersonal and anonymous , the generality of incarnate being , not of the personal experience of the body . The personal perspective was the focus of Merleau-Pontys earlier work and the question raised here is whether he successfully abandoned the perspective of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . The intercorporeal encounter with an other is understood through analogy with ones intracorporeal reversibility , insofar as in a handshake , for example , the others body is annexed by ones own . However , as Merleau-Ponty makes clear , only touching ones own body yields the double sensation of toucher-touching ; that is , I can not be an other , since I have my own place . No actual reversal is possible except from the point of view of a detached spectator who could incorporate both the hand touching and the hand being touched in a single act . Stawarska concludes that if only an impersonal spectator could uphold the thesis of intracorporeal reversibility , its characterization in terms of world flesh must be universalization of the experience of a unique " body proper , " which serves as a norm for Merleau-Pontys ontology . But this universalisalizing tendency has a larger scope than has previously been identified in the feminist interpretations of Merleau-Ponty , in that it leads both to the bracketing of gender and the self/other specificity . Stawarska argues that this failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait of the masculinist frame of mind and that it is most prominent in the oppression of women by men , insofar as men have consistently reduced women to the category of secondary and subordinate beings , devoid of free subjectivity . <p> Judith Butlers subtle exploration of ethics and sexual difference offers an introduction to the intertwining of recent feminist approaches with that of Merleau-Ponty . In " Sexual Difference as a Question of Ethics : Alterities of the Flesh in Irigaray and Merleau-Ponty , " Butler begins by arguing for Luce Irigarays subordination to the prephilosophical texts she reads , insofar as Irigary attributes to them a power that she also seeks to undo . In the case of Merleau-Ponty , in particular , Irigaray engages in an " intertwining , " which enacts the theory of flesh that it also interrogates , thereby installing itself willingly within that text . The ethical question , raised by Butler , is whether Irigarays method works to confirm and enhance the power of the text it seeks to counter . Butler proposes that Irigaray enacts an intertwining that suggests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the possibility of the masculine . This exposes the vulnerability of Merleau-Pontys concepts in particular , and the philosophical tradition in general , to what they exclude , an exclusion that in its turn is radically dependent upon what it refuses . As Butler reads him , Merleau-Ponty is concerned with how the dominant relation between understanding and vision has elided the role of tactility . So he suggests that there is a primary intertwining of language , vision , and touch that might best be understood on the level of aesthetic experience and ontology rather than through epistemology , whose subject-object distinction arises out of and so is secondary to that intertwining . For Irigaray , however , Merleau-Pontys intertwining already presupposes a set of established relations that forecloses the open future , the never yet known , which is open to the paradigmatic ethical question " Who are you ? " She would reformulate the intertwining as constitutive in the sense that through it feminine and masculine each admits its own internal impossibility through its relation to the Other , a dynamic differentiation in proximity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intertwining " between Irigaray and Merleau-Ponty ; each is engaged in a primary complicity with the Other without which no subject or author can emerge . The ethical question now becomes one of how to treat the Other well when that other is never fully Other , when the difference between self and Other is originally equivocal . <p> For Irigaray , Merleau-Pontys intertwining is solipsistic , while for Butler , Merleau-Pontys embodied " I " implicates this " I " in the world outside itself in which it is no longer the center or ground . This , in turn , makes possible Irigarays identification of the maternal body as prior to this " I " and its embodied objects . But this , Butler argues , is to reduce a complex set of constituting interrelations to " oneself , " that is , to the maternal body . Furthermore , it appears that what makes the refusal of alterity a masculinist enterprise , for Irigaray , is her use of the psychoanalytic model in which the mother is nothing but the site of a narcissistic reflection for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiated the maternal , then reappropriated it in the form of intertwining or flesh occasioned by the masculine subject . Butlers response to this is to inquire if it is not the case that the maternal body is also situated in relations of alterity without which it could not exist . If so , does not Merleau-Pontys insistence upon a prior world , which he calls flesh , offer a way out of the controlling figure of the maternal and out of the binary trap of both mothers and men ? Similarly with language , Irigaray claims that insofar as language emerges directly from bodily life , it is subject to the same solipsism as is vision and touch . Again , Butler asks if Irigaray is not assuming that the same structure of narcissism is operating here when the fact that she is implicated in Merleau-Pontys text , that it is the site of her expropriation , indicates something quite different . If Merleau-Ponty is implicated in the world of flesh , to disavow it would be to disavow himself as well , likewise with the experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being implicated in the Other is thus to be intertwined from the start but not for that reason to be reducible toor exchangeable withone another . " However , Butler immediately adds that none of this would have come to light without Irigarays intervention . Only by working through Irigarays reworking of Merleau-Pontys text can Butler read his text in this manner . And likewise , only by appropriating Merleau-Pontys text does Irigaray go on to derive a feminist philosophy both continuous with and other than the tradition she inherits . <p> In her chapter , " Culpability and the Double Cross : Irigaray with Merleau-Ponty , " Vicky Kirby explains that the attraction of feminist philosophy for her has always been the promise that ideas and values associated with women , which had formerly been conceived almost entirely in negative terms , might be able to be reconceived in a positive manner . She finds that Luce Irigaray , in particular , is able to begin her analyses with philosophys own positions and self-definitions in order to disclose the value of what is repressed or disavowed in the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique of the Western philosophical concept of the subject , especially insofar as this concept is caught up with particular ideas about the feminine and the maternal . Kirby argues that , for Irigaray , although any examination of the maternal will inevitably take us to our history and origins , we must guard against nostalgia , which works to " block the threshold of the ethical world , " by hiding " mans " anxieties about the carnality of his own history , allowing him to commodify and control his origins by replacing his fleshly origins by building a world that is largely uninhabitable . Chiefly , it is the technological world guided by instrumental knowledge that dismembers the world and cuts it up into usable and manageable parts . Kirby suggests that for Irigaray , rather than managing the world , we might consider staying attuned to it and to our own bodies through perception , which neither closes women off nor manages them . Kirby points out that this solution is deliberately elusive with respect to defining women , for Irigaray is not interested in establishing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question the constraints already in place . <p> Kirby finds in Merleau-Ponty a formidable ally for Irigaray , particularly because he confounds traditional dichotomous divisions with the notion of the flesh as the worlds becoming itself and , in its " reversibility , " embracing itself . So when Irigaray criticizes Merleau-Ponty for displacing the feminine by reconceiving of the maternal in terms of flesh , Kirby is prepared to defend the notion of the maternal as the world ( re ) conceiving itself , invaginating itself and so perceiving itself by opening itself up to the experience of its own difference , its noncoincidence in a manner that is unashamedly lacking in reserve . Thus the generative nature of the sensible undoes the so-called spatial and temporal exclusivity of maternity insofar as perception allows the world to seize its own alienness and in the wonder of this encounter to reconceive itself . This is not only possible but necessary , because nothing is preexistent in nature and everything is in the process of becoming itself . This is not , Kirby cautions , a return to a prediscursive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and center itself in its dispersion . It is maternity in the sense of the issuing forth of an identity across space and time in a world in which the senses become the " measurants for Being . " Kirby argues that Merleau-Ponty grounds language in difference and that Merleau-Pontys conception of " visibility " can be read as Jacques Derridas " textuality " such that when flesh diverges from itself , it fractures the separate sensory modalities in each body as well as between bodies so that , as Merleau-Ponty argues , there is a kind of presence of other people within each person . For Kirby , Irigaray erases this extraordinary reading of carnality when she reads it as a symptom of masculinist theft , and Kirby accuses Irigaray of resorting to a notion of duration as linear time by making tactility the perceptual ground of nurturing and support and so of visibility . Likewise , Irigaray places maternity at the origin of giving , so it is not itself subject to birth . The continual insistence on purity of origins that Kirby finds everywhere in Irigarays work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom violation is impossible because everything is always already given and , in this givenness , intertwined with everything elsevisible and tactile , self and other , self and world , body and language . Given this " generosity , " as Kirby calls it , the male subject becomes as unstable as the female , and reversibility rather than violation becomes the foundation of a radical new ethics because the condition of reversibility constrains us to be responsible insofar as all human beings issue from the flesh of sexual difference , the flesh of the world . <p> Gail Weiss wishes to explore the intersubjective value of Merleau-Pontys concept of flesh by extending it to the materiality of the urban in her chapter , " Urban Flesh . " If we have succeeded in overcoming or at least addressing the mind/body dualism of Cartesianism , then it may be time , she argues , to turn to the nature/city divide and to give it adequate theoretical attention . It is , Weiss maintains , a distinction no less gendered , racist , and classist than that of mind/body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center towers in New York City . Witnessed by thousands around the world , the images of human pain and suffering as well as those of the collapsing buildings ignited a worldwide visceral sense of vulnerability . This disruption of the so-called natural attitude reawakens our awareness of those countries recently as well as continually ravaged by war or natural disasters . Rather than seeking a fast return to the natural attitude , Weiss suggests that we take up Merleau-Pontys claim that for us , as incarnate beings , violence is our lot . To this Weiss adds that even the prospect of reconstruction following violent incidents may call for the violence of justice to rectify the situation , for even a nominally liberal society may , in reality , be oppressive . What is needed , Weiss suggests , is some recognition and understanding of the manner in which bodies exceed the boundaries of their own skin to participate in the " flesh of the world , " insofar as the relation between them is , as Merleau-Ponty might argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of cities and towns literally have no place to dwell leads Weiss to caution those who would put too much emphasis on the need for a home in which to cultivate ones individual identity and those who ignore the often profound alienation that cities may evoke for their inhabitants , not to mention those for whom even a beautiful home is a prison . In the end , Weiss argues for a much more nuanced picture of the flesh of dwelling , one that does not gloss its violence any more than it romanticizes its possibilities , which may include peace and joy but also discord and disorder . <p> The complex relation between intersubjectivity and ethics , perception and the other , is explored in Jorella Andrewss " Vision , Violence , and the Other : A Merleau-Pontean Ethics . " She grants that for Merleau-Ponty , perception opens up the intersubjective world to human beings , but in so doing , it also opens up an ethical world and a metaethics . Merleau-Ponty claims that perception is in some sense violent , but it is a violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vision , in particular , although strongly associated with fixing things in their place as objects , need not objectify . Instead , Andrews argues , the gaze is precisely antiocular , a refusal to see and to engage in seeing , since seeing does not fix objects in place but opens up the possibility for ongoing interaction in our perceptual relations . Therefore , Andrews argues , perception makes and unmakes worlds , selves , and others . To deny this openness and vulnerability would be to flee the intersubjective world , where all bodies are marked with the traces of mortality , for the stable but limited realm of the rational and the willful . To refuse to acknowledge the instability of perception is to refuse the experience of another kind of permanence , one found only among bodies , and to enter a solipsistic realm . Any failure to recognize others implies the failure to experience ourselves as seen by them , which is not the same as merely assigning others a place in our world through our conceptions of them . <p> Andrews hypothesizes that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of Merleau-Pontys ethics . A truly ethical situation , she argues , is a truly intersubjective one in which human beings reveal themselves by generously meeting others whose perspectives are juxtaposed to their own . Rather than suppressing others perspectives , Andrews maintains that Merleau-Ponty argues for their expression so that differences may be negotiated . This is evidenced in Merleau-Pontys account of Simone de Beauvoirs novel LinvitTe , which he finds contains numerous descriptions pointing to this kind of ethics , one that arises within a situation rather than being externally imposed . In such descriptions of situated ethical connections , freedom , according to Merleau-Ponty , is a matter of accepting all ones involvements and going beyond them to examine the means by which one becomes involved in the first place . This brings Andrews back to her original thesis regarding the instability of perception . For she concludes that the means by which one becomes involved with others in a flexible and nonobjectivizing manner is through the lived body with all its vulnerabilities and concrete modes of being , which precedes all thought about the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merleau-Pontys phenomenology of the body is put to the test by Laura Doyle in her moving chapter , " Bodies Inside/Out : Violation and Resistance from the Prison Cell to The Bluest Eye , " in which Doyle proposes to examine the paradoxical carnal logic where bodily vulnerability founds resistance and weakness forms the ground of defiance . The torture of IRA prisoners held in the Long Kesh prison involved the penetration of their bodily orifices by means of fists and metal tools . This is no mere display of mastery over the prisoners bodies , cautions Doyle ; it is a display of mastery over the space contained within the body ; what Merleau-Ponty refers to as the chiasmus , the ontological center that is the space of possibility . Insofar as there is always a hiatus between self-touching bodily parts , the part of the body touched and the part touching never coincide . This hiatus is the space of possibility as well as the space of vulnerability , spanned by the total being of the body and by that of the world . The point of torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide the person from her own possibilities by invading and occupying the space of the bodys chiasmatic relations . Moreover , the use or threat of invasive means such as rape reveals that the geopolitical landscape is an extension of the bodily interior , in the intercorporeal sense that Merleau-Ponty theorizes , and so to enter one is to signal ones intention to enter the other . Yet the very attempt at invasion opens up resistance in the form of an internal breathing space that can not be penetrated , since it is nonmaterial . <p> In spite of the initial accounts given by prisoners describing how they defended themselves mentally against their torture by dissociating mind from body , Doyle argues that more careful attention to their accounts reveals that the prisoners preserved themselves by means of their twoness , the joining of interior to exterior , lived-inside to lived-outside . For women prisoners in particular , " it is the hands " that came to the rescue , the very hands that exemplify the chiasmatic relation between touching and touched . Thus when all the prisoners handworked objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promise of things and shut down the chiasm , reducing their life . Doyle asserts that it is the very doubleness of the chiasm that allows this to happen , that turns ones own things , once taken away or stolen , against oneself . So the prisoner learns to hoard and to hide even the most trivial things , using the folds of the world to reaccess space , to revivify time . In this manner , the inside of the isolated prison cell where things from the outside world are hoarded and hidden maintains the prisoner in the chiasm where inside/outside and isolation/connection are still lived . This same interpretation of the chiasm guides Doyles reading of Toni Morrisons The Bluest Eye , whose protagonist suffers immeasurably from a life in which the very persons , objects , and events that open the world to her also make possible her abject condition.This intercorporeality epitomizes the gap between the protected reader of these accounts and the prisoners/sufferers , a reading that does not merely inform but that brings the reader to witness events both alienating and involving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the safety of the witness , yet not allowing for a closure of the chiasm , leaving open the gap , the wound . <p> The relation between morality and freedom is the subject of Johanna Oksalas chapter , " Female Freedom : Can the Lived Body Be Emancipated ? " Against those who criticize Merleau-Ponty for universalizing intracorporeality into intercorporeality , Oksala argues that Iris Youngs adaptation and Jean Grimshaws and Judith Butlers earlier criticisms of Merleau-Ponty each presuppose a foundationalist reading of Merleau-Ponty , that is , an analysis of the bodys structures as a universal and stable foundation for subjectivity . Oksala opposes this understanding of the body-subject as an existential constant whose universal structures are the foundation for all forms of subjectivity . Rather , she maintains , subjectivity is always historically constituted , even for the anonymous body , and this makes it possible to suggest new and interesting ways to think about the freedom of the female body . Oksala focuses on the operative intentionality of the body , which is directed to the world and places one in situations in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acts directed toward particular objects ; it is the intertwining of body and world and is expressed in the idea of the prepersonal or anonymous tacit cogito , a prereflective subjectivity as yet unaware of itself because it is inseparable from the world with which it is intertwined . <p> Oksala wishes to articulate a more radical reading of Merleau-Ponty , one that rejects the anonymous body as foundational by emphasizing the reciprocity of all constitutive processes . She argues that for Merleau-Ponty , as for Husserl before him , other people are the precondition for the objectivity of perceptions because in order for something to be an object for one perceiver , it must carry the possibility of being simultaneously perceived from other points of view . Therefore , intersubjectivity , not the anonymous body , is the condition of the possibility of perception and it constitutes objective reality out of the threefold structure of **36;1069;TOOLONG . Social normality is intersubjectively constituted for Merleau-Ponty , because the anonymous body is also intersubjectively generated ; it is a dynamic and developing structure and not merely a naturalized foundation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersubjectively constituted order constrained by our cultural environment . The historical constitution of the body remains essentially ambiguous and dynamic . Thus , although " female " embodiment is culturally constituted , it is never completely so , never a mere mechanical repetition , because intersubjective norms are not merely copied , they are taken up and lived , providing an ontological freedom without which political freedom is impossible . <p> In " Care for the Flesh : Gilligan , Merleau-Ponty , and Corporeal Styles , " David Brubaker directly addresses and defends the ethics of care , making use of the concept of embodiment as flesh to justify it . Carol Gilligans care ethics is well known for its empirically gendered " different voice , " which moves away from the frameworks of disinterested reason and impartial justice and toward the concreteness of noticing the personal needs of unique individuals . This leads to the question of whether the perspective of care is logically incompatible with a rational moral framework . Brubaker argues that the ethics of care demands a personal principle that nevertheless specifies a repeatable context associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceivers are aware of both perspectives but tend to prefer only one . Brubaker adds that such choices might be guided by a supporting context of visibility that allows for a feeling of attachment and the desire to care for the concrete needs of persons . Flesh , it is argued , entails many of the characteristics and relations of care insofar as it first serves as a subjective or personal principle of the self-affirmation of ones own unique existence , which is then universalized to the flesh of the hand grasping ones own and so to all . Following from this , the subjective injunction to care for the material basis of ones own unique existence may then be universalized as well , making possible the transfer of care for self to care for others , within the realm of visibility and tactility . <p> But what if gender is suppressed in considering the moral perspective of care ? In such circumstances , the evidence of a different voice , a self attached to others , and a new ethic will all also be suppressed . If gender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to biological factors , then care can not be a general principle of morality upholding personal autonomy . If every person has the capacity to alternate between justice and care , then it is possible that a gender difference might be associated at this particular moment in history with one or the other choice . Ultimately , Brubaker concludes , the moral perspective of care for the flesh is not the same as an empirical understanding of the structural relations that cause social and economic inequality in society . If a corporeal ethics can contribute to the desire to change the world , then the concreteness of subjectivity is of the greatest importance and the voices of women may indeed lead to a more interconnected existence that does not exclude sexual difference . This would be an existence in which the subjective contexts of visibility and touch bind each thing to every other and constitute zones of indeterminacy that enable body-images ; self-concepts ; and conceptions of sex , gender , race , and class to inhere within the realm of the individual persons own unique and practical existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desire to unveil a " wild " or originary experience and the sedimentation of language and culture in Merleau-Pontys phenomenology . In " Language in the Flesh : The Disturbance of Discourse in Merleau-Ponty , Levinas , and Irigaray , " she explores the split between our collective immersion in a primordial historicity that prereflectively informs our judgments and the political need for difference or alterity . What is at stake here is the concern that if Merleau-Pontys phenomenology can not sufficiently theorize alterity , it is neither politically nor ethically viable . Such , at least , she maintains , is the critique aimed at Merleau-Ponty by Emmanual Levinas and Luce Irigaray . Murphy argues that Irigaray assents to Merleau-Pontys return to prediscursive experience in order to construct language differently . However , Merleau-Pontys description of this world , where all the possibilities of language are pregiven , provokes the accusation that language must remain tied to patterns of patriarchal exclusion . Moreover , Levinas , whose idea of ethics requires the Others transcendence of history and irreducibility to a common material soil , suggests that lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is Levinas , first of all , who originally applauds Merleau-Pontys freeing of expressive language from its subordination to thought , particularly with respect to transcendental idealism . However , for Levinas , Merleau-Ponty continues to ground signification in intentionality , a consciousness of its object that recovers all the rights of subjectivism and interiority . Whereas , for Levinas , the prelinguistic orientation of language must come from outside any historical context , so that the call to ethics can disrupt the politicohistorical landscape in the face of humanity , which overflows every idea of it . Thus language , in order to be ethical rather than political , can neither represent nor assimilate but must imply a radical separation between interlocutors . Murphys reply is to inquire of Levinas how it is possible to conceive of bodies beyond history , since if conditions such as sex and race influence the bodys interactions with the world , then the consequences of the failure to take history into account may be enormous . However , if Levinas and Irigaray are right , then Merleau-Ponty reduces speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own experience and is , therefore , is not open to novelty . If so , Murphy argues , this is a critique of phenomenology itself , of the extent to which it is haunted by subjectivism . Yet Merleau-Ponty , she believes , is not the proper target of such a critique insofar as in his descriptions , the relation between self and other is always rendered in terms of alterity and dispersion . And insofar as this is the case , this brings him closer to Irigarays position that symbolic discourse does indeed suppress sexual difference and it is just this suppression that Merleau-Ponty strives to overcome . <p> The scope of these chapters confirms that numerous aspects of Merleau-Pontys philosophy are valued by feminist theory . As Shannon Sullivan has noted , these include " the primacy given to bodily existence ; the attention paid to the pre-reflective aspects of human life , including its indeterminacy and ambiguity ; the importance of situation and situatedness for understanding our engagement with/in the world ; and the crucial role that habit plays in corporeal existence , " all within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersubjective world of shared meaning . Nevertheless , if there is much here for feminist theories to build on , there may also be controversies giving rise to a call for new conceptions of human existence . Certainly , as has been stated above , Merleau-Pontys notion of the body is that as embodied , subjects inhabit an anonymous or prepersonal realm , later called flesh , which includes both the flesh of bodies and the flesh of the world . Several of the contributors to this volume argue that the concept of flesh describes the general atmosphere of intersubjective communication prior to cognition and so prior to social or gender stratification . Yet , as Sullivan has also claimed , echoing several other authors in this volume , we must take care not to overestimate the usefulness of bodily commonalities and shared structures for philosophy . The social and cultural milieu are powerful determinants , influencing the direction and meaning of human acts , diminishing and redirecting the embodied intentionality of any being who thereby expects the acts of others to echo her own . It may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merleau-Ponty as well as the working out of feminist questions regarding embodiment will be located precisely here in this nexus between generality and specificity , between the structure of anonymous , prepersonal , embodied existence and that of gendered , personal life in order to discover some structure that might account for both while privileging neither .

Six weeks later , August Gottlieb Spangenberg , who had recently been sent from Europe to be the leader of the new community , taught the worshippers how to sing the Litany .

Though the eighteenth-century Moravian community of Bethlehem continues to be admired , aspects of their religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem and the Moravians , though , we need to make sense of their unusual piety . <p> This book is a study of colonial Bethlehem , but it is also a book about the body : human bodies in Bethlehem , the social body of Bethlehem , and the symbolic body of Christ . It will examine the theology and piety of the Moravians in Bethlehem in order to make sense of their religious symbolism and see how it was intricately related to their unique social life . In doing so , this study will she 'd light on the complex relationship between religion and culture as well as give new insight into the complex world of colonial Pennsylvania . <p> Significance of Colonial Bethlehem <p> Much of the writing on American colonial history and culture , and especially on religion , tells a story of immigration from the British Isles and the influence of English-speaking Protestant churches on America . This is certainly understandable and valuable , for the dominant story is important ; but there are other stories , voices , and influences that should be considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies , especially to Pennsylvania , brought with them a different approach to Christianity and culture . Because of William Penns " Holy Experiment " and the response of German dissenter groups , the Pennsylvania colony was the most religiously diverse and tolerant in America . <p> Within the story of German immigration and religious experimentation in Pennsylvania , the Moravians play a prominent but little examined role . The Moravians represent a distinct voice in the history of the Great Awakening and religion in America , for they combined early evangelical sensitivities , communal living , and gender equity with Lutheran doctrine and liturgy . The Moravian community of Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , was one of the most significant , successful , and unusual religious communities in colonial North America . <p> During the first twenty years of its existence , Bethlehem was a complete commune where labor and other resources were shared for the common mission of bringing the gospel to American natives and European colonists . Missionaries went out from Bethlehem to live and preach among the Delaware and other native tribes , Bethlehems preachers ministered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for girls as well as boys . The communal economy facilitated this Moravian mission , but it was also an expression of Moravian religious ideals . Residents of Bethlehem attempted to live together in a foretaste of paradise while laboring for Christ . All of life was to be a form of worship , as they experienced a daily awareness of the presence of Christ and the heavenly community . Unlike many of the sectarian German groups in Pennsylvania , Bethlehem combined a Lutheran sense of liturgy and devotion with radical Pietist spirituality and communal living . <p> Bethlehem is also important because it was part of an international , interdenominational religious fellowship called the Br&amp;uumldergemeine ( Community of the Brethren ) . The residents of Bethlehem stayed in regular contact with their religious brothers and sisters in Germany , England , the Baltic , and the Caribbean through letters , reports , and personal visits . The Moravian story is transatlantic in many senses of the word , and this book will show how the ideas of a theologian in Europe profoundly shaped the lived existence of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the use of names can be quite confusing . The Br&amp;uumldergemeine is now known in the United States as the Moravian Church . The name " Moravian " implies a strong Czech ethnicity , but in the eighteenth century most members of the " Moravian Church " were German . Even those who came from Moravia ( and Bohemia ) spoke German . To complicate things further , in the eighteenth century the **29;1107;TOOLONG Lutheran , Reformed , and Moravian groups , known as Tropoi ( or Tropuses ) . The term " Moravian " was applied only to those members of the Br&amp;uumldergemeine ( from Moravia and Bohemia ) who claimed membership in the Unitas Fratrum , a pre-Reformation Protestant church . It is common today in English , however , to refer to the Br&amp;uumldergemeineas a whole as " Moravian . " In this book , " Moravian " will be used primarily for ethnic Moravians in the Br&amp;uumldergemeine and for the residents of Bethlehem . <p> One reason for the strong international and interracial character of the Moravian Church was its missionary zeal . The success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a thirty-year span missionaries went to North America , St. Thomas , Surinam , South Africa , the Gold Coast , Greenland , Algeria , Russia , Ceylon , Persia , Egypt , Labrador , and Jamaica . In addition to missions to non-Christian peoples , the Br&amp;uumldergemeine set up less formal groups of believers within the official churches in the Baltic region , Poland , England , the Netherlands , Switzerland , Germany , France , and Scandinavia . Tens of thousands were influenced through this " diaspora " ministry . <p> More important for my purposes , the Moravians also established several carefully regulated Christian communities ( called Ortsgemeinen ) in Europe and America . In these communities European nobles joined their voices with Moravian peasants , German students , English artisans , African slaves , and American natives in singing about the glories and blessings of Christ . During an era when the world was being torn apart by colonialism and absolutism , the Moravians created an international and interracial community , despite racial and class tensions within the community . Bethlehem was probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world . <p> Visitors to Bethlehem , such as Benjamin Franklin , remarked on the orderly and peaceful nature of life in the community as well as on its impressive architecture and " high " culture . Bethlehems missionaries and converts appear in James Fennimore Coopers Leatherstocking Tales , but for the most part , after the American Revolution , the Moravians receded from the larger American scene . The residents of the communities gradually adopted American values and attitudes , and by 1850 the church had given up the remnants of communal life . The Moravians who had once inspired passionate controversy in Europe and America became just another Protestant denomination . <p> Although Moravian archivists and historians published some material before 1960 on the history of the Moravians in America , it is really only in recent decades that Bethlehem has begun to receive the attention it deserves from critical scholars , particularly those working in the areas of colonial history , sociology , and American religious history . Many researchers have been attracted to Bethlehem because of its rich archival resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer first- and secondhand accounts of contact with Native Americans . <p> Missing from this research on the early Moravians has been sustained attention to theology and piety in their social context . Like visitors to colonial Bethlehem , researchers have generally been impressed with the social and economic life of the community , but the worship and spiritual life of Bethlehem during its communal period has generally offended or embarrassed Moravian and non-Moravian researchers alike . <p> Bethlehem was founded as a " congregation of the cross . " The adoration of the crucified Jesus , especially his wounds , was the focus of intense devotion for both adults and children . The adoration of the blood and wounds of Christ , devotion to the Holy Spirit as mother , and other unusual aspects of eighteenth-century Moravian devotion were an integral part of their communal life , interracial mission , economic activity , and sexual practices . It was the Moravians liturgy and devotion that united the community and inspired both its unique social structure and its mission effort . <p> Theology , Piety , and Society in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and communal life was a Lutheran nobleman named Nikolaus Ludwig , Count von Zinzendorf . In the United States , Zinzendorf is known mainly for his role in the religious development of John Wesley and in the establishment of Protestant missions . In his own day , however , Zinzendorf was one of the most famous ( and controversial ) figures in Germany . He was a noted preacher , hymn writer , patron of Christian missions , advocate of religious toleration , and social critic . His hymns , litanies , sermons , and discourses presented a vision of Christian community that attracted thousands of adherents from all social classes and many different races . The literature on Zinzendorf is enormous because his activities touched so many aspects of early modern German culture . In direct and indirect ways , his work influenced such luminaries as Goethe , Schleiermacher , Herder , and Novalis . He remains , arguably , the most discussed German religious figure of the eighteenth century , in part because of his controversial piety . <p> Zinzendorfs " theology of the heart " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous alternative to contemporary Protestantism , which had grown rigid in its quest for doctrinal precision and moral purity . Zinzendorf focused intently on the atoning death of Jesus and made the blood and wounds of Christ the primary object of devotion for his followers . This blood mysticism was joined to the idea of the souls mystical marriage to Christ . All believers , men and women , were to be brides of Christ . Furthermore , Zinzendorf and his followers also worshipped the Holy Spirit as " mother . " This language of motherhood and the souls marriage to the crucified Jesus offended many of Zinzendorfs contemporaries , including John Wesley , George Whitefield , and Gilbert Tennent . Despite the controversy generated by such polemics , Zinzendorfs heart theology attracted thousands of converts during the 1730s and 1740s , the period when this piety was being developed . <p> Had his ideas remained in the realm of private devotion or even been simply literary expressions , the counts writings would merit a prominent place in the history of poetry and mysticism . Unlike most poets and mystics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of Moravian communitiessuch as Bethlehem . In order to make sense of transatlantic Pietism , religion in early Pennsylvania , Moravian missions to native peoples , and even the early history of Methodism , it is necessary to understand Moravian communal life and the theology of Zinzendorf together . <p> Although Bethlehem and the Moravians in colonial America have attracted the interest of scholars in many disciplines , Zinzendorfs vital role in Bethlehems life has often been de-emphasized or even distorted . Zinzendorf and his theology have generally been seen as a negative influence on Bethlehem and the Moravian work in America . But Bethlehem was the embodiment of Zinzendorfs vision . <p> As a Moravian settlement , Bethlehem was a closed society for about one hundred years . No one was allowed to live there without being accepted as part of the Moravian Churchand agreeing to live according to the churchs rules . From the earliest days of Bethlehem , the leadership insisted that the community must be vigilant when admitting residents . " Our rule must remain that of keeping the door open for everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Simply being Christian was not sufficient for living in Bethlehem . Even Moravians had to be examined before being admitted into the Bethlehem community , and the final decision on who lived and worked in Bethlehem lay with the Lord through the drawing of the lot . <p> The practice of drawing the lot was intended to bring the individual and the community into line with the wishes of Christ and to avoid all self-will . When there were important decisions to make , the elders would pray for guidance and then draw a slip of paper from the lot box . The paper indicated " yes , " " no , " or " wait , " and this was accepted as the will of Christ . Thus it was Christ who had the final say on who could live and lead in Bethlehem . For this reason the Moravians often referred to their system as a " theocracy . " <p> The most unique feature of the Moravian communities was the " choir system . " This will be discussed in detail in a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Choir " referred not to a singing group but to social groups within a community . The entire Moravian community was divided into close-knit groups according to age , sex , and marital status . The precise structure of the choirs varied from settlement to settlement , but all of the Moravian communities implemented some variation of this system . As we shall see , Bethlehems choir system was the most developed in the Moravian world . Its choirs covered every stage of life , from conception to burial . <p> In order to gain a picture of the choir system , let us briefly trace the choirs that a typical Moravian female would progress through during her life . She would begin life in the Infants Choir , and at about age five or six she would be received into the Little Girls Choir . At the onset of puberty she would be transferred into the Older Girls Choir , and when she turned seventeen ( usually ) she would be received into the Single Sisters Choir , which was sometimes called the Maidens Choir . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she chose to marry , then she immediately became part of the Married Choir . If her husband died , she joined the Widows Choir . There were corresponding male choirs , and men served their apprenticeship in the Single Brothers Choir . This scheme was altered from time to time and from place to place . Sometimes the older and the younger girls , or the older girls and the single women , would be combined into one choir . <p> Sociologists and social historians have been attracted to Bethlehem because of its unique social structure and economic system , and they have uncovered much about how Bethlehem functioned . But the heart and soul of the community was its religious life . This book will attempt to adjust our understanding of Bethlehem by examining the deep connection between life in Bethlehem and the religious symbolism of Zinzendorf . This will be an exercise in both historical theology and cultural history because it will examine the nexus between theology , religious experience , and social praxis . In doing so , it will focus attention on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders ( including modern scholars ) but that were central to the residents of Bethlehem , namely , their liturgy and ritual . <p> It is in their adoration of the wounds of Jesus and their longing for mystical marriage with the Savior that the colonial Moravians appear most alien to us , and yet it was this piety that most clearly defined them and their mission . By examining this exotic and even disturbing devotion , we can come closer to unraveling the mystery of the Moravians and their mission . In many ways , this will be a study of ritual and how it shapes life . Clifford Geertzs comment that " in a ritual , the world as lived and the world as imagined , fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms , turn out to be the same world " describes life in colonial Bethlehem . <p> After placing Bethlehem in the context of the eighteenth century , especially the complex and fluid Pietist movement that affected Germany , England , and America , I explore the heart religion of Zinzendorf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit , the mystical marriage of the soul with Christ , the full humanity of Christ , and the blood-and-wounds theology form an organic theology . Then I will show how this theology was communicated to the residents of Bethlehem through sermons , hymns , litanies , and rituals . Bethlehem tried to be a town where " the life , sufferings , and death " of the Savior were a present reality that gave meaning to the most mundane aspects of life . Employment , education , family life , and even marriage and sexuality were all understood in the light of the incarnation of the Creator in the form of the Savior . The social system , rituals , and theology of Bethlehem were so intricately joined that it would be hard to conceive of them as existing separately . <p> This study concentrates on the theology that Zinzendorf communicated , not his private reflections . It examines Zinzendorfs printed works produced in the period 1738-56 , the time of the greatest expansion of the Br&amp;uumldergemeine , the establishment and development of the community of Bethlehem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . Interestingly enough , it does not matter to this study whether his sermons were preached in America or Europe . There were very few Moravians in America when Zinzendorf made his famous visit to Pennsylvania ( late 1741-early 1743 ) ; therefore his Pennsylvania sermons had little direct impact on the community of Bethlehem . It was the sermons preached in the European communities that would have been heard by the early emigrants to Bethlehem , since the majority of them had lived in one of the Moravian communities in Europe . Moreover , his printed sermons and discourses were widely distributed to all of the Moravian communities and were frequently read in Bethlehem . <p> Bethlehem is one of the most carefully documented communities in colonial North America . In fact , the sheer wealth of manuscript materials makes historical study more , rather than less , difficult , as it is impossible for any one person to read all , or even a significant portion , of the boxes of handwritten German papers . Past studies have focused on such official documents as the economic ledgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrative committees . In recent years , scholars such as Katherine Faull and Beverly Smaby have made good use of the funeral biographies ( Lebensl&amp;aumlufe ) as windows into the communitys norms and individuals experience . <p> This book examines a neglected body of material , especially the communitys litanies and hymns . Because of a bias toward the preached word and systematic theology in Protestantism , scholars of American religion tend to study formal theological discourse even when discussing popular religion ; but it was the liturgical practice that was formative for many communities in America . Zinzendorf and his followers placed heavy emphasis on hymns as theological expressions , and the hymnbooks used in Bethlehem during the communal period are valuable sources for determining the use of Zinzendorfian themes and motifs . <p> Even more important than the hymns are the churchs litanies , for they were explicitly intended to express the communal faith and theology . Special attention will be given to the Litany of the Wounds of the Husband as a powerful statement of the core of Zinzendorfs theology . Rather than simply condemning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , I attempt to understand why such devotional materials were so important in Bethlehem . Moreover , the rituals themselves , their scheduling , and descriptions of their effect on the community will be analyzed . <p> One of the most important sources for this study is the Bethlehem Diary , which records the events of communal life along with personal interpretation and description . It was kept by a variety of diarists over the years , and its character changes according to the diarist . It also includes excerpts from the diaries of the various subgroups within Bethlehem , such as the Single Sisters Choir . The subjective aspect of the Diary , which has steered sociologists and historians away from it as an unreliable source , makes it particularly useful for our purposes . Within the Diary are notices of weddings , baptisms , and funerals , including the funeral biographies that Smaby examined . Such sources help demonstrate whether Zinzendorfs theology went to the heart of the individuals in the community at moments of existential crisis . <p> The Question of the Sifting Time <p> Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscure period of Moravian history known as the Sichtungszeit , or Sifting Time , and thus it is necessary to address this issue before proceeding . The term itself comes from Luke 22:31 ( " Simon , Simon , behold , Satan demanded to have you , that he might sift you like wheat " ) , which refers to being tested . In Moravian historiography , the Sifting Time was a period of fanatical excess originating in the Herrnhaag community in Germany in the 1740s . At that time , the Br&amp;uumldergemeine faced the real possibility that it would become a fanatical sect or what some today might call a " cult . " In 1749 Zinzendorf was made aware of the situation in Herrnhaag and issued a long letter of reprimand . He also removed his son Christian Renatus from his office as head of the Single Mens choir . A special synod was called to deal with the problems in Herrnhaag and the resulting negative publicity . Hymnals , litany books , and many collections of Zinzendorfs sermons were edited and reissued . <p> These facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted an almost mythic status in Moravian history as a time of great danger that the Moravians survived and emerged from stronger . Nearly every history of the Moravians ( even those covering earlier and later periods ) has used the Sifting Time as a way to make sense of Zinzendorf and his movement , but I believe that we need to reconsider the idea of the Sifting Time itself . For two centuries it has been used , consciously and unconsciously , to marginalize central features of Zinzendorfs theology and Moravian piety in the eighteenth century rather than to make sense of them . <p> The traditional interpretation of the 1740s is that Zinzendorf let his theological imagination roam too far . Like Icarus , he flew too close to the sun , with catastrophic results . His provocative ( and to most interpreters , erroneous ) ideas led to fanaticism , but the count quickly returned to more or less traditional theology and the community repudiated his theological experiments . Through frequent repetition , this interpretation is often accepted as a fact , and the Sifting Time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also assumed that key figures in the history of Bethlehem , such as August Gottlieb Spangenberg and Peter B&amp;oumlhler , who opposed the troubling activities in Herrnhaag , must have been opposed to Zinzendorf and his evocative theological style as well . The American historian Jacob John Sessler is a notable exemplar of this tendency to separate the count from his close associates ; as Sessler puts it , " in these years under discussion , men like Spangenberg and Peter B&amp;oumlhler took exception to Zinzendorfianism . " <p> There are many flaws in this traditional view of the 1740s , but we need to address the question of why the standard interpretation has taken such firm hold on Moravian historiography . The simple answer is that the idea of the Sifting Time has served a convenient apologetical purpose . Whatever historians , sociologists , church leaders , or theologians have considered bizarre or unorthodox about the eighteenth-century Moravians has been identified as part of the Sifting Time and thus dismissed . We see this most clearly in English-language scholarship , but this apologetic approach has also affected German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " real " Zinzendorf from his writings of the 1740s , which provided so much fuel for polemical attacks . <p> The desire to distance Zinzendorf from his own writings was strengthened when Oskar Pfister , a Freudian psychologist , argued that the period described as the Sifting Time was Zinzendorfs " eruption period . " For Pfister , the works of the 1740s were indeed the " real " Zinzendorf , a really unbalanced Zinzendorf . It was natural that pro-Zinzendorf scholars would want to distance the count from writings that may support the charge of deep-seated sadomasochistic tendencies in Zinzendorf . Gerhard Reichel answered Pfisters charge that Zinzendorf was psychologically unbalanced by demonstrating the close affinity between the expressions of the 1740s and seventeenth-century Lutheran hymnody . <p> Reichels approach has much to commend it , but Reichel himself was so influenced by the traditional model of the Sifting Time that he actually argued at cross-purposes . On the one hand , he rightly showed that in the 1740s Zinzendorf was drawing upon a long tradition of German piety , but on the other hand he asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly recovered . So , for Reichel , while the piety of the 1740s was not pathological , it was mercifully transitory . Reichel asserts that the count quickly turned away from " blood-and-wounds theology " and returned to more acceptable modes of expression . <p> Likewise , although Wilhelm Bettermann argued that the expressions of the 1740s are part of Zinzendorfs wider theological understanding , he still maintained that this was a brief phase in Zinzendorfs thought rather than a significant development . This view is changing somewhat in modern Zinzendorf scholarship . While Peter Zimmerling uses the traditional language of a Sifting Time , he is careful to point out that Zinzendorf continued to use some of his most creative and controversial motifs , such as the family idea of the Trinity , long after the end of the Sifting . <p> In England and America , the Sifting Time has been used to separate the Moravian Church from Zinzendorfs theology itself . Zinzendorf is generally blamed for the Sifting Time , while the Moravian immigrants are given credit for restoring the church to its original discipline and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchs official history , ended when the Moravians reasserted themselves , abandoned Zinzendorfian excess , and restored proper biblical theology . " The Brethren soon found their way back to sober language and scriptural forms of thought . Few churches have passed through experiences so searching without suffering permanent harm . . . . The discipline so characteristic of the refugees of 1722 to 1727 was revived . The unhappy features of the time of Sifting disappeared ; the hymnals and liturgies which had been instrumental in promoting them were suppressed . " <p> The use of the term " Sifting Time " to demonstrate that the Moravian Church was not really the fanatical sect portrayed in mid-century polemics appears already in Moravian apologetical literature in the 1760s and 1770s . Everything controversial about the church supposedly ended around 1750 . Thus August Gottlieb Spangenberg dismissed completely the provocative Twelfth Appendix ( Anhang XII ) of the Herrnhut songbook as unworthy of mention since it was recalled by the church after 1749 . What Spangenberg does not say is that all of the litanies and most of the hymns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were used for decades after 1750 . <p> This misunderstanding of the Sifting Time has of course been increased by the intentional destruction of documents by church officials in the eighteenth century and later . Scholars have been too quick to assume that references to the " juicy and tasty " wounds in the surviving sources represent the Sifting Time . On the contrary , it is what was removed that represented the Sifting Time , not what was left in the records . Historians , however , have used the silence in the sources to create a Sifting Time that may or may not be accurate . It is easy to be misled by Zinzendorfs instruction that " the teaching of the little side-hole is already too old and belongs back in the sacristy until another time , so that no nonsense will be made of it " as an effective prohibition of blood-and-wounds theology . Even within his letter of reprimand , though , Zinzendorf affirmed the importance of wounds theology for the community . <p> Hermann Plitt in many ways set the tone for the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1743-50 has been the norm in Moravian scholarship . Peter Zimmerling , for instance , in his recent presentation of Zinzendorfs Trinitarian theology , follows Plitts outline of Zinzendorfs career . Recently , though , some have argued that the so-called Sifting Time really lasted from 1738 to 1753 or later , as expressions commonly associated with the Sifting Time occur both before and after 1743-50 . Gary Kinkel , for instance , chose 1738 as the beginning of the Sifting Time because by that date " certain ideas and manners of expression characteristic of the Sichtungszeit had begun to appear . " As we shall see , it is more accurate to say that the expressions of 1738 and even 1744 are not uniquely characteristic of the Sifting Time but were part of a persistent and comprehensive Zinzendorfian piety . <p> The wide disparity in dates demonstrates that the concept of a Sifting Time is problematic . If the broader date is accurate , then the Sifting Time spanned a quarter of Zinzendorfs life and half of his literary career . Moravians who experienced the Sifting in Herrnhaag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of Herrnhaag during 1748-49 . The idea of " a brief , terrible time " of temptation and trial loses all meaning if it extends through more than one-third of Zinzendorfs career and almost all of his published works . Paul Peucker , while serving as archivist in Herrnhut , argued convincingly that the Sifting Time originally referred only to 1748-49 in Herrnhaag . <p> One problem with the broader dating of the Sifting Time is that the 1740s was the period of Zinzendorfs greatest literary output , in terms of both sermons and liturgical materials . The majority of Zinzendorfs important works were published during the supposed Sifting Time . Thus there has been a tendency to dismiss works such as Vier und Dreiig homilien nber the Wunden-Litaney ( Thirty-four Homilies on the Litany of the Wounds ) as nothing more than Sifting Time nonsense rather than expressions of Zinzendorfs mature theology . We must keep in mind , though , that these were the works that Zinzendorf and the community chose to publish for the public arena . The hymns , litanies , and sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **26;1138;TOOLONG the 1780s and 1790s . If the standard interpretation of the Sifting Time is accurate , then what do we do with Zinzendorfs major works ? Are they expressions of the " real " Zinzendorf or not ? <p> The use of the Sifting Time in Anglo-American scholarship is more problematic than it is in German scholarship . The most influential figure in interpreting eighteenth-century Moravian history is J. E. Hutton , a Victorian-era Moravian historian whose 1909 History of the Moravian Church helped define Moravian historiography . For Hutton the Sifting Time was the direct result of Zinzendorfs antirational theology and his devotion to the wounds of Christ . " As long as Zinzendorf used his own mental powers , he was able to make his Blood and Wounds Theology a power for good ; but as soon as he bade good-bye to his intellect he made his doctrine a laughing-stock and a scandal . Instead of concentrating his attention on the moral and spiritual value of the cross , he now began to lay all the stress on the mere physical details . He composed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and sing of nothing else . " For Hutton , the Litany of the Wounds was itself evidence that Zinzendorf and his weaker followers quite literally lost their minds . It might be more accurate to say that it is evidence that Zinzendorf was not the Victorian moralist that Hutton thought all good Christians should be . <p> This view of the Sifting as a time of general and unrestrained childishness has asserted great influence and continues to serve political and ecclesiastical purposes . However , as we shall see in more detail , the evidence contradicts this widely accepted theory . In their efforts to invent a Moravian Church and a Bethlehem unaffected by Zinzendorfs more creative ideas , or to invent a Zinzendorf similarly unaffected by his own ideas , scholars have in fact distorted rather than illuminated our understanding of the entire Zinzendorfian era and the evolution of Moravian theology and piety . This situation is changing in contemporary scholarship on the Moravians . Thanks to the work of Paul Peucker , Peter Vogt , Katherine Faull , Hans-Walter Erbe , and Aaron Fogleman , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One advantage of the traditional interpretation of the Sifting Time is that it provides a neat explanation for the dissolution of Herrnhaag , the center of the Sifting . Herrnhaag was the most beautiful and the most important Moravian community in the 1740s . Most of the men and women who led the Br&amp;uumldergemeine for nearly half a century spent some time living at Herrnhaag . It was the gem of the Moravian world , but in 1749 the secular authority , Count Casimir of Ysenburg-Bndingen , forced the residents to leave . There were indeed problems in Herrnhaag among the Single Brothers , as the Moravian leadership noted , but it is not clear that this was the direct cause of the dissolution of Herrnhaag . <p> The reason for the expulsion , in brief , was that the old count ( famous for his policy of religious toleration ) died in 1749 . He had been a supporter of Zinzendorf , but his son and successor , Casimir , was not . Casimir himself was closely connected to the Danish court . The fiasco of the awarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embittered many in the Danish court against Zinzendorf . Moreover , the hostility of Halle toward Zinzendorf was well established by 1741 . In other words , the seeds of the destruction of Herrnhaag were sown in the early 1730s , long before the Sifting Time . <p> When Casimir came into his own as feudal lord , he ordered the residents on his estate to swear allegiance to him alone . In addition , the residents of Herrnhaag had to verbally repudiate Count Zinzendorf or face banishment . Casimir was shocked when the Herrnhaagers elected to vacate their buildings rather than show disloyalty to Zinzendorf . More than a thousand residents of Herrnhaag were forced to leave . Some two hundred migrated to Bethlehem at a crippling financial cost . The Herrnhaag disaster was a major reason for the financial crisis of the 1750s in Bethlehem and the wider Br&amp;uumldergemeine . While stories about the activities of the Single Brothers in Herrnhaag may have contributed to the expulsion decree , dynastic , political , and aristocratic rivalry played a great role . <p> In Moravian historiography , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beware of embracing Zinzendorfs radical ideas or you will end up like Herrnhaag . In short , Herrnhaag has been treated like a Moravian Sodom that was destroyed because of its heresy , but the Sifting in Herrnhaag had little to do with the main themes of Zinzendorfs theology and the life of the Moravians in Bethlehem : the blood and wounds of Christ . This book will demonstrate the persistence of evocative blood-and-wounds theology long after the Sifting Time and the dissolution of Herrnhaag . <p> It is recorded in the Bethlehem Diary , for instance , that at a communion service the " corpse bees enjoyed the sacrament . " At another service , " After those who are sick had also received their portion of the body , Br . Nathanael Seidel sang the corpse-bees completely to sleep with the late Christels corpse liturgies for a blessed rest in His grave ! " Based on the standard periodization of Moravian history , we would date these entries to the Sifting Time , but in fact they come from the late 1750s , when the Sifting Time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How do we explain the persistence of such language years after the so-called Sifting Time ? The simplest explanation is that these references to the " corpse bees " were connected to a deeply felt Zinzendorfian piety that was shared by Spangenberg and the Bethlehem community , rather than an aberrant form of Moravian piety . It is certainly true that Spangenberg did not use such expressions in his later apologetical works , but they appear when he was the " Vicar General of the Ordinary in America " in the decade following the Sifting Time . The examples can be multiplied . <p> Moreover , there is little evidence that there was a general time of Sifting that affected the entire church . To the contrary , this was the period when the Moravians were examined by governmental officials in Saxony , Prussia , and England and consistently found praiseworthy , despite the diligent work of their enemies . In 1749 , when the Sifting Time was supposedly raging out of Zinzendorfs control , the English Parliament carefully studied the history and theology of the Moravians and concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant Church . " It is hard to reconcile these high-water marks of legitimation with a period of raging fanaticism . <p> The actual history of the Litany of the Wounds also challenges the traditional interpretation that this litany was part of the Sifting . Historians have allowed the theory to determine the evidence . Once it has been accepted that the Litany of the Wounds is a piece of Sifting Time nonsense , one tends not to notice its continued use long after 1750 . The confusion over the Litany of the Wounds is understandable , as the name of the litany was changed to something that appears on the surface to be more traditional . In 1752 the old Litany of the Wounds was divided into The Litany of the Life , Sufferings , and Death of the Jesus and Hymns of the Wounds . In this form , most of the old Litany of the Wounds , including the infamous petitions to the wounds of Christ ( " so moist , so gory " ) remained in publication in German and English Moravian hymnals to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sifting Time . <p> Colin Podmore , in his study of the Moravians in England , recognized that it was precisely those aspects of Moravian devotion that historians have often dismissed as pathological or nonsensical that attracted many English evangelicals , such as John Cennick and Jacob Rogers , to the Moravian fold . The church never recovered the dynamism it had possessed during the 1740s , when Zinzendorf was most creative and the church most controversial . Part of the reason for the stagnation after 1750 was the debt crisis and Halles persistent opposition to the Moravians , but another factor is that the Moravians became more conventional after mid-century . This was true of the church in general , but particularly of Bethlehem . As long as the Moravians in Bethlehem embraced the theology and liturgy of Zinzendorf , their community thrived . <p> Bethlehem needed the paradoxical imagery of the wounded Savior-God in order to deal with the contradictions of living in heaven on earth . This is where the real strength of Zinzendorfs theology manifested itself . Blood-and-wounds theology , with all of its graphic descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wounds , served to help the residents of Bethlehem sublimate community-destroying impulses . Christ became their scapegoat , not just theologically but sociologically and psychologically as well . Through evocative and provocative imagery , Zinzendorf painted the Savior before their eyes as they worshipped , worked , and slept . He offered the Moravians a God who shared their struggles and bore on his own body the strains and contradictions of their communal life , so that they could live in harmony .

We have seen what a ferment has been excited among our living artists by the exhibition of the works of the Old Masters at the British Gallery . What would the actors say to it , if , by any spell or power of necromancy , all the celebrated actors , for the last hundred years could be made to appear again on the boards of Covent Garden and Drury Lane , for the last time , in all their most brilliant parts ? <p> William Hazlitt , " On Actors and Acting " <p> Prologue <p> In a shadowy interior cluttered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman declaiming before them ( fig. 1 ) . The raised sitters platform is visible in the right foreground of the scene , but the sitters chair has been removed . Although the setting is instantly recognizable as an artists studio , this is no ordinary depiction of the painter at work . It takes a moment to discern the artist , Joshua Reynolds , who is seated at far right , holding his spectacles . Like the other spectators , he is riveted by the performance of the legendary actress Sarah Siddons , whose roughed-in portrait is displayed on the easel behind them . Histrionically posed , head thrown back and arms extended , Siddons rehearses Lady Macbeth , her most celebrated tragic role . Rather than an active creator in the throes of inspiration , Reynolds is portrayed as an enthralled spectator , disenfranchised and eclipsed by his model , whose performance in the studio competes with and upstages her sketchy , unfinished portrait . This retrospective depiction of Siddons as a living work of art foregrounds the overlapping preoccupations and symbiotic rivalry of artist and model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new twist . That performative aspect is powerfully reiterated in the numerous preparatory sketches for the painting , in which the painter experimented with alternative poses , representing the actress from different vantage points , as if sculpting her in the round . In the preparatory sketches , as in the finished work , Siddons erupts dramatically and dominates the pictorial space . Performance and spectatorship are similarly thematized in painters sketches for an unrealized composition depicting the violin virtuoso Niccol= Paganini playing before an audience . <p> Despite the meticulous detail and heightened sense of verisimilitude , this restaging of the encounter between Reynolds and Siddons in the artists studio is a piece of fictiona modern pastiche that reimagines historical personalities and events in an elaborately woven tissue of appropriation and invention . Painted in the early twentieth century by William Quiller Orchardson ( 18321910 ) , Mrs. Siddons in the Studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds testifies to the lasting fame of Reynolds and Siddons and the mythic aura surrounding Reynoldss iconic 1784 canvas SarahSiddons as the Tragic Muse ( fig. 2 ) . In the latter , Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manner portraiture with the direct emotional appeal of the stage and the ethos of tragedy . <p> In his retrospective painted tribute , Orchardson has reframed the artistic encounter between Reynolds and Siddons as a lively tableau vivant in which studio and stage , art and life , are seamlessly amalgamated , and Siddonss " live " performance upstages her life-size , unfinished portrait and the artist who created it . This visual instance of " ghosting " is emblematic of the symbiotic posthumous fame that has continued to link Siddons and Reynolds , as discussed in chapter 5 . In 1920 , Orchardsons picture was reproduced in The Sphere with the title A Famous Actress in a Famous Artists StudioMrs . Siddons in Sir Joshua Reynoldss Studio ; it follows photographic portraits of four living English painters posing in their fashionable , antique-filled studios . The caption , which identifies Siddons as a renowned artist who brought London to her feet and as a constant visitor to Reynoldss studio , adds the bogus claim that Reynolds would sit amid his distinguished guests , working , while Siddons declaimed lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recontextualizing the fictive scenario . <p> Orchardson was widely admired for his historical and literary subjects and meticulously researched costume pieces . Primarily a studio painter , he was best known for Regency and Napoleonic subjects , as in Napoleon on Board H.M.S. Bellerophon ( 1880 ) , and contemporary psychological dramas . Mrs. Siddons in the Studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds , exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1903 , was Orchardsons last major historical picture . A reviewer for The Studio praised the works masterful execution , subtle tonalities , and dramatic expression . Resurrecting Reynoldss Leicester Fields studio as an artistic and theatrical arena that hosted a meeting of the minds , it evokes the famous dinners held there and the distinguished guests who attended them . Besides Siddons and Reynolds , the figures gathered in the studio ( from left to right ) are the statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke ; a mysterious flGneur ( an anonymous fashionable nobody ) ; the comic actor Charles Macklin ; Siddonss brother and costar John Philip Kemble ; the comic actress Dora Jordan ; the playwright and theater manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northcote . Although Siddons is the primary focus , Orchardson also rendered homage to the Comic Muse , incarnated here by Mrs. Jordan and Macklin , who counterbalance Siddons and Kemble . Burke , a close friend of Reynolds whose political writings are infused with theatricality , bookends the distinguished company . <p> Although Orchardson painted the principal figures from models in the studio , he also incorporated elements from actual eighteenth-century portraits in composing his metafictional tableau . A young Jewish girl , believed to closely resemble the actress , served as the model for Siddons , and Sir David Murray , Orchardsons neighbor , sat for the figure of Reynolds . Like the composition itself , the individual figures are complex historical and artistic pastiches derived from disparate sources , echoing Reynoldss own eclectic historicizing approach . The figure identified as Mrs. Jordan invokes Gainsboroughs Portrait of Sarah Siddons ( fig. 3 ) , a painting that Orchardson particularly admired . In a memorial tribute in The Studio ( 1910 ) , Orchardson would be eulogized for his grace , distinction , and air of refinement , reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move to the music of a minuet . <p> What intrigues me most about this precocious postmodern pastiche are its intertextuality and multiple levels of referentiality , in particular Orchardsons complex restaging of the artistic collaboration between Reynolds and Siddons , in which the simulacrum of Reynoldss portrait is conflated with and overshadowed by the " living " actress depicted in the act of performing . The fictive nature of Orchardsons costume drama is further underscored by the figure of the modern flGneur , who , like Barthess punctum , interjects a disjunctive note that punctures the historical illusion . For Orchardson , painting was a reflexive arena for transforming history and reenvisioning the past . In his fictional re-creation of Reynoldss studio , subject trumps referent , and Siddonss dramatic performance eclipses Reynoldss unfinished canvas . By dramatically juxtaposing Siddons and Reynolds within the imaginary space of the artists studio , Orchardson implicitly invokes the rich tradition of studio pictures and allegories about the art of painting , exemplified by Velzquezs Las Meninas ( 1656 ) , in which the artists virtuosity and the illusionism of paint are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas suggests a different sort of artistic paragone , or emulative model , for thinking about artmore specifically , portrait painting and theatrical performancethat is particularly apposite to late eighteenth-century London . Such a model revolves around the affinities and symbiotic rivalry between painting and the stage , both of which were fundamentally concerned with performance and visual display and engaging the spectator through the powers of art and illusion . <p> The role of portraiture and the theater in the creation of celebrity has been recently addressed by scholars , including Felicity Nussbaum , Gill Perry , Martin Postle , Joseph Roach , and Shearer West , and in exhibitions such as The First Actresses : Nell Gwyn to Sarah Siddons ( 2011 ) , Joshua Reynolds : The Creation of Celebrity ( 2005 ) , and A Passion for Performance : Sarah Siddons and Her Portraitists ( 1999 ) . The notion of theatricality , which figured so prominently in eighteenth-century debates about the relationship between painting and the stage , is encapsulated in Orchardsons historicizing intertextual tableau . As the preliminary studies show , the dynamic gesturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twirling dancer seen from the back in his unfinished painting The Last Waltz ( ca. 1905 ) . Like the flickering images of a magic lantern or Madame Tussauds uncanny waxworks , Orchardson brings the dead back to life by ( re ) presenting the historical past as a riveting dramatic spectacle in which fact and fiction , past and present , coalesce . <p> Origins of Modern Celebrity <p> While conducting research for The Modern Portrait in Nineteenth-Century France , I became fascinated by the celebrity cult surrounding Sarah Bernhardt ( 18441923 ) , especially her exploitation of photography and the media to disseminate her star image beyond the confines of the stage . In discussions of Bernhardt , Sarah Siddonss name kept cropping up as an antecedent , propelling the concept of celebrity back to eighteenth-century London , where theatrical stars , like Garrick and Siddons , and their artistic counterparts , like Reynolds , emerged as public personalities . What , I wondered , was celebrity like in the eighteenth century ? What factors propelled the publics growing preoccupation with the image and individual identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was celebrity fashioned , represented , and manipulated through images and print media , and how was it disseminated to a mass public in a prephotographic age ? Finally , how were the relations among artists , performers , and the public and notions of spectatorship and cultural consumption negotiated and transformed in an increasingly commercialized society steeped in exhibition culture and theatrical display , where individualism and originality became key assets in the competitive cultural marketplace ? <p> One of the fundamental dilemmas I faced was determining how to approach celebrity critically as a subject of historical inquiry . Is celebrity primarily grounded in discrete individual case studies , aligning it with biography and thus narrowing its purview ? Or should we envision celebrity as a dynamic sociocultural phenomenon produced by a multidirectional matrix of factors , evolving over time but also possessing a period-specific , culturally identifiable footprint ? This study adapts the latter approach . Focusing on the parallels between painting and the stage and the apparatus of artistic celebrityhow it was fabricated and disseminated in life and after lifeit views celebrity as a broad-based , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies from differing perspectives across a spectrum of media.Since I began my research , interest in celebrity culture and its history has expanded exponentially across disciplinary boundariesfrom sociology to media studies and film to art history and performance studiesgenerating intense debates about the broader social and cultural significance , ideological and political ramifications , and far-reaching consequences of the celebritization of society . The work of feminist scholars such as Laura Engel , Felicity Nussbaum , Gill Perry , and Stella Tillyard has shed new light on the complex dynamics linking performance and gender identity in the case of the actress , and on the growing visibility and " feminine face " of celebrity . " Although Siddons figures prominently ( notably in chapter 3 ) , this book examines celebrity through a broader cultural lens rather than focusing exclusively on the actress or any single individual , with the aim of presenting a more panoramic multimedia picture of celebrity . <p> Although the history of fame and its double-edged pursuit stretches back to antiquity , Art and Celebrity in the Age of Reynolds and Siddons is concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupation with individual identity and the contradictory nature of modern fame that engendered what Leo Braudy aptly termed a " frenzy of renown . " In light of the Roman obsession with rhetoric , civic virtue , and theatrical display , it is not surprising that the roots of the terms denoting famefama and celebritasare Latin , although " renown " is derived from the Old French word renom ( literally , to rename ) . Under the Empire , the public , essentially political and military concept of fame was complicated and called into question by a more introverted , cultural model based on artistic or poetic achievement . For poets such as Virgil and Horace , literary fame was defined by a writers ability to transcend the present . Virgil also addressed the ambivalence surrounding fame , stemming from its association with rumorwith false as well as true stories . In Pliny the Youngers letters , the quest for fame emerges as a competition and mode of literary discourse . Although avidly pursued , fame was frequently attacked and censured on moral and religious grounds . The Stoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblem of human vanity . <p> The centralization of power and the rise of court society in the early modern period , with its emphasis on representational identity , exhibition , and performance , ushered in a new era in the " celebritization of society . " During the Renaissance , fame increasingly became associated with public visibility , and individual writers and artists , notably Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo , achieved unprecedented international renown . The far-reaching social and ideological shifts that transformed seventeenth-century Europethe erosion of monarchical power ; trade and economic expansion ; the growth of individualism and evolving notions of selfhood ; and new attitudes toward knowledgelaid the foundations for the emergence of a new market-oriented , media-driven concept of fame that morphed into modern celebrity culture . With the Restoration , the reopening of the theaters , the advent of female actresses , and the expansion of print media radically redefined the relationship between audience and performer , fostering an intensified personal identification , a sort of public intimacy that provided the framework for modern celebrity culture . <p> More than anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print mediathe rapid diffusion of news , books , pamphlets , portraits , and caricaturesthat gave rise to modern " international fame culture " in eighteenth-century England , in which the public played a central role in recognizing and validating fame . In the literary marketplace , the new periodical press redefined patronage and authorship , radically transforming the nature of literary fame . Ambitious careerists such as Laurence Sterne self-consciously manipulated the " fame machine " by courting influential cultural patrons , like David Garrick . Through print culture and the expanding reach of images , especially , the separation between celebrities and spectators was mediated and attenuated , creating an illusion of intimacy . In a society increasingly obsessed with public personalities and their private lives , biography , autobiography , and portraiture flourished , catering to the publics seemingly endless appetite for novelty , fashion , and scandal . The parallels between portrait painting and biography were widely acknowledged by artists and writers from Jonathan Richardson to William Hazlitt . At the same time , the unprecedented proliferation and commercialization of fame threatened to devalue and tarnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities with the debased trivia of personality . That tension is reflected in the fame discourses overriding obsession with differentiating between immortal , historically validated fame and the evanescent bubble of media-based celebrity driven by sensation and noveltybetween authentic and false cultural value . Chris Rojek breaks down celebrity into distinct typesascribed , achieved , and attributedattesting to the continuing preoccupation with categorizing celebrity . <p> In making the case that modern celebrity culture emerged in the eighteenth century , I am intentionally using the term " celebrity " rather than " fame . " Though often used interchangeably , these terms are not entirely synonymous and differ in nuance . In modern usage , " celebrity " has the further advantage of being both an attribute and a concrete noun , underscoring the complex symbiosis of exchange value and psychological identification that still characterizes celebrity culture . Although not yet a proper noun , the concept of individual celebrity already existedtheatrical stars , beginning with Garrick , were advertised prominently on playbills and marketed as commodities . Long before the advent of film or television , fame was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas celebrity tended to be considered more ephemeral and image driven , embodying what Daniel Boorstin has termed " wellknownness " " the definable and publicizable personality " or vulgar notoriety . <p> The fact that the term " celebrity " entered the lexicon in the mid-eighteenth century is another compelling reason for using it to designate a new , rapidly evolving phenomenon . The Oxford English Dictionarys earliest citation for " celebrity " in the modern sense of being much extolled or talked about comes from The Rambler ( 15 October 1751 ) , in which SamuelJohnson ruefully observed , " I did not find myself yet enriched in proportion to my celebrity . " Just how new this sense of the term was at midcentury is confirmed by the entry in Johnsons Dictionary of the English Language ( 1755 ) , which begins with the older ritual meaning ( celebration ) , followed by the emerging sense ( modern fame ) , without providing a citation . It comes as no surprise that Johnson , as a writer , was preoccupied with the question of literary reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Rambler ( 7 September 1751 ) , " Fame can not spread wide or endure long that is not rooted in nature and manured by art . " Not coincidentally , for the eighteenth-century public , the concept of celebrity was closely linked to the proliferation of visual and print media . Referring to the prominent print publisher John Boydell , Benjamin West succinctly observed that he " spread by engravings the celebrity of British art through the civilised world . " One of the key traits associated with modern celebrity is glamourrevived by Sir Walter Scott , who aligned it with visual magic or mystery , including witchcraft , and the deceptio visus of gypsies . Glamour metamorphosed into charisma , devolving from the original Greek sense of God-given grace to political leadership or authority that inspired cult-like devotion , as evidenced in the writings of Max Weber . It also came to encapsulate the dangerously irresistible physical allure and mystique of celebrities such as Lord Byron and Napoleon , and eventually Hollywood film stars . <p> No late eighteenth-century writer more thoroughly scrutinized the complexities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic personality than William Hazlitt ( 17781830 ) , the first modern historiographer of fame . In his essays , Hazlitt probed such topics as the malaise of self-importance , sitting for ones portrait , and the ephemeral fame of the actor , who leaves no permanent record except within the collective memory . In the passage cited at the beginning of this introduction , Hazlitt imagines the theatrical equivalent to an authors collected works or an artists retrospective : a parade of the greatest actors past and present , appearing in their most brilliant roles . In the same essay , he paradoxically observed that players had little cause for complaint since " one thunder of applause from pit , boxes , and gallery , is equal to a whole immortality of posthumous fame , " challenging the widely held assumption that because of its immediate sensory appeal , the theater could never attain the summit of artistic greatness . Hazlitt confidently predicted that Garricks name and reputation would survive alongside the works of Reynolds and Johnson . In his lecture " On the Living Poets , " Hazlitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posthumousgenerally arriving only after genius has been extinguishedfrom the transitory shouts of the multitude and the buzz of fashion , the hallmarks of modern celebrity . In The Spirit of the Age ( 1825 ) , Hazlitt focused on the contrasting personalities of two contemporary literary giants , Byron and Scott . He devoted his final years to preparing a biography vindicating Napoleon , whom he considered the greatest figure of the modern era . <p> Although photography has been widely credited with democratizing portraiture and precipitating the nineteenth-century celebrity cult , visual images , notably portraits , were already a powerful means of fixing the public gaze in the eighteenth century ; these ranged from life-size painted effigies to Grangers illustrious heads , to Wedgwoods mass-produced jasperware medallions . The Swiss miniature painter Jean-AndrT Rouquet , struck by the prevalence of painted and engraved portraits in England , cogently observed that the display of engraved portraits provided public recognition and a means of advertisement for portrait painters . Savvy printmakers such as John Raphael Smith ( 17511812 ) reproduced and exhibited portraits of prominent individuals , often publishing prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Smith exhibited his print after Benjamin Wests portrait of the famous explorer Joseph Banks at the Society of Artists in April 1773 , several weeks before Wests picture was shown at the Royal Academy . Moreover , as Marcia Pointon has shown , portraiturethe dominant artistic genre in eighteenth-century Englandfunctioned as a complex system of social and symbolic representation that helped foster a unifying public discourse . Although privately commissioned , portraits were often publicly exhibited and widely disseminated in the form of prints . Functioning as visual surrogates for the public personalities they portrayed , portraits were avidly consumed and collected by an expanding urban populace that was increasingly intoxicated by celebrity . <p> In surveying the shifting sociocultural topography of Georgian London and the emergence of modern celebrity , I was particularly struck by the fluid social status and parallel trajectories of artists and actors , which , in the case of superstars such as Garrick , Reynolds , and Siddons , catapulted them from provincial obscurity to the front ranks of fashionable society . Despite the push for professionalization and growing public recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , artists and actors still faced formidable obstacles , and their social status remained ambiguous . As Benjamin West sardonically observed , " Artists stood , if possible , lower in the scale of society than actors ; for Garrick had redeemed the profession of the latter from the degradation to which it had been consigned . . . . But Reynolds , although in high repute as a portrait painter , and affecting gentlemanly liberality in the style of his living , was not so eminently before the public eye as to induce any change of the same consequence toward his profession . " <p> As I delved into the intersecting worlds of artist and actor , it became evident that the studio and the stage had much in common and overlapped , catering to the same heterogeneous urban populace in search of novelty , entertainment , and the latest celebrity gossip . Although both the Royal Academy of Arts and the patent theatersCovent Garden and Drury Lanewere nominally under royal protection , they were , in fact , independent commercial enterprises that served the public at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book considers how the theater and the newly enfranchised visual artsfrom Grand Manner portraits to popular prints and caricaturesas well as the explosion of printnewspapers , pamphlets , memoirs , and biographiesfunctioned in the burgeoning public sphere as avenues of communication and cultural exchange , and it argues for their central role in the making and marketing of celebrity . The theater , which attracted a large , heterogeneous audience , was both a phenomenally popular form of entertainment and a public forum for ideological and moral debate , in which notions of British identity and nationhood were forged and vociferously contested . The eighteenth centuryan era of few great plays in which popular vehicles were endlessly restaged and recycledwas undeniably the age of the actor and , increasingly , the actress . The establishment of the Royal Academy in 1768 and the advent of regular public art exhibitions profoundly transformed the London art world . During the second half of the eighteenth century , London became the capital of the European print trade and the epicenter of the rapidly expanding international art market . Artistic consumption and the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and auction houses and the advent of public art exhibitions . The late eighteenth century was also the golden age of caricature , which assumed a dual function as a reflector and shaper of ideas and public opinion that helped redefine the visual economy of Georgian Britain . <p> The book traces the evolving cultural and ideological significance of the visual and performing arts in Georgian London and the emergence of new hybrid forms of artistic expression , from theatrical portraits to satirical prints , which , in conjunction with the press and proliferating media , launched modern celebrity culture . Well-known performers such as Garrick , Siddons , and Kemble morphed into prominent public personalities who were painted by leading artists , chronicled in the press , and viciously caricatured . Likewise , artists such as Reynolds and Thomas Lawrence figured prominently in polite society and the emerging public sphere . Visual representations of the celebrated tragedienne Mrs. Siddons , ranging from Reynoldss magisterial Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse to Gillrays biting caricatures , are emblematic of the overlapping preoccupations of portraiture and the stage and the convergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . As a theatrical icon who reigned over the commercialized world of culture , Siddons came to embody the contradictory passions of adulation and desecration and the multilayered patina of modern celebrity that continue to captivate the public in the twenty-first century . <p> More than a decade in the making , this book examines high art and popular culturefrom paintings by Reynolds , Gainsborough , Kauffman , and Lawrence to caricatures , theatrical prints , and memorabiliaand draws from a wide variety of period textsfrom memoirs to newspaper reviews and satirical pamphlets . It transports us to late eighteenth-century London and the venues where art and celebrity , culture and commerce , collided and overlappedfrom the Royal Academy exhibitions , where the pictures on display competed with the spectacle of the public viewing them , to the stages of Drury Lane and Covent Garden , where theatrical stars such as Garrick and Siddons dazzled Londons notoriously unruly audiences with their charismatic , emotionally charged performances . Interweaving art , performance , social history , and cultural politics , the book brings to life the vibrant visual and theatrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Focusing on the convergence of exhibition culture and theatrical display and the overlapping representative strategies linking painting and the stage , it provides a synthetic cross-disciplinary template for reassessing the complex interplay of the visual and performing arts and their role as crucibles of modern celebrity culture . <p> Ranging over roughly a century , from Garricks meteoric rise in the 1740s to the death of Siddons in 1831 , the book encompasses the careers of the leading portraitists of the age : Reynolds ( 17231792 ) , Gainsborough ( 17271788 ) , Romney ( 17341802 ) , and Lawrence ( 17691830 ) . Politically , this was a turbulent era marked by widespread public debate and dissent , revolutions , and the gradual transformation of the British monarchy during the reigns of George III ( 17601820 ) and George IV , regent and king ( 181130 ) . In particular , the book focuses on the 1780s , a transformative decade defined by the dramatic expansion of printmaking , caricature , and the art market , during which the English school and the Royal Academy exhibitions arguably reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exceptional brilliance consecrated by the rise of the Kemble dynasty . <p> Chapter 1 examines the nascent concept of celebrity through the overlapping careers of Reynolds and Garrick , focusing on the thematization of performance , both onstage and in the studio . It scrutinizes the shifting social status and rising public profiles of artist and actor against the backdrop of broader changes in cultural production and consumption and a cluster of converging preoccupations , including virtuoso display and new modes of spectatorship and connoisseurship , that contributed to the emergence of celebrity culture . As the century advanced , the visual and performing arts , which catered to a rapidly expanding urban public , became a contested arena for asserting individual and collective identity and defining nationalism . The chapter elucidates Garricks and Reynoldss rise to preeminence and complicated personal and professional relations , highlighting the role the visual arts played in their public representation and their preoccupation with image management and social status . Both cultivated public personas as gentleman scholars and connoisseurs , foregrounding their intellectual and literary pursuits and embracing an aristocratic lifestyle characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both were key protagonists in the creation and staging of celebrity culture at midcentury . <p> Chapter 2 examines the intersection and cross-fertilization of fashion , celebrity , exhibition culture , and the politics of display through the lens of portraiture . It considers how pictures were displayed , viewed , and judged at the Royal Academy and other public venues and , in particular , the insights that exhibition prints and contemporary reviews provide about how portraits operatedaesthetically , culturally , and ideologicallyand how the public experienced them . Because they depicted actual individuals , viewers engaged with portraits differently , adopting an interactive mode of spectatorship that oscillated between identification and recognition . Furthermore , the widespread preoccupation with individual personality and theatrical display induced spectators to apprehend portraits as staged performances . The latter part of the chapter considers the complex dynamics of celebrity , feminine fashion , public display , and social decorum evidenced in the parallel pictorial strategies deployed in representing aristocratic women and actresses . Contemporary portraits of the Duchess of Devonshire and the actresses Sarah Siddons and Elizabeth Farren provide an entry point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blurring of social and class distinctions fueled by the emergence of actresses as public personalities and arbiters of fashion . Although publicly feted and widely emulated as fashion icons , all three women were viciously attacked by caricaturists , testifying to the perils of female celebrity and the problematic status of women performing in the public sphere . <p> Chapter 3 takes a closer look at the complex symbiotic relationship between painting and the stage , which Orchardson thematizes in Mrs. Siddons in the Studio of Sir Joshua Reynolds , and shifts the focus to the spectacle of performance . Reexamining Siddonss personification as the Tragic Muse and the broader cultural and physiological connotations of pallor , I argue that Siddonss emblematic " tragic pallor , " embodied in Reynoldss painting , came to signify her authenticity as a performer and her dramatic genius . From pallors traditional association with melancholy and death to the artificial whiteness of makeup , the chapter probes the evolving signification of pallor as an emblem of tragedy and of artistic and aristocratic distinction more generally . In particular , it focuses on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal representations and contemporaries responses to Siddonss performances . The Aristotelian ethos of tragedy and the multivalent aesthetic , sociocultural , and phenomenological valences of " tragic pallor " on the eighteenth-century stage also figure in my analysis . In making the argument that tragic pallor was emblematic of the transparency and emotional depth of Siddonss acting and her public persona as the Tragic Muse , the broader social and aesthetic connotations of whiteness as an essential component of feminine beauty , notably in England , and as a marker of race and class should not be overlooked . <p> Chapter 4 reasseses the significance of caricature as a hybrid artistic discourse , highlighting its expanding role in public debates about aesthetic hierarchies and cultural politics and its dialogic nature . The chapter examines the centrality of the theater ( and theatricality ) as a political metaphor and elucidates the double-edged role that satirical prints played in attacking as well as reifying public personalities , from politicians to actors , underscoring how individuals and their images circulated in the public sphere and were appropriated and metamorphosed by caricaturists . Focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapter analyzes the complex multilayered idiom of political satire that emerged in the 1780s and the growing role that satirical prints played in articulating and shaping cultural and political debates . In prints such as Shakespeare Sacrificed ( 1789 ) and Titianus Redivivus ( 1797 ) , Gillray invented a powerful new mock-heroic visual idiom , appropriating elements of high art to attack the lofty goals and nationalistic agenda of the Royal Academy and Boydells Shakespeare Gallery . I argue that the multivalent relationship between caricature and academic art should be characterized as a sort of inverse reciprocityboth gratified the publics preoccupation with celebrity and fashion , depended upon recognizable types , and skillfully mined the discrepancy between appropriated style and living actuality . <p> The concluding chapter circles back to the questions posed in the introduction about the origins and apparatus of modern celebrity culture and the historiography of fame . Focusing in particular on the central role of images and performance in fashioning and transmitting celebrity , it scrutinizes the tensions between ephemeral and lasting fame and the complex dynamics of idolatry and desecration that continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new image-based , media-driven model of celebrity that emerged in the eighteenth century was routinely denounced as a debased modern brand of fame , based on ephemeral popularity , it has nevertheless proved durable , notably in the case of Siddons .

Analyzing the rich afterlives and posthumous imaging of Reynolds and Siddons underscores the centrality of the visual media in promoting and transmitting artistic celebrity from the eighteenth century to the present . <p> Art and Celebrity in the Age of Reynolds and Siddons sheds new light on the emergence of modern celebrity culture in Georgian London and the role of the visual arts and theater in shaping public taste and defining and contesting national identity . In particular , it reassesses the symbiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on the centrality of the performance paradigm ; exhibition culture and the heightened preoccupation with theatrical display ; and cultural politics and evolving modes of spectatorship . While all the chapters address aspects of art , performance , and celebrity , they do so from different vantage points across a spectrum of media , ranging from Grand Manner portraits to caricature , and through diverse generic lenses , from tragedy to satire . Chapter 1 establishes the performance paradigm and introduces the complex matrix of connections and rivalries linking painting and the stage by analyzing the intersecting careers of Reynolds and Garrick , who are emblematic of the central role that the visual and performing arts played in the invention of modern celebrity . Chapter 2 focuses on exhibition culture and the politics of display by examining the Royal Academy exhibitions and modes of spectatorship , and it considers how fashion , female agency , and the politics of display converged in womens portraits , especially those of actresses . Chapters 3 and 4 are concerned with aesthetic hierarchies , cultural politics , and the complexities of representation but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , the highest dramatic genre , and its visual representation through the trope of tragic pallor , chapter 3 highlights the broader cultural significance of the stage and the feminization of celebrity by analyzing the symbiotic relationship between painting and the stage , as evidenced in the negative connotations of makeup .

Although the question of their relative significance might occasionally be debated , July 14 , August 10 , 9 Thermidor and others have a relatively unambiguous standing . The meeting of the National Assembly of the night of August 4 , however , has a far more equivocal heritage . <p> The unsettled legacy of the night of August 4 stems in large measure from the ambiguity of both the origin and the outcome of the meeting of that evening . The calculated nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for cash compensation in an effort to appease the countryside , has opened to question the sincerity of the participants . The original plan went awry and the initial relinquishments became the catalyst for a wholly unanticipated and emotional surrender of privileges of every sort . Members of all three orders spent hours renouncing an extraordinary array of exemptions , prerogatives and privileges , and the relinquishments were so extensive that deputies could not recall all of them . Indeed , whereas the minutes of previous meetings had been prepared within a day or two of each session and were generally eight to twelve pages in length , those for the meeting of August 4 took two weeks to appear and comprised more than forty pages . The ultimate outcome of these renunciations would take two years to be realized and , in the case of a relatively large proportion of the clergy and nobility , was not what they had expected when they had agreed to the abolition of privilege . Nevertheless , the meeting of the night of August 4 provided a program and guiding principles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking . <p> Just as the origins of the meeting were ambiguous , so , too , was its outcome . To deputies of the National Assembly , particularly those who had been in attendance , the meeting of the night of August 4 and the principles that it instilled were beyond reproach . To many of those who were affected by the measures enacted by the National Assembly in the aftermath of August 4 , however , the session was not above recrimination . Most elements in French society were prepared to participate in the spirit of sacrifice that the meeting represented , but the ultimate outcome produced sharp disillusionment , particularly among the First and Second Estates . <p> In the case of the First Estate , the Church believed that it was joining in the spirit of sacrifice by relinquishing the tithe . But the renunciation of the tithe mandated a new method of financing the Church , which ultimately led to the nationalization of Church lands . The need to convert clergymen to salaried public officials who , like all other public officials , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that this document was drafted without consulting the Church , however , provoked substantial opposition , and the subsequent requirement by the Assembly of an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution led to a bitter schism in French society . <p> With respect to the nobility , the sense of fraternity that emerged from the relinquishments made during the night of August 4 led to the dissolution of orders in French society , a measure formally enacted in October , 1789 . The nobility acquiesced to the dismantling of orders in the political sphere , but the abolition of nobility in June , 1790 , after the nobility had accepted political and fiscal equality , struck many of its members as gratuitous and excessive . <p> The meeting also deeply affected the Third Estate , both the peasantry and urban inhabitants . It had , after all , been an attempt to address rural unrest that produced the initial renunciations . Relinquishments made during the meeting utterly transformed the situation of the peasantry and began their politicization . Although somewhat less apparent , the meeting also had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of venality of office led to a new structure of municipal government , and guilds , a fixture of urban life since the medieval era , were abolished . <p> The National Assembly sought to codify the results of the meeting of the night of August 4 in the Constitution of 1791 . Indeed , the preamble to the Constitution of 1791 recapitulates , in essence , the renunciations made during the meeting of the night of August 4 , highlighting the centrality of that meeting to the Revolutionary agenda . <p> The night of August 4 , 1789 , was clearly the night that the Old Regime ended , but , although it has often been characterized in general terms , it has received surprisingly little attention from historians . Patrick Kessel produced an analysis based on a thorough compilation of sources , and Jean-Pierre Hirsch edited a documentary collection of the meeting . Both books are useful , but they consist largely of documentation of the meeting and its immediate aftermath . A significant void in interpretation remains . What has been particularly lacking is a consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace a new ideal of the polity and an assessment of the vast social consequences of that new ideal for French society . <p> This study , then , considers the manner in which the renunciations of privilege made during the meeting of the night of August 4 formed the agenda for the National Assembly during the remainder of its existence . After examining the manner in which the meeting affected the National Assembly itself , this study analyzes the manner in which each of the three orders or estates within the kingdom was transformed as a result of the meeting of the night of August 4 and the legacy of that transformation not only on the early period of the Revolution , but also beyond . <p> Happily , the field of the French Revolution , despite the passionate nature of our debates , is , with a few exceptions , suffused with a spirit of fraternitT and scholarly generosity that I have always valued .

He described convincingly the personalities of playful yet seriously competitive artists : who could paint the thinner line , who could hoodwink even an artist into mistaking paint for reality ? <p> Alberti was more of a theorist than Pliny and prescribed how one would make a more ambitious , a more intellectual art . He was proud of redefining Plinys project , as was Vasari after him . For Pliny art was craft ; for Alberti painting was a liberal art . Alberti wrote a pioneering treatise , On Painting , in 143435 , consisting of three short books on perspective and invention . It was not available in print until 1540 in Latin , 1548 in Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the pictorial arts could accomplish . He foresaw a culture in which the best minds would aspire to have something to do with painting , whether directly or indirectly . His vision now seems the less startling because reality so soon conformed to his hopes , but in the 1430s nobody but Alberti was thinking in those terms . His treatise may not have been absolutely instrumental in making it happen , but even if it had had no effect whatsoever ( a claim belied , I think , not least by Mantegnas painted and printed inventions ; Leonardo seems also to have read Alberti ) , he would deserve respect for seeing the future so clearly . <p> Vasari ( 151174 ) wrote biographies , thereby de facto elevating artists to the status of great men , the likes of emperors , kings , dukes , and saintsalthough it was part of Florences mostly quiet social revolution that Lives had also been written during the fifteenth century of the more intellectual ilk of merchants as well as of the biographers themselves , the humanists . Artists started painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwardly in the fifteenth centurynot least , the amateur artist Alberti himself , whose plaquette of himself in profile , accompanied by a winged eye , remains among the most memorable of images ( fig. 1 ) . Vasari , who well knew that manuscripts ( let alone printed books ) might survive when paintings and sculptures did n't  , wrote three books of lives , 133 in the first edition and 158 in the second ( plus some supplemental chapters ) . Following good humanist principle he organized the whole with prefaces , so that the book had an organic structure , culminating in the longest and most admirable Life , that of Michelangelo . The history of art became a three-act play with Michelangelo , " il divino , " as the deus ex machina . <p> Vasari used two organizing principles : biography and historical period . There was some precedent in ancient rhetorical writing for organizing careers into stylistic periods , but it was slender . Cicero ( 10643 b.c. ) notably discussed style in his assessment of oratory , and he was followed to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental for the history of Western art as they were for the history of Western literature . The other precedent for Vasaris tripartite scheme can be found in histories of the world , which divided into three basic categories : before Revelation , after Revelation , and the Apocalypse . For example , the Weltchronik , a massive illustrated book published in German and in Latin by Dnrers godfather , Anton Koberger , provides an example of a world history that divides the whole into three parts . Michelangelo , by such a measure , counts as apocalyptic , and there is a least a vestige of that attitude left in Vasari . <p> Vasari somewhat nervously skirted cyclical theories of history ; such a theory would have committed him to predicting another onset of artistic decadence like that which he recognized as having begun with Constantine ( 272337 ) . Clearly he was worried by that prospect , and hoped his book would help avert what might otherwise seem inevitable . Cyclical theories worked best for those who did not think in terms of either antitheses or continual progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hippolyte Taine ( 182893 ) , like Vasari , tended to think of history as basically cyclical . Commonly such thinkers posited three stagesprimitive , classical of some sort , and decadent . An analogy with the phases of individual human life underwrote the scheme . <p> Ever since Vasari , art historians have been struggling with the concept of historical period . Does the name " Renaissance , " for instance , designate anything ? Vasari called his own period " modern . " Europeans continued to be fascinated with pagan culture for three hundred years after the " Renaissance " had ended . What does one actually know when one knows the name , or even when one knows which objects to classify under that rubric ? <p> There is some consistency to how artists , patrons , and public behave at a certain time ; they are educated similarly and experience the same social pressures , the same formative historical events . Sometimes shifts to new patterns of behavior are relatively abrupt , sometimes more gradual , but things do change : norms for materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and markets do evolve . The history of art is a great saga precisely because of this processthough the opposite has also been claimed , that what the history of art offers is primarily a profound lesson in universal value . Sir Joshua Reynolds in his Discourses on Art ( 1797 ) , for instance , thought that the great achievements of the classical artists ( Renaissance as well as ancient ) could never be bettered , only emulatedthough his boundaries were rather elastic . He showed himself backed by a bust of Michelangelo and looking as if his Titianesque notion of portraiture owed more than a little to Rembrandt ( fig. 2 ) . Erwin Panofsky even supposed that both of those claims could be true , that the history of cultures displayed both evolution ( at least from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance ) and universality ( essentially classical form with classical content ) . Augustus sic ! Welby Pugin ( 181252 ) opposed the classicists not on aesthetic grounds but on moral ones : his defense of the pointed Christian style derived from its functionality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verticality , and for a climate defined by precipitation and the accompanying architectural need to she 'd moisture . Like the classicists , he did not see art as the expression of a historical period but as the expression of a culture , culture itself being partly a function of unchanging climate and geography . His aesthetic preferences reflected his cultural taste , indeed , his identity as an English Christian ( though there is a certain irony in this Roman Catholics rejection of Mediterranean culture ) . <p> The spin that the new theorizing has put on this old issue is the claim ( catalyzed by Freud ) that not only is period an arbitrary construct , but so is aesthetic value . Our minds , according to Freudian thought and some of its descendants , have universal developmental stages , more determining than the specifics of our personal and social environments . Pre-Freudian writers tended either to praise a suprahistorical canon of art or to admire , more comprehensively , the unfolding of the human spirit across the ages . In either case , they sweated conviction about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our modern . The new theorists mock this pre-Freudian dedication to beauty of whatever definition , almost as though they still believed in the identification between beauty and nobility defined by birth , so that they could not reject the one without rejecting the other . For them , we are trapped indelibly in a present defined by a set of universal vices : oppression and exploitation , marginalization , colonialism , and so on . The postmodern viewer thus tends to appear very wary , very frail , despite all the current talk of " empowerment " and understandably enough , in this world as obsessed with mankinds all too obvious fallibility as Enlightenment thinkers were with mankinds perfectibility . <p> Freud thought that historical period was insignificant by comparison to the fundamental psychic forces of human experience . The relationship to the mother was archetypal ; the development of sexuality likewise was to be understood as carrying an internal dynamic , to which issues like child care and even religion were inconsequential . When Freud wanted to interpret a work of art , he looked for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations " rather than in social and historical contexts . He did not judge beauty ; he did not explain creativity ; instead he tried to expand our investigation of artistic intention to certain typical underlying subrational strategies . Freud led the way in making the history of art speculative , nonadulatory , and ahistorical . Post-Freud , much historical thought has been denigrated as " historicist . " Freud diagnosed typical art historians as devoting " their energies to a task of idealization , aimed at enrolling the great man among the class of their infantile modelsat reviving in him , perhaps , the childs idea of his father . " Even for the social historian T. J. Clark , more recently , the Freudian cast overpowers the historical curiosity . For him , the art historian has advanced to the rank of analyst rather than patient : he ought to be " like the analyst listening to his patient the contemporary critics . " The artist , for his part , responds to his " public " like the patient to his unconscious : " the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet it determines the structure of private discourse ; it is the key to what can not be said . " It is also the key to what can not be seen , to what the artist ignores in his visual world and heritage : " one studies blindness as much as vision . " <p> Admittedly , historical period is an infernally evanescent structure , at once both there and not there , its margin ever fading . It is also a heuristic that discredits its own creator , for if we study a period other than our own , how are we to avoid imposing our own intellectual conventions on the foreign material of another era ? Even worse than the anthropologist whose very presence changes the society he studies , the art historian studies a place and time he can not visit , with a mind wired by its experiences to interpret visual and verbal evidence in accordance with twenty-first-century assumptions , not all of which is she fully conscious . How can a student of a distant historical period avoid creating a monster , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the in-between ? Yet do we not study the past precisely in order to learn to free ourselves from the platitudes and assumptions characteristic of the present ? What is the point , if such freedom is obtained only in some monstrous hybrid of past and present ? <p> Freud tried somewhat nanvely to deny the difference between history and fiction , as a way of solving the problem of historical distance . The cultural historian Peter Burke , in addressing this issue , suggests that we regard historical fact as having some of the qualities of fiction , and vice versa . To understand people in another culture , we need to understand their " scripts , " their sense of the role they play in their society , the " deep structure " of their actions , that which is programmed for them rather than determined at their individual discretion . He suggests that we conceive of ourselves as observing commedia dellarte being improvised by stock characters amid the distractions of the street : to understand history , we need to grasp the Zannis and the Pantelones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , significantly , are defined culturally , in contrast to Freuds supposedly universal types . <p> Yet simply to erase the distinction between fact and fiction is only lily-livered resignation , rather than any satisfactory solution . The mess we make when we refuse to try to tease fiction from fact in our personal past , present , and future compels us to try to do the same in historical inquiry . We do n't  have to achieve perfection to make it worth trying to sort out present realities from past ones , and our relatively reliable knowledge from our highly speculative . As with the canon , the attempt to be skeptical tends only to instantiate a new orthodoxy : those who disdain the old facts as nanvely accepted often come to treat their own hypotheses as proven . Faith in history as a record of progress tends to lead to a sense of self-congratulation . <p> Some historians resolve bravely never to appeal to period , to forbid themselves the word " Renaissance , " for instancea desperate ploy comparable to trying to eliminate utterly the verb " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the problem by addressing primarily the present , and using historical evidence only as backing for an argument based in the contemporary situation . Art historians as different from one another as J. J. Winckelmann , Hippolite Taine , and T. J. Clark share the project of using history primarily for the sake of reforming the present . It may be that there is no other legitimate use , that critics are like lawyers and the past is merely a set of precedents to be appealed to as opportunity affords . Artists , as well as art historians , have been known to make such use of the past , and why not ? <p> Still , historys content is no mere heuristic device but an intelligible force on artists and others . Not all things are possible at all times , as the historian of style Heinrich Wlfflin ( 18641945 ) memorably put it . That is what he meant by Zeitgeistnot a full-fledged determinism but the realization that , for example , even rebellion is culturally licensed rather than an innate right of man , that rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a norm in the France soon after of Louis XVI . Artistic rebellion , other than the most marginal , could not survive in the twelfth century ; conformity was nearly as doomed to oblivion in the twentieth . Audiences , viewers , patrons , and curators have habits that are formed by experiences ; experience itself changes from one period to the next , sometimes gradually , sometimes more suddenly . It is not that those audiences have no causal role in making their own experiences , but that conscious intentionality is a small part of the causal whole : this was Freuds fundamental and judicious insight . It was also Aristotles , though , when he made efficient cause operate in conjunction with material , formal , and final causes . Wlfflins Zeitgeist we now call " culture , " i.e. , that great conglomeration of knowledge , belief , opinion , monuments , ephemera , projects , infrastructure , fashion , recyclings , noise , public spaces , etc.all the things that condition us to certain characteristic patterns of thought and forgetting , attention and distraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrestle with Zeitgeist , to change what we are likely to think about and how we are likely to think about thingsbut not for the sake of some preexisting polemic . The problem with Winckelmann and his ilk , with those who use history as a lever by which to change the present , is that generally they know what about the present they want to change before they make their historical study . That , it seems to me , is a lower-order use of history than one that starts out genuinely curious to find whatever can be found . History deserves a certain sort of purity from its votaries , which is not to say that what one learns wont be useful , only that its usefulness ought to be as unpredictable as that of any pure research . <p> It is the anthropologists who taught us most recently that culture ought to be an inclusive concept , that there can be no clean line between silverware , a decorative art , and flatware , a part of material culture , or between the arias within Covent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market that formerly bordered it . Archeologists might have taught us that , but it was a lesson more easily learned from the other side of the disciplinary fence . Since the 1970s art historians speak of the " period eye , " a history of vision as conditioned by the changing physical and social environment . The " period eye " splits the difference between Wlfflins Hegelian Zeitgeist and the anthropologists " material culture , " being less metaphysical than the former and more conceptual than the latter . <p> Biography , on the other hand , can be an attempt to slither out of the shortcomings that result from thinking in terms of historical period . People grow up , have public careers and/or families , and decline into decrepitude whether they have lived in antiquity or in the eighteenth century . Biography makes the past immediately accessible : people love , get angry , have money troubles , and have strokes of luck . Works of art similarly make the past immediately accessible : you do n't  have to understand the theory of kingship , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Versailles ( conversely , if you hate the grandeur because you hate a dead monarchy , you are cheating yourself ) . Mere looking at art offers a cheap ticket into other peoples lives ; its virtual dress-up for the overaged . To survive , art history has to offer an alternative , or at least a complement , to that considerable pleasure . We art historians do n't  want to be like a Thomas Aquinas who spoils simple piety , however grand might be the intellectual mazes we could construct if we set our minds to it . <p> Vasaris scheme of braiding together biography with the three historical periods produced a kind of hybrid vigor : a history that offers both flexibility and integrity . He had a hybrid scheme of causality as well : God sent great artists like Giotto and Michelangelo , but art was reborn in Florence because the air there was good , the folk crusty and critical of one another , and life hard enough that making an effort was the typical modus operandi . According to Vasari , determinism can indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder figure for art history , J. J. Winckelmann , took a thoroughly different route . He barely mentioned individual artists ; he barely admitted that any of Greek art was less than the ideal expression of an ideal people in an ideal climate , for whom life was festival and to whom beauty and freedom came naturally , in art as in life . His highly detailed outline of his projecthe is said to have spent a year on the outline aloneis organized by types of subject matter : " The Conformation and Beauty of the Male Deities and Heroes , " " The Conformation and Beauty of the Female Deities and Heroines , " " The Expression of Beauty in Features and Actions ( Hair of Satyrs or Fauns , Hair of Apollo and Bacchus , Hair of Young Persons ) , " " Beauty of the Extremities , Breast and Abdomen . " In fact he was a great student of languages and literature ( it is claimed that he might have written his great History in French , Italian , or Latin instead of his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reflection sets forth a daunting prospect : in order to study even one period of the history of art ( for him there is only one period worth studyingand although he is mocked for his narrow-mindedness , many art historians share the basic attitude ) , you must first thoroughly acquaint yourself with all the physical , literary , and geographical evidence that can be had . Nothing less will do , for to understand the parts , you must have a whole into which they fit : <p> If I conceive all the statues and images of which mention has been made by the authors , and likewise every remaining fragment of them , together with the countless multitude of works of art which have been preserved , as present before me at the same time I will be like an Olympic athlete . . . venturing on the enterprize of elucidating the principles and causes of so many works of art . . . .

One can never know the whole , and so , one can never reliably know the parts . Art history is n't geometry , after all ; certainty is not our business . Winckelmanns doomed project of a comprehensive social and cultural history helped prepare the ground for Freuds theorizing . That offered the prospect of an art history as confident as the old one of connoisseurs , in place of the daunting prospect of having to know everything in order to know anything . It was an attractive trade . <p> Neither book learning nor familiarity with works of art answers all the questions . The great and learned Winckelmann is said to have been stumped on one occasion by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and immediately recognized it as the stopper of a bottle . Like Apelles and the shoemaker ( who , Pliny tells us , taught the great painter how a shoe is actually constructed ) , the art historian has much to learn from the casual passerby about the common things of daily life . For all the emphasis Alberti and others have put on the learned artist ( and , by extension , on learned art historians ) , lay persons can see as well as the learned , and sometimes better . Carlo Ginzburg has argued that art historians should consider themselves diagnosticians , dealing with bits of evidence and making uncertain inference therefrom . Giovanni Morelli , the great connoisseur , was trained as a doctor , as was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the inventor of Sherlock Holmes . Even when they are not concerned with attribution , Ginzburg argues , art historians , and more generally men of letters , are making claims inferentially , bucking the tide of hard science and its deductive proofs . The task of art historians is not to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the humanities can never pass scientific tests of rigor , and then to invent more appropriate tests of rigor . Biography , on the other hand , tends to substitute sentiment for rigor . <p> Just as the best art is never simply autobiographical , so the best art history is not limited to the petty struggles of one persons career . The very genre , biography , encourages exaggeration of the heroic aspect , in order to justify such attention paid to a single individual , perhaps more than was paid him during his lifetime . It is no mere coincidence that an age that read Vasari religiously , the nineteenth century , also promoted the cult of the artist more than any other , and believed in Renaissance artistic genius more fervently than had men of the Renaissance . They made in the past the precedent they needed in order to deal with present problems , in particular with a loss of religious faith . Their historical understanding was not irresponsibly distorted , but it could not be utterly pure either . Whenever our sense of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need most to distrust it . Knowledge , after all , is supposed to be challenging , rather than comforting : sapere aude ( dare to know ) , as Horace and Kant put it . <p> Vasari had a test of sorts for his biographies . What mattered for him , in the end , was what a person had contributed to his artthat is , whether the art of painting , or sculpture , or architecture was better off because Masaccio or Bramante or Lorenzo Monaco had lived . Vasari was a practical man : he judged not only by the direction and momentum given the history of style , but by whether the artist had been respected by his social betters and also well paid . <p> If the prestige of the profession is the ultimate criterion for art history when written as biography , that leaves open the question of an appropriate criterion for other modalities . Connoisseurship is the part of art history most affiliated with science , that modern and inescapable locus of value .

Both children survived to adulthood , as did seven of their brothers and sisters . Ann Mendenhall , Williams mother , was a strong , healthy woman who bore nine children and raised and cared for them while working alongside her husband in farming the land . She lived into old age and died in the house that she and John moved to when they married in 1729 . Ann was the second wife of John Bartram and their marriage took place two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their eldest son , Richard , three years old . Marys second son , Isaac , survived and lived with his father and Ann and in later life became an apothecary , working in Philadelphia . The house and farm that John brought Ann to on their marriage was situated at Kingsessing on the west bank of the Schuylkill River , some four miles southwest of Philadelphia . John had substantially enlarged the house himself using stone that he hewed from local bedrock . The house still exists today , kept by the John Bartram Association as a museum and botanical garden . To visit the house , one can take a trolley from City Hall in Philadelphia , which takes the visitor through the sprawling suburbs southwest of the city . <p> The grounds of the Bartram house are nestled between the Schuylkill River , which flows past the far end of the garden , and municipal housing of red brick and weatherboard houses that stretches block upon block along the busy main road . These houses are not visible from the house or garden , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like in the eighteenth century . The large , well-proportioned stone house overlooks a rambling garden that rolls gently down to the river . Herbs , shrubs , and trees abound , including the oldest Gingko tree in the country and the famous Franklinia that John and William discovered in 1765 . The various sections of the garden are full of native plants that the Bartrams grew and listed in their 1783 Catalogue of American Trees , Shrubs and Herbacious Plants . It was in this house that Ann and John lived out their lives , farming the adjacent land and raising and educating their large family . <p> The Bartrams were members of the Religious Society of Friends and lived within a large Quaker community that had settled in Pennsylvania in the late seventeenth century . Pennsylvania was born out of religious dissent . Its founder and proprietor , William Penn , had secured the land west of the Delaware River in 1681 as payment of a debt owed to his father by King Charles II . William named the land in memory of his late father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society of Friends , a nonconformist group that questioned the established beliefs of the age . As a result , they were severely persecuted in England , where punitive laws existed that prevented them from worshiping in chartered towns and excluded them from holding public office , teaching , and attending university . William Penn had spent almost nine months imprisoned in the Tower of London for his beliefs and recognized that his newly acquired land could be a refuge for the persecuted members of his religious sect , a land where religious freedom would prevail . In 1682 the first of many ships set sail from England bound for the New World and the colony that Penn described as " a holy experiment " that would become " the seed of a nation . " Pennsylvania expanded at a considerable rate and was the fastest-growing colony of the time . The predominant settlers were English Quakers , but there was also a large community of Germans , the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch . The colony prospered rapidly because of several factors : the rich farmland that was cleared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , the success of William Penn in establishing peace with the local Native Americans . In 1683 Penn signed several treaties with the Delaware Indians that to were essentially maintained for fifty years . These fifty years of peace , which no other colony in America experienced , allowed Pennsylvania to establish a city building program , commerce , industry , and farming . Stimulated by economic success , Philadelphia soon became the intellectual and cultural center of North America . <p> Among those early settlers to Philadelphia were William Bartrams great grandparents , who had left Derby , England , in 1683 for their new life of farming the land in Darby , Pennsylvania . It was here that Williams father , John , was born in 1699 . John inherited land from his grandmother and uncle when they died and in 1728 added to that already substantial landholding by purchasing an additional 112 acres at Kingsessing . It was here that he built his house , farmed his land , and established what was to become the first botanical garden-cum-nursery in America . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants from around the world than any other on the North American continent , including an array of indigenous plants from the Northeast . It was never landscaped for aesthetic splendor but remained a working garden and nursery , propagating plants for their interest , beauty , and , above all , for the seed trade that John Bartram established . It was from this garden that John supplemented his income by growing plants he collected on expeditions up and down the eastern coast of North America and by processing the seeds to send to Europe . During his long life , John Bartram built up such a successful trade in plants and seeds to Europe that it allowed one of his sons , also named John , to earn his living solely from this trade . John Bartram Jr . had taken an early interest in the seed trade and assisted his father from adolescence , thereby earning praise from his fathers English friend , fellow correspondent and agent Peter Collinson , who described him as " Our John &amp; Peters right hand man " and proclaimed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cast . " It was John Jr . who inherited , on his fathers death , the garden and the seed trade . <p> John Bartrams love and care for his family is unquestionable , but he was a formidable father who was ambitious for his children . He passed down to all his children his own interest in nature , particularly plants . His son John took a great interest in the garden and James , the son who inherited the farmland , was an authority on local flora . Two other sons , Isaac and Moses , became apothecaries , their interest lying in the medicinal properties of plants . But it was William , Johns fifth son , a twin , physically rather fragile , artistically talented , and exceedingly sensitive , with whom John had a special affinity . It was William who traveled as a boy with his father , collecting plants for the garden and drawing the plants and animals they encountered on their expeditions . In later life it was William who continued to explore the wilderness so loved by his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels , something his father had dreamed about but never accomplished . It was William who became the son publicly associated with Bartrams Garden , where , in later years , visitors from around the world would venture out of their way to pay their respects to the " venerable " old man . It was also William who presented the greatest challenge to his father . He was a son whose own nature and vision of his future were contrary to his fathers . While William revered his father and tried to please him , he rarely did so and found that the only way he could resist his fathers overpowering presence was to retreat rather than confront . <p> John Bartram was a strong , resolute , and steadfast man who would never truly appreciate the doubts , dilemmas , and internal struggles that at times troubled others . John revealed his anxieties and frustrations with William in some of his letters to Peter Collinson , asking advice on Williams career and relating his own disappointments with his son . Toward the end of Johns life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few letters that exist between them during those years , Johns seem to have a tone of resignation rather than reconciliation . While Williams liberation came through his travels , by his mid-thirties he at last reveals in his last extant letter to his father a relationship of equal partnership . <p> John and Ann Bartram were relatively wealthy in terms of land ownership , but they also had a large family to support and were happy to supplement their income through the sale to Europe of Johns five-guinea boxes of seeds of indigenous American plants . Throughout the eighteenth century , European demand for new and unusual plants never abated . In the early years , Europe was entering the golden age of pleasure and landscape gardens . This was the period of the emerging English Enlightenment , with greater religious tolerance and liberal ideals on the progress and unity of humankind and personal freedoms . The Glorious Revolution of 1688 put in place many elements that were fundamental to the English Enlightenment , including the rule of law , Parliament , and greater religious freedom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater freedom to those who had been oppressed in earlier decades . However , Unitarianism remained punishable by penal law and Catholics and non-Christians were still denied the right to public worship . Nevertheless , gone were the repressive laws that had forced William Penn and his fellow Quakers to seek refuge across the Atlantic . <p> Religious toleration reflected other changes taking place in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England . It was a period of scientific innovation with Newtonian science of experimentation replacing that of mere observation . This in turn encouraged inquiry into religious and theological traditional beliefs and reason began to replace revelation and dogma . The ideas expressed by John Locke , the man seen as the father of the English Enlightenment , who championed the natural freedom of mankind , were being espoused by Deists such as Matthew Tindal , whose Christianity as Old as the Creation , published in 1730 , was considered the Deists bible . Tindal argued that God had given mankind the means , through rationality , of knowing whatever he required of them . Tindals beliefs were based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods will is so clearly and fully manifested in the Book of Nature , that he who runs may read it . " The eighteenth-century Deists tended to be anticlerical and believed in one true God who was revealed by the light of Reason and not through written text or an intermediary priest . John Bartrams own religious belief was not much removed from Lockes and Tindals . Like Locke , Bartram read the Bible and accepted that there was a place for revealed truth by applying reason . Reason explained the scriptures and validated the existence of God . And like Tindal , Bartram was a Unitarian who rejected the Trinity and the divinity of Christ . <p> Hand in hand with greater liberalism in law and religious toleration in England came material wealth for a certain sector of the countrys citizens . In the first half of the eighteenth century , the British economy was affected by several factors . An increase in agricultural productivity and growth in manufacturing and mineral technologies moved Britain and its economy toward industrialization . A rapid growth in the population of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes of the home country gave the British export market a considerable boost . Adding stimulus to these factors was the expanding Empire and the British dominance of the slave trade . Thus , for some there was a visible rise in disposable income . This wealth provided the opportunity for many to explore science and the natural world and mans place within it . Some expressed their interest by collecting natural objects such as fossils , rocks and minerals , insects , birds , animals , and plants . The desire to possess ornamental and curious plants from around the world was insatiable . The great expeditions that opened up to Europe new worlds of exotic flora and fauna came later in the century with Captain Cooks voyages , but in the 1730s , for many in Europe , the American colonies were the main source for new plants . <p> The passion for interesting and unknown plants was not wholly new to Europeans . Hysteria had gripped Western Europe in the seventeenth century with what became known as " Tulipomania , " when many a wealthy family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed on a handful of tulip bulbs . The mania reached its peak between 1633 and 1637 with examples of traders paying as much as twenty times for a single bulb as what an average family could live on for a single year . <p> Such mania for plants was replaced in the eighteenth century by a calmer , more rational attempt at re-creating miniature plant habitats of distant lands , particularly American , and the use of plants in sculpting scenes modeled on the landscape paintings of artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin . Alexander Pope , one of the first to apply painting techniques to gardening , wrote the Reverend Joseph Spence in 1734 that " All gardening is landscape painting . " The renaissance of the classical with Palladian architecture was transposed to garden design . Nature was now made to imitate art . Not only were royalty and nobility creating grand and majestic gardens , but so too were the wealthy commoners of Europe . As John Loudon explained in 1838 , the Enclosure Acts in England soon changed the face of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats laid out in the geometrical style ; and , for this reason , an attempt to imitate the irregularity of nature in laying out pleasure grounds was made in England . " New methods of growing plants in heated glass houses enabled enthusiasts , gardeners , and nurserymen to enjoy plants never before seen in Europe . More than 320 plants were introduced from America between 1736 and 1776 ( after which trade was disrupted by the revolutionary war ) and almost half of these plants were from John Bartram . <p> The introduction of North American plants into Europe had begun in the sixteenth century with the arrival of corn and tobacco . By the seventeenth century , Parisian gardeners were growing plants from Canada , while English gardens contained plants from Virginia . In addition , botanical literature , such as John Parkinsons books Paradisus ( 1629 ) and Theatrum Botanicum ( 1640 ) and Jacques Cornuts Canadensium Plantarum ( 1635 ) , recorded North American plants . Many of the plants were introduced because they had an economic or medicinal value and only toward the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . These plants were recorded in the works of Leonard Plukenett , Robert Morison , and Paul Herman and were collected by travelers sent to America by wealthy patrons . John Tradescant the younger made three visits to Virginia and John Banister traveled in Virginia and sent a large collection of specimens and seeds to Bishop Compton of Lambeth . Other major recipients of specimens were James Petiver , a London apothecary , and Sir Hans Sloane , an Irish physician and founder of the British Museum , who himself had collected a large quantity of plants from Jamaica while employed as the surgeon to the Governor of the Island . <p> Both Petiver and Sloane were Fellows of the Royal Society and both had a list of correspondents who sent specimens of plants , insects , minerals , shells , and fossils from the colonies . One of Petivers main correspondents was John Lawson , who traveled through the Carolinas and wrote an account of the flora and fauna of the region , A New Voyage to Carolina , in 1709 .

He sent plants back to England for several years and from these collections and his sketches made during his visits he produced the first illustrated natural history book of North America , TheNatural History of Carolina , Florida , and the Bahama Islands ( 173143 ) . Many of the plant collectors who visited the American colonies remained there for short periods of time , while the contributions of residents paled in comparison to those of John Bartram . <p> John Bartram had been interested in plants from a young age : " I have had ever since I was 12 years of age A great inclination to botany &amp; natural history . " He used his knowledge of medicinal plants to treat his family and neighbors . As a Quaker , John Bartrams interest in plants and medicine was not unusual . The Society of Friends had been founded in 1651 by George Fox and James Naylor and was one of the few sects that survived the Cromwellian years of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Test Act of 1673 politically disqualified Dissenters , excluded them from a range of professions , and barred them from obtaining a university education in England . This prompted the Quakers to establish their own schools , where they encouraged the study of natural history . George Fox had insisted that " the nature of herbs , roots , plants and trees " be taught in the schools . It was with this knowledge of plants that many Quakers were attracted to the medical profession , becoming apothecaries or attending universities in Europe or Scotland and becoming doctors . <p> John Bartrams botanical knowledge was mostly self-taught since he had received only a limited formal education from the local Quaker school . He became a farmer as a young man and his doctoring and use of medicinal plants were of a practical rather than a theoretical nature . Many of the local plants in his garden in its early years were used for treating ailments . By the 1730s , Bartram had an extensive knowledge of local flora of all kinds . It was this knowledge that led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker , Peter Collinson . <p> Peter Collinson , born in London in 1694 , was five years older than John Bartram . He too was born into a Quaker family , which originally hailed from the Lake District in Cumbria . With his brother he inherited his fathers wholesale woollen business in Gracechurch Street , London . Much of their trade was with the American colonies and this enabled Collinson to develop a large circle of correspondents in the country . Collinsons extensive knowledge of science was rewarded in 1728 with his election to the Royal Society , but his main passion was his love of plants and gardening . His gardens , first at Peckham , then later at Mill Hill , were among the finest in London , ranking alongside the garden of his very good friend and fellow Quaker John Fothergill in Essex , and was visited by botanical artists such as Georg Ehret and William King . Collinson corresponded with botanists and plant collectors from all over the world , including Jesuit priests in China and Dr. Mounsey , physician to the Tsarina of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in 1768 , Collinson recalled how in the early 1730s he had been searching for a reliable source in the American colonies who would send him seeds of new plants on a regular basis : " I labourd in vain , or to little purpose ; for some years . " Eventually in 1733 , Joseph Breintnall , a Quaker merchant whose main occupation was as a copier of deeds and who worked in Benjamin Franklins stationers shop , suggested John Bartram as his man . Again in his Memorandum , Collinson wrote , " Accordingly John Bartram was recommended , as a very proper Person for that purpose , being a native of Pensylvania , with a numerous Familythe profits ariseing from Gathering Seeds would Enable Him to support It . " Thus in 1733 a correspondence began that would continue over thirty-four years between these two men , who never met in person as neither man ever left his native country , but who became intimate friends and comrades through their love of plants . <p> Both men were great letter writers and we are fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included the leading men of science and politics of the day and he introduced many of these men to John Bartram . Within several years of their first letter , John Bartram was supplying his " five-guinea box " of seeds to a long list of customers in England . Each box contained seeds of 100 to 105 different plants , mainly woody shrubs and trees . The customers who repeatedly came back for more included some of the most notable aristocrats , nurserymen , and scientists of the day . The Prince of Wales purchased boxes for several years in succession . Noblemen such as Lord Bute , who directed the planting at Kew Gardens , the Dukes of Bedford , Argyll , and Richmond , the Earl of Essex , Sir James Dashwood , and General Napier were some whose splendid gardens were rich in American productions sent by John Bartram . Nurserymen such as James Gordon , one of the most highly regarded and influential professionals in the seed trade in the mid-century gardeners such as the Reverend William Hanbury and Philip Miller of Chelsea Physic Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ireland , and Germany also ordered Bartrams seeds Among the scientists who parted with five guineas were Humphrey Sibthorp and Sir Hans Sloane . The trade was so extensive that it helped shape the appearance of English landscape gardens . <p> Lord Petre was one of the first Englishmen to be introduced to John Bartram and during his short life was one of Bartrams major patrons , helping to finance an " annual allowance to Encourage &amp; Enable " Bartram to " prosecute further discoveries . " Lord Petre , with the help of his then gardener , James Gordon , created one of the most magnificent gardens of the time at Thorndon Hall in Essex . In one of his letters , Collinson , who was awaiting new discoveries from America , reveals the scale of Bartrams success : " The Trees &amp; shrubbs raised from thy first seeds is grown to great maturity Last year Ld petre planted out about Tenn thousand Americans wch being att the Same Time mixed with about Twenty Thousand Europeans , &amp; some Asians make a very beautifull appearance . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help thinking He is in North American thickets . " <p> In order to " prosecute further discoveries , " Bartram made regular trips along the length of the eastern coast of North America between the harvesting and sowing on his own farm . He became one of the most traveled men in America , covering thousands of miles from Lake Ontario in the north to Florida in the south and west to the Ohio River . He met in person many of those with whom he was already corresponding , men such as John Byrd , who owned a large and splendid garden in Virginia and was one of the few American members of the Royal Society of London . Among others were Alexander Garden , a Scottish doctor who had settled in South Carolina and had a medical practice in Charleston that kept him " from his desire to botanise " ; James Logan , secretary to William Penn in Philadelphia , who was reputed to have the best library in America , and who helped Bartram with his Latin and introduced him to Linnaeus ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a lifelong friend and who together founded the American Philosophical Society in 1743 . A friend whom Bartram visited several times on his plant-collecting trips was Cadwallader Colden of New York , one of the most articulate and knowledgeable men of science in the colonies , and with whom Bartram corresponded for many years , exchanged plants and seeds , and maintained a dialogue on botany and natural history . <p> Colden was born in Ireland of Scottish parents , who then returned to Berwickshire , Scotland , where Cadwallader was raised and educated . In early life he intended to follow his fathers profession as a Presbyterian minister , but while at Edinburgh University he became interested in the sciences and in 1705 went to London to study medicine . He completed his studies in 1708 and decided to practice as a physician in the colonies . In 1710 he set sail for Pennsylvania and settled in Philadelphia . He returned to Scotland several times , and on one of these visits , in 1715 , he married Alice Christy , the daughter of a Scottish minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cadwallader Colden did not practice as physician for very long in America , for he soon became the surveyor general for New York , a post that allowed him to be involved in land speculation and become relatively wealthy . He purchased three thousand acres of land north of New York City in the Hudson River Valley , now the town of Montgomery in Orange County . Here he built a grand house and named his estate Coldengham , where the family settled permanently in 1728 . The Coldens had ten children , whom they educated at home . Coldens son , Cadwallader Jr. , wrote that his mother , Alice , conducted much of the childrens early education and that all of them were encouraged to develop their own intellectual pursuits . <p> Colden was himself part of the international network of scientific correspondents that included Linnaeus , Gronovious , Collinson , Franklin , and John Bartram . His interests were far-ranging and he had a broad knowledge of science . His study of history and ethnography led him to write a History of the Five Indian Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious botanist after reading Linnaeuss Plantarum Naturae and was one of the first to apply Linneauss classification system to plants in America . He wrote a local flora of New York entitled Plantae Coldinghamiae , which was published by Linnaeus in 1749 . This was the first attempt at the systematic classification of American plants . In later life Colden diverted his energies toward his interest in physics , writing An Explication of the First Causes of Action in Matter , in which he attempted to explain Newtons theory of gravity . Colden was one of the few Americans to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun in 1768 . He also took an interest in politics and became a member of the Council of New York and later , in 176176 , served as lieutenant governor of New York . <p> In 1753 John Bartram visited the Colden estate as part of his excursion to the Catskill Mountains . He wrote to Collinson before he left , " I am preparing for A Journey to dr . Coldens &amp; ye mountains I desighn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The " little botanist " was his son William , then fourteen . William was as young as twelve when he started to accompany his father on his trips . " I have A little Son about fifteen years of age that has traveled with me now three years &amp; readily knows most of ye plants that grows in our four governments . " Through Johns friendship , William had already been introduced to Peter Collinson and had presented him with some of his drawings of plants and birds . Both Collinson and George Edwards , the author of A Natural History of Birds ( 1743 ) , were recipients of Williams early drawings , and Edwards used the drawings for his engravings in his books , while Collinson showed them to scientists and artists of natural history . " There is a Little Token to my pretty artist Billey His Drawings has been much admird , " wrote Collinson in appreciation . <p> The expedition of 1753 resulted in the Bartrams spending three days at Coldengham , where they met with Coldens second daughter , Jane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in 1724 and according to her father exhibited intellectual prowess at an early age and also possessed " a curiosity for natural philosophy or natural history . " Colden took particular interest in his daughters education and provided an extensive library of botanical literature . He explained to a friend that Jane did not read Latin and so Colden " took the pains to explain Linnaeuss System , and to put it in English form for her use by freeing it from the technical terms . " The translation of Genera Plantarum enabled her to master Linnaeuss classification system and apply it to her own work . <p> Jane Colden became well known in botanical circles in both America and Europe and was without doubt highly respected by those who met her or knew of her work . Peter Collinson wrote to John Bartram about their " Friend Coldens Daughter , " explaining that Jane had sent him some sheets of plants with scientific descriptions that she had done according to the Linnaean method : " I believe she is the first Lady that has Attempted any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his letters to Colden , Collinson enclosed " 2 Vol. of Edinburgh Essays for the sake of the Curious Botanic Dissertation of your Ingenious Daughter . Being the Only Lady that I have yett heard off that is a professor of the Linnaean system of which He is not a Little proud . " <p> Alexander Garden was a friend and correspondent of Colden and was himself an amateur plant collector and botanist . In 1755 he wrote to John Ellis of London about Colden and his daughter : " Not only the doctor himself is a great botanist , but his lovely daughter is greatly master of the Linnean method and cultivates it with great assiduity . " Jane Colden is now recognized as the first American woman botanist and several attempts were made during her lifetime to have a plant named after her , both Collinson and John Ellis suggested this to Linneaus . Collinson presented his request in 1756 ; " I but lately heard from Mr Colden . He is well ; but , what is marvelous , his Daughter is perhaps the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves to be celebrated . " John Ellis went a step further in 1758 , when he sent one of Janes plant descriptions that he had translated into Latin to Linnaeus : " This young lady merits your esteem , and does honour to your system . She has drawn and described 400 plants in your method only . . . . Her father has a plant called after him Coldenia , suppose you should call this Coldenella or any other name that might distinguish her among your Genera . " However , Linnaeus may well have been a little proud and flattered by Janes work , but none of the above pleas was successful and no plant exists today that honors Jane Coldens name . <p> Few of Jane Coldens writings have survived . Her main work is the manuscript held in the Natural History Museum in London , of the flora of New York , Flora Nov-Eboracensis . The volume consists of 284 sheets of line drawings of leaves and scientific description of each plant . The descriptions , written in English with Latin names and the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some plants she has added their medicinal and folk use , explaining who used the plant and for what ailments , and even included the prescribed dosage and method of application . " This Seneca Snake Root is much used by some Physicians in America , principally Long Island , in the Pleurisy , especially when it inclines to a Perip neumony , they give it either in Powder or a Decoction . The usual Dose of the powder is thirty grains . " <p> Jane Coldens drawings are , as James Britten notes , " very poor , and consist only of leaves . The figures are merely ink outlines washed in with neutral tint . " The last image in the collection is a nature print . These drawings probably do not give justice to how skilled an artist Jane Colden was . According to several letters , she is described as an accomplished draftswoman . Her father describes to Johann Gronovius that " She was shown a method of taking the impression of the leaves on paper with printers ink , by a simple kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone can give so clear an idea , as when assisted with a picture . " Nature printing was a fashionable pastime for many and Joseph Breintnall , the man who introduced Bartram to Collinson , produced many such illustrations , and indeed relied on John Bartram to find specimens and identify them for him . A letter by Walter Rutherford reports of a visit to the Colden estate , " the abode of the venerable Philosopher . " Here Rutherford describes Jane as " a botanist , she has discovered a great number of Plants never before described . . . and she draws and colors them with great beauty . " <p> When William visited the Coldens for the first time in 1753 , he and his father spent time looking over some of Janes " botanical curious observations , " which no doubt would have included her drawings and nature prints . William Bartram may well have considered Jane Colden a respectable artist judging from the reply John Bartram gives to one of her letters , which he received on 26 October 1756 , and had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be extreamly glad to see thee at my house &amp; to shew thee my garden . . . . I shewed him William thy letter &amp; he was so well pleased with it that he presently made a pockit of very fine drawings for the far beyond Catesbys took them to town &amp; tould me he would send them very soon . " The keenness of William to send Jane some of his drawings hints that he had been impressed with Janes attempts at illustration and that it was their equal love of drawing that was the key to the cultivation of such an affectionate friendship between Jane and the Bartrams . It is not known whether Jane ever made the trip to Philadelphia to visit the Bartram garden . By 1759 she had married Dr. William Farquhar , a widower practicing medicine in New York City , and there is nothing to suggest that she continued her botanical investigations after her marriage . Tragically Jane died in 1766 , soon after giving birth to her only child , who did not survive .

Abbasidmosaics in the Holy Land ( second century BCE to eighth century CE ) . All general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on specific collections , resulting in useful corpora but nevertheless devoid of full analyses of the mosaics cultural and religious significance . This book sets out to fill this lacuna by demonstrating how mosaic art constructs cultural , religious , and ethnic identities in a multicultural society in eras that shaped the visual expressions of the three monotheistic religions . What makes this endeavor both timely and imperative are recent archaeological discoveries ( e.g. , the Christian mosaic at at Kefar ? Othnay , the synagogue at Wadi el Hamam , or the early ? Abbasid mosaics at Ramla ) that have considerably enriched the existing corpora and , above all , have challenged prevailing assumptions . <p> While I was preparing my manuscript , Rachel Hachlili published her book AncientMosaic Pavements : Themes , Issues , and Trends ( Leiden , 2009 ) . Although there is some overlap in the mosaic floors ( of ancient Palaestina ) that are discussed in the two volumes , our approaches are completely different . Hachlili focuses on the formalistic analysis of motifs as well as their meaning and significance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along their diachronic axis , thereby passing over a large set of historical , cultural , sociological , and liturgical questions that the present volume brings to the fore . The distinct methodologies naturally affected our respective observations . <p> Mosaics are not mere decorations , for when approached critically , they can be read as first-rate historical documents . Such an examination of the mosaics in a pivotal region of the eastern Mediterranean can sharpen and refine our understanding of societies , including their ideologies , institutions , and liturgies ; inclusion of the mosaics in the scholarly discourse makes possible a richer perception of the past . <p> The mosaics of the Holy Land span almost a thousand years , enabling us to detect meaningful threads of continuity and change in the evolution of floor decorations from the Hellenistic to the Roman periods , in the transition from Roman to Early Byzantine art , and in the persistence of Byzantine traditions under Umayyad rule . <p> More than any other corpora of ancient mosaics ( such as those of Antioch , Tunisia , or Greece ) , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate visual dialogues among paganism ( polytheism ) , Judaism , Samaritanism , Christianity , and Islam . The provinces of Palaestina and Arabia ( present-day Israel , the Palestinian Authority , and Jordan ) are especially rich in mosaics dating to Late Antiquity , when the region became a Christian and , later , an Islamic Holy Land ( fourth to eighth century CE ) . Adopting a comparative approach , I examine the mosaics of each of these religious/ethnic groups against the background of the art of other contemporary communities with which it had a profound and multidimensional dialogue . <p> Because of the unique nature of the region in the ancient worldand probably in world historyI base my approach on an analysis of imageries and texts . Sometimes the art confirms the textual evidence ; at other times it contradicts it . This lack of agreement obliges us to assume that the historical picture is more complex than we may have thought . <p> An art historian must consider all aspects of the artworks in his or her study . Accordingly I shall treat questions relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , composition , and style . The formalistic analysis of the mosaics style shows the existence of periodic styles ; therefore , the stylistic developments may be used as a yardstick for a discussion of the mosaics in their precise historical and social contexts . A comparison of the stylistic and compositional characteristics of the mosaics from the Holy Land with those from other provinces of the Roman and Byzantine world is essential for understanding their uniqueness and for clarifying the mechanism that enabled the spread of artistic trends to small local workshops in remote areas . The Jews did not develop a distinctive style of their own , and we shall ask why they did not consider style an important component in the designation of their cultural identity . <p> Weighing the disparate data presents a major difficulty that confronts any scholar of mosaics in Palaestina and Arabia . The number of mosaics classified as Byzantine by far exceeds the number of those classified as Hellenistic and Roman , and such an imbalance prompts profound reflections on economic , political , and administrative factors . <p> The book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part I , chapter 1 discusses the Hellenistic and Early Roman mosaics . Although our knowledge regarding this period is far from complete , the information at our disposal for roughly the first two hundred years of mosaic production in Israel and Jordan is considerable in comparison with the even poorer evidence from nearby Syria until the end of the first century CE . With regard to the pre-Herodian mosaics , I analyze forms of interaction between foreign , Hellenistic influences ( extending from Alexandria to Asia Minor ) and local artistic traditions . Under the patronage of Herod , the local mosaic industry expanded , and a fertile dialogue took place between the local Hellenistic traditions and the current Roman styles . Magnificent mosaic floors recently discovered at Caesarea Maritima and Beth Shean close the gap between the mosaics of the Second Temple ( second century BCE to 70 CE ) and Late Roman periods ( from the Antonine dynasty to the time of Constantine ) and may attest to the continued use of mosaic art in the late first or early second century CE under Roman patronage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosaics . Although marked by the influence of the major production centers in contemporary Syria , the artisans were also exposed to ideas coming from the West . Some of the mosaics raise questions regarding the degree of pagan influence on Jewish society . My conclusion here is that Roman patronage , while deepening the Hellenistic character of the art , also introduced distinctly Roman elements ; it should be emphasized , however , that several of the mosaics discussed here have not yet been subjected to careful analysis . This chapter concludes with a discussion of the intriguing mosaic discovered at Kefar ? Othnay ( in the Legio region ) , the earliest-known Christian mosaic in the Holy Land . <p> Part II treats a relatively large number of floor mosaics ( approximately 600 ) from the Byzantine period . In chapters 3 and 4 , I analyze the main compositional and stylistic features of these mosaics , and to highlight the uniqueness of this material , I compare them with mosaics of nearby provinces , such as Syria and Phoenicia . Contrary to generalizations that have customarily been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each century , demonstrating how style ( a flexible notion ) becomes a tool of periodization ( an artificially established notion ) . It will be shown that the compositional trends of the mosaics in the Holy Land are the result of a complex and intricate process of internal development alongside a receptivity to influences from other production centers . <p> My examination and analysis of the iconography of churches ( chapter 5 ) and synagogues ( Jewish , chapter 6 ; Samaritan , chapter 7 ) is followed by a study of mosaics from private homes and public secular edifices ( chapter 8 ) , raising several pivotal questions . Is there a basis for the assumption that , in addition to the authentic internal discourse within each community , art also responded to the arts of other religious groups ? Was the discourse among the arts of different religions conscious or unconscious , hidden or overt ? Are there differences in the way mosaics functioned in the liturgical spaces of each religious community ? What happened when two religions , as a result of the veneration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of images and topics ? How did they deal with the risk that the use of the same repertoire might blur the real or projected differences between them ? <p> One focus here is on the question of how religious buildings ( churches and synagogues ) were spiritually perceived by the different faiths . While the idea that a religious building is a model of the world is held in common , its implications in the mosaics are different . I also discuss how the recognition in the early fourth century of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman empire , with the waning of paganism , affected Jewish mosaics . <p> The relationships between the prayerhouses of the various monotheistic religions and the Temple in Jerusalem ( destroyed in 70 CE ) , as reflected in mosaic decorations , are also explored . I consider how and to what extent concepts of divine omnipresence are expressed in the mosaics and how the role of religious buildings as communal meeting places is reflected in their decoration . The decorative programs of synagogue and church mosaics raise the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> Jews and Christians also decorated their secular spaces with mosaics . Such works are replete with mythological scenes that provide unique insights into Classical education in Late Antiquity and the continuous vitality of Hellenism in the Byzantine period . <p> Part III focuses on the mosaics of the seventh and eighth century , prompting us to consider the ways in which the rise of Islam affected both Christian ( chapter 9 ) and Jewish ( chapter 10 ) mosaics . One strand of the investigation follows the production of Christian and Jewish mosaics under Muslim rule , and in particular how Christian mosaics responded to the Muslim conquest of the Holy Land . Special emphasis is placed on the motivation and mechanisms that ultimately resulted in the so-called iconoclastic movement . <p> Since Muslims , on the whole , shunned figurative floor mosaics within a religious context , the analysis of Islamic mosaic art focuses on figurative and geometric floor mosaics discovered in the palaces of the Muslim rulers and members of their families ( chapter 11 ) . Here I examine how Muslim patronage contributed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The last subject to be examined is the defacement of images on the mosaic floors in churches and synagogues , a phenomenon that has almost no parallels in other regions ( chapter 12 ) . In searching for the factors that led to the destruction the explanation of the phenomenon should take into account the role played by Jews , Muslims , and Christians in setting the processes of destruction in motion , and it should consider internal factors in each faith as well as possible external influences or tensions . <p> This volume will she 'd light on the close cultural interaction between faith and art in this critical part of the Mediterranean . My examination and interpretation of the recent archaeological discoveries of mosaic floors in the Holy Land will now make it possible to perceive both the intimate links and the disjunctions between art and text .

More than once , Benzoni found himself at deaths door yet managed to escape with his life . Although his travels are presented as an adventure tale , he had a less glamorous motive for traveling across the globe : Benzoni was a merchant . In his travels throughout the Americas , he pursued various trade ventures . It is difficult to judge just how successful he was at finding his riches . He omits most of his business dealings ; only rarely does he provide details on the price of wine or gold . He certainly asserts his prosperity , telling his readers that he made a fortune and was ready to bring a load of gold back to Milan . Like other early travelers , Benzoni became an amateur naturalist . He recorded detailed descriptions of indigenous flora and fauna , almost always oddly colored by the pressing pains of hunger or thirst . At the same time , his writings engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he despised the Spanish . At almost every turn , Benzoni criticizes Spanish methods of conquest and governance , while frequently siding with Native Americans . <p> More than a decade after he initially departed northern Italy for parts unknown , he found himself expelled from the overseas kingdoms of Spain . He packed his thousands of ducats and left , set to retrace his steps to Europe . Unfortunately , he suffered shipwreck and inclement weather before he got far . He had to stay in Havana for several miserable months waiting for a vessel strong enough , and weather good enough , to carry him home . He ultimately arrived in Spain in 1556 , penniless , exhausted , and full of stories . With nothing left to peddle but his memories , he decided to write them down in his History of the New World . Originally published in 1565 , Benzonis history quickly captured the attention of readers across Europe . <p> Benzonis narrative contributed to a growing corpus of travel narratives that related the explorations and adventures of Europeans as they traveled to parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons : he included harrowing stories , he offered descriptions of the indigenous animals and plants that Europeans had never even imagined , and he described a completely new group of people and beliefs . Just as Spains continental ascendency seemed unstoppable , Benzoni offered a vitriolic description of the barbarity of the Spanish that brought their moral authority to rule and exploit the New World into question . The mix of adventure , exotic people and places , and anti-Spanish diatribe made The History of the New World an immediate best seller . Benzonis narrative provides a unique firsthand account of the Spanish conquest by an Italian . Its anti-Spanish rhetoric represents an understudied but historically significant contribution to the Black Legend of Spanish colonialism . As a whole , The History of the New World provides readers with a rich ethnographic text that offered its early modern readers a tantalizing blend of travelogue , adventure tale , and anti-Spanish propaganda . <p> Benzoni and the Early Modern Travel Narrative <p> Most of the very little we know for certain about Benzoni comes from his first line : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two . Other clues come from his two dedications . The second ( and shorter ) dedication was written in 1572 , so we know that he was still alive at that point . In the first , written in 1565 , Benzoni tells Pope Paul IV that he is the child of a " humble father , " from a " house gone to ruin , in part because of the continuing war , and just as much because fortune has always been his familys enemy . " Because his father could not support him at university , he instead sent Benzoni throughout Europe , to " various provinces : France , Spain , Germany , and the other cities in Italy . " It was in these distant cities that he first heard of the wonders of the New World and developed an " extreme desire " to go . Though he never again speaks directly of his upbringing , the narrative supports his claim to be a down-on-his-luck merchant and curious traveler . <p> Benzonis book has a longer and better-documented pedigree . La historia del Mondo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reissued in 1572 with some minor changes . Far more copies of this second edition are extant , suggesting a larger run . The book was translated and republished quickly . Urban Chauveton translated it into Latin ; this edition was published in Geneva by Eustathium Vignon in 1578 . The same team issued a French translation in 1579 . Nicholas Hniger , a German , translated the work into German from Chauvetons Latin ; it was published in Basel in 1579 . Benzoni was translated into Dutch in 1610 . Europeans were able to read about a dozen more translations and editions by the end of the sixteenth century , and quite a few more in the early seventeenth . There were thirty-two editions in all . The book languished for about a century , until the appearance of a new French translation in 1835 . Unsurprisingly , Benzonis hispanophobic text was translated into Spanish only in 1967 , and even then only in the colonies , in Caracas , Venezuela . It was not published in Spain proper until 1989 . <p> Anglophones had access to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English cleric Samuel Purchas translated and edited a collection of travel narratives by " Englishmen and others " in 1625 . He included six pages from Benzoni , whom he called " Jerome Benzos , " in his fourth volume . None of Benzonis book was rendered into English again until the mid-nineteenth century , when the Hakluyt Societya group founded in 1846 in London to further the study of explorationpublished it in its entirety in 1857 . The " entirety " is part of why we have chosen to issue this new translation and edition . At its best , Benzonis account captures the readers imagination with its rich first-person details and unique perspective . At other times , Benzoni copies other authors almost word for word , passing on specious information with nary a comment . Moreover , the 1857 translation , though serviceable , is clunky and more than a little dated . The current edition contains material written only by Benzoni himself ; from the whole text we have skimmed much of the chaff . <p> Europeans had always loved stories offering adventure in faraway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Greeks told a tale of Hercules stealing the belt of Hippolyte , the Amazon queen , in a distant land . In the Middle Ages , Europeans voraciously consumed the stories of Marco Polo , Odoric of Pordenone , and Sir John Mandeville , with little thought for veracity or even verisimilitude . Rather , the more amazing or awe-inspiring , the better , even if the descriptions were inexact and difficult . Stephen Greenblatt likens the European response to the New World to the " startle reflex " in infants : " eyes widened , arms outstretched , breathing stilled , the whole body momentarily convulsed . " Europeans reached for the Western Hemisphere , with its endless jungles , enormous mountains , and strange people unlike anyone ever encountered . Yet that startled moment also contained a flash of panic . This wonder , as Greenblatt characterizes it , involved not only a desire to possess and understand but also more than a hint of terror and horror . Naked cannibals , monstrous beasts , entire societies existed outside of Gods plan , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at just the right time . Europeans were in the first throes of New World fever . They consumed more travel literature than ever before and panted over tales of adventure from those recently returned from strange new lands . <p> The travel literature of the early modern period helped to explain to Europeans not only the newly discovered territories but also how the Old World fit into a new global paradigm . As Claude LTvi-Strauss wrote in his memoir Tristes tropiques , " Every landscape appears first of all as a vast chaos , which leaves one free to choose the meaning one wants to give it . " Explorers arrived in the New World with a cultural paradigm that they imposed upon the world they found . They understood their world within that framework and transmitted it to their readers . Practically speaking , unique animals were likened to familiar beasts of burden . But beyond that , Europeans rendered the utterly unknown into something culturally identifiable . For instance , Hakluyt rendered naked Indians in the New World as the ancient Picts in imagery . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrative for growth : barbarians from Europe became the entirely civilized British Empire . These naked Indians could also become delightful Christian citizens . <p> Benzoni certainly makes use of this schema . He accentuates the savagery in the Americas , be it via an exhausting passage on bloodthirsty mites capable of crippling a grown man overnight , or magniloquent descriptions of genuine man-eating Indians . He sets up a very clear asymmetrical dichotomy between the indigenous and the Europeans , with religion as his first line of demarcation : superior European Christian opposite inferior pagan indigenous . Benzoni occasionally refers to the indigenous as " brute beasts " in his narration of their senseless pagan rituals , their willingness to murder their children , and their horrifying habit of consuming their neighbors . But he often presents these atrocities in concert with the even greater horrors perpetrated by the Spaniards . The Indians kill their children in abominable ways , but only to save them from greater abuses at the hands of the Spaniards . Yet there were clear distinctions even within the ranks of the Christians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his contemporaries , the Spaniards and Italians represented two different peoples endowed with different moral and cultural characteristics . Benzoni often writes of Spanish foolishness , yet he rarely compares Spaniards and Italians directly . Instead , he makes his anti-Spaniard point by contrasting his fellow Christians with the indigenous . The indigenous may be cannibals , but they are generous when compared to the Spaniards . The Spaniards appear not only as vicious monsters but also as very bad Christians . <p> The Spanish Empire and the Black Legend <p> Benzonis hatred of Spaniards was not unreasonable . Spain was arguably the most powerful country in Europe during the years Benzoni spent tramping through the Americas , and its power was bolstered and maintained by the copious riches of the New World . The marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabel of Castile in 1469 set the stage for the unification of Spain . In 1492 , the end of the Reconquista and the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims furthered their nationalist project . The couple wisely negotiated strategic marriages for their children , most notably pairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of the Holy Roman Emperor . Philip and Juana gave birth to a son , Charles , who became king of Castile and Aragon in 1516 , and would be the first monarch to rule those territories with the title king of Spain . The initial union of Castile and Aragon probably did not worry other European kingdoms . In 1520 , however , Charles succeeded his grandfather Maximilian and became Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor and archduke of Austria . Such a confluence of dynastic providence was certainly cause for alarm . <p> By the 1520s , Charles controlled huge chunks of Europe , including the Netherlands , Austria , Hungary , and much of northern Italy , as well as territories in the New World . After inheriting such vast estates , Charles spent most of his life defending them from his rivals . In Italy , Charles would spend thirty years fending off French invasions and internal Italian challenges . As Holy Roman Emperor , he struggled to contain the outbreak of the Protestant Reformation and the vicious warfare it unleashed . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his treasury . Even the expanding Ottoman Empire encroached on his Austrian possessions . In 1554 , Charles chose to retire to a monastery , bequeathing the Holy Roman Empire to his brother , Ferdinand , and leaving Spain , and its empire , to his son , Philip II , who remained embroiled in conflict throughout the sixteenth century . <p> Benzonis personal experience with this history came through a set of these conflicts called the Italian Wars . Waged between 1494 and 1559 , these wars involved most of the major European kingdoms , as they each vied for power over the Italian Peninsula . Benzonis home , the Duchy of Milan , was constantly at war during this period . Although the Milanese could have developed a grudge against many foreign interlopers , including the papacy , the French , the Florentines , the Ottomans , and the Venetians , among others , the Spanish were the worst . In 1535 , Francesco Sforza died without an heir , leaving the Duchy of Milan without a native ruler . Charles V took it over without fanfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French from 1536 to 1538 . A much more significant war involving the Ottoman Empire took place between 1542 and 1546 and then again from 1551 to 1559 . Benzoni departed for the Americas in 1551 , war breaking out around him again as France and Spain fought for control of his homeland . His anger toward the Spanish and the machinations of Charles V stemmed in part from this experience . Given the scope of conflicts involving the Habsburgs , other Europeans came to adopt similarly negative views of the Spanish . <p> Although derogatory descriptions of the Spanish have persisted since the sixteenth century , this pattern of national stereotyping received no serious scholarly attention until the twentieth century . In 1914 , the Spanish scholar Julin Juderfas dubbed the anti-Spanish stereotype the " Black Legend . " Since then , scholars have heatedly debated the origins and implications of the term . At its core , the Black Legend portrays Spaniards as harsh conquerors and colonizers , ruthless in their dealings with Native Americans and exploitive of the land and people under their rule . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood as a historical process . It did not spring into existence suddenly but was shaped by interactions between competing European groups in Europe and the Americas . The conflicts that routinely pitted Spain against France , England , or Italian city-states fostered antagonism toward the Spanish , and Spains colonization of the New World provided new fuel for older animosities . Benzonis own bias against Spaniards was probably rooted in the expansion of the Kingdom of Aragon into the Mediterranean and Italian Peninsula in the fifteenth century , a process that encouraged negative stereotypes of the Aragonese as mercenaries and bad Christians . Such views persisted in the sixteenth century in response to Spanish participation in the Italian Wars . These earlier biases , and Benzonis personal experience in the Italian Wars , preconditioned his view of Spanish conquest in the Americas . <p> The single most cited source of anti-Spanish stereotypes has been the work of the Spanish **30;1258;TOOLONG BartolomT de Las Casas . Since its initial publication in Spanish in 1552 , European rivals have used Las Casass Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New World , by contrast , is largely unknown to modern audiences . It is tempting to assume that Benzonis obscurity reflects the later publication of his narrative , which appeared in print thirteen years after Las Casass Short Account captured the attention of European critics . But this is not the case . In fact , Benzonis History of the New World may have reached more European readers in the sixteenth century than the Short Account did . <p> After its initial publication in Italian in 1565 , The History of the New World was reissued in 1572 and quickly translated and disseminated in Latin ( 1578 ) , French ( 1579 ) , German ( 1579 ) , and Dutch ( 1610 ) , as noted above . Las Casass Short Account was not translated until 1578 , when it appeared in Dutch . By roughly the same date , Benzonis History was available to Italian , French , and German readers , and educated readers could read it in Latin . By the end of the century , the Short Account had gained ground , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and German ( 1599 ) . Although the relative size of readership can not be determined , the popularity of The History of the New World certainly rivaled or exceeded that of the Short Account during the second half of the sixteenth century . <p> Nevertheless , in the long sweep of history , Las Casass writing continued to be mobilized as anti-Spanish propaganda long after Benzonis History of the New World fell into obscurity . One reason for Las Casass ascendency over the long haul involves the successive republication of the Short Account during periods of conflict between Spain and its European rivals . English translations , for example , appeared in 1583 , 1625 , 1656 , 1689 , 1699 , and 1745 . Each of these reprintings coincided with heightened tensions between Spain and England . Between 1552 and 1750 , the Short Account appeared in at least thirty-four editions , the majority of them published by Spanish rivals . At least fourteen Dutch editions appeared in the seventeenth century alone . By the end of the eighteenth century , six editions had appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Las Casass Short Account lies in its focused , well-argued , polemical attack on the Spanish conquest and its participants . In contrast , The History of the New World mixes critique with travelogue , history , geography , and adventure . While Las Casas relentlessly describes atrocity after atrocity , Benzonis narrative meanders , jumping between past and present and mixing history , hearsay , and personal anecdotes . While Benzonis style of writing clearly captured the imagination of sixteenth-century Europeans who sought news from the Americas , by the seventeenth century , Las Casass brutal direct attack proved more enticing to European readers eager to vilify the Spanish in the midst of international conflict . Benzonis work faded into obscurity because its style no longer appealed to European audiences . Nevertheless , the early fascination with Benzoni makes his History a formative source for the development of the Black Legend . <p> Spanish America Before Benzoni <p> Although Benzonis narrative was one of the earliest histories of the Americas , he arrived in the New World almost fifty years after Columbus first claimed Hispaniola for the Spanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies of the Americas were conquered , among them the Aztecs , Incas , Mayans , and Muiscas . But the Spanish conquests of the Americas were by no means finished , as Benzoni learned firsthand during his travels . <p> The strategies , tactics , and patterns of Spanish conquest in the Americas did not develop in isolation . For nearly eight hundred years ( 7111492 ) , Christian kingdoms in Iberia waged on-again off-again war against Muslim caliphates . These wars were commonly known as the Reconquista ( Reconquest ) because Christians viewed their struggle as an attempt to conquer areas lost to Muslim conquests of the eighth century . The Reconquista ended in 1492 , when Ferdinand and Isabel , co-monarchs of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon , conquered the last caliphate . The simultaneous ending of the Reconquista and the discovery of the New World allowed for a seamless transition between the conquest of Iberia and conquest in the Americas . <p> Significantly , the men who fought to expand Spains territory in the Americas did so as private individuals , not as uniformed soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing army , Iberian monarchs commissioned individuals , often nobles or wealthy subjects , to raise " companies " of troops . Those who commanded companies of soldiers were promised rewards for successful campaigns that might include noble titles , tax exemptions , political office , or financial remuneration . For example , before setting out on his voyage , Columbus entered into a contractual agreement with Ferdinand and Isabel that stipulated the rewards he would receive for a successful venture . Similar agreements were made between successive prospective conquistadors and the monarchs . The kings of Spain did not finance these expeditions ; they promised future rewards for privately organized and funded campaigns . <p> Conquistadors organized themselves in companies that resembled modern business ventures more than military units . Individuals who joined a company were required to provide some material support to the campaign , and rewards for successful conquests were divided according to the initial investment of the members . The necessity of private financing also ensured that these companies were frequently composed of men of means . Few poor men became conquistadors ; most who participated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once in the Americas , the Caribbean served as a proving ground where conquistador companies developed methods that would help them better succeed in their intended conquests . These included the search for native allies , the acquisition of translators , the use of terrorism and the display of violence , and the search for precious metals . The Spanish quickly recognized that indigenous people would always outnumber them , and many expeditions learned to identify local conflicts that could be used to pit one indigenous group against another . In some instances , the cross-cultural dialogue used in these negotiations led Native Americans to ally themselves willingly with the Spanish . We can see many of these tactics in Benzonis narrative , and they would remain staples of Spanish conquest and colonial rule for centuries . <p> The Spanish conquest of the Americas proceeded slowly . Between 1492 and 1500 , Columbus undertook four voyages and explored the Greater and Lesser Antilles . Few colonists made the transatlantic journey in the fifteenth century , however . Before 1500 , most settlement occurred on the island of Hispaniola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the newly appointed royal governor , Nicols de Ovando , arrived with several thousand settlers . By 1510 , conquest companies had begun to expand into the greater Caribbean . From Hispaniola , expansion took two paths . The first expanded west to Cuba , Jamaica , and eventually the mainland of Mexico and Central America . The second , the path Benzoni followed , expanded east and south to the Lesser Antilles , the northern coastline of South America , Panama , the Pacific , and eventually Peru . Spanish expansion did not merely seek new territory . Rather , conquistadors sought areas with large numbers of Native Americans . Consequently , these two paths of expansion skipped over many areas . Most of the small islands of the Caribbean ( e.g. , Dominica , Saint Kitts , Grenada ) were explored but not conquered during this period because they were sparsely populated and lacked precious resources . Major conquests during this period included Puerto Rico ( 1508 ) , Jamaica ( 1509 ) , Panama ( 1510 ) , and Cuba ( 1511 ) . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding translators , recruiting native allies , and using displays of violence to forge Spanish-native alliances that would ultimately topple the Aztec Empire . A decade later , between 1532 and 1537 , Gonzalo Pizarro used similar practices to conquer much of the Inca Empire . <p> Spanish America During Benzonis Travels ( 15411556 ) <p> The publication in Europe of accounts detailing the conquests had increased the pace of immigration to the Americas even as new conquests continued to expand Spanish territorial control . From Mexico , campaigns pushed into northern Mexico ( 1530s50s ) , Guatemala ( 1520s ) and Central America , and eventually Florida ( 1565 ) . From Peru , conquests expanded south into Chile ( 1541 ) and north into Ecuador ( 1535 ) and Colombia ( 1537 ) . During this time , previously overlooked areas received attention , as new arrivals looked to profit from the spoils of conquest . Parts of northern South America were settled as explorers discovered pearl fisheries and gold deposits . Atlantic exploration led to the settlement of Buenos Aires ( 1536 ) . From there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivia ( 1548 ) . <p> During Benzonis travels , major political changes would gradually slow the pace of conquest and seek to rein in the power of the conquistadors and early settlers . In most areas , the lead conquistador , or adelantado , became the first governor of conquered regions . As governors , adelantados were allowed to appoint other officials , grant lands , and collect taxes . Additionally , these conquistador-governors rewarded many of their soldiers with encomienda grants . Based on an older model from the Reconquest , encomiendas granted individual conquistadors the right to demand tribute and labor from specific indigenous communities . Over time , the Spanish monarchs worked to replace conquistador-governors with officials of their choosing . In some cases , accusations of malfeasance or the mistreatment of indigenous subjects served as a pretext for the appointment of new royal officials . In most cases , the transitions went smoothly , but on occasion , the attempt to assert royal authority could lead to civil war . In 1544 , following the appointment of new officials and the promulgation of new legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquistadors of Peru rose up in rebellion , killing the newly arrived viceroy . <p> Although Benzoni arrived after the major conquests of Mexico and Peru , he was present during a crucial period in Spanish American history . Established regions were transitioning from frontier settlements to major urban centers . New conquests expanded the frontier into previously uncharted territory . Politically , the region became more centralized , as royal authority sought to establish new , uniform systems of government . Benzonis writing provides a unique vista into the diversity of experience during this turbulent period . <p> Native Americans Before and After Conquest <p> Like many other early chroniclers of the Americas , Benzoni recorded a great deal of information about Native Americans . Although most Europeans called indigenous residents of the Americas indios , in the mistaken belief that Columbus had discovered India/Asia , among indios there existed a huge diversity of culture . In some areas , like Mesoamerica and the Andes , Native Americans practiced agriculture and lived in large urban settlements . In other regions , especially the Caribbean islands and northern South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often agriculturalists , the settlement pattern in these regions was more dispersed , and communities could range from several dozen households to several thousand people . The social and cultural diversity of Native Americans played an important role in their interaction with Spaniards and Spanish colonialism . In all areas , Spaniards sought to negotiate with local leaders and identify local rivalries . Through these contacts , Spaniards gained vital information about the human landscape . In some instances , this process led native groups to accept Spanish authority without open conflict . In other cases , initial contact led to hostilities . <p> Conquistadors viewed indios as sources of labor and tribute . Through the use of the encomienda , individual Spaniards were allowed to demand laboroften for the mining of precious metalsand tribute from native subjects . In imposing the burdens of tribute and forced labor , the Spanish frequently exempted indigenous elites , especially caciques ( local rulers ) . This practice helped to forge ties between the indigenous elites and the Spanish , ties that were sometimes furthered through marriage when conquistadors married the daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that began in the Caribbean expanded to the mainland . Among the more populous and urban societies of Mesoamerica and the Andes , however , the imposition of Spanish authority frequently benefited from existing social and political structures . Consequently , Spanish colonialism appropriated rather than replaced existing forms of imperial control in those areas . As in the Caribbean , preferential status was given to local elites to help facilitate the transition from pre-Columbian empires to Spanish imperialism . <p> Almost immediately , the Spaniards who held encomienda grants were criticized for their abuse of indigenous subjects , the most vocal opposition coming from Spanish clergymen . In 1511 , Antonio de Montesino , a Dominican friar , preached an impassioned sermon that criticized the residents of Santo Domingo for their mistreatment of indigenous subjects . " Tell me , " he challenged them , " what right have you to enslave them ? What authority did you use to make war against them who lived at peace on their territories , killing them cruelly with methods never before heard of ? Are n't  they human beings ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest assured that you are in no better state of salvation than the Moors or the Turks who reject the Christian faith . " The sermon sparked outrage among the early settlers ; some complained to the king and queen . Incensed by the settlers actions , the monarchs sided with Montesino and issued the first laws regulating the exploitation of Native Americans , the Laws of Burgos ( 1512 ) . Although these laws sought to restrict the rampant exploitation of Native Americans , such abuse continued , especially in newly conquered areas and fringe zones . By the 1540s , the continued abuse of native subjects , combined with the desire to limit the power of settlers , led the monarchy to issue a more expansive set of laws to protect Native Americans . The New Laws ( 1542 ) banned the enslavement and conscription to mines of indios and outlawed the inheritance of encomienda grants , among other provisions . <p> Over the course of the sixteenth century , royal legislation gradually created a unique legal and political sphere for indigenous subjects . Although indios were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and ecclesiastical offices , they were also considered special subjects of the king and were granted many rights denied to other non-Spanish groups , such as Africans and people of mixed race . Native communities were allowed self-governance , exemption from the Inquisition , and special royal officials to protect their interests and investigate abuses . Benzonis writings provide glimpses into the complex relationship between Spaniards and Native Americans and help illustrate the disjuncture between legal norms and everyday practices . <p> Just as Spanish law reacted to the abuses of indigenous subjects , intellectuals continued to debate the issues raised by Antonio de Montesino in 1511 . In 1551 , BartolomT de Las Casas met with Juan de Seplveda , a humanist scholar who specialized in ancient Greek philosophy , in the Spanish city of Valladolid to discuss the viability of Indian self-rule . Seplveda used Aristotle and the Bible to argue that the Indians were natural slaves ; Las Casas responded , using the same sources , that the indigenous were free men entitled to humane treatment . Though the debate was theoretical and brought no immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe about the treatment of indigenous people . Some scholars argue that the debate at Valladolid set the stage for later anticolonial thought . <p> The first edition of Benzonis Historia came out not long after the Valladolid debate and contributed to a growing European awareness of the atrocities committed under colonial expansion . Moreover , the interest in the emancipation and rights of non-Europeans did not end with the abuse of Native Americans . Abolition movements would become quite popular in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , mobilizing similar arguments about Africans humanity . The sensational atrocities of the Spanish certainly contributed to the monumental sales of Benzoni and Las Casas , and their firsthand accounts of the mistreatment of Indians probably fed antislavery sentiments . <p> Although Benzoni frequently sides with Native Americans against what he perceives ( or at least portrays ) as the savage Spanish , cannibalism is a recurring theme in his History . The attribution of cannibalism to some Native American groups began almost as soon as the Spanish arrived in the Caribbean . This accusation served the interest of Spanish conquistadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be dealt with more harshly . When legislation began to limit the enslavement of native peoples , exceptions were made for cannibals . In the early colonization of the Caribbean , these distinctions were mapped onto the ethnic markers applied to indigenous groups . Caribs were labeled cannibals and subjected to enslavement , while Aruacas ( Arawaks ) were not cannibals and therefore enjoyed legal protections . Significantly , this early distinction between " good " and " bad " indios , a view clearly perpetuated by Benzonis History , had lasting consequences in obscuring the cultural landscape of the early Americas . <p> In the pages that follow , the reader is carried along on a journey of discovery , adventure , and at times political intrigue . Benzonis rich descriptions capture the Spanish colonial world during a unique moment , poised between initial conquests and colonial maturity . We are given glimpses of unexplored frontiers and bustling port cities , wild jungles and burgeoning plantations , unconquered Indians and rebellious African slaves . Ultimately , The History of the New World was a massive success , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while grounding itself in the politics and culture of the Old . <p> Notes on the Translation <p> Every translation necessarily involves some interpretation , and this one is no exception . We have omitted various segments of Benzonis narrative , in part to keep the text a manageable length . Mostly , we cut long and repetitive accounts rehashing earlier conquistadors exploits that add little to Benzonis tale ; we note these expunctions in the footnotes . The abridgement remains faithful to Benzonis overall narrative and its focus on his travels and firsthand experiences . We chose to translate the second edition , published by Piero and Franceso Tini in 1572 . There are few substantive differences between the 1565 and 1572 editions , but the latter had a much larger run . It is thus not only the edition that most early moderns would have read but the one most accessible to modern scholars . <p> Benzoni wrote in vernacular Italian and generally used Italian names in his text . We have rendered these names in their appropriate languages : usually Spanish , some French , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his turn as a lexicographer and lists the local words , we have generally left them as he wrote them ; these words appear italicized in the text . Benzoni used signori , an Italian title of respect for men equivalent to the English gentlemen , to refer to indigenous rulers . This parallels the Spanish use of seores for such individuals . In the text , signori has been translated as lords to match the Spanish convention . Benzoni also used the idiomatic Mori ( Moors ) , in reference to all Africans and people of African descent in the New World , regardless of their actual place of origin . His use of the term is equivalent to the modern use of black . Finally , Benzoni uses some measurements that are no longer in standard use . We have left these in the text and explained them in the notes . <p> Benzoni was not a gifted writer . As the reader will see , the finer points of metaphor , well-placed adjectives , and a clever turn of phrase never interrupt his narrative . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sadly , this devotion to the story at the expense of literary niceties makes his work less clear than one might hope . At times , clarity is obscured by Benzonis firm belief that a series of subordinate clauses constitutes a sentence , and by his reliance on completely idiosyncratic vocabulary . In places , we have radically altered his sentence structure , replaced pronouns with proper nouns and vice versa , and added verbs for the purpose of clarity . The aim has been to preserve his meaning and tone while rendering the text more readable .

This book is about such a period of change and remaking : the decades following the citys capture by the Ottomans in 1453 , during which a grandly conceived urban project was implemented to reconstruct the capital of Eastern Rome as the capital of the Ottoman Empire . Through these decades , the construction of the city was fundamentally interlocked with the construction of empire . As the empire was built up around reorientations political and cultural and the creation of a new concept of sovereignty and a new ruling elite , so the space and image of Constantinople , too , were constructed .

Situated between the Byzantine , Latin , and Ottoman worlds , ghazi ( Islamic frontier-warrior ) and imperial ideologies , the city became a physical and symbolical site upon which contrasting visions and perceptions would be projected , where cultural meanings would be contested , negotiated , and remade . <p> This was a time , largely erased as it was from Istanbuls later histories and documents , when a marble relief of the Byzantine eagle marked the monumental portal of the newly built commercial center , when city views meant to represent either Byzantine or Ottoman Constantinople conspicuously displayed symbols of the other , when a man by the name of Mustafa son of Yanni lived in a quarter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saints Church " ) and the neighborhood of the Mevlana Husrev masjid .

Hence Barthess slash transposed to the space between Constantinopolis and Istanbul , where it will serve as the mirroring edge against which the citys many selves are defined , imagined , represented . For if history and topography render this a site whose multiple selves will perpetually face , mirror , confront , and define each other across time and across social and physical space , these attributes assume particular import through the period with which this book concerns itself . <p> 1453 and After <p> It may not be wrong to assume that the huge army that laid siege to Constantinople in 1453 included the whole spectrum of Ottoman polity of the later fifteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultan , grandees of Balkan and Byzantine aristocratic origin , an army of converted Christian recruits , a landed aristocracy that had constituted the ruling elite of the state until and into the reign of Mehmed II , frontier warlords and their retinues of ghazis , dervishes , recent converts , and those uprooted in the tumultuous atmosphere of late medieval Anatolia and the Balkans . The two major factions within this wide spectrum were the builders of the sedentary state and the soldiers of the frontier , whose power and dynamism were based on the semi-independence of their political and military conduct . To the former , Constantinople was the natural locus of power ; ruling from the city would make the House of Osman the foremost ghazis within the realm of Islam and simultaneously inheritors of the legacy of Eastern Rome . To the latter , Constantinople was no more than a particularly prestigious object of war and conquest ; the significance of its takeover lay in the erasure of an inauspicious Byzantine presence in the midst of Muslim territory . Hence , Mehmed IIs declaration , shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throne , and his first measures in restoring and repopulating it , marked the first steps in the final resolution of the tension between state building and unrestrained military activity on the frontiers : the rebuilding of the city was constitutive of the building of empire . In the process , the frontier ethos and its propagators , a foundational component of the Ottoman polity since its modest beginnings as a tiny principality in Bithynia a century and a half before , would be marginalized within the Ottoman political spectrum , ceding to an increasingly pivotal center and its agents . <p> The figure of Mehmed II ( r. 14511481 ) looms large over the Ottoman world of the fifteenth century . He was the motor force behind the cultural and political reorientations and transformations that took place in the Ottoman realm and the restructuring of the administrative apparatus that followed the conquest of Constantinople . His realization of an ancient dream of the Islamic realm earned him the title ebul-feth , " father of conquest .

The primary and persistent motive that shaped Mehmed IIs rule was creation of a world empire governed from Constantinople by a centralized administrative apparatus . To that end , he diminished the power of the landed aristocracy and of the frontier lords , replacing them with a new military-administrative elite of devsirme ( Christians conscripted for service in the palace or the army ) and a larger janissary army . In an effort to centralize the learned establishment and to endow it with a hierarchical structure , he founded the Eight Colleges ( Semaniye ) as part of his new mosque complex in the new capital ; here learned men ( ulema ) of the highest rank would be educated .

A kanunname ( law code ) , written after 1477 captured and encoded for subsequent generations of Ottomans the imperial ideology and practice that were elaborated throughout Mehmed IIs reign ; in particular , it defined and detailed the structure of the administrative , military , and religious hierarchies and sanctioned imperial seclusion and the custom of royal fratricide . <p> Imperial claims brought new notions of cultural patronage , through which the Ottoman world embraced the high cultural traditions with which it had come into contact .

Conquest and consolidation effected cultural encounters , which in turn gave shape to the dynamic eclecticism and inclusivism characteristic of the fifteenth-century Ottoman world in general and Ottoman court culture in particular . <p> The Byzantine capital was in a ruinous state at the time of its fall . Stripped of its hinterland by the Ottoman expansion of the previous century , impoverished by successive Ottoman sieges of the preceding decades , it is estimated to have housed forty to fifty thousand people in its vast expanse .

Reconstruction entailed repopulation : invitations to the city and grants of property , as well as forced resettlement of Muslim , Christian , and Jewish communities from other parts of the Ottoman realm , aimed at the creation of a thriving cosmopolitan capital . <p> The Historiography of Conquest and Construction <p> The fall/conquest of Constantinople added a new set of narratives to the rich constellation of histories , myths , and memories that have , over centuries , interpreted the city and its past , making them intelligible to a diverse spectrum of audiences . The political and cultural consequences of the final demise of the Byzantine Empire have rendered the citys " fall " or " conquest " an enormously charged topic in Byzantine , Ottoman , and Western cultural traditions alike . Texts originating in these milieus , in separate veins but at times merging with each other , have told and retold the stories of this important moment in the life of the city . Encapsulated in the emotional charge of the words " fall " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Constantinople is a complex of perceptions and visions concerning the city and the realm to which it belongs . <p> Whether to lament the fall of the city or to celebrate its long-desired capture , historical accounts of this period focus largely on the momentous events of spring 1453 , detailing episodes and moments of the siege , the capture , the sack . Ottoman chronicles written from the later fifteenth century onward , whether narrating the history of the dynasty or events of the reign of Mehmed II , have summary or detailed sections on Mehmeds efforts to rebuild and repopulate Constantinople . They narrate the sultans order to his grandees to undertake constructions of public and private buildings in Constantinople , and they report also on the grand viziers constructions . These accounts , full of praise for the sultans enormous endeavor , constitute the first examples of the Ottoman historical narrative that asserts that Istanbul owed its rebirth and its subsequent prosperity as the Ottoman capital to Mehmed II . The early-sixteenth-century historian Nesri presents this position succinctly : " In short , Sultan Mehmed Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that travelers today say there is no city like it in the universe. " Some decades later Sadnddin described how the city became an abode where innumerable people lived and worked comfortably under the peace-giving shadow of the sultan . In the seventeenth century , Evliya elebi , when detailing the deportation of communities to the capital , wrote of Mehmed IIs Constantinople as the wealthy , thriving city he was proud to inhabit . Tracing these narratives through time reveals also the steps in the making of a myth : a century after Evliya elebi , Hafiz Hnseyin al-Ayvansarayi , writing his Hadikatnl Cevami ( Garden of Mosques ) , attributed a large number of quarter mosques to those who had partaken in the 1453 siege , thereby inscribing stories of the conquest onto the space of the city . ( Ayvansarayis partly false attributions , in turn , figure prominently in most modern accounts of the early Ottoman city . ) <p> The writings of contemporary and later authors no doubt attest to the grand enterprise of the sultan in the rebuilding and repopulation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only accounts dealing with the subject . Narratives originating from the milieu of frontier warriors , who were increasingly marginalized by the new state , tell a strongly contrasting tale of Constantinoples reconstruction . The authors and audiences of those texts understood only too well that the move from the former capital Edirne to Constantinople was part of a centralizing policy and that empire building was its corollary . Their strong opposition to both is clearly manifested in historical narratives such as the anonymous Tevarig-i Al-i Osman ( chronicles of the House of Osman ) , which portray the sultans attempts to restore and revitalize the city as markedly less successful than those depicted in narratives originating from the " center " : " Even a sultan like Mehmed restored it with difficulty in three , four years , and so many parts of it are still in ruins . " The objection to the rebuilding itself is wonderfully demonstrated in a text completed ca. 1474 , that is , after the most intense period of building activity in the new capital was already over . An imaginary conversation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city captures the sense of exasperation prompted by the sultans urban venture . The commanders warn the ruler : " Because of adultery and sodomy and lewdness and debauchery , black waters emerged from its ground at night , and it remained ruinous . . . . If you rebuild this city , it will destroy the world , and you will be the cause of this destruction . It will never flourish . However many times you build it , it will fall back into ruin again . " <p> These narratives are of documentary as well as historiographic value . On the one hand , they provide insights into the contrasting and competing meanings of Constantinople within the fifteenth-century Ottoman world , meanings to which I return in the following chapters . On the other hand , they provide insights into the making of the citys Ottoman and , later , modern Turkish history . While the accounts that narrated the conquest and the subsequent restoration of the city as tales of glory remained central in the historiography of the dynasty and of the city , those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voiced objections to its status as Ottoman capital were either marginalized or domesticated into mainstream accounts . These texts are reminders that Mehmed IIs grand urban project was realized only with the estrangement and marginalization of many , at huge costs to Ottoman subjects and treasury alike . Not surprisingly , it was the former picture , not the latter , that survived the passage of time . <p> New images of the Conqueror and the Conquest were fabricated in the later nineteenth century , when Ottoman intellectuals revisited court chronicles and the complex of narratives on Mehmed II and his spiritual , political , and military companions in popular histories , hagiographies , and topographic accounts . At a time when ( control over ) imperial territory eroded , with the Ottoman elite compelled to respond to a rapidly changing political and ideological landscape , emergent modes of historicist thinking offered Ottoman intellectuals a new framework for imagining and representing the imperial past . In the writings of Namik Kemal , one of the prominent intellectuals of the Ottoman nineteenth century , the golden age of Ottoman rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , was re-created , its zenith marked by the conquest of Constantinople . In articulating notions of nationhood ( millet ) and fatherland ( vatan ) to become the building blocks of an emerging nationalist imagination tightly anchored to notions of dynastic continuity , Kemal endowed Mehmed II , who had occupied a central place in Ottoman historiography , with new significance . Now referred to as the Conqueror ( Fatih ) , he became the ultimate symbol of an age of glory , a bygone era of conquests summoned to stand in stark contrast to a present of losses . More significantly , Istanbul , the city , and 1453 , the date , provided spatial and temporal anchor points to the inchoate ethos of nationhood , since the conquest was now a chapter in the history of the Ottoman millet , and the city was the center of the territorial entity it inhabited . The conquest marked an honorable beginning , that of Ottoman ( " national " ) history as history of empire . <p> " One rarely searches for beginnings unless the present matters a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotional need for unity underlies the quest for beginnings , for the beginning provides sequential , moral , or logical order to an otherwise diffuse set of circumstances . The promise of unity and cohesiveness embodied in the idea of the beginning , in turn , works to fix and theologize knowledge , whereby the beginning , ceding its place to that which it gave rise to , assumes virtuality . Saids " meditation on beginnings " may help explain the continued import of the Conqueror and the Conquest in modern Turkish historiography , once they were salvaged from the pages of manuscripts and rendered part of a " national " historical narrative . A large body of literature on the subject has been produced from the last decades of the nineteenth century onward , with significant additions around 1953 , when the five hundredth anniversary of the conquest of Constantinople provided opportunity for celebration for those riding on an ascending wave of nationalism . The program of commemorations included publication of studies , as well as editions and facsimiles of numerous fifteenth-century literary and historical works . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its associations as an increasingly crucial , at times fetishized , symbol for strands of nationalism within the Turkish political spectrum . During the last decade of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first , the Conqueror and the Conquest have become subjects of contestation in a polarized political landscape whose diverse constituents have ( mostly ) different claims on the Ottoman past . The debate has brought into sharper focus what are ostensibly contradictory aspects of the Conquerors character and conduct . An anachronistic and exclusionary nationalism and religious zeal and an equally anachronistic progressivism are by turns attributed to Mehmed II : to some , the Conqueror is the foremost warrior of Islam , who captured and converted into a Muslim and Turkish city the heart of Eastern Christendom ; to others , he is a Renaissance prince in Ottoman garb , an enlightened , progressive , European-oriented ruler . <p> What I broadly outline here is the process by which the conqueror and the conquest were constructed as sites of memory central to Ottoman and , later , modern Turkish historical consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a differently constructed site of memory to Greek historical imagination ) should be a subject of scrutiny in itself . My sketch , however , has a different aim : to highlight the ways in which the process of construction following 1453 is represented in the modern historiography of the city . For the writing on this period and on its foremost figure has shaped and colored the ways in which modern scholarship has approached the city , as it has the ways in which modern urbanism and urban conservation have interpreted and treated the remains of this period . While the majestic figure of the conqueror came to overshadow everything else in the fifteenth century , the image of his Istanbul as the glamorously built capital was reinforced . Little attention was given to other histories or to documents that would complicate the narratives of Istanbuls reconstruction , revealing ( instead of overlooking ) the complexities and the chaotic aspects of that process . <p> While this overview has focused on the historiography of conquest and reconstruction in Ottoman and modern Turkish scholarship , it should be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn by orientalist and nationalist legacies , bear on Western scholarship on Byzantine as well as Ottoman cultural history in comparable ways . Turkish and Western scholarship alike have largely abided by widely accepted geographic ( Middle Eastern versus Western ) , religio-cultural ( Islamic versus Christian ) , and nominally dynastic but in effect ethno-religious ( Ottoman versus Byzantine ) divides , which have in turn tended to obfuscate connections across those categorizations or hindered the use of alternative frameworks . In one of the fascinating spatiotemporal constructions of modern historiography ( effected also , but not only , by a history of conflict and coexistence of two world religions in this complex cultural landscape ) , Constantinople , as it were , abandons its Roman ( read Western ) context on 29 May 1453 and becomes part of a different geography : the Islamic , or the Middle Eastern , world . This year has thus constituted a neat and precise dividing line in scholarship on the city , seldom crossed , incontrovertibly separating the " Byzantine " and the " Ottoman " domains . Questions regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fallen into the trap of a loaded debate of " influences , " rendering it difficult , if not impossible , to understand the products of a complex cultural environment marked with interactions , fluidity , and hybridity . Likewise , questions regarding connections between Ottoman and Byzantine urbanistic practice have seldom drawn interest . Recent cultural history has been altering this picture of insular fields and particularistic approaches , introducing important insights into shared histories and cultural contacts and interrelationships across the larger medieval and early modern worlds . <p> The fifteenth century figures prominently in several studies of Ottoman architectural history . The bibliography and references of the present study will make apparent the important ground covered by earlier scholarship on the topic . The construal of Ottoman architecture of the later fifteenth century in these works once more evokes Saids observations in his Beginnings . Under the spell of Ottoman Istanbuls classical image , which largely took shape in the second half of the sixteenth century , modern scholarship has tended to understand the citys premodern urban and architectural history as a continuum , regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception and design , as the first steps in a linear and evolutionary scheme that culminated in the grand projects of a later era of magnificence . Despite a strong current of continuity in the Ottoman architectural tradition , a focus on the evolutionary dimension of that history obscures significant aspects of fifteenth-century Istanbul and its architecture that had more to do with the complex cultural dynamics of the era than with any future traditions to which they gave rise . <p> Within the framework of urban historyor , more precisely , the vaguely defined area within urban history that concerns itself with aspects of urban spatiality and visualityOttoman Istanbul has often been lodged either on the " organic " or the " Islamic " side of dichotomous and mutually exclusive categorizations . The Islamic city model , a product of orientalist scholarship largely based on an essentialist understanding of Islam as the foremost determinant of urban culture in the Middle East , has been the subject of an extensive debate from the 1950s onward . The writing on urban history from the 1990s onward has covered considerable ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence problematizing the essentialist aspects of the model , if not doing away with it altogether . Where Ottoman studies are concerned , a somewhat different picture emerges . Created and elaborated by scholars of the medieval Islamic world , the Islamic city paradigm ( based in turn on Weberian urban theory , which relied heavily on definitions of the city in medieval Europe ) could never embrace early modern Istanbul as comfortably as it did medieval Aleppo or Fez . Scholarship on Ottoman history , in its turn , has until recently proved itself rather disinterested in historical processes connecting , or dividing , the larger Islamic world . Tacit acceptance of received opinion , then , rather than attempts to create or apply models , has at times led scholars to the Islamic city model for interpreting the shape and the structures of the Ottoman capital . <p> It might be useful to regard the organic and the Islamic city models together in terms of their bearing on the study of Ottoman urbanism , although these represent distinct lines of inquiry in urban history . For where spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geometric principle ordering the urban environment , a geometry regarded as a constitutive aspect of Western urbanism by virtue of the mark it has left on cities of the Greco-Roman , Renaissance , and post-Renaissance eras . The absence of a geometric principle shaping the city , in turn , has been read as an indicator of spontaneous development of urban structures , whereby builders possess neither the will nor the ability to premeditate on a grand scale the formal , functional , and symbolical implications of their interventions in the cityscape . Recent work has brought important changes to this picture . The organic city paradigm has been divorced from the presumption of spontaneity , while work on Ottoman cities has explored alternate ways in which urban configurations took shape , acquired and manifested meaning . <p> This Study <p> Alongside nationalist historiographies or equally rigid civilizational divides , the mere absence of an in-depth study on the topic , too , accounts for the obscurity of important aspects of Istanbuls first Ottoman decades . It is one of the objectives of this book to fill this gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this era , highlighting the complexity of the urban process that transformed Constantinople and the hybridity of its spaces and images . I construe the Ottoman capital city as the product of a range of encounters , dialogues , and oppositions between different actors within the Ottoman realm as well as between the Ottomans , Byzantium , and the West . Beyond that immediate locus , interconnections , parallelisms , and incongruities in the emerging early modern world ( of which the Ottomans were part ) constitute a parallel theme in my exploration of urbanistic trends in fifteenth-century Istanbul . Investigating aspects of urban spatiality and visuality beyond strict categorizations of planned and unplanned , and stepping outside of the geometric paradigm within or against which urbanism has often been evaluated , this study aims to reveal the urbanistic notions at work in the ordering of Istanbuls urban environment during a formative period . The book delineates emerging urbanistic trends in Constantinople/Istanbul in their connections to the making of a new political structure , underscoring the ways in which the urban interventions of this era bear on the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , is placed on those aspects of the fifteenth-century city that were to be erased from its mainstream historiography . <p> This book focuses on the first three decades of Istanbuls Ottoman history . Three interrelated themes constitute its framework : monumentalization , representation , and inhabitation . Here , monumentalization refers to a building program that aimed to establish and communicate the citys new identity as the center of the Ottoman realm through the introduction of a new visual and spatial order to the urban environment . This new spatial and formal hierarchy , created through the construction of Ottoman monuments and the selective appropriation of Byzantine sites and monuments , in turn represented , accommodated , and engendered a new political and social order . Urban monuments , in this framework , were at once buildings intended to communicate a range of meanings to diverse audiences and sites that enabled their users to partake of the urban space and its practices . <p> By portraying , surveying , accentuating , and at times silencing symbolically significant sites or consequential events , the citys images projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites or events and the city at large . My exploration into modes and manners of representing the urban body extends to visual and literary images of Constantinople/Istanbul , as well as to archival documents such as imperial edicts or property surveys that offer insights into the cultural meanings bestowed on and projected by the city and its parts . A dialogic of representation is particularly pertinent to this subject : products of an era of political and cultural encounters and transformations , these images escape singular interpretations with clear and distinct meanings . Whether pictures , poems , chronicles , or epics , that is , whether iconic or narrative , they often convey a range of contrasting perceptions regarding their highly symbolic subject . My analysis aims to capture the plurality that constitutes the citys representations , for this offers an entry into the plurality that constitutes the city at large . <p> An inhabited city coexisted with that created through monuments and images . The citys commercial and residential fabric were woven from political and cultural processes that gave shape to these monuments and images as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that fabric and its interrelationship with the citys monumental structure and image are integral to an understanding of the larger urban process with which this book concerns itself . By looking into the formation and use of residential and commercial patterns and into the social , political , and institutional processes underlying these patterns , I delineate aspects of the immediate material environment of the citys inhabitants . At the same time , this inquiry into the formation of residential and commercial patterns reveals Ottoman notions of city and urbanity , informed by Islamic legal practices , on the one hand , and by newly articulated notions of spatial hierarchy , on the other . <p> I regard these the three main aspects of the making of the city , interrelated processes that reshaped its physical space and its image , investing both with new meanings . Inspired by Henri Lefebvres triad of the conceived , the represented , and the lived , whose dialectical relationship underlies the production of space , this conceptual framework provides the means for a synchronic exploration of the multiple processes that informed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ottoman Empire . While the main themes that underlie and structure my studymonumentalization , representation , inhabitationbroadly relate to Lefebvres triad , the correspondence is neither literal nor complete . My inquiry into the dialectics of the physical , the mental , and the social mediates an entry into an exploration of emerging modes of spatiality and visuality operative in a particular urban setting . <p> The primary sources of this studyhistories , epics , hagiographies , poetry , archival documents , and visual imagesconstitute repositories of data pertaining to the material environment of the fifteenth-century city and the social , political , and institutional processes that shaped its urban environment . These documents are simultaneously analyzed in this book as representations of Constantinople , providing insights into the attitudes , perceptions , and claims of the makers of those documents with regard to the city . <p> It is surely not coincidental that the later fifteenth century marks the first significant outburst of Ottoman historical writing , concerning both the history of the Ottoman dynasty from its humble beginnings and the contemporary history of the period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical consciousness in the era following the Timurid invasion of Anatolia , has suggested that the resolution of the interregnum subsequent to the Ottoman defeat and the emergence of a new configuration of power ( whereby the Ottomans were relegated to vassal status by their Timurid adversaries ) led the Ottomans to represent themselves in historical terms . The formation of a new cultural and political configuration under the reign of Mehmed II encouraged further articulation of an Ottoman historical consciousness . Significantly , three works exclusively on the reign of Mehmed II , in Greek , Persian , and Turkish by the order of their publication , were written in the 1470s and 1480s . The chronicles of Kritovoulos of Imbros , Muali , and Tursun Beg ( the first two presented to the sultan and the latter to his successor ) are detailed accounts of the period and constitute important sources of information on the events of the era as much as on the varied cultural and political attitudes and dispositions of those who partook in them . A more broadly scoped work on Ottoman history as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nisanci Mehmed Pasha , was completed in the final years of Mehmed IIs rule . <p> The end of Mehmed IIs reign , as separately observed by StTphane Yerasimos and Cemal Kafadar , brought forth a new era of reckoning , as Bayezid IIs policies made it possible to criticize Mehmeds often harsh measures aiming to build a centralized state . Anonymous chronicles of the House of Osman , as well as those by Uruc , Asikpasazade Dervis Ahmed , and Ruhi of Edirne , are products of this period , providing historical accounts of the Ottoman experience of the previous two centuries while simultaneously articulating and manifesting reactions to Mehmeds rule . The House of Osman , in turn , produced its own versions of the consequential events of these decades : works commissioned by Bayezid II , most notably Idris Bidlisis Hest behist , in Persian ( " Eight Paradises , " referring to the rules of the eight Ottoman sultans up to Bayezid II ) , but also Kivamis Fetihname-i Sultan Mehmed ( Book of Conquest of Sultan Mehmed ) , are histories dealing extensively with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious elite , also produced its first works around the turn of the sixteenth century . The Chronicles of the House of Osman by Ibn Kemal and the Cihannnma by Mevlana Mehmed Nesri are the early examples of this genre . Not surprisingly , the rebuilding of Constantinople and the endeavors of the Ottoman ruling elite in this regard received particular attention from the authors of these chronicles . <p> Fifteenth- and early-sixteenth-century Greek historical writings , as exemplified by the chronicles of Doukas , Sphrantzes , and a number of anonymous authors , constitute important sources on the era and provide significant , if summary , information on the city subsequent to its fall . European visitors to and captives in the Ottoman court who wrote accounts of their stays following their return to the WestGiovan Maria Angiolello , Giovanni Antonio Menavino , Georgius of Hungary among themoffer important information and complementary views . <p> In the decades following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and the decision to make it the Ottoman capital , authors belonging to diverse segments of Ottoman society and with different attitudes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating the city , its past , and its significant sites . The Patria , a collection of Greek texts on the history and monuments of Constantinople , was partially translated , upon a royal commission , into Persian ( and eventually into Turkish ) . The citys myriad stories , translated , adapted , and appropriated to varying ends from medieval Greek and Arabic literature , figured in anonymous chronicles and in such compilations of late medieval lore as Dnrr-i Meknun and the Saltukname ( an epic of Ottoman expansion in the Balkans compiled in the 1470s ) . Hagiographies of figures as diverse as the grand vizier Mahmud Pasha , the heterodox ( and to Ottoman authorities highly troublesome ) Sufi leader Otman Baba , and the Sufi scholar Aksemseddin ( spiritual guide to Mehmed II during the siege of Constantinople ) are other literary products in which the city figures as setting to a variety of narratives representing and interpreting newly emerging social and political configurations . During the same period the city and its spaces entered the realm of Ottoman poetry , in which are apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented to its Ottoman audiences across the following centuries . Belonging to a different strand of literary production are the earliest biographical dictionaries of Ottoman poets and scholars : those by Latifi and Sehi Beg , as well as Taskprizades Sakaikul-Numaniyye , although works of the middle decades of the sixteenth century , are rich with information on the networks and settings of intellectual activity in fifteenth-century Istanbul . <p> The fifteenth century lacks the rich mines of archival documentation , such as court records and mnhimme registers ( compilations of imperial edicts and decrees ) , available to students of later Ottoman urban history . Among the available archival sources that deal with the builders , inhabitants , and buildings of the city during this period are unbound imperial edicts , surveys of urban property , sales and ownership documents , and the deeds and account books of pious endowments . The most voluminous among these are the documents related to pious endowments : individual waqfiyyas ( endowment deeds ) and citywide surveys of endowed property , which provide significant information on the citys physical and social makeup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in the making of residential and commercial areas . These documents make possible a partial mapping of the citys social and built fabric ; they simultaneously provide valuable insights into notions shaping the conceptualization and organization of urban life . <p> Chapter 1 focuses on the first years following the conquest ( 145359 ) . Although Constantinople was declared the capital of the Ottoman realm upon its capture , it was only in the 1460s that this decision was fully implemented . The initial Ottoman interventions in the cityscape following 1453 were responses to immediate concerns and needs , rather than parts of a larger project . Reflecting the sultans decision to rebuild the city on a vast scale and endowing it with some of its powerful symbols , the projects of these years of orientation and reorientation simultaneously betray a lack of clarity regarding the status of the city and the possibilities offered by its topography . The conflict between the former Ottoman order , defined by largely centrifugal forces , and the newly emerging political configuration , shaped by a centralizing vision , found reflection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main Ottoman interventions in the Constantinopolitan cityscape through these years , highlighting at once the projects that were to be subsequently marginalized and those that were to leave a permanent mark on the city . <p> The second chapter , " Constructing the City , " focuses on the monumentalization of urban space in its artistic , cultural , political , and social dimensions . It takes as its starting point Mehmeds announcement in 1459 of a new campaign in rebuilding the capital and his order to members of the ruling elite to undertake constructions in the city alongside him . Three sections structure this discussion , the first devoted to the royal project , the second to the architectural patronage of the new ruling elite , and the third to an overall assessment of major Ottoman interventions in the cityscape . The architectural works constructed in response to Mehmeds decree are evaluated as a collective enterprise of the ruling body to create the imperial capital . Here , I delineate those aspects of the architectural projects that link them to each other and justify their study as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their functions , architectural style , relationship to the urban environment , and their roles as centers of further urban development . Central to this discussion is the interaction between the Byzantine and Ottoman urban and architectural traditions , on the one hand , and the Renaissance ideas of ordering the urban environment , on the other . <p> The third chapter turns to representations of Constantinople/Istanbul . As the space of the city was transformed through a large-scale urban project that had its roots in Ottoman , Byzantine , and Italian urban practices , the citys image , too , was remade , to represent the Ottoman capital as it emerged at the end of Mehmeds rule . The views of the city in the numerous manuscripts of Liber Insularum Archipelagi of Cristoforo Buondelmonti , produced throughout the latter half of the fifteenth century , the Vavassore map , which is a copy of an earlier drawing dating from ca. 1480 , and the image in Hartmann Schedels Liber Chronicarum of 1493 are analyzed in the context of the changing cultural meaning of the city concomitant with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later-fifteenth-century Ottoman sources are analyzed as textual counterparts to the visual images . I discuss the intent and meaning of these representations , situating them in their cultural and political milieus of production and use . In light of the complexities of their representational modes and content , the ambiguity and polysemy they embody , I discuss transformations in the cultural identity and meaning of the city . <p> The fourth chapter explores another main theme of the study , urban space as inhabited . Here , I return to the physical space of the city , its buildings , and the primary sources treating them , now to map out a residential topography of the new capital and to delineate its relationship to the citys monumental order . I begin with a focus on the organizing principles of the archival documents relevant to the topic and the representational strategies manifest in them . Close reading of this documentation exposes ruptures between representations of the urban body and the practices that shaped it . This , in turn , sheds light at once on Ottoman concepts of urban structure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times overly literal readings of the documents in question . Delineating patterns in the formation of new neighborhood centers and in the patronage mechanisms involved in this process , I propose a revised residential map of the city . At the same time , by tracing the first steps in the formation of the citys residential structure , I demonstrate that this was a less straightforward process than has generally been assumed . I turn finally to the physical fabric of the residential areas , to the uses of Byzantine structures and new constructions , to reach an understanding of the tangible mass that surrounded a newly configured monumental layout . <p> The epilogue turns to the reigns of two successors of Mehmed , Bayezid II ( r. 14811512 ) and Selim I ( r. 151220 ) , providing an overview of Istanbul on the eve of a second major construction boom , led by Snleyman I , which endowed the city with its " classical " features . A celebrated image of Ottoman Istanbul , Matrakci Nasuhs view of ca. 1537 , mediates both a survey of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision that shaped it , leading to an exploration into the interrelationships between urban representation and urbanistic practice in the Ottoman world . Comparing Matrakcis image to earlier representations of the city discussed in the third chapter , I locate their differences in shifts in political and cultural orientations that marked the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries , and in concomitant changes in patronage patterns and sponsorship of urban institutions . This brief overview ( of another little-studied era in the history of Istanbul ) aims to buttress one of the theses of this study : through the first decades of Ottoman rule , the formal and conceptual foundations for Istanbuls later development were laid . But those decades also inscribed in the space of the city and in its images traces of the complex dynamics of an era when diverse cultural traditions encountered each other on a site of immense symbolic significance . By the time the Matrakci view was created , traces of that former era were in part obscured , as a more univalent imperial vision of the capital city was articulated .

And among the most talked about topics is talking itself : theories of deliberative democracy are colonizing the entire discipline . Hundreds of books have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various theories , each making an effort to find an uninhabited little island where some new theoretical development can get under way . The central principle of deliberative democracy can be summarized as follows : " At the heart of the deliberative conception of democracy is the view that collective decision-making is to proceed deliberativelyby citizens advancing proposals and defending them with considerations that others , who are themselves free and equal , can acknowledge as reasons " ( Cohen and Sabel 1997 , 327 ) . <p> However , what started as a theoretical enterprise to justify certain kinds of reasons and decision-making processes has now also captured the attention of institutional designers . Democrats who appreciate the value of deliberation in democratic decision-making routinely conjure technocratic tools to invigorate deliberation in democracy under the theoretically well established view that deliberation contributes to legitimacy . Since J&amp;uumlrgen Habermas ( 1996 ) promulgated the view that communicative power coming from the subjects of a regime may be one of the only sources for the legitimation of state power , communication and deliberation have become the focus of democrats interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard more loudly , providing a forum for the rulers to heed the informed views of the ruled . Accordingly , this book exercises institutional imagination ; it offers a reform proposal to begin the conversation about how we can better design our political institutions to conform to the aspirations of deliberative democracy , since the literature has been much more voluminous in theory than in practice . But let us take one step back before moving forward . &lt;P&gt; <p> What Is the I 'll for Which Deliberation Is the Cure ? &lt;P&gt; <p> While deliberation is the medicine many theorists and some general practitioners are willing to prescribe , the diagnosis of the current regime 's sickness is sometimes elusive . And if we do n't know the disease and its etiology , the cure and its own side effects and pathologies are really secondary . Lucky for us , the problem is usually rather inviting to deliberative democrats : our democracy is not deliberative enough . But we must say a bit more . &lt;P&gt; <p> There are a number of basic problems with our version of republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal of popular sovereignty in view . Generally , voters select among candidates with a bundle of policy commitments that can not be disentangled ; federal lawmaking in accordance with Article I , section 7 , of the United States Constitution leaves most bills losing steam prior to passage ; the committee system is vulnerable to manipulation ; divided government often renders legislatures impotent ; and the policies that are enacted are often selected by lawmakers for less than kosher reasons ( pork-barreling , rent-seeking , log-rolling , etc . ) . When voters take matters into their own hands through the initiative or referendum , they act out of ignorance or self-interest ( rational or not ) , under the influence of mass media campaigns that are often aimed to misinform ; and poor turnouts cast a further shadow of suspicion over electoral results ( especially when the poor and minorities are underrepresented or undercounted ) . Unfortunately , many democratic theorists are willing to accept these losses because they imagine that our democracy is pretty good anyway ; indeed , even voters who suffer the failures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't worth the effort to become more involved or informed . Or perhaps because they do not believe it would do any good.Yet it remains unclear how we can all stay sanguine about our version of democracy when its built-in limitations are so manifold and obvious . Participatory democratsthose who favor greater levels of political participationtend to justify their preferences by noting that broadened participation may ameliorate some of the defects associated with mass democracy : citizens can pool information and ideas , bring local knowledge to the table , establish greater levels of equality and political opportunity , and the like . But it is important to remember that these democrats do not take the power inequalities to be the primary problem : instead they would target for reform the process failures that foster and facilitate them . <p> To be sure , some efforts in structural reform have the aforementioned problems in view when they set their sights on a new vision for American democracy . Campaign finance reform proposals are , perhaps , salient examples of recent energies directed to alter the system of democracy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in service of the basic insight that if we get money out of politics , we can get a politics that is both more legitimate and less steered by the rich . The distortion of money can make democracy a joke ; the masses serve as the marionettes of money managers and make decisions that can not help but help the capitalists , who are very good at convincing others that their fate is wholly tied to the strength of the economy and , in turn , the strength of the capitalists . We all know who pulls the strings . <p> Proposals for consultation regimes , where policymakers and bureaucrats confer with the electorate to tailor their rulemaking to the needs of their constituency , are another common palliative for the sorts of problems described earlier . Policy planners often prescribe that administrators speak directly with the people in a nonthreatening environment to heed their concerns and maybe even change policy accordingly . Of course , those consulted are often self-selected repeat players who are rarely heeded . <p> There are even those who espouse a completely different decision-procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Whether it is a proposal for proportional representation , cumulative voting , or the proliferation of parties , there is no dearth of suggestions that American democracy could be made stronger by revamping political life as we know it . <p> On a smaller scale , the call for more local and accountable government is yet another version of a cure for the ills of mass democracy . Proponents of local government worry that citizens do not have enough input into decision-making processes and have little control over how their interests are represented . They also imagine that community concerns are more likely to be considered if the community can govern more consistently with its own values . <p> Each of these proposed republican reforms of government ( and of course a republican form of government is guaranteed by Article IV of the United States Constitution ) has a diagnosis that allows usin the felicitous phrase of Jon Elster ( 1998 , 10 ) to argue for arguing , to make an argument for why deliberation is well suited to the task of ameliorating the condition of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our democracy suffers a &lt;i&gt;legitimacy deficit&lt;/i&gt; : citizens are so remote from decision-making that the decisions rendered in their name can not be fairly imputed to them and their authorship . If this is indeed the problem , deliberative democracy may , after all , be a viable solution that encourages institutional redesign from within the general framework we already have in place . <p> &lt;P&gt;Let 's Get the Show on the Road&lt;P&gt; <p> This book starts by getting right down to the business of design . It proposes a fourth branch of government to make laws using randomly selected civic juries , wholly displacing the referendum and initiative systems as they exist today . I make my assumptions clear : where political autonomy is measured by the degree to which people can be said to be the authors of their own laws , deliberation by ordinary citizens helps the republican project of self-authorship . I also take for granted that face-to-face democracy has benefits that teledemocracy can never provide . I may be a Luddite , but I am fairly sure cyberspace is n't yet the place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delay in perceiving the emotions a face can convey . <p> I argue that the system of checks and balances remains unbalanced and that representative government is not well suited to the task of popular sovereignty . The people need a voice of their own , but referendums have failed to provide a reliable one . A fourth branchnot the media or the administrative agenciesis needed to get the people to speak in topically specified ways that are not distorted by money , expertise , or naked power . Deliberation is a value because it is a response to the distortions , but neither the legislature nor the judiciary is sufficiently deliberative to be the trustee of deliberative democracy . So we need a deliberative branchwhat I call the **26;1485;TOOLONG branchto do this work . The first chapter makes this argument , while also giving a summary of how to operationalize it . &lt;P&gt; <p> Here are some of the operations : There is a commission responsible for its administration , which has representatives from each of the parties as well as independents . There are ways for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get a question onto the popular agenda . And while the design is intended for the national political arena , there are corollary possibilities for any state or city system . <p> There is compulsory service , required to get a proper representative sample deliberating ; since each deliberative assembly of the branch could only accommodate 525 people , it is necessary to make sure the people are not subject to the voluntary response problem . I propose a decision procedure ( a supermajority requirement ) and an implementation stage , where the branch 's activities get absorbed into the separation of powers . These details help ensure that the popular branch , when it utters its decision , is actually reflective of a popular &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; , not merely a public opinion . <p> Chapter 1 also offers more details for the design . It explains how participants are to be selected ( random stratified sampling ) ; how we can be assured of citizen competence ( empirical work ) ; how we can moderate the pathologies of deliberative environments ( a design problem to be tackled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design ground rules for what people are allowed to say ( no gag rules ) ; whom we can put in the room to make sure discussion is well informed and civil ( federal judges or volunteers from the League of Women Voters ) ; and who gets to be considered stakeholders ( virtually everyone ) . Many of the details here are elaborations of James Fishkin 's work with Deliberative Polling , and I make the connections between the popular branch and Deliberative Polling explicit ( as well as exploring my deviations therefrom ) . <p> The second chapter is a theoretical one , explaining the model of deliberative democracy I use to support my proposal . It assumes certain legitimacy deficits in current republican democracy that deliberation is well suited to address . It takes the legitimacy problem developed from a respect for popular sovereignty as much more basic than the problems associated with power inequalities ; it is more interested in procedures than in ensuring fundamental rights . The argument here leaves to other branches the protection against the tyranny of the majority . Instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to heed in the first place . &lt;P&gt; <p> Since much of the institutionalization of the popular branch , however , hinges on how the separation of powers would function in this possible polity , the third and fourth chapters are devoted to this issue . Participatory democrats rarely give any attention to how popular deliberation can be institutionalized ; and when they institutionalize it , they invariably displace so many other governmental functions that the resulting regime is unrecognizable . Either they take the practices of deliberative democracy as they see them or propose unrealistic reforms . Deliberative assemblies can not do everything , but they also can not merely be in civil society without having a binding effect on the state : they need to be institutionalized as mechanisms of the state and be able to issue binding statements of popular will . Chapters 3 and 4 are poised to address the most difficult design question : how can a " popular " branch be integrated and coordinated with the representative presidentialist system we have now ? The reform proposal offered here is not meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is meant to provide a forum for revolutionary politics where higher lawmaking is possible ( even if most of the time the polity is satisfied with ordinary politics ) . <p> In Chapter 3 I start thinking through Arendt 's objections to Jefferson 's council system and the family resemblance of my proposal with his . I consider what my proposal might do to the two-party system . I make my way through similar ideas that the Progressives tried , offering the lack of attention to integration and the separation of powers as one reason for their failure . By arguing that the failure to institutionalize deliberative assemblies was sure to lead to their irrelevance , I lay the groundwork for Chapter 4. &lt;P&gt; <p> Chapter 4 offers the actual integration exercise . I take two policy proposals through the popular system , showing what the branch would look like in action . I discuss each traditional branch 's relationship to and authority over the popular branchand how the legislative , executive , or judiciary branches could try to mobilize it . Ultimately , after making my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tackle the question of judicial review of the work of the popular branch . Only then do I revisit the question of the party system and its potential integration into the branch 's activities . &lt;P&gt; <p> Chapters 5 and 6 are meant to deflect the suspicions that the first four chapters are sure to raise . They address such questions as : Why do I require a two-thirds " supermajority " to enact a law at the assemblies ? Why is n't half enough ? Are juries so reliable that we should depend upon them in the **30;1513;TOOLONG process ? What of the use of the jury analogy altogether ? Is n't there empirical evidence that controverts Fishkin , showing incompetence and inefficiency in actual practices of deliberation ? Do n't these deliberative assemblies , in a sense , force people to be free ? Is n't the use of coercion offensive to liberal republicans ? Could n't deliberative assemblies be corrupted , just like any easily targeted small group of decision-makers ? Should n't citizens have access to the goings-on of all deliberative assemblies and understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does n't the " value of publicity " demand the transparency of the procedure ? Would n't excessive secrecy shroud its legitimacy ? While these questions seem rather specific , many of the details of the proposalespecially details like compulsory servicerequire explicit rejoinders . Chapter 6 , on the jury and compulsory service , is an original contribution because so many theorists in the public policy literature pay too little attention to the voluntary response problem associated with most consultation regimes . Even institutional designers sensitive to the value of deliberation underestimate the need to have a truly representative sample culled for deliberationrepresenting even those who often prefer not to speak or volunteer their time for civic affairs . &lt;P&gt; <p> Finally , Chapter 7 , the conclusion of the design project , explores what role civil society ( that is , nongovernmental associations ) may play in setting the agenda for the deliberative publics . It explores how nondeliberative bodies will have to compete for opportunities to have their issues heard by a deliberative body such as the popular branch and makes an effort to show why civil society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from complete elite control . &lt;P&gt; <p> After discussing some theoretical work on the role of civil society in a deliberative democracy , I offer a number of ways that citizens in civil society ( those not selected for popular activities on a given subject ) could gain practical access to the political public sphere ( the popular branch ) . I offer a mild version of interest-group pluralism , where civil associations would garner signatures to get issues before the branch . I suggest that civil associations might get themselves on Yea/Nay committees organized to help present arguments to the deliberators in plenary sessions . I recommend a version of Bruce Ackerman 's ( 1993 ) " Patriot Proposal , " where every citizen would get fifty points to allocate funds to the civil associations of his or her choice . Concurrently , civil associations would be trying to win citizen points in and for media campaigns to influence the Yea/Nay committees . If successful , the committees would include their arguments in the pamphlet of materials the deliberators ultimately receive . I also suggest that candidates may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch ( which they do in states that make substantial use of the direct democracy procedures of the initiative and referendum ) , another way the general electorate could control the agenda of the popular branch . &lt;P&gt; <p> The epilogue very briefly sketches how activists interested in establishing a popular branch might help facilitate its birth ( and the rebirth of democracy ) . Obviously , a national constitutional amendment would probably be necessary for the version offered in the book to take effect . But the scope and jurisdiction of the proposal need not reform the entire country all at once : states and municipalities could first engage in a little " democratic experimentalism , " in the phrase of Dorf and Sabel ( 1998 ) , before the country adopted a national version of the proposal . &lt;P&gt; <p> Let us proceed to the proposal itself . I hope to demonstrate that my popular branch would not only ameliorate legitimacy deficits , but also ( if only obliquely ) help mitigate the problems associated with money in politics , political alienation , political ignorance , legislative deadlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individualism in mass democracy . While I do n't spend a lot of time explaining how the proposal forwards each of these advantages , I hope the reader will be able to keep these potentialities in view when considering the viability and desirability of the proposal .

There are lessons to be learned from the history of cooperative economic models that can be applied to future discussions about community economic development in communities of color . <p> What Is a Cooperative ? <p> Cooperatives are companies owned by the people who use their services . These member-owners form the company for a particular purpose : to satisfy an economic or social need , to provide a quality good or service ( one that the market is not adequately providing ) at an affordable price , or to create an economic structure to engage in needed production or facilitate more equal distribution to compensate for a market failure . The International Co-operative Alliance ( ICA ) , a nongovernmental trade association founded in 1895 to represent and serve cooperatives worldwide , defines a cooperative as " an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic , social , and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and **25;1545;TOOLONG enterprise " ( ICA 2012b ) . Cooperatives range across the globe from small-scale to multi-million-dollar businesses . There are more than one billion members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ICA , in 1994 the United Nations estimated that " the livelihood of nearly 3 billion people , or half of the worlds population , was made secure by co-operative enterprise " ( 2012a ) and the cooperative movement has continued to grow since then . Moreover , the United Nations designated the year 2012 " the international year of cooperatives , " with the theme " cooperative enterprises build a better world " ( UN 2011 ) , recognizing the viability of the model in addition to its widespread use . Although they were not a well-publicized economic structure before 2012 , cooperatives are a significant force in the world economy . Building on the successful year of cooperatives , the ICA and UN have now declared the following ten years to be the international decade of cooperatives . <p> Cooperatives are classified into three major categories , depending on the relationship between the member-owners and the co-ops purpose : consumer-owned , producer-owned , or worker-owned ( or some combination of the three ) . Consumers come together and form a buying club or cooperative retail store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of goods and services they want , and the quality they want , at an affordable price . Consumers establish a grocery cooperative , for example , if fresh produce and natural and vegetarian foods are not supplied elsewhere or are very costly . Consumers also come together to buy electricity , financial services ( as in a credit union ) , environmentally friendly fuels , pharmaceuticals , or child care , for example . Cooperative retail enterprises such as natural-food grocery stores and rural electric and energy cooperatives , together with credit unions , are the most common and successful examples of consumer cooperatives . Credit unions offer financial services and loans to a specific group of members ( affiliated with a union , a workplace , or a church , for example ) or to underserved communities , and keep financial resources circulating in the community . Housing co-ops expand home or apartment ownership to more people , addressing both financing and maintenance issues , and often build in long-term affordability . <p> Producers also form cooperatives to jointly purchase supplies and equipment or to jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics facilitates the pooling of resources to supply producers or to help produce or enhance their product , to standardize procedures and prices , to increase the selling price , or to decrease the costs of distribution , advertising , and sales . Agriculture marketing and craft cooperatives are the most common form of producers cooperatives . <p> Workers form cooperatives so as to jointly own and manage a business themselves , to stabilize employment , make policy , and share the profits . Worker cooperatives are often established to save a company that is being sold off , abandoned , or closed down , or to start a company that exemplifies workplace democracy and collective management . Worker-owned businesses offer economic security , income and wealth generation , and democratic economic participation to employees , as well as provide communities with meaningful and decent jobs and promote environmental sustainability . <p> Cooperative businesses must operate democratically , according to a set of principles that include open membership , equal voting rights for each member regardless of how much is invested , returns based on use , continuous education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " co-operatives are based on the values of self-help , self-responsibility , democracy , equality , equity and solidarity " ( ICA 2012b ) , as well as accountability and transparency . Cooperatives operate on a " double bottom line " paying attention not just to good business practices and producing a surplus but also to good functioning of the association and to member and community participation ( democratic participation ) and well-being ( Fairbairn 2003 ; Spear 2000 ) . Because many cooperatives also address sustainability ( both economic and environmental ) , they are often seen as addressing a " triple bottom line " : economic ( business ) , social ( mutuality and participation ) , and ecological sustainability . Fairbairn argues , however , that making distinctions between social and economic sustainability is reductionist because it suggests tradeoffs instead of synergies . A more integrated approach recognizes that " social and economic functions come together " and that economic activities achieve social goals ( Fairbairn 2003 , 4 ) . This is not an either/or relationship in which one goal has priority over others .

Witness the telling photographs taken by CTzannes admirers near the end of his life . Ker Xavier Roussels picture of CTzanne painting at Les Lauves in 1906 shows him spry , his brush poised , ready to make a carefully considered mark on a canvas placed perpendicular to the camera lens , its top tilted precariously forward to mitigate against the glare of the harsh Mediterranean sunlight ( fig. 1 ) . CTzannes face is in profil perdu , yet we can still make out an expression of fierce concentration as he studies his motif . His body is tensed , ready for action : he is the embodiment of vital creativity . One of +mile Bernards photos of his mentor , taken during his second trip to Aix in 1905 , repeats this image of masculine power : CTzanne , though not painting , stands near the same site at Les Lauves , one of his favorite working spots ( fig. 2 ) . His figure fills the frame of the image . He looks larger than life and absolutely self-containedeven his hands are folded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body , not unlike Rodins stele-like portrait of Balzac in all his virile glory . CTzannes face is half-shadowed , but despite this his gaze seems focused , sure , as he looks directly at the photographer . His hatthat symbol of sartorial splendor and metonymic substitution for bourgeois , masculine authoritycontrasts sharply with the white of the sky . <p> Compare these photos to Bernards other , more famous picture of CTzanne sitting in front of his celebrated and vexing Large Bathers , now in the Barnes collection ( fig. 3 , pl . IX ) . The pictureor , more precisely , the man depicted thereinis no longer marked by the assuredness of those images discussed above . One can imagine the scene : Bernard having to cajole the reclusive painter to pose with his painting , then placing him seated just so in front of it . CTzannes shy pride and discomfort registers , I think , in his stately carriage . Sitting where he is , with the painting as a backdrop , it is hard not to read him as the generative source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures surround him , as if they are the Muses honoring his creative power . <p> Yet just as Bernards writings by this point in time make clear that he was becoming less and less convinced of his teachers ability to deal with the genre of the female nude so , too , does the photograph present CTzanne not as the unequivocal master of his painting but as in some senses dominated by it , broken by its ambition , inadequate to its conception . The painting itself , in its half-finished state , has not yet achieved the full strangeness of its effectsthe figures still convey some degree of anatomical truth , the surface is still thinly painted , the color still retains a relative clarity ( as far as can be registered in this black-and-white photograph ) . And yet even this early state suggests something of what the finished canvas would possess : stylized and distorted bodies , clotted , scumbled skins of paint , muddied and overworked color , eccentricities of scale and composition . In other words , a thoroughly unconventional approach to painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of reworking the painting , CTzanne would continue his reinvention of the category of the nude , a project that had engaged him since his earliest forays into the theme in the 1870s . He would recast its pleasures in a thoroughly modern way , as an erotics of paint : that is to say , he would harness the materiality of the medium to take the place of narrative fantasies of sexual possession or even of the representation of believable bodies as such in communicating fleshly pleasures . Those puzzling qualities that would characterize the final work and that marked his work on the theme of bathersthose gaucheries , as they were termed by the painters contemporaries , the signs , in other words , of a nanve and awkward ( but also sincere and authentic ) handwere in fact the terms of CTzannes new language of the erotic , even though they were only rarely or , more precisely , only obliquely understood as such by critics who most often scratched their heads at CTzannes strange and troubling images . <p> In the photograph , CTzanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full view of it : as such , it stands as an appropriate metaphor for the way this artists unconventional approach to painting has often structured his biographical portrait and , simultaneously , for the way his mythic biography has circumscribed interpretations of his painting . Bernards difficulty in understanding CTzannes approach to the nude determined his view of the man seated before him in the studio , not simply in his critical writings , as we will see in the coming pages , but also in this portrait . No longer the active , vigorous , virile presence seen in Roussels photograph , no longer the solid , columnar , powerful , and strong-willed presence of the first of Bernards pictures , CTzanne is here transformed into their opposite : now indoors , surrounded by his naked figures , his head is bare and vulnerable , his legs are crossed and his hands are clenched in his lap , his body is compacted and compressed . He no longer dominates the frame of the photograph but seems , rather , to shrink in front of the canvas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature , was the epitome of potent masculine genius , CTzanne in his studio , in front of this painting of baigneuses , is the image of manhood shrunken , shriveled . At the same time , it was precisely CTzannes strange reputation , in wide circulation at the turn of the century , as a recluse , a misanthropic hermit , an eccentric , andmost importantlyas an " impotent artist " who was inadequate ( physically and psychically ) to achieve his artistic goals , that led Bernard to understand his bathers , the most challenging paintings in his oeuvre , as something akin to failures . <p> It was no coincidence , I think , that the photographs of CTzanne that seem to embody a certain masterful , vigorous persona were taken outdoors , often depicting him in the process of painting the landscape , and that this other view of CTzannemelancholic , diminishedwas constructed in the studio , in relation to his bathers . CTzannes strength as an artist and innovator was most ofteneven exclusivelyattributed by his turn-of-the-century critics to his mastery of the genres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a practice rooted in optical effects , truth to nature , and an almost monastic search for beauty . Not only were his bathers hard to reconcile to conventional expectations of the erotic nude , but they were difficult to align with this idea of visual veracity , which was understood as the most important aspect of CTzannes artistic approach , for these odd paintings of nudes in the landscape were the product of an insular studio practice , derived not from the external world but from the minds eye . They seemed utterly incompatible with those qualities , that search for an authentic and sincere translation of the natural world , that most critics of the 1890s and early 1900s valued most about CTzannes work . <p> Hence our double inheritance , the two CTzannes : both the virile " father of modern art " and an impotent genius , both the painter who was transforming the terrain of advanced painting in the twentieth century and an artist whose work was marked by inadequacies and gaucheries , both the celebrated recorder of the most subtle optical effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some thought , disturbed ) painter of deformed female flesh . Bernards photo at once responds to these portraits of CTzanne that were being articulated , in full contrariness , in the years around the turn of the century and takes its own part in constructing CTzanne as such a contradiction . This insistence on two CTzannes not only structures the biography of CTzanne that emerged in these years in myriad and subtle waysCTzanne the youthful revolutionary versus CTzanne the reactionary bourgeois , CTzanne the fearless rebel versus CTzanne the fearful , fragile hermit , CTzanne the genius versus CTzanne the doubterbut also the treatment of his oeuvre , so that his landscapes , still lifes , portraits , and genre scenes have tended to be quarantined from his treatment of the nude , a subject that occupied him throughout his career , from his first brushstrokes to his last . <p> This book is an attempt not to reconcile the two pictures of CTzanne and his oeuvre but to understand the stakes of the distinctions between them . In one sense , this volume is an essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of fiction , art criticism , and memoirs of personal encounters with the famous ( or infamous ) painter , that were written just before and after his death in 1907 by figures such as +mile Bernard , Maurice Denis , Ambroise Vollard , Joachim Gasquet , Gustave Geoffroy , +mile Zola , and many others , major and minor . But more crucially , this book is a reflection on his paintings of the male and female nude , his so-called bathers . For it is from CTzannes biography , rife with images of sexual anxiety and impotence , of failure and doubt , that one may glean an interpretation of the bathers that was emerging in the 1890s and 1900s , an interpretation that could not , perhaps , be articulated outside of biographical terms as such . To state it plainly : my argument is that CTzannes bather paintings radically redefined what it meant to paint the erotic nude and that his redefinition of that genre was so mystifying to his critics that they could only understand his artistic intervention as a failure of his masculinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of art analyses . The critics recognition of the ways CTzanne reconceived the erotic nude was never stated outright in the many attempts to write about the bathers in the years around the turn of the century yet can be discerned everywhere through a careful reading of the various textual portraits of CTzanne that were written , even in the glancing form of the art critic , in the 1890s and 1900s . <p> CTzannes biographymeaning his biography as a literary form , as a textis marked by its pathos : it is a particularly unexpected narrative of artistic genius , since he is repeatedly characterized an artist who has not always lived up to the lofty goals he set for his art . Rather than overflowing with images of CTzanne as a heroic figure of avant-garde assurednessas something like a Courbet , cutting a swath through tradition and definitively reorienting the path of nineteenth-century artthe accumulation of writings that constitute his biography as it was emerging at the turn of the century often as not picture CTzanne as a fearful , paranoid man almost paralyzed with anxiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of an artist who is central to most , if not all , accounts of European modernism . The roots of this narrative of CTzanne as an impotent geniusboth in romantic and later naturalist fictions of artistic endeavor as well as in a contemporary , pseudoscientific discourse around the pathology of geniusand the stakes of this picture in an analysis of the artists work , especially his forays into the representation of the nude , are explored in the first chapter of this volume . <p> In reading the early criticism of CTzanne , much of which took the form of artistic biography , it is striking the degree to which images of CTzannes troubled masculinity were articulated in relation to a discussion of his paintings of the nude , and simultaneously by the way the bathers sat so uneasily , in the minds of his commentators , with the rest of CTzannes oeuvre . This discomfort with the paintingswith their relation to CTzannes " other " practice of landscape , still life painting , and portraiture and with their strangeness in relation to contemporary conventions of the genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present moment . The second chapter investigates the history of writings on CTzanne and his bathers and the way the various accounts of these works that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century ( especially those by Meyer Schapiro , Theodore Reff , Tamar Garb , and T. J. Clark ) might be harnessed to bring us closer to an understanding of CTzannes project as one rooted in an investigation of the material qualities of paint and its potential to evoke a sensualized response . At the same time , I engage critically with these approaches to CTzannes oeuvre , especially in relation to the deployment of a range of psychoanalytic descriptions of the operations of desire that , in their dependence on visual metaphors , remain inadequate to explain the bathers haptic address . It was this materialized aspect of CTzannes practicethe dislocation of the signifier of the erotic from the depicted body itself to the painted mark , the manipulation of paint on the surface of the canvasthat constituted his painterly erotics . <p> If the writings on CTzannes bathers suggest something like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nude , this is an indication that the erotic element in these works is not ( as the most familiar interpretations of his oeuvre would insist ) a private , traumatic , sublimated or simply repressed symbolic dimension but rather part of the paintings public address and a sign of the painters reaction to a number of prior interventions into the terms of the genre . That this engagement with the historical and contemporary stakes of the nude registered with the painters contemporaries is indicated by the insistent attempts at distinguishing , and separating , one type of bather painting from another : the male and female bathers , the baigneurs and baigneuses , were understood as having entirely different geneses , the former in memory and direct observation and the latter in CTzannes imagination , even though there was no visual justification for this belief . The implications of this segregation are entirely gendered and stem from the way CTzannes contemporaries interpreted his gaucheries : his failures of execution were linked in the critics imagination to CTzannes unresolved passion for his ( female ) models and thus were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exploring this overdetermined attempt to segregate baigneurs from baigneuses is a means of recognizing the critics understandinginchoate as it often wasof CTzannes interventions into the representation of eroticism . <p> The book ends with a reading of CTzannes bathers that is at once thoroughly rooted in CTzannes contemporary moment but that also suggests the implications for a later modernist practice : that of Henri Matisse , whose writings and work are filled with references to CTzanne , especially to his imagings of the nude . It is here , perhaps , that this book makes its biggest claims : CTzannes shifting of the terms of the erotic to the material signifier of paint from the representational component of the bodies depicted was , I suggest , precisely understood by Matisse and thus set the terms for a certain strand of modernisms engagement with the sensualized body . My starting point in making this argument is Matisses utterly stubborn misreading of CTzannes bather paintings , articulated in his " Notes of a Painter " of 1908 , in which he insisted on substituting for the more common description of CTzannes bather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their utter lack of visual or anatomical confusion . Reading against this text , one can come to understand Matisses words as a self-conscious , textual dissimulation of not only the erotic effects of CTzannes work but of Matisses own . Like the critics who were writing on CTzanne at the same , and who were only able to voice the strangeness of CTzannes erotics of paint obliquely , through the form of biography , Matisse , too , was only able to address this aspect of CTzannes practice in an indirect way : in terms of paint rather than words , in canvases in which the structural and material conditions of paintings do not sublimate or replace desire but produce them in defiance of the willfully distorted bodies on display . <p> If the existence of two CTzannes in criticism on the artist has proved a troubling fact for most scholars , it has also been a productive one . For that reason , this book does not set out to restore CTzanne to wholeness and unity , to reintegrate the bathers into his oeuvre , reconstructing his practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through scholarly explication . Rather , it seeks to preserveand , at its best moments , heightenthat radical disjuncture or discontinuity that CTzannes first critics found so troubling and to insist on the fundamental rupture these works effected in the history of the erotic nude . The bathers could only evoke overt disavowal by even his most sensitive observers , but against the grain of this repression emerged the terms for a new conception of painting the pleasures of the body in the twentieth century .

Looking back on this effort now , well more than sixty years later , we can appreciate the full scope of the project and see more clearly what was at stake and how it related to the history and tradition of documentary photography . <p> The camera has , from the beginning , recorded the actuality of life , including urban and rural social conditions . Such observations , however , were accidental , picked up by the eye of the camera as it sought to record and memorialize everyday life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the 1880s and 1890s , when Jacob Riis undertook a more systematic exposure of conditions in the tenements and slums of the Lower East Side of New York City . Riis was followed by Lewis Hine shortly after the turn of the last century ; Hine photographed immigrants at Ellis Island and factory workers in Pittsburgh as well as the lower strata of urban society in Boston and New York . As Alan Trachtenberg has argued , Hines work for The Survey , a Progressive magazine , " reflected a new idea in the reform movement , " a shift away from individual pauperism to the more systemic problems ( e.g. , child labor ) " which required legislative intervention and professional expertise . " Even the magazines nameThe Surveysuggested this more synoptic approach , confirming Allan Sekulas observation that the archive , the effort to construct a complete catalog or description , became " the dominant institutional basis for photographic meaning " around the turn of the twentieth century . <p> By the 1920s , though , the leading edge of the Progressive movement had become blunted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chauvinistic politics that wanted to exclude foreign elements . Hine , with his liberal attitudes and documentary strategies , was marginalized , while the more self-consciously avant-garde modernist photographersinfluenced by the innovative European art movements emanating from Germany and Francecreated a new space for photography within the art world . Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand were in the ascendant now , and the mood of photography , influenced by the strong example of Cubism , was to cultivate form for its own sake . Transforming the everyday objects of the immediate urban environment , Stieglitz , Strand , Alvin Langdon Coburn , and Edward Weston constructed an abstract photography that favored the fragment , the close-up , the studious meditation on the thing itself . The modernists were also exalting photography as the art of the moment , of freezing time in ways that provided exciting juxtapositions , elegant formal matches , and the discovery of form in the natural world . <p> The stock-market crash of 1929 and the economic depression that followed it placed everything in a new light . Silent factories , growing unemployment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans began to look for apocalyptic solutions . There was no apocalypse , but the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932 heralded a gradual restoration of confidence in the American system of government . Roosevelt brought with him a host of new faces , new talents , and new ideas , among them the creation of federal agencies that would employ the unemployedincluding , to everyones surprise , artists , writers , musicians , performers , editors , and photographers . The government also went into the business of providing information about its own programs , a move designed to promote support for farm subsidies , land conservation , dam control , and a host of other beneficial projects . ( Today we would call this effort propaganda , but in the 1930s the term did not have its negative postWorld War II connotation . ) Leading that effort was the Farm Security Administration , which saw the great potential that visual portrayalsthrough photography and filmmight have . At the head of the FSAs historical division was the pivotal figure of the 1930s documentary movement , Roy Stryker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roosevelts close advisor . <p> Stryker worked with about a dozen photographers at any given time , assigning them to different regions across the United States . They went equipped with background information and " shooting scripts " that gave detailed instructions on what material was needed . The resulting images were made available , free of charge , to news magazines and newspapers and for local exhibitions . The FSA archiveabout 164,000 black-and-white images and about 1,600 color slidesmay be the greatest collection in photographic history . <p> The ostensible motive of the FSA photographers was to gather images relating to the agricultural policies of the government , but in practice , Stryker and his crew quickly developed a much broader conception of their documentary project . They set out to render a sociological portrait of American life , across classes , in urban and rural areasa portrait guided consciously by the sociological approach of Robert Lynd , whose Middletown had been a pioneering ethnography of an American city . The FSAs ambitious aims were captured in an interoffice memo written by John Vachon , who ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as the archivist of the FSA files : 60006 @qwx470006 <p> The statement that photography is the medium best suited to true documentation can no longer be challenged . Still photography , not cinematic , is the most impersonal and truthful device yet perfected for factual recording . It is able to include the widest range of subject matter and employ the least plastic materials of all the arts . In still photography the artists material is one simple phenomenon , the splash of light on a sensitized emulsion . <p> The camera , then , intelligently used , should leave for the future a very living document of our age , of what people of today look like , of what they do and build . It should be a monumental document comparable to the tombs of Egyptian Pharoahs sic , or to the Greek Temples , but far more accurate . <p> Such a body of work is the well organized , intelligently selected and edited file of photographs . The most important , perhaps the only important file of this sort is the FSA collection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any overt political purpose , Vachon argued for a more lofty , comprehensive perspective : " While accepting limits of detail , the documentary file should accept no general limits . It should not portray exclusively either the rural scene or the urban scene , lower classes or upper classes . It should be like the philosopher , who without a profound knowledge of all special sciences , yet includes and understands them all . " Vachons youthful memo expresses some of the excitement and sense of purpose that infused the FSA photographers as they fanned out across the country in search of pictures that would definitively portray Americas present conditions . <p> The young photographers Stryker gathered around him were to revive the dormant tradition of documentary photography that Hine had championed ( they knew Hines work , as did Stryker , of course ) . They had also been schooled , however , in the aesthetics of modernism . Though they remained adamantly committed to documentary , this younger generation of photographersDorothea Lange and Jack Delano , Ben Shahn and Arthur Rothstein , John Vachon and Marjory Collinswas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Walker Evans , in this group , had a notable prior reputation . Evans had begun his career in the late twenties , and his early workclose-ups of commercial signs , fragments of buildings , architectural studies , street snapshotsrevealed his mastery of the modernist idiom of abstraction as well as his interest in capturing the flow of urban life . Bringing these resources into his work for Stryker , Evans produced images that had an elegance of composition and technical brilliance . He favored architectural images and landscapes , his eye alert for formal resonancesrepetitions , contrastswithin the image and for the odd detail of signage or furnishings . He excelled as well in the portrait . <p> Two of Evanss best-known works are part of the Pennsylvania FSA archive and are included in the present volume . " Johnstown housing " ( December 1935 ) and " Bethlehem graveyard and steel mill " ( November 1935 ) , both taken with Evanss 8 x 10 view camera with a long depth of field , fill the frame up to the edges , with everything in focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a radical foreshortening of the picture plane and the creation of patterns through the juxtaposition of objects in space , objects brought close together in the photograph . The pattern created by the houses in " Johnstown housing " is straightforward enough ; in " Bethlehem graveyard and steel mill , " however , the juxtaposition of the cemetery cross in the foreground and the workers housing in the middle ground against the steel mills in the background gives to the scene a compressed symbolic quality , as if to sum up the living and dying of this town within the ruling structure of the steel industry . <p> Two other well-known Evans images in the Pennsylvania FSA archive also appeared , in more severely cropped versions , in Evanss classic American Photographs ( 1938 ) , and they are reproduced here : " Legionnaire , Bethlehem " ( November 1935 ) and " Sons of American Legion , Bethlehem " ( November 1935 ) . Looking at the " American Memory " Library of Congress Web site , which offers on-line versions of most of the FSA prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of this Bethlehem parade with a 35 mm camera ( thus affording him mobility and speed ) . The first shot in the series shows the formidable legionnaire as Evans initially saw himpart of a larger group of legionnaires who were informally clustering around him . Evans must have closed in to get this close-up , provoking the glowering and disapproving stare of the sternly patriotic , proudly decorated veteran . The subsequent frame captures the boys in caps , bored and waiting for some action , trying to look the part of junior legionnaires but so far still in the training stage . <p> Patriotism and the flag figure as themes in several other photographs in this collection , especially those taken by Marjory Collins in 1942 . By then , the United States was in the war , and home-front activity is visible not only in displays of loyalty but also in the work performed by women in jobs that would normally have gone to menworking on the Pennsylvania Railroad , in factories , or at filling stations . Such pictures might have come from anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in this collection give us a portrait of a specific region and a particular state . <p> This statePennsylvaniawas anything but a single unit , as the photographs reveal . During the 1930s , regional differences were more distinct ; since then , they have been blurred to some extent by suburbanization . For one , the farming industry and the family farm were far more important to the overall Pennsylvania economy than at present . How deeply Pennsylvania farmers suffered the strain of the Depression is clear in Marion Post Wolcotts photographs of York County farm auctions in 1939 . In some ways , the images of the Amish and Mennonites serve as a counterpoint to the depiction of Pennsylvania more generally , for their perpetually conservative way of life , from dress and custom to religion and technology , vividly contrasts with the changes in fashion and the vicissitudes of life outside these communities . But even the Amish and Mennonites were not immune to the downturns of the Depression , as one can see in the depictions of farm auctions in 1942 by Marjory Collins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also featured in Pennsylvania life , and though such conflicts seldom appear in the FSA archive , we do see them in an image such as John Vachons portrayal of the strikebreakers at the King Farm near Morrisville in 1938 . <p> The industrial state of Pennsylvania is also made visible here . The mining regions dominated western Pennsylvania , and the photographs by Carl Mydans , Ben Shahn , Jack Delano , and John Collier reveal workers caught up in a massive industrial machine fronted by a determined John L. Lewis , president of the United Mine Workers of America from 1920 to 1960 . Meanwhile , Jack Delanos 1941 photographs of the Bethlehem and Aliquippa steel mills show us an industry gearing up for war production . Pittsburgh , the industrial anchor of western Pennsylvania , is here portrayed with its factories lining the riverfront , a city of production . At the eastern end of the state , the tall towers of Philadelphia in Paul Vanderbilts images represent the city as a bastion of financial power . <p> We also see , amid the deprivations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing , and drinking , the full table at the Lancaster farm in Sheldon Dicks 1938 photo , the customers portrayed by Jack Delano shopping at a cooperative farmers market in 1940 . But holding it all together , at the center , are the images of family , none more symbolic of the American ideal than the 1942 Neffsville Thanksgiving photographed by Marjory Collins . <p> The documentary photographers framing these images of Pennsylvania were working within a generally understood notion of what documentary photography wasa vision articulated by Stryker and embodied in the practice of the various leading photographers in the group . For images of the rural landscape , the FSA photographers might be governed by pictorial conventions derived from painting ( e.g. , a centered composition , framed by natural elements ) . For images of the modern city and modern industry , they might draw on the more recent aesthetic conventions of Precisionism , with hard edges and geometric lines creating an abstract design within the picture frame . Oras with Evansthey might create within a more purely photographic aesthetic , taking advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Human subjects dominate the FSA archive , in which we find three basic approaches to photographing people : ( 1 ) candid images , in which the action is taken by the photographer with the subject generally unaware of his or her presence , although in a few cases the subject seems suddenly aware of the camera ; ( 2 ) posed portraits ( the most frequent type of image ) , in which the subject is obviously aware of the camera and is looking at it , composing him- or herself under the direction of the photographer ; and ( 3 ) the posed dramatic image , in which the subject is positioned by the photographer so as to represent some " typical " action , feeling , or gesture . Documentary photographers were , more often than not , directing the picture in order to achieve the appearance of " truth " or to gain the desired appearance of a generalized type that the portrait might reveal . <p> There are so many vital images in this collection of Pennsylvania photography that it is difficult to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Shahns 1937 " Man gathering good coal from the slag heaps at Nanty Glo " offers a visceral sense of the mans perilous angle ; Sheldon Dicks " Second shaft tower at Maple Hill mine seen from the first tower " ( 1938 ? ) beautifully uses the foreground structure to divide the picture beyond it into geometric segments . John Colliers " Mennonite girls waiting for Deutsch School to begin in Mennonite church " ( 1942 ) is an elegant study of the group of girls in their traditional dress , framed by the strict lines of the corner . Esther Bubleys 1943 studies of the Pittsburgh bus terminal capture the posture and attitudes of impatient patience . Jack Delanos portrait of the tinplate worker ( 1941 ) , who is seen in profile with his head turned toward us , is a striking composition , the mans gaze fixed unalterably on the camera and the viewer ; another of Delanos tinplate workers holds a balletic pose , the steam rising off the forge to the right . Andto close a catalog that might go on and onMarjory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost surreal presence , framed perfectly within the perspective lines of the sidewalk . <p> The FSA photographers were , of course , beneficiaries of the Roosevelt administration and most of them felt in full sympathy with its new definitions of the role of government in our lives and with its goals of social welfare . Butto place them in the larger context of social documentary of the timethey were surely to the right of the more deliberately leftist Photo League . Emerging in 1936 out of the Workers Film and Photo League , an earlier leftist organization whose purpose was to promote the workers struggle , the Photo League was a self-supporting photo school , gallery , and camera club based in New York City and headed by Sol Libsohn and Sid Grossman . Given the generally leftist tenor of the times , the Photo League managed to enlist an older generation of photographers ( e.g. , Hine , Strand , Weston ) along with younger photographers including Ansel Adams , Richard Avedon , Helen Levitt , Lisette Model , and Walter Rosenblum . Seeking subjects outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo League featured scenes of urban life regularly ignored by the media , such as Aaron Siskinds study of Harlem . Following a triumphant exhibition in 1948 entitled " This Is the Photo League , " the organization fell victim to the paranoid political climate of the postwar years , andin the face of accusations of communist influencethe group disbanded in 1951 . Their work would be virtually forgotten until its rediscovery in the 1980s . <p> But the Photo League was certainly not the only cultural organization to fall before the anticommunist right . To Congressional Republicans , the federal arts programs and the photography project of the FSA were themselves just short of communist ; eventually , the Republicans succeeded in shutting down the New Deal and dismantling the various agencies of the Roosevelt era . Roy Stryker , seeing the writing on the wall , made arrangements to have the FSA file ( which had become in 1942 the Farm Security AdministrationOffice of War Information file ) shifted to the Library of Congress for storage and safekeeping . Ironically , the major effort of the FSA-OWI group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , one that would rally the troops and the home front in support of the battles abroad . <p> Despite its official termination , the FSA effort continued , in a way , into the forties , when Stryker moved his operations to private industry and began to work for the Standard Oil Company . He managed to pull together a team of photographers , many from the FSA years , who would sustain the documenting of America ( enlarging their sphere to incorporate South as well as North America ) in order to portray the ramifications of the oil industry in our lives , from production to consumption . In effect , it was another grand opportunity to construct a visual sociology of American life , one paid for by an oil company looking for improved public relations . Mainstream magazines , tooLife , Look , and Fortune , for exampleemployed a number of former FSA photographers in the forties and fifties as they evolved and perfected the concept of the narrative picture story . <p> The spirit of the FSA movement reached a kind of apogee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Museum of Modern Art in 1955 . Steichen , by then the curator of photography at the Modern , had seen the FSA show at Grand Central Station in 1938 and had been impressed by the power of documentary photography to portray a national condition and move peoples emotions . During the recovery period after World War II , Steichen conceived the idea of developing a similar show on a global scale , one that would articulate a vision of common interest within a world of difference and promote the peaceful coexistence of nations . Putting out a universal call for images , Steichen , with Wayne Millers help , selected 503 images taken by 273 photographers . In addition , Steichen culled images from the files of the FSA and the National Archives in Washington ; he went to Life magazine as well . The resultperhaps the most popular photography show everfeatured a selection of images from sixty-eight countries that was shaped by the tradition of American FSA documentary photography as well as by the Henri Cartier-Bresson tradition of the " decisive moment , " which was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new generation of street photographers .

His book would take social observation and documentary photography in a more subjective direction , signaling a skepticism about American society and American prejudices that would open the door to a range of social commentary and description in the decades to follow . Though the FSA under Stryker was striving for a coherent vision , one can find the seeds of Franks work and that of other social documentary photographers in the exemplary images by Walker Evans and his FSA colleagues . <p> Pennsylvaniawith its mix of cities and small towns , its rural and wilderness areas , its mining industries and rich farming areas , its financial and cultural centershas always offered a microcosm of American life .

He believed that the Paris police had incarcerated the philosophe because they thought he had written a lewd novel , ThTrFse philosophe , ou MTmoires pour servir a lhistoire du P.

Mixing sizzling sex with impious philosophy , the heroine , ThTrFse , chronicles how various mentorsa libertine noblewoman , a cleric , and a courtesangave her a well-rounded sexual and intellectual education . <p> Barbier was less concerned with the novels blasphemous content and more excited by the fact that it included " the history of Father Girard , Jesuit , and the demoiselle CadiFre in Aix-en-Provence , which created such a stir . " This " history " appears in ThTrFses account of the affair between her friend Mademoiselle +radice , who " loved God like one loves her lover , " and the famous confessor Father Dirrag . While " all of Europe " knew their story , ThTrFse is privy to a more intimate episode . At +radices invitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " instructions . " +radice promises , " Youll see . . . the power of my spiritual exercises and the stages of repentance through which the good father is leading me to sainthood . And you 'll no longer be able to doubt the ecstasies and the raptures which these exercises produce . " <p> Through a crack , ThTrFse watches Dirrag teach his enthusiastic young penitent the mystical principle of " oubliez-vous , laissez-faire " " forget yourself and let yourself go . " +radice kneels in prayer , buttocks exposed , as he whips her while quoting the Bible and then declares , " You should now be . . . in a state of the most perfect contemplation ; your soul should be detached from your senses . If my child does not disappoint my holy expectations , she sees nothing , hears nothing , and feels nothing . " Having urged her to ignore all physical sensations , the confessor penetrates her from behind , telling +radice that what she feels is a segment of the original cord St. Francis of Assisi wore around his waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was like a satyr , his lips frothing , his mouth ajar , grinding his teeth and snorting like a bull . " After Dirrag leaves the room , the ecstatic +radice exclaims , " Yes , I have seen Paradise unveiled ; Ive experienced angelic bliss . . . . By virtue of the holy cord my soul was almost freed from matter . " Clearly , the distinction between mystic and sexual union was blurred at best . <p> This seduction scene juxtaposed blind faith and clerical hypocrisy . According to historian Robert Darnton , the 1748 publication of ThTrFse philosophe belonged to a transformative moment in French intellectual culture . Diderot , Montesquieu , Voltaire , and Rousseau all published substantial works at midcentury . Just three years after ThTrFse philosophe , the first two volumes of the monumental EncyclopTdie appeared . Erotic fiction and a massive compendium of knowledge may seem to have little in common . However , Darnton locates ThTrFse philosophe in " the bawdy , naughty , cheeky world of the early Enlightenment , where everything was held up to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinctive Enlightenment genre , the livre philosophique , which fused frenzied sexual activity with philosophical deliberations on the soul , morality , and individual happinessthe same weighty topics scrutinized by the EncyclopTdie . <p> Pairing ThTrFse philosophe with an Enlightenment classic suggests that the novels secular outlook reflects the beginning of a new , more " modern " mindset . There is much to support this claim . For example , the abbT T . . . , one of ThTrFses mentors , pontificates on the incompatibility between Christian teachings and nature : " To be the perfect Christian , one must be ignorant , to believe blindly , to renounce all pleasures . . . , to abandon ones relatives , friends , to maintain ones virginity , in a word do everything that is contrary to nature . " <p> However , returning to +dmond Barbier , we see that his first impulse was not to connect the novel with Enlightenment philosophy but to recall the story of Jean-Baptiste Girard ( Dirrag ) and Catherine CadiFre ( +radice ) , central figures in a trial that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1730 when Catherine CadiFre , the twenty-year-old daughter of an olive oil merchant in Toulon , accused the fifty-year-old Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Girard of shocking crimes in the confessional . Their relationshipone of confessor and penitentbegan quietly enough in 1728 . Within a year , however , the young womans body had become a battleground between demonic possession and divine ecstasy . Friends and neighbors believed that Catherine was on the brink of sainthood , destined to be another Teresa of Avila or Catherine of Siena . But the story of Catherine the saint and Father Girard the saint-maker turned sour . In November 1730 , Catherine denounced Father Girard for sexual misconduct . A few months later , the torrid scandal became a fraught judicial conflict . <p> Although the trial took place in Aix-en-Provence , four hundred miles from Paris , all France followed the sensational case . Private correspondence , official exchanges , and police records from 1731 indicate that everyone in the realm had an opinion on it . Elites updated each other on the voluminous legal briefs , or mTmoires judiciaires , in which lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual misdeeds and conspiracies . English and German translations quickly appeared , suggesting that much of Europe was equally fascinated . Periodicals , pamphlets , songs , and other polemics circulated in cafTs and taverns , taking aim at everyone from Father Girard to the judges . <p> The storys salacious details may explain this fervid interest . Catherine claimed that Father Girard had urged her " to accept a state of demonic possession , " to embrace indecent visions , and , finally , to embrace him . Catherine soon found herself yet more compromised in a pregnancy that Father Girard then terminated with an abortifacient . Soon after her revelations to her new confessor ( and possible lover ) , Father Nicolas Girieux , Catherine went to authorities in Toulon to seek justice . <p> Clumsy official handling of the case aggravated the scandal . By January 1731 , matters in Toulon were stalemated , so Louis XV commanded the regions royal judicial courts , the parlement of Provence , to try the case . Meanwhile , Cardinal AndrT-Hercule de Fleury , then prime minister , and Chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping to quash the affair quickly and quietly . It was too late . The presiding judges were at each others throats , and the trial dragged on into the fall . Moreover , the affair divided the public , whose interpretations of the trial read like a " he said/she said " melodrama . Indeed , the marquis dArgens said the affair created rifts everywherewithin families , between lovers . <p> We , too , are drawn to the details of Catherine and Girards relationship . What really happened behind closed doors ? The truth is lost to us , buried under layers of accusations and the passage of time . Instead , I would draw readers attention to how men and women of the eighteenth century reacted to the scandal . Intervention by the realms most powerful individuals and the publics passionate responses show that this trial was not simply about a sexual liaison between an aging cleric and his young penitent . Jean-Baptiste Girard conjured up images of Urbain Grandier and Louis Gaufridy , seventeenth-century priests burned at the stake for witchcraft . The Girard/CadiFre affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , but , at bottom , it was a political affair . For readers today , the trial sheds light on two intersecting phenomena : growing uncertainties about the role of the sacred in buttressing the power of traditional figures of authority in French society , and the compelling presence of the public in eighteenth-century politics and religion . While ThTrFse philosophe used the Girard/CadiFre scandal as a vehicle to denounce Christian teachings , this book examines how the affair was firmly rooted in the world of faith as well as political and religious dissent . <p> Over the past three decades , historians have shown that religious disillusionment emerged not out of the Enlightenment but out of the divisions erupting around Jansenism , a contentious French Catholic sect with origins in the early seventeenth century . Even as the Catholic Church vigorously supported free will , Jansenists ( as their detractors called them ) steadfastly believed in predestination , the notion that only Godnot human choices or actionsdetermined salvation . Jansenists seemed to undermine the hierarchy that elevated clergy over laity . In defense of individual conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest must mediate between God and the lay individual . <p> To modern readers , such theological issues are arcane , but for early modern men and women , questions about eternal salvation and religious conformity were intensely relevant to their souls and their community . Thus , the clergy occupied a central place in the lives of the laity . For many devout persons , relationships between confessors and penitents rested on trust and reverence . The CadiFre trial exposed the fragile negotiation between the private world of confession and the public authority of the clergy . <p> The case also gained political urgency as the conflict over Jansenism intensified after the anti-Jansenist bull Unigenitus appeared in 1713 . For the aged Sun King , Jansenism undermined the absolutist principle of un roi , une loi , une foi " one king , one law , one faith . " On the grounds of conscience , Jansenists resisted the kings authority as well as the Churchs chain of command . Jansenists also espoused a more " republican " Church in which bishops and church officials were not appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened Louis XIVs vision of a well-ordered body politic that prized authority and tolerated no religious dissent . By persuading Pope Clement XI to publish Unigenitus , Louis XIV sought to stamp out the " heresy " of Jansenism . But immediately after his death in 1715 , large numbers of clergy lodged official appeals against Unigenitus , supported by prestigious institutions such as the Sorbonne and the parlement of Paris . Outside Paris , Provence became an important node of resistance to the bull . <p> This conflict had reached a flash point on the eve of the Girard/CadiFre affair . During the late 1720s , Cardinal Fleury relaunched a campaign to cleanse the clergy of Jansenism . Ultramontane , or pro-papal , bishops now tirelessly pursued suspected Jansenists , who were often imprisoned or exiled . On March 24 , 1730 , Louis XV declared that Unigenitus was " the law of church and state , " which outraged the parlements and further politicized the Jansenist movement . Then , in July 1731 , Jansenist devotees , known as the convulsionnaires , writhed and screamed in the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous ; for others , an embarrassment . With their backs against the wall , Jansenists found a godsend in the Girard/CadiFre affair , especially since they held the Jesuits responsible for all their woes . <p> For Catherine CadiFres supporters , Jansenist and non-Jansenist alike , the trial was not just about one wanton priest but the pernicious influence of Frances most powerful religious orderthe Jesuits , known formally as the Society of Jesus . Jesuit priests acted as royal confessors , spiritual directors , and educators , positions with privileged access to the king and to elite French families . Many contemporaries , including ecclesiastics and men of law , regarded the Society as too influential and too independent , beyond the power of the Crown and leaders of the French Church . The Jesuits were widely seen as foreign interlopers seeking to usurp the kings authority and control his subjects . Jansenists , proponents of predestination , loathed the Jesuits , who were the Catholic Churchs fiercest gatekeepers of free will and clerical superiority . The Jesuits saw Jansenists as heretics whose beliefs verged on Calvinism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a document the Jansenists claimed that the Jesuits had orchestrated . <p> Despite the Societys power , anti-Jesuit sentiment seemed to gain traction . In the years before the CadiFre trial , anonymous pamphlets spread anti-Jesuit messages to " expose " Jesuit immorality and the Societys threat to political and social order . Now , the Girard affair dealt a serious blow to the Jesuits reputation and added another layer to the black legend of the " wily Jesuit . " <p> In the long run , far more was at stake than individual reputations . The public disputes over Jansenism destabilized the sacred underpinnings of authority in early modern French society . Divine-right kingship was at the core of Bourbon absolutism . The kings authority was legitimate and incontestable because it was God-given ; in turn , the most Catholic king was expected to uphold Catholic doctrine . Furthermore , the power invested in the realms institutions and leaders , like the parlements and their magistrates , was also sacred because the king sanctioned it . <p> But like the acrimonious debates over Unigenitus , the CadiFre scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No evidence exists that Catherine herself had Jansenist sympathies , although there is evidence that both her brother +tienne-Thomas and Father Nicolas did . More importantly , certain men of law , such as attorney general Jacques-Joseph Gaufridy and the lawyer Frantois Gastaud , as well as satirists in Provence and Paris , hated the Jesuits and relentlessly criticized Unigenitus . Their efforts on behalf of Catherine CadiFre or , more accurately , against Father Girard transformed the trial from a local sex scandal into a referendum on religious authority . Their strategy ? They appealed to the public through inflammatory arguments intrinsically tied to the campaign against Unigenitus and the Jesuits . The CadiFre affair highlighted the dangers of clerical overreach for the spiritual and , indeed , physical welfare of French men and women . <p> During the summer of 1731 , these claims hardly seemed exaggerated . The Jesuits efforts to protect Father Girard at all costs prompted popular fear that the order violated the rights of the kings subjects . Moreover , magistrates who supported Father Girard were accused of blind devotion and corruption . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed to be in league with the Jesuits and , at the very least , Louis XV appeared unable to control either faction . Religious quarrels , unrestrained clerical powers , and repressive Crown measures contributed to the " desacralization " of the French monarchythe gradual erosion of divine-right ideology and royal prestige . A cameo of the larger conflicts around Unigenitus and the Jesuits , the notorious CadiFre affair played an important role in this process . <p> Lawyers and polemicists efforts to involve the public during the trial dovetailed with an important shift in Jansenism in the early 1730s : its expanding support among men of law , the bourgeoisie , and the menu peuple of Paris . By 1733 and well into the 1750s , men of law actively intervened on behalf of the appellant clergy ; they more or less replaced theologians and bishops as opponents of Unigenitus . Barbier repeatedly noted that the " people " of Paris were avid Jansenists whose zeal had been " ignited by a number of priests who have been removed " from their parishes . Similarly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in ecclesiastical councils and judicial chambers but also in homes and in the streets . Contemporary accounts detail how , in the summer of 1731 , crowds comprising elites and non-elites gathered at Catherines prison in Aix and around the courthouse where the Provental magistrates were deliberating . In the days following the October 10 verdict , riots and celebrations in Toulon caused property damage and led some to fear for their lives . <p> Despite these violent episodes , the public did not simply represent a mob , nor was it a passive audience . Lawyers and polemicists consistently presented their arguments before " public opinion " and asked the public to identify with Catherine : her cause was the cause of all believers and all French subjects . Verses vilifying Girard painted Catherine as the victim of a Jesuit seducer who had also violated her spiritual and civic rights . Catherines lawyer , Jean-Baptiste Chaudon , described the public as " so enlightened , so rightly the adjudicator of virtue and of merit , Sovereign Arbitrator of mens reputations , the true Judge of their innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potentially decisive position . <p> Over the past few decades , historians have emphasized how the process of desacralization and the emergence of public opinion became key features in French politics during the 1750s . According to Keith Baker , " French politics broke out of the absolutist mold . The reign of silence imposed by an absolute monarch could no longer contain debates and contestations that made increasingly explicit appeal to a world of public opinion beyond the traditional circle of institutional actors . " The Crown was besieged from all sides . In the summer of 1750 , the marquis dArgenson remarked in his journal how the people of Paris called their king " Herod , " referring to the notorious Jewish king responsible for the Massacre of the Innocents . Instead of toeing the line , the princes and the parlement of Paris challenged the Crowns policies . At the same time , the Jansenist conflict was reignited , thanks to ultramontane bishops and priests who refused to administer the sacraments to suspected Jansenists . <p> These events of the mid-eighteenth century signified a " moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ThTrFse philosophe was a " moment " in the same periods intellectual history . They marked the emergence of a public , an abstract entity signifying a secular community of reasoning individuals . This public possessed a more " modern " sensibility in which the norm was not to obey but to question rationally . This perspective of a " public " and its challenges to authority points toward the French Revolution . Just two years after the Girard/CadiFre trial , Voltaire published the Philosophical Letters , which one critic described as " the first bomb dropped on the Old Regime . " <p> Readers may ask what difference twenty years makes in identifying a public that can express seditious statements . The Girard/CadiFre trial represented a watershed event that allows us to think beyond a " prerevolutionary " moment and more about the eighteenth century as a long sequence of turmoil and transition . As Thomas Kaiser states , " it is undoubtedly true that after 1750 rhetorical appeals to the public increased and the authority of public opinion grew . But by then , the monarchy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . " Even in the decades before the 1730s , political reformers and financiers appealed to " enlightened " public opinion . Skepticism and irreverence punctuated popular songs and poems that drifted around the cafTs frequented by ordinary peoplepeople whose lives were deeply intertwined with Catholic practice and belief . <p> The Girard/CadiFre trial illuminates how disaffection and dissent grew within the complex world of French Catholicism . It illustrates what Dale Van Kley has argued for decadesthat religious conflict was pivotal in bringing about the demise of the Old Regime . The affair coincided with a time when the Catholic community was unstable and contested as a result of the Jansenist controversies . In the weeks after the trial , ultramontane bishops and royal officials believed that the Catholic faith was threatened and that support for Catherine equaled sedition and disorder . Through the CadiFre affair , we also see the " politics of contestation " evolving outside legal institutions and the rhetoric of constitutionalism . Public opinion coalesced around a scandal that began as a private affair , originating in a world inhabited by most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign , an imaginary Other , in reality they were integral to peoples lives as priests and advisors , making the CadiFre affair much more traumatic . <p> We might think of eighteenth-century French society as a fabric woven of strong , sustaining threads of the sacred , of authority , of obedience . The Girard/CadiFre affair tore fiercely at this fabric . In time , the strain would cause eighteenth-century French men and women to grow disenchanted with their church , their authorities , and at last with their king .

Throughout his sixty years as a professional photographer in Berlin , Seidenstncker captured scenes of German culture in flux . At the time he took this photograph , newsstands like these had become regular features of the urban street . Corner kiosks sold tabloid-format newspapers and magazines well suited for easy reading during the commute on Berlins rapidly growing and increasingly crowded subway . Seidenstnckers newsstand overflows with newspapers and magazines966 , according to the photographs captionbut even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming street culture of Berlin in the late 1920s and early 1930s . To the contrary , it surely fit in seamlessly with the myriad surfaces of modern urban life : the ubiquitous signs and advertisements , many in flashy typefaces or neon ; the enticing shopwindows with dioramas of the latest modern conveniences ; and movie theaters so self-consciously decadent that they were called palaces . Were it not for Seidenstnckers decision to record this moment of daily life in the Weimar RepublicGermanys short-lived and ultimately failed experiment in democracy from 1919 to 1933this corner kiosk might simply have faded into history . <p> Yet Seidenstnckers image also represents a dramatic juncture in German history . It captures a moment at the end of the Weimar Republic as Germany transitioned from an unstable democracy with fierce ideological divisions and a teeming culture into a one-party society that embraced war and ultimately genocide . In a crude sense , the newsstand looks like a kind of theater . Its columns , racks , and piles of newspapers and periodicals create a proscenium . Recessed layers of periodicals form an orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bystander within the image and viewers outside of it together stand in for both anxious German audiences of the early 1930s and a posterity still curious about the drama whose outcome became the twentieth centurys focal point . Even the newsstands location on Berlins imperially named Kaiserallee ( Emperors Avenue ) points to a broader historical drama : today , that same avenue carries the decidedly less imperial name Bundesallee ( Federal Avenue ) . What exactly was this drama that took place toward the end of the Weimar Republic , and how does Seidenstnckers image of a crowded Berlin newsstand offer a new entry point into it ? What is it about photography , in other words , that distinctively helps us investigate the political , aesthetic , and social crises of Weimar Germany ? At least in part , the answers lie in the publications that the photograph depicts , for they form both this dramas medium and its message . <p> One might better understand the moment and broader context that Seidenstncker captured by reading the photograph as his contemporary Siegfried Kracauer might have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photography not because of what it depictshere , a newsstand on a city streetbut by virtue of what it interruptsin this case , the sensory overload of modern city space . In this light , Seidenstnckers photograph embodies a series of conflicts precisely because it is a photograph : it records the fast pace of Weimar modernity in a medium that , through its muteness and paralysis , forms the antithesis of modernitys intensified nervous stimulation . Or as Eduardo Cadava has put it , " The significance of photography lies not with its ability to reproduce a given object , but rather with its ability to tear it away from itself . " We observe in Seidenstnckers image the paradoxical notion of a frozen moment of a culture in flux . In 1932 , Germany was mired in the depths of the Great Depression , and unemployment figures reached their peak of more than six million that year . Meanwhile , street clashes between Communists and National Socialists produced what one commentator called a " schleichender Bnrgerkrieg " ( creeping civil war ) . Yet in this photograph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also its chaos and crises , grind to a standstill . <p> Seidenstnckers newsstand represents one of the most important sites where German thinkers established Weimar Germanys lasting cultural legacy . Public intellectuals such as Kracauer published not only books , novels , and academic studies but also articles , essays , and feuilletons in the specialized and mass media . Kracauer developed his theories about mass cultures effects on the middle class both in books such as Die Angestellten ( The Salaried Masses ) and in the feuilletons he published as the film critic for the Frankfurter Zeitung . In addition to book-length works such as Einbahnstrae ( One-Way Street ) and Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels ( The Origin of German Tragic Drama ) , Walter Benjamin eked out a living through book reviews and articles that appeared in popular newspapers and literary reviews such as the Vossische Zeitung and Die Literarische Welt . Countless other examples attest to key intellectuals interest in shorter essayistic and journalistic forms . This interest transcended political boundaries : key right-wing figures also advanced ideas in book-length forms as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abenteuerliche Herz ( The Adventurous Heart ) and Der Kampf als inneres Erlebnis ( Struggle as inner experience ) two extended texts that glorified his experiences in World War IErnst Jnnger spread his protofascist ideas in publications with provocative titles such as Das Reich ( The empire ) , Widerstand : Zeitschrift fnr nationalrevolutionSre Politik ( Resistance : Journal for national revolutionary politics ) , and Der Vormarsch : BlStter der nationalistischen Jugend ( The forward march : Magazine of the nationalist youth ) . In short , the debates and arguments , as well as the street fights and riots , that pockmarked Weimar Germanys politically fractured landscape replayed themselves not just in books , scholarly journals , and other traditional intellectual venues . They also took place in the rhetorical struggles on the pages of the popular press and in a diverse array of narrative photographic forms . <p> The publications on Seidenstnckers newsstand are thus not significant merely because photographs appeared alongside their record of Weimar Germanys key debates . Rather , they used photographs in new waysin novel essayistic forms that did more than just illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so too did the forms in which those struggles unfolded . The turbulent final years of the Weimar Republic provided the stage for an important development in visual representation : the photo essay . The sequencing or arrangement of photographs to tell stories , make arguments , communicate ideas , elicit narratives , evoke allegories , and persuade listeners to accept new ways of seeing and thinking had accompanied the medium since its origins in the early nineteenth century . But while the photo essay did not , strictly speaking , debut in Weimar Germany , the combination of text and image in a way that shifted the terms of their interaction found its first starring role there . Just as Germanys most significant writers and thinkers advanced arguments in both the popular media and extended book-length works , so too did its most important photographers intervene in these same debates through the use of a variety of photo essay forms . Like their colleagues who published scholarly books as well as journalistic works , they published not only photo stories for the illustrated press but also longer book-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the late Weimar period , before televisions heyday , the photo essay flourished as a central , ideologically charged artifact . <p> Whereas for much of the nineteenth century , photography had been a technically complex activity associated with fine art , it had by this time become a practice in which a general , nonspecialist population could partake simply by depressing a button . Advances in printing technology had made it possible not only to reproduce photographs on paper but also to make thousands of copies of those images and disseminate them in books , newspapers , and advertisements to a new and increasingly urban mass market . As it became possible to produce photographs almost as easily as language , photographs took on new roles in original forms . To be sure , photography had never been limited exclusively to illustrating text . But the emergence of forms that more ambitiously replicated the functions and effects of traditional written language suggests that in the cultural crucible of Weimar Germany a significant and lasting shift occurred in how we understand text and image . <p> This book examines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Weimar photo essaythrough readings of several seminal works and examinations of the discursive contexts in which they appeared . The newspaper photo stories alluded to in Seidenstnckers image as well as other forms , including portrait collections , book-length assemblages of nature photography , and experimental modernist photobooks , all reveal photographys broad linguistic dimensions . Photographers could organize photographs with greater and lesser degrees of structure and use them to tell stories , make arguments , communicate ideas , and persuade listenerssuch as the art criticto see , think , and ultimately act in new ways . To the reader , student , and scholar of Weimar Germany today , the photo essay provides a unique lens through which to read , or rather reread , this tumultuous but exciting era in modern German history and to examine a profound sense of enthusiasm for a new representational technology . <p> If , as theorists ranging from the sociologist Georg Simmel to the German Jewish philosopher and cultural critic Walter Benjamin have suggested , modernity consists of a series of shock experiences , then the photo essay , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allows modernity to illuminate itself by means of a form constructed from these very shocks . The photo essay opens up a critical period of German cultural history by utilizing one of that periods unique forms of self-representation . We see this eras dramas and crises " acted out " in photo essays , and , consequently , reading the photo essays from the later years of the Weimar Republic let 's us excavate and reconstruct key debates with a level of detail unique to photography . We can then see how the ostensible " objectivity " of photographs in fact skewed and molded the ways in which audiences perceived the world around them . <p> By the mid- to late 1920s , German photographers , thinkers , and criticsclearly influenced by the ubiquity and popularity of such varied forms of narratively organized photographycommented explicitly on photographys " language-like " abilities . In 1928 , using the phrase that Walter Benjamin would later famously cite in " Little History of Photography , " the painter , photographer , and Bauhaus professor Lszl= Moholy-Nagy noted in his essay " Fotografie ist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illiterates of the future would be those who could not read images , rather than words . Writing in Das Kunstblatt ( The art paper ) in 1928 , Johannes Molzahn , another painter and photography enthusiast , appealed to his readers with the title " Nicht mehr Lesen ! Sehen ! " ( " Stop Reading ! Look ! " ) . He too highlighted photographys affinities to written language by implying that photographs could do the work of written words . Benjamin , Moholy-Nagy , Molzahn , and many others demanded that photography not be defined and understood solely in opposition to painting or other art forms . Photography was not simply a form of painting for the artistically unskilled . Rather , it was to be understood in terms of its own capabilities and limitations as a mediumof which signification akin to writing was a part . In their own lifetimes , writers and photographers had seen this potential realized and exploited in entirely new ways . It was becoming clear that photography was coming into its own as a means of communication . In 1927 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deutsche Lichtbild ( The German photograph ) that this uniquely modern medium must be understood on its own terms . " Let us . . . leave art to the artists , " he wrote , " and let us try to use the medium of photography to create photographs that can endure because of their photographic qualitieswithout borrowing from art . " <p> This book approaches this moment of the visual turn in German modernism with the fundamental premise that the diverse manifestations and subgenres of the photo essay in Weimar Germany were both a reflection of and contributor to the enormous changes in culture , society , and technology during this tumultuous period . As Pepper Stetler has eloquently argued with reference to photobooks , these forms " staged dialectics of unity and fragmentation , coherence and discord that were at the heart of visual experiences in the Weimar Republic .

German photo essays of the late 1920s and early 1930s blossomed as a distinctly modern , technologically inflected vehicle used by writers and photographers to participate in crucial aesthetic , political , and cultural debates . Yet for all of the familiar focus on Weimar cinema , scholarship has not paid nearly as much attention to photo essays , even though millions of readers encountered them in illustrated magazines and books and even though twenty periodicals ( illustrated and otherwise ) were sold for every movie ticket . <p> Toward a Definition of the Photo Essay <p> Many of the photo essay forms that this book documents and interprets have previously been examined individuallymost often in the context of artworks by individual photographersas examples of the burgeoning practice of photojournalism in illustrated magazines or as examples of the photobook . Scholarship has not , however , considered these ostensibly discrete photographic forms together as legitimate objects of comparison , because to todays viewers they do not appear to be so similar .

Yet contemporaries in Weimar Germany understood these varied forms of narrative photography as belonging to the same visual turn about which Benjamin , Moholy-Nagy , and Molzahn spoke . Writers , photographers , editors , and cultural commentators viewed the traffic in photographs and the new ubiquity of photographically illustrated books , magazines , advertisements , and other publications as , in one journalists words , " a sign of the times . " The photographers who published photobooks with more explicitly aesthetic pretensions regularly sold individual images to photographically illustrated magazines known as Illustrierten to be used in these publications own forays into narrative photography . <p> Moreover , these diverse photo essay forms evince shared concern with the pressing ( and also not so pressing ) political and social issues of their time and the optimistic view that photography could help resolve them : the fragility of Weimar democracy after the compounded crises of defeat in World War I , including political revolution and hyperinflation ; the profound transformations of the natural world in the modern age ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance ; and , of course , the manifold new forms of diversion and recreation available in a modernized world . Photographers with profoundly heterogeneous political and aesthetic leanings and thematic interests in Weimar Germany produced important works about a long list of important topics . The Bauhaus-trained photographer Moishe Vorobeichic reflected on the fate of Jews in the face of modernity and secularization in Vilna : Ein Ghetto i 'm Osten ( The Ghetto Lane in Vilna ) . Else NeulSnder-Simon , working pseudonymously as Yva , composed picture stories for the culture magazine Uhu about changing gender roles and the figure of die Neue Frau ( the New Woman ) . Essayist and satirist Kurt Tucholsky teamed with the Dadaist photomonteur John Heartfield to criticize rabid nationalism in Deutschland , Deutschland nber alles . And architect Erich Mendelssohn dissected Germanys love-hate relationship with America in Amerika : Bilderbuch eines Architekten ( America : An Architects Picture Book ) .

In photo essays , photographs may have functioned like written or spoken language , but as with written or spoken language , they could also be co-opted and misused . <p> Aside from their common historical origins and shared thematic interests , photo essays are also significant as a marker of an important aesthetic change more often considered in the context of written language . Like the major works by modernist authors such as Alfred Dblin , Marcel Proust , or James Joyce , narrative photography participated in modernisms challenge to traditional modes of reading and understanding . The presence of photographs in print media demanded that audiences learn to read the pages in front of them in new ways . Regarding the relationship of text and image in interwar Europe , art historian Matthew S. Witkovsky has rightfully suggested that photo essays " shifted the traditional terms of their interaction . " The diverse photo essay forms of Weimar Germany are evidence of this shifting , which makes it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity that today may not seem as self-evident . <p> Many contemporaries indeed recognized such a shift . In the photobook Es kommt der neue Fotograf ! ( Here Comes the New Photographer ! ) , Werner Graeff celebrated photographys power in various fields of human endeavor , including art , science , journalism , and advertising . Assembled in connection with the Deutscher Werkbunds 1929 Film und Foto ( FiFo ) exhibitiona retrospective look at the vast changes in visual culture in 1929Graeffs book also provided examples of distinct forms of photographic texts . Alongside examples of " art photography , " including camera-less photograms , photomontages , and sharply focused still lifes , Graeff singled out photographys commercial and functional uses , especially in newspaper photoreportage , advertising , and propaganda . All of these forms appeared in a book that , as we shall see , self-referentially exemplified a broad-based and historically unprecedented openness on the part of photographers and readers to this modern mediums myriad rhetorical possibilities . If we consider the photo essay and its constituent subgenresboth those today considered closer to art and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these different kinds of photography . It also helps us grasp the photo essays development , including the new ubiquity of the photograph and the new receptivity to photography , as part of a broad-based cultural trend in Weimar Germany . <p> Whatever their physical appearance or aesthetic status today , Weimar photo essays share other significant affinities , particularly as commodities produced and consumed in a bustling consumer economy . The works of August Sander and Albert Renger-Patzsch offer two useful examples . Like many of the photographers known for their art books , both Sander and Renger-Patzsch were , in their " day jobs , " commercial photographers who took portraits ( Sander ) and photographed industrial objects ( Renger-Patzsch ) for clients , and they also sold photographs to image-hungry Illustrierten . Sanders business correspondence contains exchanges with Peter Suhrkamp , the editor of the Ullstein publishing companys culture magazine Uhu , that show he understood the various uses of his photographs , both in newspapers and in his photobook Antlitz der Zeit ( Face of Our Time ) , as interrelated and not mutually exclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Die Welt ist schn ( The World Is Beautiful ) , the Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung published a short photo story with Renger-Patzschs photographs and a laudatory review by Thomas Mann on December 23 , 1928 . Such examples underscore the value of approaching the photobooks for which photographers are best known today alongside the other photo essay forms , including more ephemeral ones such as photoreportage , in which their work sometimes appeared . These varied photo essay forms were all part of a new traffic in photographs that revealed the thorough interconnectedness of the previously more autonomous realms of commercial photography and art photography . All were possible because of a new receptivity to , and new optimism about , mechanically produced imagery . <p> Scholarship has not generally considered the many interrelated but discrete photo essay genres with an eye to how they developed in the specific cultural-historical milieu of Weimar Germany . What has emerged instead is a scholarly literature that focuses more on individual photo essay subgenres than on their shared conceptual frameworks and historical commonalities . In other words , the focus tends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they meant in their own time . For instance , the two-volume work The Photobook : A History , by Martin Parr and Gerry Badger , elides photo essay subgenres , including portrait books , anthologies , and literature/photography hybrids , framing them primarily as fetishizable objects for art-historical connoisseurship or aesthetic contemplation . Photo essays from Weimar Germany receive no special attention in spite of their influential and pioneering role in the forms development . Parr and Badger define the photobook through references to other art forms such as the " literary novel " and as a work akin to the output of the cinematic auteur . Such scholarship , which also includes Andrew Roths The Book of 101 Books and The Open Book : A History of the Photographic Book from 1878 to the Present , often appears in the context of exhibition catalogues . This trend in scholarship demarcates the photobook as a discrete and aesthetically autonomous object . Such fetishistic interest in this type of photo essay derives more from an appreciation of photo essays physical form than from extensive interest in their conceptual unity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially downplayed , oversimplified , or ignored . <p> Along similar lines , scholarship on photoreportage does not typically consider the interconnectedness of newspaper photo stories and photobooks . Discussion of the journalistic photo essay often appears in histories of a " golden age " of photojournalism , where it is understood in isolation and with a profound degree of nostalgia as a moment in the history of journalism that television and later the Internet have rendered quaintly anachronistic . Histories such as Tim Gidals firsthand accounts of the origins and evolution of modern photojournalism rightfully emphasize the novelty of photoreportage in Weimar Germany and the pioneering roles of certain figures . But they generally do not integrate the formal achievements of newspaper photo stories and their focus on using images to tell stories , construct arguments , and communicate into broader trends of narrative photographic forms and the profound enthusiasm for them in Weimar society . At the same time , these studies retroactively construct the world of interwar German photojournalism as an " all-boys club " of intrepid male reporters and downplay or completely ignore the contributions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lex-Nerlinger , Else NeulSnder-Simon ( Yva ) , and other important women photographers . The gendered narrative of photojournalism would , decades later , have to be correctively reinscribed into the foundational story of Weimar photography . <p> Interpreting the Photo Essay <p> For all of the formal and thematic diversity apparent in the photo essays constituent subgenres , what unites these forms is not what they are as objects but what they do as forms of narrative . This naturally invites two questions : What do they in fact do ( or , at least , what did they try to do ) and how should one approach them ? Just as modernist literatures narrative strategies of interior monologues , collage , and self-reflexivity challenged traditional modes of reading , so too did photo essays make reading into an interactive endeavor resembling a kind of game . If the complicated and quasi-linguistic relationships between individual photographs and an entire photographic narrative presented new opportunities for authorial expression , they also challenged traditional modes of reading . Readers encountered photo essays in familiar venues , particularly in the popular press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thematic focus , demanded that they be read with attention to their proximate historical contexts . Photo essays structure relationships between their parts ( individual photographs ) and their whole ( the entire narrative ) with greater and lesser degrees of narrative unity . In some cases , as in photographic anthologies , subject matter presented in an introductory text creates structure by virtue of thematic commonalities . In illustrated magazines , commercial considerations such as advertising space , the need for attractive images , and even the boundaries of a tabloid-size page ( or pages ) condition the look and feel of individual photo stories . In still other cases , as in the photobooks Face of Our Time by Sander and The World Is Beautiful by Renger-Patzsch , subtle formal traits or narrative rhythms govern the sequencing of images , and textual accompaniment is relegated to short captions , checklists at the back of the book , or extended narrative introductions . <p> This diversity of narrative structures carries with it the demand to develop new modes of reading . This book takes as its interpretive approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulated in his Denkbild ( thought figure ) " Brezel , Feder , Pause , Klage , Firlefanz " ( " Pretzel , Feather , Pause , Lament , Clothing " ) . Benjamin described a Biedermeier-era parlor game that offers a useful conceptual model for thinking about how , specifically , photo essays construct , reconfigure , and even resist our attempts to read and interpret them . In the parlor game , each player had to link a series of ostensibly unrelated words into a coherent sentence . The goal was to construct the shortest sentence possible out of the given words . Benjamin imagines the creative movement between these parts as a paradigm for all forms of reading and writing , noting that " in reality , something of this perspective is contained in every act of reading . " Photo essays complicate this further because they consist of another set of symbolsphotographsthat have generated their own mythologies of straightforwardness and immediacy . Those symbols are inscribed , organized , or sequenced into an additional syntactic structure . Although composed of discrete images , this sum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs and words ) . <p> The entirety of the montage of images in a photo essay becomes what Umberto Eco has theorized as an " open work , " one that " produces in the interpreter acts of conscious freedom , putting him at the center of a net of inexhaustible relations among which he inserts his own form . " This new mode of textuality both invokes and differs from traditional forms of reading and writing . In their various guises , photographic narratives and sequences evoke explicit or implicit meanings for readers . The burden of interpreting those meanings falls to the readers , who must mediate a photographs denotative and connotative dimensions . With some photo essay genresnotably photo stories in illustrated magazines or explicitly didactic photobooks such as Graeffs Here Comes the New Photographer ! titles , captions , accompanying articles , and introductory essays quickly constrain interpretive possibilities and elicit specific interpretations . With other forms , however , especially those in which images feature only captions , " overreading " emerges as a significant danger for photographic narratives . Photography criticism is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical excess . " The reason for accusing critics of overreading rests largely on the received but misguided tendency to " underread " imagesthat is , to subscribe to the nanve rhetoric of photographic indexicality and transparency and the corollary belief that photographs do not require interpretation because they somehow " speak for themselves . " In other cases , the act of critical photographic interpretation is perceived as an affront to the beauty of the photograph as an artwork . <p> A final issue related to the method of interpreting diverse photo essay forms is that of nomenclature . Why is the form called a photo essay and not , for instance , as W. J. T. Mitchell asks , a " photo novel " or " photo lyric " ? And what do such names imply ? In posing this question , Mitchell rightfully stresses affinities between diverse photo essayistic forms ( photoreportage , photobooks , anthologies ) and the referential and experimental qualities of personal and informal essays . Mitchell notes that one typically encounters essays ( traditional or photo ) in the context of books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that both written essays and photo essays emphasize private viewpoints , personal memories , and autobiographical concerns , a cultural history of the visual essay form is wise to combine " literary " or " textual " approaches with historical contextualization or photographic criticism . The generally reflective , subjective , and unsystematic nature of essays nevertheless poses very real difficulties for scholarship . Theodor Adorno suggested as much in " Der Essay als Form " ( " The Essay as Form " ) when he argued , " The essay . . . does not let its domain be prescribed for it . " Studies of the German essay tradition range from Ludwig Rohners multivolume attempt to establish a canon of German essays ( on the one hand ) to Adornos objection ( on the other ) that the object of evaluation will necessarily cause any such totalizing approach to fail . Writing a history of the photo essay presents similar challenges . <p> The enormous number of photo essays that appeared in Weimar Germany offers a rich corpus from which to choose examples of the forms many manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the Weimar photo essay based on close readings of examples by well-known photo essayists of the time . The subsequent chapters present analyses of their works , which speak to the diverse range of photo essayistic forms : photobooks marketed in connection with important art exhibitions that announced new roles for photography ; photo stories about current events in Illustrierten , which became the public laboratories for experimentation with photographic narratives ; portrait books that influenced intellectuals and public opinion ; and photo essays that provided grist for propagandists across the political spectrum . Although one could easily include other works in lieu of or in addition to those addressed here , I have chosen instead to structure this cultural history of the Weimar photo essay in a manner similar to the form it analyzes : this study selects revealing examples from a larger corpus of texts and , like the player in the Biedermeier parlor game , navigates them in , one would hope , an interesting and elegant manner . <p> Chapters 1 and 2 present broader background on the aesthetic and cultural context of Weimar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their status as photographic narratives . Chapter 1 historicizes the controversies surrounding photography at the time by examining Graeffs highly self-referential work Here Comes the New Photographer ! Graeffs popularization of the principles of the constructivist avant-garde movement known as the Neues Sehen ( New Vision ) stands out for many reasons . Most of all , it was a key indicator of the new receptivity to and optimism about the new photographic forms that became a hallmark of the visual culture of Weimar Germany . Graeff self-reflexively draws attention to his use of photography , but for more programmatic purposes . His book not only catalogues the various formal techniques that photographers used in photo essays but also directly refutes critics objections to photography . Graeff accomplishes these rhetorical goals performatively . In Here Comes the New Photographer ! he does not simply advocate for photography ; he uses a photographic narrative as his vehicle of choice for promoting a new medium and its communicative possibilities . <p> Chapter 2 examines the crucial intermediary space between still images and book-length photo essays : the popular photo stories of Illustrierten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public most frequently encountered narrative photography . Although contemporary critics attacked the image-heavy Illustriertenas sensational examples of a " dumbed-down " culture , these magazines offered an important space for experiments in photographic form , both by editors such as Kurt Korff and Stefan Lorant and by star photojournalists , some of whom published book-length photo essays alongside their work as freelance or commercial photographers . When these same photographers published photobooks , they did so fully cognizant of the impact of formal sequencing on the ways in which their photographs conveyed meaning . As a close reading of the photo essays within a single issue of Lorants Mnnchner Illustrierte Presse shows , however , Illustriertenwere not simply a sign of a broader shift in sensibilities toward images ; they played an active role in that shift by enthusiastically showcasing how they used photography . They regularly trumpeted photographys potential to teach readers a new way of seeing and interpreting the complex world around them , and in their layouts they encouraged specific modes of perception vis-a-vis groups of multiple photographs . Nevertheless , as we shall see , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demystifying the complexity of Weimar Germany , Illustriertenmerely added more layers to it . Through new forms and new formal techniques , illustrated magazines presented narrative photography as a path to greater knowledge and enlightenment about the rapidly changing world . Yet these same forms and techniques were readily co-opted for reactionary purposes , even if they maintained the sheen of " the new . " <p> Unlike the short photo stories of Illustriertenor a polemic such as Here Comes the New Photographer ! , which actively guided readers through accompanying text and captions , extended book-length photo essays ( photobooks ) more actively segregated text from image . This photo essay form became an important means by which photographers addressed pressing philosophical and cultural concerns of Weimar Germany . Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 present case studies of sets of photobooks that coalesced around specific thematic interests . These chapters examine how photo essays can be understood as being in dialogue with other photographic forms as well as traditional essay forms . Chapter 3 argues that photobooks constructed from still photographs of flowers and landscapesostensibly benign subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated debates about urbanism and modernization . Albert Renger-Patzschs Die Welt ist schn ( The World Is Beautiful ) and Paul Dobes Wilde Blumen der deutschen Flora ( Wildflowers of German flora ) offer antagonistic arguments about nature , a category regularly invoked in literary and philosophical texts to criticize urbanism , to justify back-to-basics social practices ranging from dietary reform to physical fitness , and to justify racist ideologies . As a thematically organized set of flower photographs with an incendiary introductory text , Dobes photobook rather uncritically venerates " the natural . " By contrast , Renger-Patzschs photobook lends itself to a reading more in line with a culture whose expressions of a " return to nature " ethos were as varied as nudist Freikrperkultur ( free body culture ) and youth-based scouting movements such as the Wandervogel ( literally , migratory bird ) . Through a contrapuntally sequenced photo essay , Renger-Patzsch argues against those who would uncritically venerate nature as the cure for all of the modern worlds ills . First , he establishes a narrative rhythm of thematically linked photographs . He then introduces jarring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is a photographic series inviting readers to question the reductiveness of the " return to nature " idealism that held such currency among vlkisch nationalists , those invested in the idea that their identity was linked organically to German blood and German soil . <p> From this discussion of the " nature of nature " discourse in the photobook , chapter 4 moves to a more specific analysis of the " German condition " by examining the role of another photo essay subgenre , the portrait collection , in Weimar-era debates on national and racial identity . Alongside photobooks such as Helmar Lerskis Kpfe des Alltags ( Everyday heads ) and Erna Lendvai-Dircksens Das deutsche Volksgesicht ( The face of the Germanic folk ) , August Sanders Antlitz der Zeit ( Face of Our Time ) invokes the rhetoric of physiognomy , the belief that external bodily characteristics are indicative of deeper psychological and spiritual conditions . Featuring a sequence of portraits organized in a rise-and-fall narrative structure that accords with a model theorized by Oswald Spengler , whose work Sander admired , Face of Our Time offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sander participated in the widespread contemporary interest in Germany that sought to come to grips with its identity crisis and to diagnose and define it amid the economic and political turmoil of the 1920s and early 1930s . Sanders photobook concurrently provides a new optic through which to read Walter Benjamins Deutsche Menschen ( German Men and Women ) , an essayistic , chronologically organized collection of letters expressing similar interests in physiognomy , photography , and defining the time . Benjamins text pays homage to Sander ( famously calling his work a " training manual " ) but ultimately critiques Sanders faith in the use of photographic typologies and individual examples to make broader claims about German identity . Benjamin uses language to do the work that Sander does with photographs , but he arrives at a different conclusion . He maintains an optimism about Germany , even though he published his book in 1936 during the dark years of fascism . The implicit dialogue between these works stresses the photo essays important links to the Weimar culture of feuilletons and essay writing . <p> Chapter 5 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from snapshots : star photojournalist Dr. Erich Salomons Bernhmte Zeitgenossen in unbewachten Augenblicken ( Famous contemporaries in unguarded moments ) and Ferdinand Bucholtz and Ernst Jnngers anthology Der gefShrliche Augenblick ( The dangerous moment ) . These works represent two different photo essayistic responses to Weimar Germanys rhetoric of crisis , struggle , and the decisive moment . Their authors used photography to address this widespread and inflated rhetoric . However , whereas the photobook by the socially well-connected Salomon offers a more affirmative view of parliamentary democracyalbeit one that , considering Salomons vulnerability as a German Jew , appears strikingly nanve in retrospectBucholtz and Jnnger explicitly celebrate danger and condemn the reigning liberal order . These works stage an implicit debate about who controlled discourse . While loaded words and phrases such as Kampf ( struggle ) and Moment der Entscheidung ( moment of decision ) have become synonymous with the Right and its attempts to expand its popular appeal , Salomons work shows that these termsand the historical situation in which they were anchoredwere far from predestined in Weimar Germany . <p> By way of conclusion , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period following 1933 and beyond . Many of the notable figures of Weimar Germanys photo essay culture went into exile or , as in Salomons case , met their deaths in concentration camps . At the same time , however , photo essays and photobooks continued to blossom . Even before 1933 , the new modes of perception that photo essays encouraged were being co-opted for propaganda purposes , and after the rise of National Socialism this trend continued in force . Modernist photography and narrative photography did not simply disappear . Rather , the new regime adapted them for its own purposes , where they served very different cultural and political roles , with horrific consequences .

Today , people deposit their savings with banks , make use of their payment facilities , invest through their brokerage offices , get cash at electronic tellers , and apply for mortgages by filling out standardized forms . Banks are ubiquitous financial institutions today , but they are a relatively recent phenomenon . In Mexico , before the existence of banks in the late nineteenth century , nonbank financial intermediaries handled most of the financial tasks we associate with banks . For all we know about banks , we still know very little about how the intermediaries that predate them functioned and who precisely they were . For example , absent specific formation charters , how did they become intermediaries in the first place , and what circumstancesbe they legal , political , economic , or simply accidentalput them in a position to provide financial intermediation and do so in such a way to influence and create markets ? <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth happened without bankswhich is Yucatns story and the topic of this book . Yucatn , like many regions in Latin America , experienced a protracted economic boom during the nineteenth century . Foreign demand for henequen , a local cordage fiber , stimulated the economy out if its postcolonial slump . Henequen had been used as naval cordage in the early nineteenth century and became the preferred binding twine in mechanical wheat binders in the United States and Canada in the late nineteenth century . Fueled by this demand for a primary good that was almost exclusive to the region , modern Yucatn transformed from a cattle-ranching and subsistence-farming society into a booming export-oriented agricultural economy . <p> In the context of Yucatns nineteenth-century agricultural boom , this book studies how credit markets worked before the emergence of modern banks . The boom occurred without the assistance of modern financial institutions ; instead , mortgage loans arranged through local notaries raised the capital that land owners and merchants invested in crops and infrastructure . The importance of these informal or personal credit markets in supporting productive activities that generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which tradespeople , personal loans , and religious institutions advanced loans . The novelty of the Yucatn case is that personal credit networks continued to be important in the nineteenth century and were very quickly mobilized through the person of the notary to finance one of the major commodity booms in Latin American history . <p> This finding challenges the notion that large-scale investment capital could be mobilized only through formal financial institutions or through specialized enterprises directly engaged in the henequen trade . Yucatn changed from a regional backwater into a participant in the global cordage market , and it did so without any local banks . While foreign brokers extended trade loans to the most important producers and traders of henequen , all other participants in the local economy carried Yucatn from its colonial past into modernity by relying on traditional forms of personal finance . <p> Even though personal credit was probably the major source of credit in most countries before the twentieth century , we know little about how these personal mortgage markets worked in Latin America . Historical research on credit markets has focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories and assumed that informal markets did not support a large enough part of the market . The case of Yucatn analyzed here overturns this assumption . <p> This book provides an analysis of how intermediaries mobilized personal credit markets through the office of notaries , many of which became unwitting catalysts of Yucatns capitalist transformation . It provides a crucial addition to the historiography of formal institutional finance , showing that interpersonal credit markets operated before the creation of banks and that notaries were crucial financial intermediaries . In Yucatns personal , informal , and small credit market , notaries embodied trust , monitored reputations , managed networks , and provided social enforcement to support the flow of credit . This example of economic growth supported by financial alternatives demonstrates that additional and important sources of credit can exist before and , perhaps most importantly , without banks . <p> Economic Growth <p> Latin Americas development lag compared to the United States or Europe has occupied historians for quite some time , and the explanations draw a picture of a development process marred by the colonial experience .

However , it is difficult to connect modern transformations , or the lack thereof , to the colonial period alone , and the colonial legacy certainly can not explain the different patterns of financial development among Latin American countries after independence from Spain and Portugal . <p> Independence did unshackle Mexico from the straightjacket of colonial commercial restraints . The progressive purpose of many of its postindependence presidents was to catch up with Europe and leave the colonial legacy behind . Both conservatives and liberals were dedicated to reinvigorating Mexicos economic position and reclaiming a place in the global trade network , which Mexico had lost when it separated from Spain . The political instability and conflict between political factions probably delayed this economic revival in the nineteenth century , but Mexico , like many other Latin American countries , benefited from a primary goods export boom fueled by the industrialization of the other parts of the world .

This did in fact happen , as state-chartered banks opened throughout the Americas in the nineteenth century , starting with the Banco Comercial de Rfo de Janeiro and the Banco do Brasil in 1851 . The two merged in 1853 to form the first and largest institution of commercial credit in Latin America . Also in this period the Argentinian government established the charter of operations for its Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires , the first locally funded and managed bank , which became the first bank to issue long-term residential loans in 1856 . <p> In Mexico the first Mexican private banks were formed even later , during Emperor Maximilians reign ( 186467 ) , but these banks functioned more as royal treasuries than as modern banks .

The Banco de Santa Eulalia , chartered in 1875 , was the first ; the Banco Nacional de MTxico , chartered in 1882 , was the most important . In late nineteenth-century Mexico , the Banco de MTxico had almost exclusive note-issuance privileges , managed the governments budget , and was in charge of servicing the governments domestic and foreign debt ; some have argued that it acted like Mexicos de facto banker of last resort . Regional banks also expanded during this period , and Yucatns henequen traders followed suit and opened two banks in 1889 . <p> Yucatns growth predates the birth of local banks in 1889 , and henequen had been harvested and processed on local plantations in increasing amounts since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance that expansion , that foreign brokers mostly financed trade , and that henequen plants had a seven-year seed-to-plant maturation time , how did the Yucatecan economy finance its long-term investments ? <p> To answer this question we need to think of the financial role of institutions and actors that are not banks . Banks are only the most recent embodiment of financial institutions , and the focus on banks as vehicles of economic growth obscures the fact that debt was ubiquitous well before the creation of banks . From the commitment letters of eleventh-century Maghribi traders to trading debts of Spanish merchants in New Spain and the mundane debts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English parishioners , there is reliable and plentiful evidence of active credit markets throughout the world that existed without banks . This was doubly true in nineteenth-century Yucatn , where the demand for henequen and the lack of banks promoted the growth of a market for personal loans . The notarial ledgers maintained in the Yucatn archives confirm that credit markets do not require banks to exist . They also reveal that notaries , not banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local economic growth . What the market needed was n't necessarily banks , but the existence of financial intermediaries that could perform the functions that banks eventually internalized . <p> The literature on Yucatn has focused justifiably on the role of trading houses and import-export houses such as Escalante y Compafa and Molina y Compafa . These institutions preceded banks and were created to support those involved in the henequen trade , to whom they advanced large sums of capital each planting season and on behalf of whom they negotiated with foreign purchasers over the price of henequen in return for product . The trading houses were crucial in the global reach of henequen , and they structured the market in ways very advantageous to themthereby guaranteeing a majority share in both the business sphere and the politics of Yucatn . As financial intermediaries , however , the trading houses were relative latecomers and imperfect coordinators . Trading houses lent exclusively to planters that could repay them in fiber , which excluded smaller planters and anyone not borrowing for a henequen plantation . <p> The financial intermediaries that supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of the credit market beyond the strict limits of the henequen producers were the notaries , who sit at the heart of this book and at the intersection of market norms and social norms . They facilitated contact between borrowers and lenders without doing any lending themselves , and in doing so , their intermediary role was closely tied to their social role . The role of notaries is often overlooked in this context , and they deserve to be analyzed in depth to reinterpret and recast their place in society and history as well as in the functioning of an economy . <p> This book steps away from the traditional emphasis on banks in financial studies and reconceptualizes the financial market through the role of intermediaries . In shifting the perspective from formal financial institutions to notaries , the book joins a body of research on informal relations in marketspart of a growing scholarship that studies informal mechanisms of credit distribution and demonstrates the importance of such mechanisms in developing economies . <p> Financial Intermediation <p> The roles performed by notaries in financial markets position the notaries firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mexicos modern financial system . As embodiments of the civic trust , notaries recorded the transactions that trace Mexicos capitalist transformation from Spanish colony to independent republic . The trust embodied in the notarial institution and the informal nature of the networks in which notaries worked underscores the importance of informal institutions and traditional mechanisms of trust in the transition to modernity . <p> Time-honored figures in the Spanish and French legal tradition of recording civil transactions , notaries were the main contact between civil society and the body of laws imposed by successive governments in colonial and independent Mexico . Notaries were a source of stability throughout the changes in governance and laws . They continued their record-keeping tasks no matter what the political , economic , or diplomatic circumstance , as their core activities were relatively impervious to wars and revolutions . As a historical documentary source , notaries provide a privileged perspective into the reverberations of social , political , and economic upheavals . <p> The constancy of notarial activity is particularly useful when studying economic markets during the tumultuous nineteenth century . Mexico was wracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals and the federalist conservatives erupted in civil wars . The first half of the century was a period during which Mexico faced secession both in the north and in the south . Texas seceded successfully in 1836 and Yucatn tried but failed in 1844 . Invasions , both by the United States as well as European powers , followed . <p> It was a period of economic distress ( especially in the immediate aftermath of independence ) and economic rebound . It was also a period of legal reform and political exploration . Mexico started the nineteenth century as a colony , was twice an empire and , depending on how they are counted , supported about seventy-five separate presidencies . In the midst of this chaos , notaries recorded contracts and continued to perform their civic duties , continued to be not just the pillar of civil contracting but a bulwark against the changing political and economic landscape . <p> The Mexican independence wars were a significant shock to the Mexican economy , most obviously on the rates of economic growth and the level of exports and trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these losses and the imposition of calm under Porfirio Dfaz are part of the great successes and contradictions of this period in Mexicos history . And below the surface of the political conflicts and rearrangements , informal institutions and intermediaries weathered the shocks and continued operating . In Mexico City , for example , pawnshops , one of the oldest operating short-term credit providers , did not stop during the independence wars or the revolution in the early twentieth century . This was also the case for the mortgage market in Yucatn during the period covered in this book . Notaries oversaw the private credit market and recorded private mortgages with interest rates that reflected changes in laws and perceived risks in the markets , operating for all intents and purposes like financial brokers . Mortgage banks , on the other hand , had to wait until the last decade of the nineteenth century to get a charter and begin operating in the Yucatn Peninsula . <p> Contrary to notaries , banks first started operating in MTrida , the capital of Yucatn , in the late nineteenth century , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was privately allocated through long-term collateralized credit in the form of mortgage loans . Save for foreign-trade credit ( reserved for large traders during the boom ) and pawnshop credit ( in smaller amounts but among a larger proportion of the population ) , such loans could be legal and enforceable only if they were recorded in a notarys office and carried the notarial seal . Even after banks opened in Yucatn , their lending terms were limited , and while foreign brokerage houses provided longer-term loans for henequen production and export , these loans were limited to all but the biggest producers . The last and often only option for secured credit during the nineteenth century was the mortgage loan or contract ( I often refer to them as " mortgages " throughout the book ) . <p> In this setting where land was wealth and banks did not exist , mortgage credit became the single and most widely used mechanism to raise long-term debt . This does not discount the role of alternative credit sources , but it does emphasize the widespread use and deep reliance on long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventures , and there is evidence that the use of mortgages to finance productive activity was not limited to Yucatn . The textile industry in the state of Veracruz also used mortgage credit to finance itself in the nineteenth century . And beyond Mexico , mortgages also fueled the French financial and industrial markets in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . <p> Nineteenth-Century Economic History <p> The importance of mortgages and nontraditional financial intermediaries has received relatively little attention because , traditionally , financial institutions and development in Latin America has been analyzed in comparison to the economic histories of Europe and the United States . Modern institutional deposit and investment banks are a feature of European and U.S. economic history , and the delay in development in other parts of the world has been analyzed through the prism of the standards that have come before them . This perspective has skewed our view of markets in the developing world , leading many to ask why banks in Mexico , Morocco , or Malaysia , for example , did not arise at the same time , play the same role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in Western Europe and the United States . <p> Today , many scholars of Latin American financial development are reversing this trend and studying local development without relying on these traditional comparisons . Gail Triner advances our understanding of banks and the intricacy of their corporate governance in Brazil , and Aldo Musacchio overturns many assumptions about the effect of the colonial legacy on Brazilian economic development , much as Leonor Ludlow , Carlos Marichal , Steve Haber , Gustavo del -ngel-Mobarak , and Noel Maurer have done for Mexico . Steve Habers more recent analysis of the commitments that tie governments to bank stakeholders and compel them to honor their mutual obligations complicates our understanding of the logic of Latin American financial markets . These are all groundbreaking works , especially in their break with the theoretical and empirical legacy of the dependency school . Together , these recent studies chart a new course for Latin American economic history of credit , but they still maintain a perspective that defines it as the history of banks and public finance . <p> That said , the literature on banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal credit relations were necessary for the creation and development of a national banking network . Anne Hanley has demonstrated that local networks were at the origin of the sophisticated financial institutions that marked Brazils late nineteenth-century economy and that the demands of the coffee trade combined with the end of slavery were not alone in supporting the Brazilian financial markets ; coffee traders ( or coffee factors , as they are known ) and local debt markets supported the existence of these markets before they became national , formal , and modern . <p> Historians studying the colonial period , by default , focus on nonbank intermediaries . They study the importance of traders and the church in the development of colonial markets and provide insight into the functioning of premodern credit markets . With his sweeping analysis of the Guadalajara region in the eighteenth century , Eric Van Young demonstrates that regional studies can have an explanatory impact for the rest of the area . His research determines that urban trade and agricultural production in the colonial period depended on each other not just for commodity production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Van Youngs and Linda Greenows detailed study of credit in colonial Mexico describe the overlap and dependence between producers , traders , and financers , and although neither articulates the role of intermediaries , they introduce a clear picture of socially embedded commercial interactions and a fledgling , if unidentified , role for informal intermediaries . <p> Financial and economic studies of the immediate postindependence period are few , most likely because , except for Brazil , most Latin American economies were mostly in disarray . At the national level , Barbara Tenenbaum studies the pitiful state of public finance during the revolving governments of the early independent period and shows that chaos was the one constant in this period . Margaret Chownings work on Michoacn demonstrates that not all regions in Mexico experienced the conflicts and resolutions that marked the national scene in the same way . Independence freed Mexico from the weight of the colonial regime but did not replace it with anything firm or reliable . <p> The resulting power vacuum had two sets of consequences . First , Mexicos governments were led by a revolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the colonial structure was replaced with a semifunctional independent alternative . Second , in the absence of trustworthy public institutions , personal wealth and power became achievable and noticeable goals . The historical record of the nineteenth century is long on chaos and large family fortunes , and the survival of these regional family fortunes is a pillar of nineteenth-century studies . David Walkers and Alex Saragozas studies of kinship and wealth in the nineteenth century hint at the role of informal relations in markets and argue in favor of the family and kinship networks as agents of these markets . <p> Families and the reliance on kinship networks in Latin America have often been used to explain its economic development lagespecially in the case of Yucatn , where the mythical power of the " Casta Divina " overshadows many of the studies of the henequen boom . The Casta Divina is the term used to refer to a group of wealthy families who owned a significant share of the land and wielded considerable political power in nineteenth-century Yucatn . The Molina clan , the Pe=n family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their existence has served to reinforce the fact that in Yucatn , as in the rest of Mexico , family networks , interlocking business directorates , and other forms of insider lending were a response to a lack of trust in and the pervasive weakness of the legal and governmental institutions . The argument that kinship networks and preexisting institutions were at the root of the inefficiencies in the economic system of Mexico has great explanatory thrust , but the existence of overlapping family connections in business can not prove that it was the driving force . The evidence from the mortgage market in Yucatn suggest that kin was not necessarily king . This point has been made by economic sociologists who recognize and demonstrate that intangible elements such as trust can hold more value than any material or familial bondand that the less obvious ties ( the ones Mark Granovetter calls " weak " ) may be the ones holding the network together . <p> Apart from kinship and delayed financial development , property rights also address the delay in the development of financial markets in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability . Douglass North best articulates the effect that legal constraints could have on economic activity in the United States and Europe , but no one has illustrated it more convincingly for Latin America than Hernando de Soto . De Soto recognizes the static property rights of land ownership in Peru as an obstacle to the development of credit markets and a cause of poverty in the countryside . In the Peruvian twentieth-century context , de Soto identifies this as a leading cause of terrorism and instability . Like de Soto , historians of the Mexican Revolution made the connection between the massive land privatizations of the nineteenth century and the revolution , but de Sotos work provides a theoretical and empirical context in which to conceptualize the problem . The exclusion of different constituencies from credit markets , and markets in general , can benefit greatly from being understood as a consequence of property rights regimes . Bringing this back to Yucatn , the absence of ethnic Mayas from the mortgage market and the conditions under which women participated is best understood as a reflection of market responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ethnic bias or sexism . <p> Notarial Sources <p> Because of notaries integral role in the judicial system ( contrary to lawyers , who had no obligation to record their transactions ) , notaries recorded all civil agreements and contracts , as well as the detailed notes of those agreements between their clients . As a consequence , notarial records are a staple of historical research , and many historians have used the mundane details of personal life that notaries recorded . The term " notary " in fact springs etymologically from this very act of " taking note , " an act performed diligently throughout the ages . The tasks they performed per their mandated functions and the records that notaries left behind are the material with which one can thoroughly document the history of the mundane acts that constitute a societys interactions . <p> The collaborative work of Philip Hoffman , Gilles Postel-Vinay , and Jean-Laurent Rosenthal , as well as research by Julie Hardwick and Donna Merwick , all rely on notaries copious notes to study their subjects and the world in which they operate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recasting him respectively as the servant of financial innovation , the embodiment of middling patriarchs , and one of the casualties of the British conquest of New York . Jointly , they rewrite history from the perspective of a humble civil servant . In the Netherlands , notaries are also the subject of renewed interest because the financial accounts they recorded and managed are an important gateway to understanding the local effects of the economic growth in the Low Lands during the heyday of exploration and foreign trade ( through the Dutch East India Company , for example ) . Among the Latin Americanists , Kathryn Burns , Catherine LeGrand , and Adriana Mercedes Corso have seen notaries as influential participants in the mundane worlds of colonial Peru and nineteenth-century Colombia . In all their works , as well as in this book , notaries are not just the providers of documentary sources ; they are the main subjects of research . <p> The records used here were collected in the State Archive of Yucatn ( Archivo General del Estado de Yucatn ; AGEY ) and its Notarial Archive ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The data set comprises all the mortgage contracts that were recorded in the surviving ledgers between 1850 and 1900 . I use every mortgage that was recorded in the ledgers from 1850 , 1860 , 1870 , 1875 , 1880 , 1885 , 1890 , and 1895 . Because sampling throughout the years would have complicated the assessment of the secular growth of the mortgage market , every mortgage contract recorded in every surviving notarial ledger in the Notarial Archive and the State Archive of Yucatn in the eight benchmark years are part of the data set . The data consists of approximately 1,000 contracts and also includes a subset of mortgages that were recorded by one of MTridas most important notaries , JosT Anacleto Patr=n Zavalegui . His data set of 448 mortgages includes every mortgage contract he recorded between 1875 and 1899 . <p> Another part of the data set consists of the debts that were recorded in more than 300 probate records . This part of the data set consists of 337 estate inventories from 1847 to 1901 and includes 128 probates from Maya decedents . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as one acknowledges the inherent bias in probates , because probates were not a standard practice and were considered " neither perfunctory nor conventional . " There are very strong variations in the probate items listed , the details of the inventories , and the depth of detail from one probate to the next . Because the conditions that led to recording a probate inventory were so disparate , none of the formulaic elements that ruled the recording of mortgage contracts appeared in the probate inventories . However , they are irreplaceable sources to reinforce the economic picture painted by the notarial contracts , and they supplement the standardized data with illustrative evidence of the pervasive uses of debt across sociodemographic strata in Yucatn . The probates used here cover a period of approximately fifty years , which while not exhaustive , is an acceptable sample for the summary uses with probates . Zephyr Frank , who wrote an excellent study of the Brazilian economy and wealth distribution in the entire nineteenth century , used approximately 659 probates . <p> Book Outline <p> This book proceeds thematically rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical background , while exploring its postcolonial transition to a capitalist economy in laying the foundation for its emerging personal credit market . In the mid-nineteenth century , Yucatn was a heterogeneous region : urban and rural , native Maya and mestizo , rich and poorall these elements collided and overlapped . The nineteenth century was also marked by the aftermath of a secession war , an ongoing civil conflict with ethnic overtones , and the agricultural henequen boom that exacerbated the regions economic disparities while increasingly tying it to the global market . <p> Chapter 3 focuses on the mortgages themselves and the development of the mortgage market in the wake of the 1857 Constitution and ensuing Reform Laws . The progressive bent of these laws , especially their reversal on the issue of the civil enforcement of usury laws , freed interest rates and opened the way for credit contracts to charge a price that reflected the risk each loan represented . This chapter addresses the importance and many interpretations of mortgages , not just as a documentary source in the book , but also as a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortgages recorded by notaries are abundant in Latin American archives , and these debt contracts became the cornerstone of the credit market in Yucatn because of changes in the legal codes and the regional infrastructure . The contracts represent more than historical documents ; they need to be understood and studied as an aggregate record of economic and social interactions in Yucatn . <p> The fourth chapter analyzes the formal and informal roles of notaries . The formal and explicit role was established by nineteenth-century laws and notarial codes . The informal role , developed as a result of the economic boom , highlighted the flexibility of the notarys inherent ability to act as an intermediary . This chapter further addresses the mechanisms by which notaries aided in the development of financial vehicles better suited to the new economic climate created by the henequen boom . Without banks , the shift from a subsistence economy to export-led growth relied on , among other things , reinterpretations of personal networks . Notaries were uniquely equipped to become intermediaries in transactions based on trust and the quality of the information on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows the mechanics of how a social network of hacienda owners and enterprising merchants , as well as members of the elite , financed a boom without banks . The analysis of notarial functions in Yucatns mortgage market reveals notaries contributions to the creation of this market . Their active participation in recording contracts and connecting clients demonstrates how , in the absence of banks , they facilitated access to credit and created networks of clients that strengthened the role of individual connections in the mortgage boom . <p> The importance and role of property rights in credit markets is the subject of the fifth chapter . The progressive reforms of Mexicos liberal legal transformation in the nineteenth century significantly expanded property rights and protection for its citizens , but it did not do this for all citizens equally . Gender was the main factor for this legal iniquity , as women had incomplete property rights , with a corresponding effect on their diminished status in Mexican society . The nineteenth century extended the legal inferiority for women that had originated in the colonial legal codes . Marriage still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moral ways , and a mother could not be the guardian of her own children if she was a widow . She could not enter into contracts on her own , she had no official or public political power , and her legal and professional roles were often in opposition or subservient to men . This legal inferiority was substantiated in the mortgage records , where the effect of property rights comes to light . While colonial records have long recorded the financial activity of widows who acquired their husbands wealth after his death and invested in local loans , the literature has never considered the implications for female borrowers or the fact that married female borrowers generally paid much higher interest than their male counterparts . This chapter highlights how laws that were not created to address or respond to credit markets profoundly affected those who participated in them . It also countervails the conventional wisdom about the position of women in Latin American societies , in credit markets , and under the law in this period . <p> Monopoly , rent-seeking behavior , and insider networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trend toward small and concentrated economic activity has generally been observed among the powerful , the elite , and the government , which centralize their power and ration access to the fruits of that power . Chapter 6 explores this tendency within the notarial profession in Yucatn . Notaries were central to the financial mechanics in Yucatn , but they can hardly be considered elite , nor was their profession the nexus of power . Notaries were only one of the many institutions of civil law and civil power , and yet the tendency toward monopoly was reflected among them too . This chapter delves into this drive toward monopoly through the case study of one of the most important notaries in MTrida and his entrepreneurial and monopolistic bent in the mortgage market . This notary provides a prime example of the role of personal connections in fostering personal success in Mexico . As this chapter on Patr=n Zavaleguis practice and business demonstrates , this much-touted characteristic of Mexicos economic markets permeates all levels of power and importance in society . As he became the engine of growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among notaries . This combination of growth , entrepreneurship , and monopoly mirrors a pattern that is all too common in Yucatn and Mexico and reveals once more the mechanisms that have long operated there . Chapter 7 provides the conclusion .

What enables them to see past the official stories and strike out for understandings of their own ? What forms of coercion and rejection are they subjected tohow costly is the freedom they achieve in terms of family affection and social acceptance ? <p> It is hard to get good evidence on these points . People do not advertise their histories , so it is not usually obvious which of us have passed this way . The editors of this book did not initially know this about each other . In the course of working together in the Ph.D . program in the Human Sciences at the George Washington University we discovered ( in the context of a small reading group on feminist ethics ) a community of personal interest in the fact that under different regimes , at different times , and in different places , we had been subjected to similar ordealsthe frequent and all too familiar ordeals of children brought up by stubbornly religious parents . We came respectively from the Exclusive Brethren in England in the 1930s and 1940s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saints in Utah in the 1970s and 1980s . It was not surprising that the dissertation topic we agreed on should reflect an interest in parental influences on the potential autonomy of their children . <p> When that work was finished and defended , we reopened a discussion that had begun along the way about the possibility of writing a joint article on the specific moral issues that arise when the convictions of one generation have a determining effect on the freedom of the next . But a scholarly article would capture only part of what concerned us ; it would not convey a sense of the lived experience of indoctrination and of the work involved in achieving liberation from it . Here already our histories diverged , the details of the religious background and the reaction of the faithful to our apostasy ( a term fraught with significance for believers ) being quite different in the two cases . Mormons tend to be inclusivethose who lapse are still considered members and would no doubt be welcomed back at any time . But Exclusives are true to their name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . So the vivid autobiographical parts of each story would not be easy to incorporate smoothly into the same text . <p> The project therefore remained tentative until it occurred to us that since presumably not too many people in the field were aware of our own intellectual origins , there were probably others out there of whose origins we and the rest of the profession were similarly unaware , even though they might have be as difficult and as interesting as ours . The idea of an article therefore metamorphosed into the idea of a bookthis book . <p> Our suspicions about others having similar experiences were confirmed by the number of enthusiastic responses we received to our call for papers . There were not just a few people whose interest in philosophy helped them come to terms with their own childhood religious indoctrination , but dozens scattered around the world . And their personal stories differed , at times drastically . We eventually selected what we think to be a good representation of the variety of personal experiences , philosophical analyses , and religious orientations we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of each writers childhood community of belief and the price that had to be paid to escape from it . Most , though not all , of these histories involved some degree of personal stress . The professional components look at the moral issues that arise when caregivers try to coerce the beliefs of those entrusted to them , particularly when this involves restricting opportunities for personal development , the withholding of love , and so on . <p> The testimonies and reflections collected here are diverse , but their common theme gives them a striking unity . Their importance goes far beyond the bounds of professional philosophythe fates of nations hang on the conflicting views with which each new generation of citizens is indoctrinated . If the world is to be really free , the chains of belief that seem to descend inexorably from parents to children , from religious and political leaders to their followers , have to be brokenin our own culture no less than in alien ones . We want to draw attention , through concrete examples , to the moral responsibilities of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even more to those who do not . While our examples are drawn from contexts in which there are overt religious agendas , the issues they raise are no less important in education generally , with its burden of unstated ideological and even theological assumptions . <p> While all our authors were brought up in religious familial or community contexts , the reactions of their coreligionists to their apostasies varied . For some , the break was painful and included varying degrees of estrangement from family . Others had the comparative luxury of calmly sorting through what is objectionable about inculcating a belief system and what is not . Their conclusions do not always agree . One source of disagreement is the concept of " indoctrination " itself . Is indoctrination necessarily coercive , or can it be benign ? It seems inevitable that young children should be " indoctrinated " in the sense of being constrained to certain sorts of behavior , and beliefs about that behavior , while still too young to understand and appreciate the reasons why the behavior and the beliefs are desirable .

Limited indoctrination does not necessarily pose a moral problem , provided that children are also taught the skills to critically examine the rules , principles , and beliefs that were indoctrinated and then encouraged to use those skills as soon as they are able to act responsibly on their own . Learning to act responsibly and autonomously has less to do with acquiring a belief system or framework than it has to do with developing the ability to decipher for oneself what one should do . Abuses of parental authority tend to result in diminished space for the child to practice freedom . When the initiative is not eventually handed over to the children , when indoctrination offers no space for them to become free and autonomous , parents are abusing their authority . <p> A central theme of this book , then , is an exploration into the ways that religious indoctrination interferes with a childs discovery of freedom . It is through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first introduced to the world and are provided with or inhibited from access to it . Children are always born into specific situations , into particular social and cultural contexts with already established moral and value systems , within which they become adults . In coming to terms with their freedom , they need the opportunity to deconstruct these systems and then to reconstruct them in ways they can call their own . For them to have the best chances of developing the self-esteem and confidence required to strike out for an autonomous understanding takes parental recognition and support . <p> Young people who are not offered such recognition and support may find the strength to embark on this voyage alone , but they often bear emotional scars from abandoning internalized systems of belief and coming to terms with rejection from family and community . Several of our contributors fit this description . Their stories reveal that the costs of autonomy are lived both internally and externallyin psychological upheaval , and in estrangement from loved ones and the communities that provided their first introduction to the world . Others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the process with less overt interference from without . Our first chapter , by Christine Overall , represents such a case . It describes an upbringing in the Anglican Church in Canadanot a setting normally associated with rigidity in doctrine . But as the author points out , indoctrination can happen indirectly , simply from the immersion of an impressionable child in a culture of belief , even belief not especially strongly held by the adult members of the relevant community . It can take hold just as effectively , if the child is serious and thoughtful , as in more coercive cases , and getting free of it may be just as distressing and require just as much work ( if less family trauma ) . <p> The second chapter , by Irfan Khawaja , echoes Overalls experience in a starkly different cultural setting , that of a Sunni Muslim community in New Jersey . Rather than " indirect indoctrination , " Khawaja speaks of " self-indoctrination , " which follows again from the childs immersion in a belief system , in this case an absolutist system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The apparently cast-iron completeness of the doctrine answers to a human " wish for the irrevocable , " so that lesser certainties seem unreal by comparison . Yet this unreality may in fact be the reality of the world we live in , which must be reappropriated by a process of " counter-indoctrination . " <p> Chapter 3 takes us to a Baptist childhood and upbringing in New Zealand . Raymond Bradleys family came well connected in the Baptist hierarchy , from his missionary grandfather to the renowned theologian E. M. Blaiklock , an avuncular figure who eventually became an opponent in debate . Bradleys evolution into a freethinker went through family violence to professional maturity , leaving him with the conviction , shared by many of our contributors , that fundamentalist belief is " the most dangerous phenomenon of our times . " <p> Chapter 4 , the last in the first section of the book , begins with an account of growing up Catholic in the American Bible Belt . The Catholic Church had the kind of grip on Damien Dupont that Islam had on Irfan Khawaja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a different way . But Dupont performs a similar deconstruction of the absolutist doctrines of the Church . He concludes that all indoctrination is abusive , particularly of vulnerable children . Indoctrination may occur in nonreligious contexts ; this too is contingently abusive , but religious indoctrination is constitutively so . <p> The next three chapters take a gentler approach . Amalia Jiva ( Chapter 5 ) was a Romanian Baptist who on resettlement in the United States found herself a student at Jerry Falwells Liberty University . She is critical of fundamentalist indoctrination and has rejected its literalism , but that rejection was experienced less as an opening out into freedom than as an introduction to a productive uncertainty , which she treasures . In Chapter 6 Tasia Persson , raised a conservative evangelical , undertakes a careful critique of the moral risks and consequences of indoctrination , and wonders whether evangelical parents might find ways of teaching their children that are not coercive and manipulative . And in Chapter 7 Glen Pettigrove , son of a Wesleyan pastor , describes a gradual and relatively stress-free transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale rejection of belief at which some of our contributors have arrived , and offers what he calls a " qualified defense of religious indoctrination , " which need not as he sees it involve coercion or irrationality , or be inconsistent with autonomy and authenticity . It becomes morally objectionable only when it compromises autonomy or violates trust . Pettigroves chapter takes a more benign view than that of some other chapters as to the possibility of avoiding these outcomes , and recommends a presumption of innocence with respect to indoctrination rather than one of suspicion . <p> The final section of the book comprises four accounts of upbringings in radically doctrinaire sects . Paul Hirst and Peter Caws come from different parts of England and different offshoots of the Plymouth Brethren , a loose grouping which was itself an offshoot from the Church of England in the 1830sin Cawss case the suburbs of London and the Taylorite Exclusive Brethren , in Hirsts the industrial north and the Glanton Brethren ( named for a village in Northumberland where a tempest in a doctrinal teapot led to a split in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Russian Mennonites in Ontario , and Stefani Jones as part of a Mormon family in Utah . In Chapter 8 Hirst recounts his spare , strict , and affectively bleak life as the child of an all too spiritual father and the opening up of perspective provided , among other things , by an exposure to mathematics and sex . But he was able to find his way to Cambridge and philosophy without making a complete break with his familyhis slow , but final departure from belief tracked his career as a professional philosopher . <p> In Chapter 9 Enns describes the constricted life of immigrant fundamentalists , its grip on herits inculcation of mistrust of the physical , mental , and emotional aspects of human lifebut also its inconsistencies and moral flaws , and traces the path that led her to feminism and phenomenology . Jones too , in Chapter 10 , comes to feminism , in part as a reaction to the situation of women in the Mormon Church , but helped by the liberating influence of some significant women with whom she was fortunate enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of womens voices leads her to stress the importance of finding her own . Finally in Chapter 11 Caws places his main emphasis on the doubly tragic conflict between a son who can not maintain belief and parents who can not imagine life or salvation without it . <p> These thumbnail sketches of the chapters that follow stress their diversity , but for the most part overlook an important component that in different forms is present in all . The authors , as remarked at the beginning , are professional philosophers , and each refers in one way or another to his or her intellectual formation , reading , and experiences of the academy . Some of them give striking insights into specific university settings , notably Paul Hirsts account of the philosophical life of Oxford and Cambridge at critical moments in his history . And as professional philosophers most of them engage in serious conceptual and analytical work on the leading topics of the bookindoctrination itself and its moral status , freedom of thought and the human price it sometimes exacts . It can safely be said that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of departure ; what they all would wish , we think , is that their experiences might serve as encouragement to others who may have to follow similar personal and philosophical trajectories .

Some of these new settlements developed into sizable population and market centers that linked the major seaport cities to the expanding colonial frontier and performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the backcountry . In Pennsylvania , several new counties were created after 1729 in response to demographic and territorial growth , and county seats such as Lancaster , Reading , York , and Carlisle thrived as market and supply centers for the surrounding countryside . " Political , commercial , craft , and social functions , " historical geographer James T. Lemon wrote , " brought early rapid growth and later sustained growth to these county towns in the backcountry . " The county courthouse became the focus of legal and political activity ; wholesalers , retailers , and artisans provided an increasing variety of goods and services ; and churches , fire companies , libraries , and eventually newspapers and secondary schools contributed to a thriving social life . <p> The oldest of these towns in the Pennsylvania backcountry , Lancaster ( founded in 1730 ) , became the administrative center of the surrounding county and an important commercial hub connecting the colonial metropolis of Philadelphia to a rapidly expanding hinterland . The town had about twentyeight hundred inhabitants in 1770 , and its population grew to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While these figures seem rather modest from todays perspective , they made Lancaster one of largest inland towns in eighteenthcentury North America , and Lancasters commercial functions foreshadowed , on a smaller scale , the role that Midwestern cities such as Cincinnati , Chicago , and St. Louis would assume in the nineteenth century . Eighteenth century Lancaster also resembled later Midwestern cities in one other crucial aspect : its ethnic and religious diversity . From its earliest days , German speakers formed a majority of Lancasters inhabitants , and up to the 1750s the town absorbed growing numbers of German immigrants . While some of them prospered as shopkeepers , innkeepers , or artisans , many more moved on after a brief stay . English speakers accounted for only onethird to twofifths of Lancasters prerevolutionary population , but due to their command of the language and the legal system and their business connections and political ties to the Philadelphia elite , they were disproportionately influential . While Lancasters population was highly mobilepopulation turnover in the years 177282 has been estimated at 5 percent annuallythe town also had a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Neither English nor German speakers were confessionally homogeneous groups . Describing the community to officers of the Londonbased Society of the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts , the Anglican minister Thomas Barton wrote in 1760 that " Lancaster is a large Town having near 600 Houses , inhabited chiefly by Germans of almost every Religious Denomination . It contains one Church of England , which is but small , a large German Calvinist Church , a Lutheran Church , a Moravian Church , a large Quaker Meeting House , a Popish Chapel ; and a Presbyterian Church is now erecting . " Thirty years after its founding , Lancaster housed seven Christian congregations , and all of them had built or were in the process of building their own places of worship . Only the small group of Jewish families , " who read and observe their Talmud with great exactness , " did not have a synagogue . <p> Apart from the small clusters of Catholics and Jews , both German and English speakers were thus divided into three major Protestant groups . Many German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Martin Luthers Reformation of the early sixteenth century . Spreading out from Saxony , Lutheranism had become the public religion in a number of German territories and free imperial cities and received official recognition in the Holy Roman Empire with the religious peace of Augsburg in 1555 . The German Reformed church originated in the teachings of the Swiss theologians Ulrich Zwingli and Jean Calvin , who shared Luthers emphasis on Gods saving grace and the sole authority of the Bible but differed in their views on the sacraments and church discipline . Moreover , they sought to purify the liturgy from " popish " elements to a greater extent than the Lutherans . Reformed German princes fused Calvinist doctrine with a hierarchical church organization that resembled the Lutheran one . With the Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years War in 1648 , the Reformed religion also received official sanction in the Holy Roman Empire . In contrast to both Lutheran and Reformed churches , Moravianism remained outside the imperial constitution and was considered a " sect " by central European secular and ecclesiastical authorities . Originating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early fifteenth century , the Moravian Brethren had survived lengthy periods of persecution until their remnants found shelter on the estate of a Lutheran nobleman in Saxony , Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf , in the early eighteenth century . The charismatic Zinzendorf first became a convert and then a leader of the Moravian brethren . Under his influence Moravianism developed into a highly personal " religion of the heart , " and Zinzendorfs followers spread the message of the renewed Moravian church with considerable missionary zeal . <p> Among the English speakers , Anglicans were adherents of the Church of England , established as the national church by the Tudor rulers Henry VIII , Edward VI , and Elizabeth I in the sixteenth century . While Anglicanism had absorbed elements of Calvinist doctrine , it retained a hierarchical , Episcopal form of ecclesiastical government . In the eighteenth century , the Church of England generally adopted a latitudinarian position , emphasizing reason and morality over fine points of doctrine , but the renewal movements of the revivalists George Whitefield and John Wesley also promoted a new emphasis on piety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Puritanism who preferred congregational autonomy over hierarchical church organization , were restricted to the status of " dissenters " in eighteenth century England but constituted the official church in Scotland . Finally , the Society of Friends , or Quakersreligious nonconformists who made their first appearance during the English Civil War of the midseventeenth centuryemphasized the " inner light " within each individual over ecclesiastical and scriptural authority and suffered heavy persecution during the first decades of their existence on account of their antiauthoritarianism . Quakers were a relatively marginal and shrinking minority in eighteenth century England but all the more prominent in Pennsylvania , a colony that their member William Penn had founded , in part , as an asylum for persecuted Christian minorities . <p> As Thomas Bartons 1760 report indicates , church building in Lancaster had started almost as soon as town proprietor Andrew Hamilton had succeeded in making his town the new county seat : the German Reformed had completed their first wooden church by 1736 , the Lutherans finished their first building two years later , the Roman Catholic chapel is referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own church by 1744 . Soon after their split from the Lutherans in 1746 , the Moravians also built their own church . In later years , the congregations would enlarge and sometimes completely rebuild these early edifices , add towering steeples , import church bells from England , and adorn church interiors with elaborate pulpits , organs , pews , and galleries . Contemporary views of the town confirm that Lancaster was thoroughly " sacralized " by the later eighteenth century . <p> As these building activities demonstrate , congregations were of central importance to Lancasters early residents . Laypeople in the new town began to build churches before the arrival of regular ministers , and the organization of several congregations predates the incorporation of Lancaster as a borough in 1742 . In Lancaster , as elsewhere in early America , " congregations provided the only regular small-group activities that included every colonistmen , women , and children . " Congregational administration also involved far greater numbers of people than town government or voluntary societies such as the fire companies or the library company . Whereas only thirtysix men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times that many officiated as trustees , wardens , elders , and deacons of the towns congregations . It was in the running of congregational affairsthe drafting of charters and bylaws , the acquisition of real estate for churches , schoolhouses , and graveyards , the management of fundsthat many European immigrants acquired their first experiences in selfgovernment on American soil . In their concern for public morality , the relief of poor members , and the schooling of the young , religious congregations fostered a " sense of communal responsibility . " Moreover , it was their congregations that dozens of eighteenth century Lancasterians thought of when they made charitable bequests in their last wills , and it was in the congregations that pastors and laypeople fought and argued over questions of power , authority , obedience , and order . Even the religious enthusiasm of the " First Great Awakening " was a distinctly congregational affair : the town as a whole never experienced a religious revival in the eighteenth century , but " awakenings " repeatedly occurred within individual churches . In the 1740s the inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nyberg split the local Lutheran congregation and resulted in the establishment of a Moravian congregation . In the 1750s the young pastor Philipp Wilhelm Otterbeins preaching invigorated piety and spirituality among Lancasters German Reformed , and in the early 1770s a newcomer from Halle , Justus Heinrich Christian Helmuth , led the Lutherans through another period of awakening . While Nyberg , Otterbein , and Helmuth drew inspiration from continental European traditions of Reformed , Lutheran , and Moravian pietism , they were only loosely connected to the AngloAmerican revivalist networks that createdor " invented , " as some scholars have arguedthe Great Awakening . These observations suggest that congregations were pivotal social and cultural institutions in eighteenth century Lancaster . <p> While scholars of colonial New England have long recognized the central significance of the church in the regions communities , churches in the middle colonies have often been described as weak , fledgling , striferidden institutions . In the case of Pennsylvania and her neighbors , the Great Awakening of the 1740s has been interpreted as a response to crisis and decline , while the later eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her study of Germantown , for example , Stephanie Grauman Wolf has argued that individualism , geographic mobility , and the heterogeneity of the population led to a " growing lack of interest in the church as a vital center of life . " Congregations were organized slowly , and close to half the population remained unchurched in the late eighteenth century . According to Wolf , Germantowns churches " seem to have played a very small role in the overall life of the community . " Ministers exerted little influence in a place where the courts and taverns allegedly were much more important public forums than houses of worship . The slight impact of Germantowns congregations on education , charity , and public morality also indicated a " failure of institutional religion to carve out a meaningful niche for itself in the new secular world . " <p> In the case of Lancaster nothing would be more misleading than to portray congregational development in terms of decline or secularization . Lancasters congregations grew throughout the eighteenth century , and they continued to absorb a majority of the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of Lancaster has been estimated at roughly three thousand on the eve of the Revolution , pastor Helmuth wrote in 1772 that almost thirteen hundred people had registered themselves as members of the Lutheran congregation ; this figure probably excluded children under fifteen . The following year the Reformed pastor Carl Ludwig Boehme reported 218 families in his congregation to the annual Coetus of Reformed ministers , and one historical demographer has put the size of the congregation at 850 to 900 people . In 1775 the Moravian congregation counted 320 members ( including children ) . Anglican minister Thomas Barton had only twenty-five communicants in Lancaster in 1770 , but the number of people who regularly attended his church was certainly not below 150 . While the numbers of Presbyterians , Quakers , and Catholics can only be guessed , it is still clear that at least twenty-seven hundred people were affiliated with one of Lancasters congregations in the early 1770s . Even if we estimate that one-fifth to one-quarter of these lived in surrounding townships , a significant majority of eighteenth-century Lancasterians adhered to a church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheran church the number of Easter communicants increased by 78.5 percent , from 107 to 191 , between 1749 and 1785 , while the number of newly confirmed rose from fourteen to seventy over the same period . The 284 Lutherans who went to communion on Pentecost in 1785 represented a 67 percent increase over the 170 Pentecost communicants in 1749 . The Reformed pastor Heinrich Wilhelm Stoy counted " about 100 families belonging to the congregation " upon his arrival in Lancaster in 1758 . In 1790 his successor , Wilhelm Hendel , reported 183 families . <p> When Lancasters tax assessment lists are correlated with local church records , it becomes clear that church adherence was high even during a period for which many historians have claimed rising religious indifference . Lancasters earliest tax assessment dates from 1751 and includes 293 taxpaying householders . Sixty-three individuals ( 21.5 percent of the total ) can be identified as Lutherans since they took communion in the Lutheran church at midcentury or were repeatedly present at pastoral acts there . A further fifty taxpayers ( 17.1 percent ) appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformed in the Lutheran church book , and thirty-four people ( 11.6 percent ) are on a list of adherents compiled by the local Moravian pastor . Twenty-nine individuals ( 9.9 percent ) on the tax list also appear on membership lists of the Anglican congregation , and fifteen ( 5.1 percent ) can be identified as members of smaller religious groups in townCatholics , Jews , Quakers , and Presbyterians . Altogether , 191 taxpayers or 65.2 percent of the people on the list were clearly affiliated with a religious group . At a time when Lancaster society was still in fluxthe town was just twenty years old , German immigration to Pennsylvania was at its peak , geographical mobility rates were high , some religious groups were not yet formally organized , and others were experiencing interior conflicta significant majority of the towns household heads were " churched . " <p> The 1773 tax list names 432 individuals and four estates of deceased persons . Of the 432 taxables , 93 ( 21.5 percent ) could not be located in contemporary church records , but since there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anglican church books are patchy , we may assume that at least onethird of these taxables were not really " unchurched . " A further twentysix individuals ( 6.0 percent ) could be found in only one church record ; they may have been loosely affiliated with a local congregation or may have stayed in town only briefly . The remaining 313 individuals ( 72.5 percent ) , however , repeatedly appear in church records . At the very least , this means that they deemed religion important enough to have their children baptized or seek a Christian burial for family members . But many were involved to a much larger degree . Onehundredtwentysix individuals on the 1773 tax listalmost 30 percent of all taxableshad rented pews in the Lutheran church . Fiftyeight Lutheran , Reformed , and Anglican men were elected to church offices ( trustee , elder , deacon , warden , vestryman ) during the late 1760s and early 1770s . Since the Moravians , Presbyterians , Quakers , and Catholics also had their lay leaders , at least seventy individuals , or one out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the basis of the 1773 tax assessment it is also possible to give a rough estimate of the religious composition of prerevolutionary Lancaster . About 40 percent of household heads were Lutheran , 20 percent Reformed , and almost 10 percent Moravian ; the three largest congregations were all German speaking and together comprised more than two-thirds of the towns inhabitants . Anglicans and Presbyterians together may have accounted for another 10 percent of household heads and the smaller religious groups ( Quakers , Catholics , and Jews ) about 5 percent . This would leave only 15 percent of the taxables who were not affiliated with any congregation . Comparing these percentages with the 1751 data , it appears that the Lutherans had gained most from the heavy German immigration of the early 1750s while the share of the Reformed , Moravians , Anglicans and smaller groups remained relatively stable . <p> These figures suggest that Lancaster fits a pattern of continuing religious vitality , congregational growth , high levels of church adherence , and a proliferation of ecclesiastical institutions that some scholars have detected in eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diversity within colonial American Protestantism between 1680 and the 1770s , " and Charles Cohen asserts that the work of Butler , Patricia Bonomi , and others amounts to a " post-Puritan paradigm " a perspective on early American history that emphasizes " the varieties of colonial religious experience . " According to Cohen , " the earnest if stolid fabrication of ecclesiastical institutions throughout AngloAmerica during the socalled long eighteenth century " may have had a more lasting impact on religious patterns in the United States than either seventeenth century New England Puritanism or nineteenth century revivalism . Moreover , the construction of these institutions " engaged the laity ; gathering churches , challenging ministerial prerogatives , and nurturing their own hermeneutics , they played a significantat times paramountrole in defining their faiths . " The history of church building in Lancaster allows us to test some of the major tenets of this " postPuritan paradigm . " More particularly , Lancaster provides ample evidence for the pivotal role of laypeople in shaping local congregations . As the subsequent chapters will show , the laity actively participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even conflicts with pastors testify to its intense concern for the ordering of congregational life and the distribution of authority . <p> Since Lancaster , unlike colonial New England towns , never knew a religious establishment but housed a plurality of congregations from its beginning , a study of congregational development also illuminates the diverse , pluralist character of eighteenth-century Pennsylvania . To be sure , the microcosm of Lancaster does not fully represent the " crazy quilt " of religious groups that had formed in the colony on account of religious toleration and the diversity of immigration . German-speaking Anabaptist and radical pietistic groups such as the Mennonites , the Amish , the Dunkers , and Conrad Beissels sabbatarian Ephrata commune were prominent in rural Lancaster County , for example , but few of their members resided in the borough and they did not build meetinghouses or form congregations there . Nor did English speaking residents establish Methodist or Baptist congregations in Lancaster before 1800 . Still , a study of congregations in the borough and their relationships with one another can she 'd considerable light on the interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local level . With the exception of the small Catholic community , Lancasters congregations also mirrored the towns ethnic divisions : the membership of the Reformed , Lutheran , and Moravian congregations was overwhelmingly German speaking throughout the period covered here , while the vast majority of English speakers attended the Anglican and Presbyterian churches . As historian E. Brooks Holifield has noted , however , " even the ethnic coloration of congregations exemplified their comprehensive charactertheir embrace of a larger community , their function in preserving larger communal values . " Steven M. Nolt has asserted that " religion and religious institutions were often the chief means of mediating and propagating culture for minority groups in a pluralistic setting . " Significantly , no single religious group comprised the majority of Lancasters inhabitants , and no group even came close to holding a monopoly on wealth or political influence . Among the thirtyfour men with the highest assessment on the first borough tax list of 1751 , we find eight Anglicans , eight Lutherans , seven Moravians , seven German Reformed , two Quakers , one Catholic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jews were elected to the borough council between 1742 and 1775 . <p> In order to assess the nature of religious pluralism in Lancaster , two approaches are combined here : comparison and the study of interactions . Much scholarship on religious development in the middle colonies has focused on particular denominationsDutch Calvinists , German Lutherans and Moravians , or ScotsIrish Presbyteriansand traced the transfer of their religious institutions from the Old World to the new as well as their encounters with a dominant English culture . While these works have placed colonial religious history in a transatlantic context and outlined the " Americanization " of European churches , a comparative perspective allows us to identify what was actually unique about the development of specific religious groups within a particular environment . <p> Thus the first three chapters of this study analyze the development of the major Protestant churches in colonial LancasterGerman Reformed , Lutheran , Moravian , Anglican , Presbyterianin a comparative perspective . While each congregational history has its distinct features , there are also remarkable parallels . The argument pursued here is that a quest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these congregations . During the colonial period all major religious communities experienced similar problems : the adjustment of an immigrant population to a new environment , struggles between ministers and laymen for the control of congregational affairs , and conflicting concepts of church order .

They had built ornate churches , secured charters of incorporation , and attracted qualified ministers who usually served long , successful pastorates ( chapter 5 ) . Moreover , the Protestant congregations had developed traditions of charity and stewardship that had a significant impact on the establishment of local benevolent associations such as the Lancaster Bible Society , the German Society , and the Female Benevolent Society after 1815 ( chapter 6 ) . <p> In addition , this book examines the interactions between the various religious groups in the town . While pastors offered general comments on relations between Lancasters inhabitants , a detailed analysis of church records , wills , letters , and a variety of other sources reveals how frequently eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly townspeople married across denominational lines , and how often they made bequests to more than one congregation . A close study of the relationships between Englishmen and Germans , " church " and " sect " people , Catholics and Protestants , Jews and Christians , as well as blacks and whites enables us to assess the character of ethnic and religious boundaries and the meanings of pluralism in a major population center of the Pennsylvania backcountry ( chapter 4 ) . While there are several fine studies on the growth of toleration and religious liberty in the middle colonies , these tend to look at general developments at the provincial level , and they rely heavily on sources authored by political and clerical leaders . The adoption of a microhistorical perspective on actual interconfessional relations in a specific community broadens our understanding of the nature and evolution of religious pluralism . <p> The sources for a study of congregational development and religious pluralism in Lancaster are remarkably rich . Apart from the Presbyterians , for which few eighteenth century records exist , church books , vestry minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies such as the Lutheran Ministerium and the German Reformed Coetus of Pennsylvania provide a wealth of information on the major religious congregations .

In addition , tax lists , deed books , wills , estate inventories , and newspaper advertisements reveal much about the social standing of laypersons who were involved in congregational leadership . While a local perspective is necessary to understand the importance of the congregation in the lives of eighteenth century Lancasterians , the study of congregational life has implications far beyond the confines of one Pennsylvania town .

" Brad Jacobs , Wilson Journal of Ornithology <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence-absence data for nesting species , in order to provide the first-ever detailed " snapshot " of breeding bird distributions for the geographic regions they coveredcounties , states , provinces , or entire countries . Pennsylvanias first breeding bird atlas ( hereafter " first Atlas " ) accomplished this goal when it was conducted from 1983 through 1989 : just over 2,000 volunteers collectively reported more than 83,000 hours in the field , and amassed a total of 318,600 records representing 210 different species , 187 of which were considered breeding birds in the state ( Brauning 1992a ) . Many more individual observations were certainly made by volunteers for the first Atlas , but , ultimately , only one record for each species ( representing the highest observed evidence of breeding ) was retained in the final database . The comparable total of unique species-by-block observations for the second Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas ( hereafter " second Atlas " ) was just over 350,000 , representing 217 species , with 190 considered breeding . However , unlike the first Atlas , in the second Atlas many additional records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations representing the same level of breeding evidence ) were collected and retained in the final database for the additional valuable information they could provide regarding breeding phenology and fine-scale distribution patterns ( see Chapter Six ) . The collective contribution of the more than 2,000 volunteers who submitted records for the second Atlas not only added to the solid foundation established by the first Atlas , but will continue to help private and public resource organizations further effective , scientific conservation programs in the years to come . <p> As groundbreaking as they were , most first atlases did not tell us whereacross the length and breadth of their overall distributional rangesspecies were more or less common : an observation of a single nesting pair or one hundred nesting pairs within a block would be mapped in just the same way . Because geographic differences in abundance , particularly for species of concern , have obvious importance for prioritizing conservation efforts , tackling the challenge of introducing a measure of abundance ( i.e. , a third dimension of distribution ) into the second Atlas was a high priority from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a number of experienced field biologists and biostatisticians , we devised a novel , logistically demanding point count protocol , with the express purpose of meeting a principal aim of the second Atlas : mapping not only distributions of the states breeding birds , but also estimating the true density of as many of them as possible . This customized protocol was executed in every full-sized ( i.e. , non-border ) block in the state over the course of five years ( see Chapters Four and Five for details ) . An important lesson learned from the first Atlas provided another set of challenges for the planning and execution of Pennsylvanias second Atlas . Simply put , the specialized natural history of some bird species renders them particularly difficult to find without considerable , targeted effort . Thus , in the first Atlas , the final maps for most nocturnal birds , as well as some habitat specialists ( e.g. , marsh birds ) , primarily reflected where in the state atlas volunteers had made the extra efforts needed to find these species . It was impossible to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were real or an artefact of insufficient effort ; that is , there was no real way to know whether a species was actually absent from a block or if it was simply missed . Because many of these same species are of particularly high conservation importance and concern in the state , specialized surveys for these species were built into the second Atlas to increase the likelihood that these notoriously difficult-to-detect bird species would , in fact , be detected in blocks in which they likely occurred ( see Chapter Four ) . Now , in blocks where these specialized surveys were conducted for the second Atlas and the target species were not detected , we can have greater confidence ( compared with the first Atlas ) that they were , in fact , not present . <p> As another novel feature of the second Atlas , we encouraged volunteers to collect multiple georeferenced records within any given block for selected species of conservation importance ( i.e. , species in bold or italics on the second Atlas field cards ; see Chapter Four ) . Although only one breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atlas block for a given species on the final maps in this book , we knew that multiple georeferenced records within the same block could provide better data to support analysis of environmental and habitat relationships for these species , and that these , in turn , could contribute to the work of conservation in the coming years . Taken together , these resources enabled our volunteers to generate a large , precisely georeferenced database of breeding records , particularly for important bird species of conservation concern in Pennsylvania . <p> Yet another twist in data collection for the second Atlas , compared with the first Atlas , was our attempt to collect information about the co-occurrence of breeding bird species and Pennsylvanias state tree , the Eastern Hemlock . As we faced the rapid spread of the introduced Hemlock Woolly Adelgid from east to west across the state , the second Atlas provided a timely opportunity to find out just how many and which species might be negatively affected by any future losses of the hemlock component of Pennsylvanias forests . Because hemlock cover can not be distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , we encouraged second Atlas volunteers to be our " eyes on the ground , " reporting the amount of hemlock present in locations where they observed breeding birds . We requested that volunteers collect one piece of habitat data , especially in connection with confirmed breeding records , for all species . The provisional list of " hemlock-associated " species ( see Chapter Six ) will deserve closer attention and consideration in connection with the conservation impacts of the advancing Hemlock Woolly Adelgid on hemlock stands in Pennsylvania and surrounding states . <p> Last , but by no means least , we strived to greatly increase participation in the second Atlas by recruiting our volunteers from well outside the conventional birding community circles . Although the states organized birders clearly contributed the bulk of records to the second Atlas , we used various means , such as backyard bird forms , farmer forms , hunter/fisher surveys , scout projects , and classroom activities promoted through statewide news releases , in an attempt to " popularize " the second Atlas and to increase the number of people who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " every single breeding bird observation , whether of a common species by a beginning bird watcher or of a real rarity by an expert birder , will put another one of our state birds on the map , in the process adding measurably to our knowledge of the occurrence , status , and distribution of Pennsylvanias birdlife . " In an effort to make as many people as possible aware of the aims and purposes of the second Atlas , and to continually recruit new volunteers , we printed newsletters ( c. 15,000 ) , The PennsylAvian Monitor , once or twice a season , and sent it not only to those already enrolled in the second Atlas , but also to every public library in the state and many other public distribution points ( e.g. , nature centers , nature shops , and state park offices ) . An ulterior motive was to bring more of the states bird watchers into the fold of local Audubon and other bird clubs , not only for the benefit of those clubs , but also to ensure a ready supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Although the hoped-for successes did not follow from all of the aforementioned aims and aspirations of the Second Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas , we strongly encourage the organizers of second and subsequent atlases to strive to improve the quantity , quality , and scope of data related to breeding birds , to take full advantage of new and emerging technologies and analytical methods and products , and to reach out to the many people whose interest in ( and knowledge about ) birds may not yet have led them to membership in a bird organization . The risk of overreaching seems less of a concern than repeating exactly what was done before , especially where there is a clear opportunity to do much more . We hope the second Atlas will , therefore , serve as a source of ideas and inspiration for others embarking on their first or next atlas . There is value in thinking of bird atlases not only as a follow-up to a preceding atlas , but also as a step forward for any succeeding atlas . <p> The welfare of the birds within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very environments that we humans share with birdsdepends upon practical , up-to-date information that can support sound scientific conclusions which , in turn , can inform and promote effective and efficient on-the-ground conservation efforts . Like most good citizen-science projects , the second Atlas has produced far more data than can be summarized and incorporated in this book , and we look forward to making these data available to conservation biologists and land managers interested in understanding , fostering , and protecting bird diversity in the future . The book you are holding breaks much new ground compared with the first Atlas , but it is just one of what we hope will be a stream of important publications based on the voluminous data collected by thousands of dedicated volunteers and other field workers for the second Atlas .

Looking at the political thought of one of the giants of social democracys founding generation , it aims to recover certain questions asked by that generation , questions that might profitably be asked again by those who would like to see a democratic Left in the twenty-first century that is able to preserve and extend the best of what the twentieth-century Left achieved . <p> The story of social democracys outer life is well known .

This modelas momentous an innovation as the nineteenth-century development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of the constitutional republiccomprised a comprehensive welfare state , extensive collective bargaining , and economic rules that favored equality and stability , all in the context of representative democracy and a market economy .

No other version of left-wing politics has been so successful at realizing the Lefts dream of a modern society made fit for human habitation . <p> When I describe social democracy as a political tradition , I mean that it is not only this set of actions and results . More fundamentally , it is a distinct way of thinking about and approaching politics that has been sustained over time .

The social democratic tradition is thus defined not only by its strategy and its policy program but also by its broader commitment to freedom , equality , and solidarity . Just as fundamental as those principles is social democracys commitment to a genuinely political engagement with the modern world . Social democracy has been among the modern traditions that defend the classical Greek and Roman image of public talk in public spaces and the classical claim that human beings living together in ordered societies have the capacity to change or preserve their social orders through such talk , and , in doing so , to realize common goods . Thus social democrats have prized political life , with all its uncertainty and messiness ; they have sought coalition and compromise rather than absolute victory ; they have valued the continued possibility of dissent over the perfect realization of principles .

That said , I want to point out something about social democracy that may be less obvious , especially in our time . During the last years of the nineteenth century and the first years of the twentieth , before there were social democratic governments with the power to enact a policy model , social democrats built a movement . At first no more than an unconventional style within the international socialist movement , this new politics gradually differentiated itself from the rest of the socialist family and emerged as a distinct movement with a forthrightly reformist and democratic character .

If the daily work of the socialist movement was not to be seen as a series of steps on the road to a wholly new and fully just society , what reason could the movements members have for making the sacrifices demanded by political life ? If a final victory was not written into the trajectory of history , what could make participation in the movement worthwhile ? What would bind the movement together ? The early social democrats seem to have been surprised by the urgency of these questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think through the problems of their movements inner life than their descendants would in the period when social democracy moved from success to success . Building a movement , the first social democrats were haunted by the problem of hope . <p> Seeking to rebuild that movement , social democrats today are haunted by the same problem and need not face it as if for the first time . Since the last quarter of the twentieth century , adherents of neoliberal market fundamentalism have attacked the social democratic model with devastating results . Over the same period , the character of election campaigns has changed ; the demographic bases of left parties have shifted ; globalization has altered the terms of national policy making . Social democrats in recent years have found their confidence enfeebled , their sense of a common project less sure than it once was . Old questions about social democracys inner life have a new relevance . <p> That the polemics and introspections of social democrats a century ago might be of interest today may seem an odd notion . Why read old arguments against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements to argue against ? Nevertheless , this is just what I want to propose . Because those first social democrats could not take for granted the appropriateness of a commitment to democratic reform , theyor at any rate some of themnot only examined the outer shape of their politics but also attended to the problems that accompanied their new commitments . We might say that they listened not only to the melody but also to the undertones of social democratic politics . Social democrats multiple commitmentsto principles like freedom and solidarity but also to the worth of political life itselfraise difficult questions , today as in earlier periods , about the sources of political motivation and the kind of political hope that can orient a project of democratic reform . I am convinced that the original social democrats can help todays social democrats not only to develop an account of what theyor , rather , weare doing and of why our political commitments might be worthwhile , but also to confront the consequences of those commitments . I should add that , although I write here with those purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither all new nor all unique to the Left . In many respects , they are iterations of the oldest problems of Western politics and political thought , and so I would suggest that the travails of social democracy ought to be of interest to anyone who wants to defend the possibility of political life in the modern world . <p> This book , then , should be understood as a study in social democratic political theory that reconstructs the questions asked by the first generation of social democrats in order to pose those questions in a way that might be useful to the democratic Left today . Its medium is the political thought of Jean JaurFs , a French writer and politician whose career in public life lasted from his first election to public office in 1885 to his assassination in 1914 . JaurFs was one of many people in several countries who contributed to the birth of the reformist socialism that would grow into the tradition of social democracy . Except in France , where he is fondly remembered , JaurFs is not the best known of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has received more attention . Studying JaurFs makes sense for my purposes , however . Like other reformists of his generation , JaurFs thought through the consequences of the social democratic commitment when those consequences were new and surprising . It seems to me that he undertook that intellectual work with exceptional vigor and creativity . He also did so with exceptional prominence : in a way Bernstein never did , JaurFs became an international spokesman for the new reformism ; indeed , " JaurFsism " was one of the first names for social democracy . <p> In some ways , JaurFs was a representative member of the first generation of social democrats , albeit a particularly vocal and prolific one . He also contributed something unique to the new politics . JaurFs was unusual among his contemporaries in that he was not only a journalist and a parliamentarian , but also a historian and a philosopher , distinguished by the uncommon breadth of his curiosity and intellectual aptitudes . Although he never wrote a systematic statement of his ideasin itself a suggestive facthe thought broadly about both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best of all , he wrote blazing prose and gave intricate and soaring speeches . These traits have sometimes been seen as faults . I want to suggest , however , that JaurFss writerly prowess should be seen not as a quirk of temperament , but as an indication of the kind of political thinking appropriate to social democracy . <p> Irving Howe , who knew something about both rhetoric and social democracy , wrote : " It has been customary in radical circles to praise JaurFs as a brilliant personality , a scintillating orator , a fine leader , but to condescend a little toward his intellectual powers , often because he was far from Marxist orthodoxy . But time is a cruel teacher . Many of the clogged Marxist tracts of theoreticians allegedly more profound than JaurFs are now all but unreadable , while his writings , for all their oratorical quality , retain a clear vision of the indissoluble link between democracy and socialism . " <p> I would go only slightly farther than Howe : JaurFss works convey something about the link between democracy and socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of his oratory . Theory can be allied with rhetoric , ideas with imagery , and when citizens talk with one another , this alliance is not only possible but also indispensable . When we aim to illuminate a shared moral world , we need words that touch the intangible : we need symbols . When we aim to move listeners to political commitment , or to give an account of such commitments , we need models of speech other than those we associate with scientific discovery and technological invention . Because JaurFss works were elements of his own thoughtful engagement in the democratic politics of his time , they pursue those aims , they meet those needs , and they rely on that alliance . That is no small part of why they remain useful today . <p> Accordingly , this book reflects on the social democratic tradition by presenting and interpreting the political thought of Jean JaurFs both because he is representative of social democracys founders and because he has something unusual and valuable to say . Although it resembles a work of intellectual history , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own situation ; its purpose is as much rumination as exposition . I am concerned with what JaurFs said because I want to figure out what his political thought might mean now . To that end , I write with an eye toward how JaurFs thought ; I try to show the process by which he responded to concrete political problems as much as I try to show what his responses were . <p> Thus , although I try to explain enough about JaurFss life to put his thought in its proper context , I offer no full-fledged biography of JaurFs , nor even an intellectual biography , no history of the socialist movement in the France or Europe of his time , nor an account of JaurFss historical legacy or influence on later generations . I also offer no apology for social democracy itself . Instead , I write here as a " connected critic " of social democracy ; I start from the assumption that social democratic politics is worth practicing and worth thinking about . <p> With that in mind , I look at JaurFss political thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside JaurFs in order to discover what he has to say to us today , at a time when the social democratic tradition seems unsure of its way forward . I ask , what follows from the decision to engage in social democratic politics ? What account can those who make this decision give of what they are doing ? What tends to trouble them , and how can they think clearly and usefully about those troubles ? <p> In exploring these questions , I argue that JaurFss account of the public character of his politics makes a connected whole out of the principles and method that later became the hallmarks of the social democratic tradition . JaurFs was able to give this account of social democracys outer life in part because he drew on the vocabulary and imagery of classical political thought . When he uses the word " republic " to describe his political commitments , he is expressing an understanding of reformist socialism that is not peculiarly French . Social democracy , though a distinctively modern tradition , is also a tradition that can be best accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can show us the republicanor , to use the equivalent Greek-rooted word , the politicalquality of social democracy better than JaurFs . <p> What I have found most interesting in JaurFss writings and speeches , however , are those points at which his thought becomes murkier . JaurFs is not shy about revealing the inner life of social democracy , but his account of that inner life is not entirely consistent , and when he spoke to his contemporaries , he at times contradicted himself . JaurFs wants to understand what can motivate a political tradition that does not expect to fully realize its ideals ; he wants to give an account of social democratic hope . This , it seems to me , was the deepest concern of his intellectual life . That his account of this hope never became entirely clear may have been less a failure on his part than a feature of the problem he faced . <p> The subsequent chapters are a reading of several of JaurFss major writings and speeches . These span the years from his young adulthood to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and European socialist politics and the events of JaurFss own life , with occasional , briefer references to other writings or speeches by JaurFs or his contemporaries . Because how JaurFs says things is important to what I want to show about his political thoughtand also because so few of his writings have been translated into English I often quote substantial sections of his texts in my own translations . Although I have tried to convey both the sense and the sensibility of JaurFss words , as an amateur translator , I have certainly fallen short of that aspiration . But if the inadequacies of my efforts spur someone more competent to undertake a fuller and better translation of JaurFss writings into English , that alone will justify the existence of this book . <p> Each chapter examines either one major text or a small number of related texts , set in their respective contexts . There is one chapter each on JaurFss doctoral theses ( chapter 1 ) , his Histoire socialiste ( chapter 2 ) , his major speeches during the reformism debates toward and just after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " the evolution of socialist method " ( chapter 3 ) , his +tudes socialistes of that period ( chapter 4 ) , and his LarmTe nouvelle ( chapter 5 ) . In the conclusion , I try to make room for both clarity and murkiness , piecing together the implications of JaurFss thought for politics in our time .

When elections were held in all the electoral districts in the first months of 1789 , the bailliages and sTnTchaussTes of France , the clergy had to work out their own problems of power and politics , which were further complicated by theology and religious sentiment . Strong reformist priests were able to dominate from the beginning , although individual bishops were occasionally astute enough to maintain their control over clergy meetings within their own dioceses . At the opening of the Estates General there was an unexpectedly high percentage of curTs , even given the ground rules set in place by Finance Minister Jacques Necker in order to ensure a high priest-to-bishop ratio . CurT words and deeds are recorded in the cahiers de dolTances , those official lists of complaints and hopes , in the diaries kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the records kept by the ComitT ecclTsiastique after the Estates General became the Constituent Assembly . After many months of work in 1790 , the members of the ComitT ecclTsiastique produced the founding document of church reform , the Civil Constitution of the Clergy . <p> Reform Within the Church : The Cahiers de DolTances <p> Very few revolutionary demands or complaints are in the clergy cahiers , according to Timothy Tackett , who scanned them to establish the frequency of such demands and complaints . There was some minor concern for the rights of the poor and antagonism toward the systems of rich and noble bishops , but no straightforward expression of bona fide revolutionary ideas . Tackett says that " grievances anticipating the most radical measures of the Civil Constitution were scarcely to be found anywhere . " Still and all , Philippe Grateau , in his " cultural rereading " of the cahiers , highlights a tradition of contempt for luxury and a clerical caste , and Nigel Aston notes a pervasive desire that the state might possibly " order matters thought formerly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules were required for the celebration of religious festivals , fasting , and control of immoral behavior in its usual forms of sex , drinking , and blasphemy . There was much demand for press censorship and little thought about toleration of non-Catholicism . There was little clarity about the distribution of powers needed to accomplish the reforms , with only a small minority of the cahiers suggesting that the decisions of the Estates General should be handled and ratified by the bishops or a national council or diocesan synods . At times the Estates General were considered the final authority . To highlight regional differences , Tackett recalculated his figures to apply geographically to departments instead of the old electoral districts . The highest level of demand for curT rights was found in western Normandy , Maine , the Touraine , then between the Massif Central and the PyrTnTes . In these regions , the north looked more to " honorific " rights ; the south , to political rightsbut rights in any case . It is striking that these regions did not , on the one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful dechristianization , or , on the other hand , with high levels of revolutionary demands . <p> There were , to be sure , expressions of resentment and rebellion , recorded by Charles Chassin in his book on the clergy cahiers . Class differences always counted for something . The cahier from Arles indicates that " the diverse classes of ecclesiastics put forward their individual dolTances in contradiction to one another . " In Aix and several other towns , little opposition to the bishop was recorded ; but , even so , a simple village curT was chosen to accompany him to the Estates General . The curT , Father Cousin , helped prepare the parish cahier that was sent to the Third Estatewith provisions for the election of curTs . In Marseilles , a supplementary cahier was sent in because the bishops would not sign some of the formulations that had been crafted by the lower clergy . From Puy-en-Velay came the strange cahier that was episcopal in tone , but noted the complaints of curTs demanding that bishops and others who were rewarded for their services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group of clergy would produce a very moderate document but choose a strongly political curT to represent them . Antagonism to the bishop is evident in the cahier that expects , not from the higher clergy , but " from the nation the concern to improve the lot of curTs and assistants . " In PTrigord the curTs of Libourne also look to the nation " to remedy the abuses that have made their way into the church administration . " <p> From the Auvergne came the plea that the bishops be well chosen : " Since bishops must be the lights and model of the clergy , the king should be begged right away to take effective measures , so that in choosing these first pastors , the minister charged with this task experience no coercion or fear , due to the intrigue , money , or power of the powerful . " Opposition to the bishop also featured in the letters from the curTs of Poitiers and Luton . When Father Guilleminet wrote to Necker , the kings finance minister , he said , " Monseigneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to admitting into the minutes all the demands , requests , and protests that the cures want relative to the aforesaid cahier . " The Norman priest Crosnier roundly criticized episcopal immorality : " The people are indignant , scandalized to see that riches taken for the altar serve the secular luxury , sensuality , and intemperance . " Rather , the money " could have been used to put their children in a position to serve the fatherland , rather than to support the idleness of clergy useless to church and state . " <p> CurTs projected their own key roles in church and society . The cahier from Caen was a pure Gallican document highlighting the importance of the curTs and urging a separate but equal status for the French church relative to pope and king . The cahier from Beauvais provided for limited elections , Chassin says , in order to avoid the formula of the curT from Saventin demanding that gold and silver be taken from the churches in order to pay the national debt ! In the cahier of the sTnTchaussTe of Anjou the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " freedom of election . " But seldom does one find a cahier such as the two brief articles from the AngoulOme region , wherein the curTs said nothing of church or clergy , dealing only with taxes andin a surprising expression in these documents " the legitimate liberty of the press . " In Lorraine , the curTs of Toul offered to pay taxes , " considering themselves citizens and children of the fatherland . " In Lille , the curTs demanded that all pastors of the city church " participate in the administration of the properties and revenues of the fabrique of the diocese . " In Metz , however , though favorable to a constitution , they wanted the rescinding of Protestant civil status , just granted in 1787 . And opposition to the corruption of the religious orders was juxtaposed to the demand for curT rights . In the Southwest , curTs wanted formal assemblies of their own resembling the religious-order assemblies , noting the " decline that threatens the religious orders with imminent dissolution , " and suggesting the convocation of a national council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed the right to be the " only genuine preachers , instead of monks and religious . " <p> CurTs highlighted the lot of their parishioners . The poor in their charge should benefit from the tithe , some of them said . The clergy of the bailliage of Mirecourt even demanded that the king himself listen to his people : " They will tell you for how long these children of the best of fathers the king groan under oppression . They will recount the rapport possessed by the church in the Vosges . It is a cruel stepmother that torments the inhabitants of the countryside and takes from them all the money it can . " <p> In any case , the priests of France had yet to try their hand at revolution when they arrived at Versailles in May 1789 for the opening of the Estates General . The expression of opposition to domination by bishops allowed little room for other church and government reforms . Confrontations developed across the meetings of the Estates General , where the curTs of the First Estate acquired most of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the aristocratic bishops . <p> Clergy Journals : Jacques Jallet in Particular <p> Lively records of the clergy sessions of the Estates General and the common sessions of the Constituent Assembly , minutes and diaries in effect , were kept by the curTs Sigisbert-Etienne Coster and Anne-Alexandre Thibault , and then Jacques Rangeard and Jacques Jallet . There were contrasts here . Coster feared the radicality of the groups decisions and refused the oath ; Thibault , despite his appreciation of revolution and reform , wrote a matter-of-fact journal . Rangeard , although keeping his editorializing to a minimum , complained of the unjust distribution of tithesso much taken by the aristocratic bishops and so little received by the hardworking priests . Jacques Jallets journal was , from beginning to end , the work of a priest revolutionary . On 13 June 1789 , he had led the first curTs ( there were two others ) to the hall of the Menus-Plaisirs to join the Third Estate . <p> Jallet put much more of himself in his journal , noting with satisfaction that the head of the small Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Messieurs ; even though there were a number of aristocratic bishops present , he never once said Messeigneurs . It was May 1789 and some of the bishops were hoping for good relations with the two other Estates . The trouble began with those efforts to unite the clergy and noble Estates as an intermediary between the king and the Third Estate . This would have considerably strengthened the control of the aristocratic bishops over the commoner priests : " We easily saw the real goal of this writing . If the plan were adopted , the clergy of the second order priests , overcome by the higher clergy and the nobles , would have not the least force , even for resistance , in the chamber . " The bishops were also unwilling to renounce their tax privileges ; to Jallet they seemed to oppose the Third Estate and protect the old union of throne and altar . It was then that Jallet undertook to show the Assembly that " all the cahiers insisted on the preservation of the throne and of religion , but they insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of the bishops ; on the amassing of benefices , nonresidency , the exclusion of commoners from the episcopate ; it made clear that the clergy themselves should take on the honors of planning the reforms , but those who live off the abuses endeavor to defend them . " <p> And it got rough at times , such as when a canon from Marseilles told the bishop of Langres , " Ive forgotten more about this than you know now " ( in fact , the canon was an aristocrat and conservative , whereas the bishop was open to change ) . This all took place in the confusing time between the first invitations to join the Third Estate and the dramatic unification of the First and Second Estates to the Third Estate ; the memorable day was 19 May 1789 . The indefatigably conservative abbT Maury , urging caution , " calumniated " ( Jallets word ) the intentions of the Third Estate . But GrTgoire said that delays had already jeopardized the reform , and Lubersac of Chartres promoted a careful but rapid restructuring . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center stage until a weepy curT from Bordeaux drew some snickers as he warned of the dangers religion was facing . Jallet believed that the bishops were stonewalling the curTs efforts to " reconcile " the First and Third Estates . He reported that " an episcopal curT was bold enough to treat the Assembly of the Third Estate as seditious ; a bishop had said the previous day that it was a cave of robbers . " The radical curTs won out , with the final vote 148 for union with the Third Estate and 136 against ; " the bishops exited quickly before the news of the defeat could be reported . " The crowd did not know what had transpired but they were still looking for a fight with the abbT Maury : he " could not get away from the boos of the crowd ; he made a threat and they were ready to attack him ; some spoke out saying that it would be better not to dirty ones hands by touching such a despicable person . " But at least the forces for change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applause were universal ; the archbishop of Vienne Le Franc de Pompignon , that of Bordeaux Champion de CicT , and the bishop of Chartres de Lubersac we put at the head of the winners . " The aristocratic bishops who lost went to the king to protest that the vote had not been legal , but the archbishops of Vienne and Bordeaux and the bishop of Chartres held fast in their defense of the change . <p> The curTs were anxious to finish the union project , and the bishop of Chartres suggested that all repair to the church of Saint-Louis for the official ceremony . And so it was , to Jallets clear joy : " The union of the clergy with the Third Estate will bring life and action to the National Assembly ; and it is noteworthy that this union has been accomplished in a church that is under the patronage of good Saint Louis ; a situation that no one has noticed , as far as we know . " The king then tried to stop the proceedings , ordering the three Estates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estate and a large number of clergy in favor of union remained . There was a profound silence for several minutes . The marquis de BrTzT entered at the kings behest and declared with the accord of the president that the will of his Majesty was that the different orders separate . The president answered that the session could not be closed except with the consent of the National Assembly . One of the deputies rose and said , " Only bayonets could get us out of here . " <p> The business of getting the final union worked out was a drawn-out affair , a tug of war between curT eagerness and episcopal reserve . But on 25 May forty-seven nobles ( " among whom figure the names of the first families of the kingdom , " wrote Jallet ) reinforced the clergy for Estate unification . In the final discussion , Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld protested against the elimination of his right to meet separately with his Estate ( his fellow bishops ) , and Mirabeau rose to say that no one had the right to protest his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly . The archbishop of Aix wanted to refute Mirabeau , but in his melodrama drew some laughter . Other bishops decided against continuing the contest , but Jallet referred to it all as an episcopal final attempt , a " swing of a club " to prevent the union of the Estates . <p> And when the secretaries for the united National Assembly were chosen for the first period on 8 June , the short list comprised two nobles , two members of the Third Estate ( Le Chapelier , a founder of the Jacobin Club , was one ) , and . . . the abbTs SieyFs and GrTgoire ! These were troubled times , nevertheless . In the first days of July plans were made to call in more than thirty thousand troops to maintain the peace . Mirabeau , believing that the order would arouse the people , demanded its cancellation , GrTgoire wanted to know who could have given the king such pernicious advice , and SieyFs wondered how the Assembly could have free and open discussion when surrounded by bayonets . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deliberations as to what to do , with the coming and going of the king . Jallet combines reports of the peoples and delegates esteem and expressed enthusiasm for the king , with the subtle insertion of reserve and antagonismprimitive reverence and primitive rebellion in a unique alloy only two days after the storming of the Bastille . A delegation was sent from the Assembly to Paris with an archbishop at its head : " It had been received with lively joy ; taken down to the Place Louis XV , they were conducted by an honor guard of the Paris militia , to the acclamations of an immense crowd demanding the return of Necker , to the H ( tel-de-Ville , where the archbishop of Paris announced the dispatching of troops . " <p> The next delegation had the king at the center , but the clergy who were committed to reform were squeezed out of membership , Jallet himself finding that his name had been proposed but then arbitrarily removed . After a full presentation of the precautions taken against insurrection and violence in Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philippe EgalitT , Jallet posts his negative assessment of the kings behavior : " The king revealed himself to the Assembly , not with the dignity of a monarch who considers it an honor to surround himself with the counsels of a noble nation , not with the goodness of a father who has just taken his place , but with the weakness of a despot , humbled by the evil success of his unjust and violent enterprises , and who has just humbled himself before those he can not destroy , or rather with the faintheartedness of a weak king , without character , whom the counsels of those around him can make proud or craven , alternately , according to circumstances . " <p> Records show , then , that the priests discussions were sometimes reform-oriented and sometimes intimidated by the aristocratic bishops . Only a minority felt comfortable making common cause with the Third Estate , and few , apart from reflexively fearful conservatives , fully realized the magnitude of the changes they were bringing about . One of the outspoken curTs , Jean-Louis Gouttes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Noblesse , changed his mind within ten days , from no to yes , on the question of joining the Third Estate . <p> What had happened was this . The regular run of lower clergy were clearly anxious about their relationship with the aristocratic bishops , first in their own Estate and then in the Constituent Assembly ; those curTs with the greatest resentment of the aristocracy were the most ready to reject their status as a separate Estate . Their suspicion of episcopal self-interest waxed and waned , depending on the liveliness of the communal discussions and the reconciliation achieved in them . All this meant that the clergy were less unified in their stand for or against union with the Third Estate than were the nobles . Back at the end of May , one of the great motivators of debate had been the Essai sur la rTforme du clergT , an attack on the bishops by the curT Laurent ; published probably on 20 May , it ensured intense debate by 25 and 26 May . Archbishop ( of Aix ) Raymond de Boisgelins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general assembly persuaded the majority of the clergy that loss of collective clout was the greater danger . By the middle of June , those promoting union with the Third Estate garnered enough votes to win , after several divided and inconclusiveperhaps gerrymanderedvotes . <p> Maurice Hutt decades ago insisted that union with the Third Estate was not what the curTs had voted for : " They had voted to cross to the Third Estates chamber to check election returns . It was not a decision to merge the Order with that of the Third Estate . . . . The leaders of the curT party were prepared for voting by head and urged acceptance of verification in common to bring this about . But they realized quite clearly that this was not a view common among the lower clergy and in their speeches and pamphlets they took care to manage this opinion . " This interpretation has been substantially qualified in subsequent years by Ruth Necheles , William Doyle , and Nigel Aston , who wrote that the clergy " were certainly aware of the implications of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before that they were the French " National Assembly " plain and simple , but at least some of the clergy ( Hutt was not totally wrong ) thought , right up through the fall of the Bastille , that they would be maintained as a distinct order . On 19 July , Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld announced the full participation of the clergy in the Assembly sessions and debates , and the First Estate was no more . A number of these patriote clergy who had voted volens nolens for the crossover in June had changed their mind by the beginning of 1791 , when only one-third of them ( compared to more than one-half of the clergy in general ) were willing to take the oath of loyalty to the Constitution , and accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy . <p> With the union of orders , the Estates General became the Constituent Assembly . One-quarter of the curTs seated there came from peasant or artisan families , representing , then , humbler levels of society . GrTgoires father was a tailor ; Jallets father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of the curTs came from families that were considered notable in the Old Regime , and the rest came from merchant or professional families . Some of the curTs were widely read , and some had managed to publish their own works , with or without university degrees . Work with the Estates General and Constituent Assembly developed the political inclinations of some . Priests belonged , too , to the Jacobin Club , although some of them went along with the Feuillants , constitutional monarchists , when the Jacobins turned antireligious after the end of the Constituent Assembly . This was late June 1789 , and in the following months there was no lack of strife . <p> Reform in the National Assembly : The Ecclesiastical Committee <p> Paris militias and mobs had stormed the Bastille on 14 July . Nobles surrendered their legal and tax privileges in August , after months of rumored and real peasant attacks on the great landed estates . After issuing a balanced " Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , " inspired by the American founding documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be placed at the disposal of the nation . Radical active churchmen , reinforced and even dominated by enthusiastic laymen , worked into the following year to reform and revolutionize church structures . They established the ComitT ecclTsiastique on 12 August to work out the shape of the church for the new regime . <p> Committee members wanted a democratic church that would have as close a relationship to a constitutional monarchy as had the Old Regime church to the Old Regime state . Coming from all three Estates , they were a mixture of nobles , bishops and priests , and laymen trained in canon lawin particular , Jean-Denis Lanjuinais , Jean-Baptiste Treilhard , and Pierre Durand de Maillane . Before long , a new rostrum of members included the future constitutional bishops Thibault , Louis-Alexandre Expilly , and Jean-Baptiste Massieu . According to Durand de Maillane , the Committee continued to hammer out the contents of the future Civil Constitution of the Clergy , trying to ensure a democratically elected roster of clergy . Dioceses were reorganized to conform to the new distribution of departments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided and politically operative units in place of the old ramshackle set of dioceses that included great and small , rich and poor , well and poorly administered , dedicated and charlatan bishops . CurTs and bishops were to be elected , and the bishops duly constituted without a mandate from the pope . Financially supporting the whole system , the state was to ensure an equitable distribution of income . This setup was an amalgam of political and ecclesiastical Gallicanism , an independent churchstate polity that gave churchmen relative independence from Rome while keeping them submissive to the state . <p> Durand de Maillane , reporting on the whole affair , insisted that the state could not let clerical domination and religious abuses continue as it went about the job of cleaning up the other problems . The state could not tolerate any ecclesiastical self-defense from the bishops and priests who were the source of the abuses , no more than it could tolerate any offensive actions against the government . The Catholic Church response could not be taken seriously , because it was offered by " the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See . " When false decretals and new laws unjustly extended Roman authority over the years , " the more learned bishops in these latter days have complained " ; and this was one of the glories of the Gallican church , always holding out against Roman abuses . Durand scorns the lavishness of church ornaments as one major example of clerical self-indulgence . Rather , he envisions a new episcopate , elected after the manner of the early church , " half ecclesiastical , half popular . " It appears , too , that Durand would expect that choices could fall outside the regular rostra of bishops and priests : " I thought that if the choice for the episcopate should fall upon others , it could only be by divine inspiration because of outstanding virtues such as those of Ambrose and Augustine , which appeared to me more in conformity with the minds of the church , and electoral liberty , and ancient customs . " <p> Gallican bishops had always insisted that their church dignity was founded by Christ and , hence , not arbitrary . Durand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrarily , and so sets the bishop in the proper context to benefit from his priests : " It is precisely because of the new cathedral arrangement that we have come to place the bishop and his presbytery in a happy and paternal relationship . " But the aristocratic French bishops were refusing to countenance any loss of dignity and so rejected everything the Assembly tried to do to return to the discipline of the early church , and to assure the care of souls and the preaching of the gospel . Apropos , Durand is especially concerned to ensure the care of souls and the preaching of the gospel , and consequently , to elevate the wretched state of the country priests . <p> As he drafted the document , Durand knew that a principal complaint against election of bishops was based on the possibility of a non-Catholic vote : " But after the explanations that I have given on the real meaning of the acts of election , institution , and consecration , a single response will be enough to refute one or another of the objections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good moral and political foundation for the election ; then it is up to the hierarchy to decide what best serves the spiritual interests of their people . Inasmuch as the decrees presupposed the celebration of a Mass before the election , one would expect non-Catholics to vote in very limited numbers . Durand builds on the commonplace that a special dynamism resided in the bishops of the early church . And in its carefully maintained freedom , the Gallican church is a counterweight to the abuses of the Roman court . So , the " pope is neither infallible nor superior to a general council , which alone represents the church . " He has no civil or temporal rights over kings , nor can he insist that people set up any particular form of society or government . The pope is not to make any particular judgments about the French . That is for the local hierarchy to do , and this in conformity with " natural law and ancient custom . " <p> The Civil Constitution of the Clergy <p> The central church reform document , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Constitution of the Clergy , adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 12 July 1790 , and ratified in effect by all clergy who professed the oath of loyalty to the nation , the law , and the king , at the very beginning of the following year . Pierre Durand de Maillane and Jean-Baptiste Treilhard , the lay canon lawyers , were the outspoken members of the Ecclesiastical Committee across the weeks of debate in 1790 , 29 May to 12 July . But the top orator was Armand-Gaston Camus , lay canon lawyer and polymath , whose theology of the church was the principal inspiration for Adrien Lamourette , the future constitutional bishop , a major influence on Henri GrTgoire and Claude Fauchet all along , and on the comte de Mirabeau in the National Assembly . <p> The Civil Constitution fundamentally restructured French dioceses to coordinate with the new subdivision of the country into departments . Special attention was given to the independence of the French church from outside domination : " No church or parish of France , and no French citizen , may , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of an ordinary bishop or archbishop whose see is established under the name of a foreign power . " Cities of less than six thousand people were to have one parish only ; cities of more than six thousand were to have as many parishes as necessary to take care of the needs of the people . All titles and offices were to be abolished . <p> In providing for the election of church officials , the Civil Constitution revived much earlier custom . Priests who served fifteen years within a diocese were eligible for election as bishop and , if elected , would receive confirmation from the metropolitan bishop ; if election was to the metropolitan see itself , confirmation would come from the oldest bishop of the arrondissement . Each bishop with his council constituted the regional church authority . The election of the local curT was to take place in each parish , following the form established for election of members of the district administrative assembly . <p> Set between the rules for the election of the bishop and the election of the curT were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops were to report in ( and only report in ) to the pope : " The new bishop may not apply to the Pope for confirmation , but shall write to him as the Visible Head of the Universal Church , in testimony of the unity of faith and communion which he is to maintain therewith . " Second , the bishop was to take an oath of loyalty to the nation , the law , and the king : " The bishop-elect shall take a solemn oath , in the presence of the municipal officials , the people , and the clergy , to watch with care over the faithful of the diocese entrusted to him , to be faithful to the nation , to the law , and to the king , and to maintain with all his power the Constitution decreed by the National Assembly and accepted by the king . " All clergy were to be salaried by the state but held to laws of residency . " No bishop may absent himself from his diocese for more than fifteen consecutive days during any year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curTs and vicars in their parishes . <p> When the time came , the elections themselves were conducted as part of the new governmental electoral structure . Selection of bishops and curTs was actually accomplished by electors who were themselves chosen by voters who met in primary assemblies . There would be one elector for every one hundred citizens , and the electors tended to be relatively well-off , with enough leisure time to take part in the somewhat lengthy process . Later constitutional writers seldom acknowledged this two-tier system , but preferred , rather , to evoke a golden age of early church history , when the faithful would in all freedom and innocence choose their clergy , sometimes by acclamation . In fact , the system tended to produce bishops and priests that appealed to the more radical bourgeoisie . <p> If one label is to be used to explain the motivations or at least the orientation of the champions of the Civil Constitution , it would be " Gallican , " the grand old tradition of a national church wherein the French bishops would establish and carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome ( and so , Roman Catholic ) but not under his direct jurisdiction . The old Jansenists in the Committee and legislative discussions cobbled together as many usable parts as possible from the old multiform and sometimes self-contradictory ideology ; and the old Richerist tendencies were considerably diffusedall of which has led Catherine Maire to write , " Jansenism dissolved into its own proper contradictions . " <p> Even so , the bishops in the Constituent Assembly , with Boisgelin at their head , constrained to oppose any final churchstate structures that the state would set up unilaterally , circulated an Exposition des principes on 30 October 1790 . They insisted that the legislature should work with either a church council or the pope , for without that no redistribution of religious authority would be possible . Roman cardinals , in special session that September , were weighing the potential for schism of the redrawing of the diocesan boundaries , episcopal elections , and the relationship of bishops to Roman authority ; they were to advise the pope , whose considered response the French bishops anxiously awaited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 November decree obliging the clergy to swear the oath of loyalty to the nation , the law , and the king ( implying acceptance of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy ) . Henri GrTgoire actually took the oath ahead of schedule , believing that it was the only way to reconcile the church and the revolutionary government . A minority of the priests and only two of the bishops in the Assembly took the oath . In the end , only seven of the Old Regime bishops took the oath : Talleyrand and Jean-Baptiste Gobel , the Assembly members , and then +tienne-Charles de LomTnie de Brienne of Sens , Louis-Frantois-Alexandre Jarente of OrlTans , Charles de la Font de Savine of Viviers , and the non-jurisdictional bishops Jean-Baptiste Dubourg-Miroudot ( titular bishop of Babylon ) and Pierre-Frantois Martial de LomTnie ( titular bishop of Trianopolis ) . The massive refusal of the bishops came out of motivations theological and psychological , but aristocratic family background certainly weighed in here . More than 50 percent of the priests in public ministry ( a much higher percentage than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives , mapped by Timothy Tackett , were more varied than the motives of the bishops , of course , and can be conjectured with reasonable confidence by reference to authority and financial stability of church appointment , theological orientation , ecclesiastical milieu , age , social position , and location of diocese . The map of the wildly varying percentages of oath takers in the different regions of France , derived from Tacketts broad sociography of oath takers , does not show these motivational factors , and must be supplemented with his other statistics . <p> Priests in their thirties and those over sixty took the oath in greater numbers , probably because they were more vulnerable financially . CurTs from the aristocracy unsurprisingly rejected the oath , and curTs from the formerly Jansenistand so , still relatively anti-episcopalareas accepted it , but those from the lowest economic strata took the oath in greatest numbers . A seminary education was an investment that poorer families did not want to lose . As for milieu , priests who lived in close proximity to colleagues were less likely to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lay community . Personality traits are harder to pin down , although , after a sampling of ten provinces , Tackett noted " that of those young men specifically cited for their piety , only about a fourth would take the oath . . . . On the other hand , some two thirds of the young priests described with the relatively neutral adjective honnOte or criticized for their haughtiness or quick temper would ultimately emerge oath takers . . . . There was apparently a tendency to those least amenable to ecclesiastical discipline to later accept the Civil Constitution . " <p> With eighty-three dioceses and only a handful of Old Regime bishops available , new bishops had to be chosen from the ranks of the constitutional priests . Talleyrand , assisted by Gobel and Miroudot , consecrated Fathers Louis-Alexandre Expilly and Claude-Eustache-Frantois Marolles , who then got right to the task of producing more new bishops , consecrating around fifty by the end of the first month . When regional governments organized the election of the curTs , immediate problems ensued . Only a limited number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to go , and elected curTs were often unwilling to take up the posts to which they were called . Most often a nonjuror was replaced with a juror , although many nonjurors proved impossible to replace . Antagonisms quickly multiplied with violence perpetrated by rough-and-ready types offended by the constitutional clergy , their anger heated up by some of the more embittered or extreme refractories . Constitutional bishops , in their new dioceses , were met sooner or later with mockery , accompanied at times by violence . <p> Accepting or rejecting their new priests , the common people were inevitably engaged : in some regions the peasants were quite fond of their old curT or the traditional modes of church life . Constitutional bishops and priests themselves were resentful of troublesome refractories , but occasionally reached out with , or responded to , kindness . As far as the government was concerned , the constitutionals were the real priests of France . They were to control all the parish registers , and thus records of baptisms , marriage , deathsmatters of vital public record . Refractories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them all the more . The parish of Saint-Sulpice in Paris was able to get around the restrictions by turning over jurisdiction to a religious order , the Theatines . Constitutional bishops , their authority so often in question , could maintain that authority only by formal rejection of refractory ministries ; they were aided by the passage on 14 May 1791 of the Le Chapelier Law requiring that recalcitrant clergy be brought to court . <p> In Paris , the only other bishop in the Constituent Assembly who had taken the oath with Talleyrand , Jean-Baptiste Gobel , was elected bishop , receiving five hundred votes , as opposed to the fifty-six votes for Louis Charrier de la Roche , then a canon from Lyon , and the twenty-six votes for SieyFs , who declined to be a candidate anyway . Gobel had an indifferent reputation in Alsace , where he was serving as bishop after a position as auxiliary bishop of BGle : the main problem seemed to be his debts , resulting from high though probably not immoral living . Income was a factor in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Langres , and Agen . There were even some reports that he was willing to negotiate his submission to the Holy See for a certain sum . He turned out to be an inconsistent leader , alternately showing pastoral concern and submission to revolutionary dechristianization . His correspondence with government officials contained little explicit talk about spirituality , theology , or ministry . His priestly personality can be glimpsed only in a few rare texts , such as one letter to a local government committee about his Paris seminarians , who straddled residency in the nearby parish of Saint-Magloire and liturgy in the cathedral . A principal issue for Gobel was their health ! " There is no one who does not feel that we would endanger the health of the young men by forcing them , in winter especially , to come back to Saint-Magloire after the morning office , only to return to Notre-Dame for the evening office after dinner , and by requiring subsequently that they remain for two or three hours after they arrive soaked by rain or covered with snow . " The seminarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , because they assist in teaching catechism ( Gobel developed four catechisms since taking charge of the diocese ) , and they get the opportunity to hear good preachers . It all might have worked out in less trying times . <p> One revolutionary priest who had established his reputation in Paris before Gobel was elected bishop there was Claude Fauchet . Right in the middle of the violent storming of the Bastille , Fauchet , the churchman closest to the men who fought and died there , was at the center of Parisian political and religious life . Later bishop of Calvados , he was the revolutionary priest and constitutional bishop who animated the radical activity that spread from the capital to the provinces . Both by his life and by his writings , he proved to be an essential " priest of the French Revolution . "

These other residents helped Azmet locate the Jew and , after giving him a severe beating , hand him over to Valldignas abbot , who then , according to the crowns lawyer , exploited the situation to enrich himself . <p> The abbot allegedly incarcerated Abraham under harsh conditions until the Jews father could arrive from their town of Alzira , twenty kilometers to the north , to issue the abbot a promissory note for one hundred gold florins for his release . He also refused to return the sack full of silk that Abraham had been carrying at the time of the attack . The Jews later claimed it was worth more than one hundred pounds . In search of a judicial forum to overrule the monastery , Abraham lodged a complaint with the monarchys bailiff general in Valencia . After the officer failed to get an adequate response from the abbot , however , he referred the matter to the royal court . <p> During the court proceedings , the jurisdictional issues raised by the case overshadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The systemic challenge the case presented to royal prerogatives likely accounts for the trials length and the extensiveness of its extant transcripts . In keeping with the claims of Valencias thirteenth-century territorial law , the Furs de ValFncia , the monarchy asserted that , because all Jews represented " the kings treasure , " all cases involving Jews , no matter where they were perpetrated , necessarily fell under royal jurisdiction . Given the circumstances of the case , the Jew obviously had a strong interest in collaborating with the monarchys agenda , just as the Muslims who testified were motivated to support their lord . On future occasions , however , residents of Valldigna in conflict with the abbot would instead seek to use the monarchys jurisdictional claims to escape seigniorial justice . One local Muslim in 1481 publicly ridiculed the executive authority of Valldignas justice , jeering that he was unable " to hang anyone outside the valley in the Kings land , God guard him ! " Proclaiming himself " a vassal of my lord the King , " however , did not deter the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . <p> In the case involving Abraham , the crown aimed to expose and condemn the dangerous precedent perpetrated by the abbot of Valldigna . By universalizing the case , the royal legal experts managed to use it to broadcast the monarchys claims of exclusive jurisdiction over Jews such as Abraham . In his testimony , the governor of Valencia , who claimed responsibility to " maintain and defend royal jurisdiction , " stated matter-of-factly that " usurpers and occupiers of royal jurisdiction and violators of licenses of safe passage guiatges from the king granted to this Jew and to other Jews must be punished . " He based his retelling and argumentation on the assumption that the monarchys exclusive relationship with the Jews was legally incontrovertible and universally recognized . Thus , according to the governor , when these Muslims decided to attack this lender , they naturally understood and were choosing to defy what was " known to all " by not " paying heed to omnipotent God and royal authority , nor observing how the said Jew and all of the other Jews are under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Azmet grabbed a staff to kill Abraham , the governor reasoned , he must have been " motivated by an evil spirit , " since any subject in his right mind would have known not to transgress royal authority in such a fashion . <p> In this situation , from the crowns point of view , the abbot should have known to cede the handling of the case to the kings chief officer for the kingdom of Valencia . His abuse of the judicial and executive authority he had usurped from the monarchy by finding Abraham guilty without cause and illegitimately seizing his property further emphasized why special subjects such as the Jews so depended on the effective protection that only the king could offer . Even though the monarchy did not mention its parallel claims to possess all Muslims in its realms , the case obviously had serious implications for the abbots jurisdictional power over Valldignas Muslim inhabitants . If Azmet had indeed been the victim , as he and his lord had claimed , would the monarchy have had the same right to intervene ? <p> Valldigna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the monarchys own claims by appealing to feudal law . Through his procurator , the abbot argued that , as local lord , he enjoyed the expression of the crowns regalian prerogatives on his domains . And , unfortunately for the crown , in this instance its opponents had the documentation on hand to support their claim . According to evidence presented by the abbots procurator , the kings predecessor , Jaume II ( r. 12911327 ) , had indeed invested the abbots of Valldigna with this independence by assigning them a charter of donation in 1300 , later confirmed by Pere III ( r. 133687 ) . It had awarded them full jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases ( merum et mixtum imperium ) as well as all other rights pertaining to " our regalia " over " all men and women residing or who will reside " within these domains in perpetuity . The language of the Furs de ValFncia , the abbots procurator continued , furthermore " provides no impediment , " since it must apply only to lords who had not already been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no doubt , he concluded , " that the said Lord Abbot is able to punish any delinquents in the said Valldigna , either a Jew or whomever it might be . " <p> Thus , the monks of Valldigna had little reason to challenge outright the monarchys claims that the Jews pertained to the royal treasure because the principle undergirded their own jurisdictional rights . From their point of view , the royal donation had invested the monks with legal ownership of this treasure when it fell within their domains . The conflict between the principle of theoretically inalienable regalian jurisdiction over the Jews and the monarchys chronic tendency to transfer such rights to independent lordships for varying objectives had caused numerous similar scenarios throughout the Crown of Aragon over the past generations . <p> This book explores the origins of such controversies over the development and implementation of a policy of exclusive possession of resident Jews by the monarchy of the Crown of Aragon from the twelfth through the early fourteenth centuries . By scrutinizing the case of the town of Tortosa alongside an array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range of responses by independent lords who contested these jurisdictional prerogatives claimed by the crown because , like the monks of Valldigna , they felt legally entitled to enforce justice among the Jews and other subjects in their domains . The primary argument to be made here is that , far from a curiosity of legal history , these engagements had significant , lasting implications for the coexistence of Jews within Christian-ruled society and the development of royal governance . They influenced the regulatory norms for Jews that would endure until the expulsion , altered the dynamics within and between individual Jewish communities , and affected the modes of interaction between Jews and royal and seigniorial authorities . Similar to the court case in Valldigna , these confrontations forced rival local constituencies to confront and reconcile their conflicting interpretations about the very nature of royal power . The outcomes of these engagements have significant implications for their interrelationships as well as , potentially , for the potency of the crowns regalian claims .

It is the product of an extended period of reflection on art history in Habsburg central Europe . One of my first published articles was on Alois Riegl , with whom I had first become acquainted as a graduate teaching assistant at the University of St. Andrews in the early 1990s , when he formed part of a course in historiography that I taught . Since that time the scholarly landscape on the Vienna School of art history has undergone enormous transformations ; twenty years ago the literature on the subject was modest , and that available in English was even more limited . Access to primary sources was a significant problem . Aside from a few reeditions in the 1960s and 1970s , the writings by the major representatives of the Vienna School were out of print and difficult to obtain . This was doubly the case with editions in English , which consisted of Riegls " Late Roman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient oder Rom ? ) , Late Roman Art Industry ( a questionable translation of Riegls Die spStrmische Kunstindustrie ) , and an edition of Max Dvorks History of Art as the History of Ideas . <p> The situation has since changed dramatically ; a turning point , perhaps , was marked by the publication in 1992 of Margaret Olins monograph on Riegl , Forms of Representation in Alois Riegls Theory of Art , and of an English translation of Riegls Stilfragen ( Problems of Style ) . The importance of Riegl was confirmed the following year , when Margaret Iversens monograph on him appeared . The translation of Stilfragen was the first of a number of important English editions of works by Riegl and other Viennese art historians , and new translations continue to appear . This has paralleled renewed efforts in Austria to publish new critical editions of work by Vienna School scholars . The advent of online digital libraries and archives , providing access to historic primary texts , has increased still further the availability of primary materials . The renewed publication of works associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume of scholarly research on the subject . At the time of writing , the library of the Zentralinstitut fnr Kunstgeschichte in Munich , which has arguably the most extensive holdings , listed sixty-seven items on Riegl alone published since 2000 , in languages as diverse as Croatian , German , French , Italian , Slovak , and English . <p> Despite the appearance of such a volume of commentary and analysis , the literature on the Vienna School remains curiously partial and incomplete . It is partial inasmuch as by far the greatest degree of critical attention has been devoted to Alois Riegl , with other figures , not least the " founder " of the Vienna School , Rudolf von Eitelberger , languishing in relative obscurity . In many respects this situation is easily explicable ; given his contributions to scholarship on textiles , ornament , the applied arts of late antiquity , monument protection policy and theory , folk art , Baroque art and architecture , together with his methodological innovations , Riegl was by far the most consistently original art historian working in Vienna between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the heightened interest in Rieglwhich can at times come close to a fetishism of the author figureproduces a restricted vision of the discursive dynamics of Viennese art history . A prominent example of this phenomenon can be seen in the treatment of Franz Wickhoff and Alois Riegls conflict with Josef Strzygowski over the origins of early medieval art . This dispute has largely been viewed in terms of the political differences between the individuals concerned , but this view underplays the fact that they were reprising a decades-long debate over European identity and the place of Austria-Hungary in Europe , a debate that continued long after the personal antagonism between these authors had been forgotten . <p> This book therefore gives less prominence to Riegl than usual in accounts of the Vienna School . My intention is not so much to rehabilitate neglected art historians , such as Moriz Thausing , Albert Ilg , or even Franz Wickhoff ( who is usually only discussed in relation to the dispute with Strzygowski or his part in the furor raised by Klimts Philosophy frieze ) , as to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors and toward larger-scale themes that preoccupied art historians in Austria-Hungary . <p> In many respects , therefore , this book diverges from the approaches that have characterized most accounts of the Vienna School . It examines the novel ideas and methods explored by individual art historians , but it is concerned less with method per se than with the situational logic and the ideological and institutional factors that shaped art-historical practices in Austria-Hungary from the 1840s until its demise , in 1918 . It is thus primarily a political and social history of the discipline , rather than an account of its intellectual evolution , and stands apart from interpretations by commentators such as Michael Podro , who have located the Vienna School in a discursive tradition preoccupied with the philosophical legacy of Kant and Hegel . Riegl has loomed large in such readings , starting with Stilfragen , which made a decisive break with the legacy and influence of Gottfried Semper . Within this framework , the other significant component of Riegls thought was his notion of the Kunstwollen ( variously translated as " art drive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , and ever since Erwin Panofskys essay on the topic in 1920 , commentators have wrestled with the philosophical meaning and scope of the term . A similar preoccupation has been visible in the reception of Riegls intervention into monument conservation and protection ; his famous article on the cult of monuments has been the object of interest primarily due to its attempt to posit a theory of historicity , including an evolutionary typology of treatments of history . This has in turn been taken up and revisited in the light of contemporary concerns with time and with the experience of time in the Viennese fin de siFcle . <p> The originality of Riegls thinking is not in question , but such accounts tend to diminish other factors ; the essay on the cult of monuments was one of many articles Riegl wrote on monument protection , the predominant themes of which were not the theoretical issues mentioned above but rather the role that monument protection and conservation had to play in the cultural politics of contemporary Austria-Hungary . It has to be seen alongside his critique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian Georg Dehio and the restoration projects undertaken in , for example , Cracow or Split to " restore " the artistic and architectural heritage of Polish Galicia or Dalmatia in line with local nationalist and religious visions of the past . Riegls meditation on the cult of monuments was only one of many other contemporary publications on the same topic , in a state that had long sanctioned historicism as an official visual style but that tentatively supported Secessionism and progressive artistic currents as part of its program of cultural modernization . <p> Much writing by Vienna School art historians thus revolved less around questions of methodology and more around ones of aesthetic , historical , and political value . Viewing art history in Austria-Hungary in this light allows the role of other authors to come into consideration . In comparison with Riegl , figures such as Eitelberger , Thausing , and Ilg , for example , were not pioneers of art-historical method , but they played an equally important role in laying out the parameters of inquiry and in intervening into wider public debates about artistic tradition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Dvork , who , although one of the most prominent and influential art historians working in Habsburg Vienna , has attracted a surprisingly small body of commentary , having been dismissed by one observer as responsible for a genre of art-historical writing that " verged on the popular , the sensational and the grandiose . " <p> At the heart of these deliberations lies the fundamental methodological question of how one should write a history of the Vienna School . As Michael Podro has asked , " What kind of commentary are we to construct upon a literature . . . if we no longer believe in its theories ? " One approach has been to identify specific conceptual and theoretical issues with a contemporary resonance and reread them in relation to the interests of the present . Hence , the fact that Riegl had written extensively on the applied arts , for example , led some commentators in the 1990s to mention him when constructing the genealogy of the emerging field of visual studies . However , a number of alternative paradigms that also diminish the focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important is institutional inquiry , first explored by Heinrich Dilly . Combining elements of Foucauldian discourse analysis with concrete historical research into specific institutions , Dilly has examined the institutional framework that shaped the emergence of art history as a discipline . Although interest in the author figure has persisted , Dillys model has been taken up by a number of important studies , including Lyne Therriens analysis of French art history , Hubert Lochers study of art history in Germany , and Donald Preziosis work on the interlinking of art history and the exhibitionary and museological complex of the modern European state . <p> This book adopts a broadly similar approach , viewing the emergence of art history in Austria-Hungary in the context of the institutions where it was taught and where research was undertaken . These included , primarily , the University of Vienna and the Museum for Art and Industry in Vienna , where many art historians , most notably Riegl , started out on their scholarly careers . It also considers the role of other institutions . These include the imperial-royal Central Commission for the Investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erforschung und Erhaltung der Baudenkmale ) , the Ministry of Culture and Education , and other museums and societies that formed the institutional matrix that sustained the development of art history as a professional discipline . <p> While central to the investigation , analysis of the institutional setting of art history is nevertheless limited in scope without an equal degree of attention to the wider political , ideological , and social context of the Habsburg Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . Although some studies have begun to explore this dimension , it remains surprisingly understudied except in outline . Studying the Vienna School in the light of its social and political background raises the obvious question of how that background should be constructed . One of the most influential accounts of the culture of the later Habsburg Empire has been that of Carl Schorske , who attributes the extraordinary flowering of late nineteenth-century Viennese intellectual , artistic , and cultural life to the failure of liberalism . Accordingly , Schorske has interpreted Secessionist culture as a form of Oedipal revolt against the material , economic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this reading the failure of the liberal bourgeoisie to shape the political direction of the Austrian state in any substantial way resulted in either an aesthetic withdrawal from public life or its counterpart , the rise of the right-wing nationalism , populism , and anti-Semitism of Karl Luegers Christian Social Party . Fritz Ringers account of Germany during the same period provides a compelling parallel , in which the political disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie under the authoritarian regime of the Wilhelminian Reich resulted in a retreat into scholarly learning and culture ( Bildung ) as a compensatory gesture , accompanied by an aestheticized distancing from social and political life . <p> Schorske has offered a persuasive thesis that could in principle also be applied to the Vienna School ; Eitelberger , the liberal " father " of Viennese art history , who played a central role in the formation of key imperial cultural institutions in the 1860s and 1870s and whose historicist orientations epitomized the artistic and aesthetic values of those decades , was followed by the generation of Wickhoff and Riegl , whose work was much more sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the figure of Strzygowski , whose strident ressentiment toward the Viennese scholarly establishment drew from the same ideological and political well as Luegers Christian Socialism . <p> This story of generational and ideological conflict is suggestive , but it presents a partial account . As Pieter Judson has recently emphasized , German liberal culture proved surprisingly resilient , and while the rise of the mass politics of the right and the left clearly challenged its position , it survived as an ideological position till the collapse of the Empire in 1918 . Moreover , Schorske masks important continuities in political , social , and cultural life . The art historians Eitelberger and his successors , for example , were all united in their loyalties to the Habsburg state ; his pupil Albert Ilg explicitly declared his allegiance to the monarchy and berated those of his contemporaries who lacked a sense of Austrian patriotism , while Riegl and Dvork were highly critical of the nationalist ideologiesGerman as well as Slavof the decades preceding the outbreak of the First World War . In addition , the putative political alienation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempered by the fact that the government gave considerable support to Secessionism . As Jeroen Bastiaan van Heerde has demonstrated , state sponsorship for Klimt and other artists was generous precisely because of the international character of their work , which presented an image of Austria-Hungary as a progressive cosmopolitan state . <p> The greatest limitation of Schorskes study , however , and of the publications that emerged in its wake , is its excessive focus on Vienna . Thus , even if his interpretation is accepted , it arguably applies only to a small cultural elite based in the metropolis ; its value for an understanding of the complex cultural dynamics of the wider monarchy is restricted . A similar criticism can be made of research into the historiography of art . Few studies of the Vienna School have paid attention to its place in the wider context of central Europe . Where comparisons have been made , they have mostly been made with art historians in Germany . It is of course undeniable that art historians in Vienna belonged to a larger German-language scholarly community that encompassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multilingual context of the Empire . Specifically , art historians had to contend with the gradual decline of German as the lingua franca of art-historical scholarship and with the rise of scholarly communities writing in Czech , Polish , Croatian , and Hungarian , many of whom studied in Vienna but then later came to challenge its intellectual hegemony . This challenge saw its most extreme form in the bitter exchanges in Prague between Czech and German Bohemian art historians , in which academic appointments and entire institutions were assimilated to wider political disputes , but it occurred elsewhere too . <p> This study sets art-historical writing against this background , considering how Vienna-based art historians responded to the increasingly fractured intellectual and cultural life of the late Habsburg Empire . In this context , the work of art historians in languages other than German remains woefully underinvestigated , and when it has been investigated , the research has largely been undertaken by scholars writing their own national histories of the discipline in Czech , Polish , or Croatian , which , for linguistic reasons , have hardly reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of art history across Austria-Hungary , this study nevertheless explores this broader context and analyzes its implications for an understanding of the practices of Vienna-based art historians . <p> Foregrounding the larger political and cultural contexts of Austria-Hungary invites the obvious question regarding this books methodological and conceptual framework , especially given the limitations of Schorske . One of the most important recent developments in Habsburg studies has been the application of postcolonial theory to the analysis of the relations between Vienna and the " peripheries " of the Empire and between the Empires differing minorities . This has proved enormously productive in the interpretation of the Empires intercultural dynamics and of the way that a variety of cultural practices and discourses , including art history , sustained the quasi-colonial and imperial attitudes of the Viennese intelligentsia as well as its political class . As one of the great European powers , Austria-Hungary could be compared with France or Britain in its treatment of its subjects . Although it had no overseas colonies , many of its minorities struggled to achieve recognition of their national aspirations ; thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their liberal counterparts elsewhere in Europe , many were also driven by a nationalist agenda that sought greater political and cultural recognition . The most dramatic expression of this impulse was the failed Hungarian revolution , which embraced the cause of Magyar self-determination and , ultimately , independence . Conversely , for many in Vienna the image of the various minorities of the Empire , especially those in the eastern and southern extremities of Galicia , Bukovina , Dalmatia , and Bosnia , differed little from the image those in London or Paris held of the colonial subjects in Africa or India . <p> The popular travelogue of 1876 From Semi-Asia : The Land and People of Eastern Europe , by the novelist and journalist Karl Franzos , encapsulated the beliefs of many Viennese about the picturesque but " backward " cultures and inhabitants of the eastern " fringes " of the Empire . For their part , members of many of the minority culturesincluding Franzos ( 18481904 ) himself , born to Jewish parents in the " peripheral " eastern province of Bukovinaexhibited a complex array of attitudes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ambivalence and even clear opposition . These attitudes can also be seen in the writings of art historians of the various minority cultures . Some openly identified with the legitimizing ideology of the Habsburg Empire , while some were strongly committed to an oppositional stance and used art history as an instrument for resisting " Austrian " ( or " Hungarian " ) cultural dominance . Still others remained attached to the notion of a distinctive identityand to the " rediscovery " or invention of a separate national artistic traditionwhile nevertheless holding on to the Empire as providing the best political settlement possible . Recent work in this area has identified the extent to which many actors saw no contradiction between the promotion of a distinctive national identity , on the one hand , and loyalty to the emperor , on the other , whom they saw as the protector of their rights against the putative predations of other minorities . <p> Parallels with the other European empires are suggestive , but Austria-Hungary was nevertheless different . Although its peripheral regions functioned as semicolonial territoriesthe only proper colony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other European states has to be treated with caution . As Andrea Komlosy has argued , the relation of center and periphery was multilayered . After the Compromise ( Ausgleich ) of 1867 , in which Hungary was granted near autonomy except in military and foreign affairs , the monarchy had two political centers : Vienna and Budapest . Moreover , while Vienna may have been an economic , cultural , and political center , Budapest , and indeed Hungary , were economic peripheries . In contrast , Bohemia , which was a political " periphery , " was economically and educationally one of the most advanced crown lands of the Empire . Galicia had , after 1868 , substantial local political autonomy , and although economically tied to Vienna in certain respects , it also enjoyed a substantial degree of local control over its economic resources , in particular oil . <p> There was also no single dominant national group ; German language and culture occupied a hegemonic position , but the monarchy continuously resisted German nationalism . Austro-German liberals dominated the government and the legislative program during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under Count Eduard Taaffe , ruled by means of support from the so-called Iron Ring , a coalition of Czechs , Poles , and conservative Austro-Germans . While the Empire did not recognize national groups as collective bodies , this did not amount to official systematic discrimination against individuals of particular linguistic or ethnic backgrounds , even if many individual Germans regarded the Slavs or the Romanians as culturally inferior . <p> Patterns of cultural , economic , and political influence and dominance were also not uniform , and the three did not necessarily always coincide .

Muratoris book , which appeared in 1723 , was a clarion call by the modest priest from Modena for a system of Catholic charity based on individual assistance to the poor , sick , and disabled that constituted a better imitation of Christ than traditional pieties that emphasized endowments for chapels , masses for the dead , and gifts of property to the Church . Crespi , in his early seventies when he wrote to Muratori and doubtless thinking seriously about the nature of good works essential to Catholic salvation , found the arguments of Christian Charity persuasive . The survival of Crespis letter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spiritual life of an eighteenth-century Catholic artist . An important premise of the present book is that artistsas well as the individuals and institutions that patronize themlive in society and engage , with varying intensity , in the broader cultural , social , spiritual , economic , and political contexts in which they live and work . The reforming impulse of the Catholic Church in the middle decades of the Settecento and its impact on art and visual culture , broadly defined , is the subject of my study . <p> To approach this complex theme coherently requires an answer to the question , What was Catholic enlightenment ? Until relatively recently , most scholars considered the notion either oxymoronic or illusory , because the Catholic Church , according to received wisdom , was a tireless and indefatigable enemy of modernity . The eighteenth-century Papacy , however , recognized the advantages of engaging aspects of progressive thinking , and many in the ecclesiastical hierarchy , both in Italy and abroad , were sincerely interested in making the Church more relevant in the modern world and , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cogent ideology with a clearly identifiable agenda , Catholic enlightenment was more an attitude about how things could be made better for a larger segment of the body politic . Compromise , conciliation , and moderation were its defining characteristics , and it attempted to absorb as much of the new intellectual and social energy of the age of reason as was possible for an institution and belief system based on divine revelation and historical privilege . Thus Catholic enlightenment shared many of the assumptions and goals on which the broader , secular enlightenment was based . <p> Catholic enlightenment in the eighteenth century , although it manifested an idea of reform with a long history in the Church , differed fundamentally from past reforming tendencies , especially those advocated by the Council of Trent that initiated the Catholic Reformation , in its commitment to increasing accommodation and compromise with Catholic rulers . This spirit of " throne and altar , " highly problematic in many respects , was necessitated by the political weakness of the Holy See . Most Settecento pontiffs recognized the absolute necessity of cooperating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission , which many progressive Catholics believed more important than the Secular Power , the term for the popes position as ruler of most of central Italy . The Roman hierarchy , as it came to understand the need for reform and spiritual renewal to preserve the Churchs authority in an increasingly secular era , began to feel an urgent need to get the house in order . Moreover , progressive reformers , having achieved the prominence in ecclesiastical government that was a major feature of enlightened Catholicism , were in a position to influence policy directly , both in Rome and throughout Catholic Europe . Although reforming efforts had mixed success , scholars recognition of the initiative in and of itself helps to position the papacy nearer the center of European enlightenment . The Roman version of the phenomenon differed little from its counterparts in other parts of Catholic Europe . <p> As the historian Dorinda Outram has pointed out , European enlightenment can no longer be considered an invention of a small group of French male writers ; it can not be identified with " a coherent intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European and even global " periphery " underscores the atypical nature of the French version of enlightenment that Friedrich Hegel ( 17701831 ) noted in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy ( 182526 ) . In these , he argued , for example , that church and state became equal targets of French intellectual critique because France had not experienced the Reformation in the same way as Germany , and thus Germanys enlightenment was more tolerant of the institutional status quo . Even in Scotland , where the mainstream of enlightenment was at its anticlerical and even atheistic extreme , an established group of Catholic writers shared a religious view of social progress similar to that of enlightened Catholic intellectuals in France , Germany , Austria , and elsewhere . The Italian historian Franco Venturi argued long ago that mainstream reformers and enlightenment elements of reforming Catholicism in Italy shared some interests , although his anticlericalism ultimately caused him to dismiss Catholic enlightenment reforms as insufficiently radical . The reform espoused by enlightened Catholicism sought neither to reinvent society nor to sweep away traditional institutions but to reform them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , but the traditional notion that they were synonymous with those of the philosophes is erroneous . The Hapsburg court of Maria Theresa ( r. 174080 ) in Vienna is a case in point . Moderate French Catholic authors of the preceding generation , such as Jacques BTnigne Bossuet ( 16271704 ) and Frantois de Salignac de la Mothe-FTnelon ( 16511715 ) , were just as influential there as Voltaire and Denis Diderot ( if not more so ) , and the rigorist tendencies so pronounced in French Jansenism ( which Voltaire loathed ) influenced ecclesiastical reform under Maria Theresa and her co-ruler and son , Joseph II ( r. alone 178090 ) . Most Catholic monarchs championed the " Christian Philosopher , " a characterization rejected by Peter Gay as oxymoronic . Separating progressive ideas from religious motivation gives an incomplete idea of ancien rTgime attempts to create a more reasonable government that existed , in theory , to make its citizens more prosperous , secure , and happy . <p> Reform Catholicism and Catholic enlightenment in Italy were influenced by the weight of history and the perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept papal claims to authority based solely on tradition . By the mid- eighteenth century only Piedmont and Naples , among the Italian states , had any real political and military clout in European dynastic dramas . The others had to rely on strategic alliances to preserve their independence . Because the Papal States remained neutral in conflicts between Catholic princes , an attitude of appeasement and accommodation necessarily carried the day . Pontifical strategies based on cultural politics to bolster Romes position had been developing since the end of the seventeenth century , but Catholic reform to be carried out in conjunction with the secular rulers came later , reaching its apogee under Benedict XIV ( r. 174058 ) . It would be cynical to argue that the papal version of enlightened Catholicism was engendered only by fear and political impotence , although those were doubtless factors . Much more significant , however , were the legacy of reform begun at the Council of Trent in the sixteenth century and the formal rejection of papal nepotism in the bull issued by Innocent XII ( r. 16911700 ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals . Both were deeply concerned with eliminating simony in the awarding of Church offices , increasing the number and quality of seminaries that trained parish priests , deploying the arts to promote piety and provide visual models of sanctity , and enforcing canonical rules regarding episcopal residency . Catholic enlightenment reform , unlike its Tridentine predecessor , however , emphasized anti-nepotism , improvement of the working relationship with Catholic monarchs , and social rather than more strictly theological issues . Moreover , eighteenth-century ecclesiastical reform responded not so much to a Protestant challenge as to the need to secure the Churchs relevance . Appeals to culture , the arts , and history were more significant in the era of enlightenment than they had been in the Counter-Reformation . <p> Anyone who has been to Rome is cognizant of the historical legacy everywhere in evidence . Italians took ( and still take ) great pride in their position as the home of Western antiquitys greatest empire , and the popes self-consciously claimed the mantle of imperial authority . While some felt that the weight of tradition had enervated the peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lione Pascoli ( 16741744 ) looked to the past as a promise of future progress , claiming that " the world is still young and full of possibilities . " Pascoli and others began to understand the shifting nature of historical judgmentsfor example , the disparagement of the modern Italian school of paintingand predicted that in time artists such as Giovanni Battista Gaulli ( 16391709 ) and Carlo Maratti ( 16251713 ) would get their due . Catholic reform also drew inspiration from its venerable past , and those seeking reform viewed it not as the pursuit of a perpetually unattainable goal but as an active agent of change in contemporary efforts to create a better world . <p> Because many Catholic intellectuals embraced reform and posited a broad array of ideas for transforming the Church from within , some attention to the nuances of the adjective " moderate " is required to assess the remarkable accomplishments of these individuals . Two prominent figures help make my point : Celestino Galiani ( 16811753 ) and Lodovico Antonio Muratori , the recipient of the letter from Crespi quoted in the epigraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponents of Newtonian thinking and empirical science , was also a papal diplomat and abbot general of the Celestine Order . Clement XII ( r. 173040 ) named him bishop of Taranto in the kingdom of Naples , where he spent the last twenty years of his life . Galiani , with an unusually well developed understanding of the strong link between political authority and cultural reform , was in a key position , as the abbot of a major Catholic order and a trusted advisor to the king of Naples , to promote progressive ideas . In his best-known treatise , La scienza morale , he came as close to a Lockean privileging of human reason as was possible for a professed Catholic . ( John Lockes publications were all on the Holy Offices Index of Forbidden Books by the time Galianis publication appeared . ) The Celestine savant had also been influential as a teacher in Rome during the pontificate of Clement XI ( r. 17001721 ) , numbering among his pupils Silvio Valenti Gonzaga ( 16901756 ) , who later became cardinal secretary of state under Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinal journeyed to Naples to attend Galianis funeral in 1753 , only three years before his own . <p> Compared with Galiani , who engaged with scientific progress and cultural reform , Muratori represented the more moderate cadre of Catholic reformers , emphasizing clerical discipline , institutional responsibility to societys underclass , and a tireless war against the " excesses " of popular piety and superstition . Both thinkers believed that reform was essential to the survival of traditional institutions . Muratori , however , was more interested in empiricisms implications for the study of history than in contemporary science . Arguably Settecento Italys most respected historian , Muratori , like his contemporary Pascoli , took great pride in Italian cultural achievements under the aegis of the Church . His Annali dItalia , a twelve-volume study of post-antique Italian history , published in Milan from 1744 to 1749 , is one of the disciplines foundational texts . It is based on the new empirical methodology that looked to archival documentation , works of art , and cultural artifacts for " truth . " The Italian Annals is still an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous publications on spiritual and ecclesiastical topics had a greater impact on enlightened Catholic thinking . <p> Muratoris Concerning Christian Charity , so much admired by Crespi , argued that lay institutions , which in Protestant countries did the work of caring for the poor and sick , were not effective in Catholic countries . Instead , the traditional Catholic system of almsgiving , confraternities , hospitals run by monks and nuns , and other pious establishments should be renewed and expanded . To Muratori , the secular workhouse could only stockpile the poor , whereas combining spiritual direction with physical sustenance would produce better citizens and better Christians . A sustained renewal of charitable initiatives , moreover , would energize Catholic elites , promoting class harmony . A year before his death Muratori published Della pubblica felicita oggetto de buoni principi ( Concerning public happiness as the object of good princes ) , the centurys most fully developed argument for enlightened social paternalism based on the principle of public charity directed by the elite under ecclesiastical leadership . Muratoris arguments assumed a vital role for both church and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be separate , a central tenet of much enlightenment thinking , would never have occurred to him . <p> Although many of Muratoris publications were controversial and provoked negative reactions among the ecclesiastical hierarchys more conservative and traditional circles , their profound impact is undeniable . This is especially true of his most intellectually developed spiritual work : " Da Della regolata divozione de cristiani " ( Concerning a well-regulated Christian devotion ) , published in 1747 . Many have characterized this fairly short book as the most influential text of Catholic enlightenment . Its effect on contemporary thinking about religious observance , popular devotions , cults , the responsibilities of the bishops , and the proper role of parish priests can not be overstated . Among Muratoris numerous complaints about popular piety was the foregrounding of devotions to the saints ( especially local ones ) and the Virgin Mary at the expense of God the Father , Christ , and the Holy Spirit . Such practices were in his view remnants of ancient pagan superstitions . Ringing church bells to ward off storms and other natural disasters is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Devotion to the saints should focus on the imitation of their virtues and not on their divine " powers . " He endorsed Marys special role as an intercessor but bluntly pointed out that she is not Christ . Grace is given only by the Holy Trinity and may be achieved with or without the Virgins help . The Muratorian ne plus ultra of Christian devotion may be summarized thus : " Jesus Christ , therefore , is the true and real hope of Christians . " <p> In 1740 Pope Benedict XIV published a book on the Sacrifice of the Mass , the central sacrament of the Roman Catholic Church in which communion bread becomes the living body of Christ . It conforms closely to Muratorian ideas . Formal restraint , adherence to the proper performance of the various rites and ceremonies , and , above all , standardization were essential . The utmost decorum was to be maintained at all times . This special emphasis on the visible aspects of Church ceremonies was especially important for the arts because liturgical vestments , instruments , altar decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedicts treatise was published in Latin , because priests and other clerics were the intended audience . It was part of a broader enlightened Catholic discourse on the history of the liturgy that ecclesiologistsOratorian , Theatine , and Mauristwere investigating . To underscore the vital importance of the Mass to progressive Catholics , the Lambertini pontiff established an academy devoted to the liturgy in its historical context in the early months of his pontificate . <p> Included in the enlightened Catholic project of reform and spiritual renewal was the investigation of Church history , using the most advanced methodologies to purge the institution of unsubstantiated traditions , bogus hagiographies , and devotional abuses . Reform Catholicism sought to make faith " reasonable " and more socially responsible . Self-criticism carried out in a scholarly manner was essential to the process . Debunking pious legends and false martyrs , among other desiderata , had to be pursued rigorously . The Roman abate ( a cleric in minor orders supported by an ecclesiastical stipend , in French abbT ) and diarist , Francesco Valesio , reported on one of the more egregious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1732 . He criticized the Discalced Carmelites of Santa Maria della Vittoria for joining their shod brethren for the first time to honor the prophet Elijah , traditionally believed to have established the Carmelite Order . Valesio condemned what he called a " nonsensical exercise " in support of " this fable . " Although Benedict XIV was also deeply skeptical , the traditional belief was allowed to stand . Indeed , the Carmelites employed the sculptor Agostino Cornacchini ( 16861754 ) to make a colossal statue of Elijah for their niche in Saint Peters as one of the series of " portraits " of the founders of the religious orders begun by Clement XI in 1702 ( fig. 1 ) .

All of which we have abundantly achieved in this country . " In the midst of social , political , and military crises , thousands of middling and poor people in southern Germany had packed up and decided to leave . Most of them opted for eastern Europe , but by the time of the American Revolution some one hundred thousand men , women , and children from Baden and Wnrttemberg had emigrated to Pennsylvania , their " new Canaan . " To Badenians and Swabians Pennsylvania was known as the land of unlimited freedom of conscience , the land of liberty , rights , and the possibility of acquiring property by sheer dedication , work , and disciplinevirtues southern Germans seemed to possess in abundance . Faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being discriminated against as the dregs of society , tired of war miseries , and tired of shabby treatment by their local landlords and squires . To them , Pennsylvania seemed the land of hope and glory , the perfect refuge where they would be able to achieve a peaceful life on earth and eternal bliss in heaven . <p> With the beginning of the War of Austrian Succession in December 1740 , the harmony that had reigned in Pennsylvania collapsednot because Thomas Penn , eldest son of William Penn , had become the monster some of his political opponents thought , but simply because macro-political conditions in Europe and in the Atlantic world had changed . As shadows began to darken the bright new American world , Conrad Weisers broadsides appealed to the rapidly growing number of German immigrants to vote for candidates who , under the mounting danger of war , favored defensive measures . They mark the beginning of one of the most turbulent phases in the history of Pennsylvania . <p> Germans had fled war and misery . Now , according to Weiser , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only problem Germans faced . They could not understand Pennsylvanias large English-speaking majority ; they had to accept indentures for up to five years with a farmer , albeit often a German one ; in the first two years increased mortality threatened their lives ; and they had to cope generally with cultural , political , and social dislocation . These difficult experiences , together with their European memories , became deeply engrained in their minds . <p> The English , Welsh , and Irish in Pennsylvania experienced this influx of foreigners differently . For them in 1739 Pennsylvania was still a peaceful haven , stable and quiet except for the little catastrophes here and there . Two years later that peace was gone . Political controversy reigned as the colony became politically deeply divided between the dominant Quaker Party and the small but influential Proprietary Party , which drew its strength from its closeness to the proprietors of the colony . In this context the German settlers voted the way most English settlers did : for the Quaker Party . As long as the number of naturalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rapidly growing influx of Germans from the 1730s onwards , however , increasingly irritated the English , who perceived these newcomers as a danger to English culture and politics . <p> The process for acquiring full citizen status and thus the right to vote was eased in 1741 by the arrival of the new general naturalization act of the British Parliament and in February 1743 by the passage of laws in Pennsylvania that allowed German Mennonites and other peace churches to substitute affirmations for the required oaths of allegiance . Along with the substantial immigration not only from Germany but from Scotland and Ireland , this meant that Pennsylvania was gradually becoming a multiethnic society . This picture was complicated even more by a continuous substantial immigration from Ireland and Scotland . As future developments would show , the English considered both a problem . As it turned out , Germans would come to adopt English prejudices toward the Irish . Another consequence was that pacifism , which had been seen as a distinctive mark of Quakerism , came to be associated with a number of German peace churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of this development would continue to surface in Pennsylvania politics until the early nineteenth century . <p> Most German immigrants , like most of Pennsylvanias population in general , became farmers . The greater part of them finally settled in the colonys southeastern counties , Berks , Lancaster , and Northampton , which became German strongholds after the middle of the eighteenth century . This is the region with which this book is primarily concerned .

Jacob Eichholtz ( 17761842 ) began his career in the metal trades but with much practice , some encouragement from his friend Thomas Sully , and a few weeks instruction from Americas preeminent portraitist , Gilbert Stuart , he transformed himself into one of the nations most productive portrait painters . Eichholtz worked primarily in the Middle Atlantic region from his homes in Lancaster and Philadelphia . While Stuart and Sully concentrated on the elite of American society , Eichholtz captured the images of a rising middle class with its craftsmen , merchants , doctors , lawyers , and their families . From a lifetime that spanned the American Revolution to the Industrial Revolution , and a career that produced more than 800 paintings , Eichholtz offers a collective portrait of early American culture in the first half of the nineteenth century . <p> The Worlds of Jacob Eichholtz begins with four insightful essays by Thomas Ryan , David Jaffee , Carol Faill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They arise in specific places at particular moments in time , and they either flourish or fade depending on the extent to which they are perceived as intellectually viable , useful , fashionable , and/or compatible with the needs and aspirations of influential social groups . Like styles of music , trends in fashion , and political theories , disciplines can be exported . They can cross boundaries , spreading from their culture of origin to other countries and continents . Sometimes disciplines change substantially when placed in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the basic vocabulary employed by practitioners , can all evolve in response to local conditions . Often , however , disciplines may seem , at least superficially , to pass unaltered from one culture to the next . <p> Strong nations and empires , unsurprisingly , export academic disciplines more successfully than weaker states . In recent decades environmental engineering , gender studies , and ethnic studies , emerging disciplines that enjoy significant popularity in Western Europe and the United States , have all begun to gain ground in other areas of the globe . Leading universities in countries as far-flung as Argentina , Uganda , Slovenia , and Yemen regularly issue promotional material filled with references to new academic units , programs , and courses that , to a contemporary American educator , may well sound familiar . The similarities are at times so striking that one might reasonably presume that , thanks to modern tools of communication and Western economic and cultural dominance , a single homogeneous system for the organization and classification of approaches to learning has taken hold throughout the world and that regional trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great democracies of the West are of little real significance . <p> However , despite the unquestionable influence of Western universities , scientific societies , and grant-giving agencies , substantial diversity continues to exist in the organization of learning and scholarship . Disciplines that are largely or entirely unknown in the United States flourish in other areas of the globe . They can easily escape the notice of American academics , because they do not fit into our system of disciplinary classification : no words exist for them in the English language ; they overlap with and yet do not entirely coincide with accepted Western fields of specialization ; to us they seem sometimes like one thing and sometimes like another , but never distinct and important in and of themselves . As a result , American specialists tend to translate foreign disciplinary terms either reductively or situationally . In the first case , they render the name of a foreign discipline in English literally and then , noting that it sounds roughly equivalent to one of its well-known Western counterparts , assume , without regard to coverage or methodology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second case , they ignore the existence of the unfamiliar category entirely and reclassify individual works of scholarship in the foreign discipline according to Western norms : they might label some pieces as history , identify others as political science , and list a third group under cultural anthropology . The set as such disappears , leaving in its place only disparate items . Both reductive and situational translations of foreign disciplinary terms tend to reinforce our cultural blindness ; false equations and hastily conceived comparisons reduce our already limited ability to perceive unfamiliar categories and structures . <p> Should our disregard for foreign disciplines concern us ? Are categories and labels at all important or is it just individual works of scholarship that matter ? In this age of interdisciplinary studies , it would be foolish to regard the lines that divide fields of specialization as inherently fixed or impermeable , but does that mean that disciplines as such are wholly irrelevant ? I would argue no : the ways in which human beings organize scholarship , the categories and approaches developed in various parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can learn a great deal about ourselves and our neighbors , about what is constant and immutable in the universal quest for knowledge , and about what varies according to the culture and the age . <p> This book focuses on a disciplinary tradition that will be unfamiliar to most Americans and to many Western Europeans : the system of inquiry that in Russian is called kraevedenie . Best translated into English as regional or , perhaps , local studies ( krai , region or local administrative district , and vedenie , study or knowledge of ) , this field took shape in central Russia in the early twentieth century , combining elements drawn from a variety of domestic and foreign antecedents . As it developed , kraevedenie grew and changed in response to local historical conditions , acquiring , over time , functions , a theoretical base , and social significance render it distinct from all obvious precursors . Popular from the beginning , kraevedenie rapidly spread throughout Soviet territory and , in the decades following World War II , even played a certain role in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism , kraevedenie appears to have ceased expanding geographically , but it remains a vibrant and important force throughout the former Soviet Union . In Russia , in particular , it has flourished in recent years , in no way overshadowed or diminished by recently imported Western disciplines and modes of thinking . Since the early 1990s , Russia has seenin addition to the creation of new departments , centers , and schools of gender studies , public relations , and marketinga significant increase in the number of academic units and institutions devoted to kraevedenie . <p> What exactly is kraevedenie ? Contemporary Russian lexicographers generally define the term as " the study of the natural environment , population , economy , history , or culture of some part of a country , such as an administrative or natural region , or a place of settlement . " As such a definition implies , kraevedenie represents a synthetic field that draws upon the methodological and theoretical legacies of various scholarly traditions . In it , approaches , terminology , and tools typical of fields as diverse as anthropology , sociology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science are brought together to produce a new holistic science of place . Kraevedy ( practitioners of kraevedenie ) investigate and describe both natural and man-made landscapes , study the ways in which human society and the environment affect each other , and decipher the semiotics of space . They deconstruct local myths , analyze the conventions governing the depiction of specific regions and towns in works of art and literature , and dissect both outsider and insider perceptions of local population groups . The notion that people are shaped and defined by the environment in which they live is fundamental to modern kraevedenie . Kraevedy believe that geographic factors play an active role both in human history at large and in the lives of individual men and women . They maintain that long-term residence in a specific town or regionexposure to a particular aesthetic and social environment , to a certain set of symbols , myths , stereotypes , and historical conceptionscan influence our options , choices , points-of-view , and to some extent even our character . For this reason , kraevedy tend to see the exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . <p> In terms of the range of issues it explores , one might perhaps reasonably compare kraevedenie to modern human geography . Structurally , however , the two disciplines differ in a number of significant respects . Most important , while geographers investigate both large and small units of territory and explore places both close to and distant from their own personal experiences , kraevedy almost invariably study discrete localities ( cities , parishes , administrative regions ) in which they have at one time lived or that are in some other way associated with family history , such as a long-lost patrimony or the site of a parents death . It is highly unusual for kraevedy to write about places to which they have no clear personal connection . As lexicographers struggling to define kraevedenie sometimes acknowledge , " for the most part " this form of research represents the work of individuals who could under some rubric be classified as " local inhabitants . " <p> In this respect , kraevedenie closely resembles German Heimatkunde ( literally : homeland studies ) , a tradition of loc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes a particularly obvious debt of inspiration and from which it might in a limited sense even be said to have derived . As I will explain in more detail later in this manuscript , the word kraevedenie entered the Russian language at the beginning of the twentieth century as one of three possible translations of Heimatkunde . Significantly less popular than the competing calques rodinovedenie ( motherland studies ) and stranovedenie ( country studies ) , kraevedenie appeared in Russian publications only sporadically until the 1920s , at which time it became associated with an emerging network of provincial scientific societies that was loosely affiliated with the Academy of Sciences . Over the course of the next several decades , definitions of kraevedenie gradually expanded to include other institutions and the forms of regional scholarship that they practiced . In the process , the resemblance of this mode of inquiry to Heimatkunde significantly decreased . Compared to its German predecessor , kraevedenie became less exclusively provincial in character , and it gained new academic pretensions and ambitions . However , most researchers continued , even as Russian local studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they lived or to which they felt a personal connection . They explored landscapes that they believed had shaped their own characters and , thereby , in investigating space also worked to define the self . <p> Like Heimatkunde and , for that matter , gender studies , gay and lesbian studies , and various forms of ethnic studies in the United States , kraevedenie might reasonably be described as an " identity discipline . " By this I mean a field dominated by scholars who strongly identify with the subject of their scholarship , perceiving it as " self " rather than " other . " In such areas of specialization , the distinction between researcher and researched remains blurred at best . Historically and culturally contingent notions of identity often function as key determinants of disciplinary boundaries , and investigators frequently view their academic activities as part of a larger quest for certain political and social rights , the rectification of past injustices , self-fulfillment , self-awareness , and protection from oppression . As a result , scholarship can easily merge with activism . <p> Scholars interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not constitute real disciplines at all . They note that such areas of specialization are marred by too much subjectivism and lack real cohesion . What , critics sometimes charge , do all the practitioners of womens studies have in common except that they work on projects that in some way involve women or notions of femaleness ? They do not necessarily share the same training or even hold the same degrees ; they may have vastly different interests and methodological biases . Perhaps all this to some extent represents a valid point , but it seems worth noting that the same kinds of criticism can also be leveled at a host of more traditional fields of specialization . If intellectual coherence represents the primary measure of disciplinarity , then how many areas meet the standard ? Does English ? Would economics , history , anthropology , medicine , or physics ? In publications from the last twenty years , scholars who view " unity " as the primary benchmark of disciplinary status have labeled ( or have come close to labeling ) each of these fields as nondisciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize external features rather than internal consistency as the key measure of disciplinarity tend to be more inclusive and often can accommodate contemporary identity disciplines . Fields like Womens Studies , African American Studies , and Gay and Lesbian Studies generally exhibit most of the functional characteristics associated with disciplinary status . An elaborate academic infrastructure exists to support them : they have their own departments , professional societies , conferences , journals , grants , endowed chairs , and textbooks . They also are at least to some extent associated with specific theories , methods , techniques , and discursive strategies . Scholars working in them employ a specialized vocabulary and propagate themselves by training , examining , and accrediting successors . They review each others articles and monographs ; submit and judge applications for funding ; and build upon the work of their predecessors . Although it would be ludicrous to argue that identity disciplines possess the degree of formalization characteristic of established fields like biology , denying them disciplinary status outright seems to ignore a significant trend : many of these areas of specialization are rapidly professionalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In this book , I intend to treat Russian kraevedenie as an identity discipline , a field of specialization that combines a certain amount of external structure with substantial internal diversity ; in which scholars tend to identify strongly with the subject they study ; and where the pursuit of knowledge can easily merge with political and social activism . Just as womens studies throughout the globe in many respects remains bound to the feminist movement and racial and ethnic studies tied to the struggle for tolerance and equality , kraevedenie in Russia has always been strongly associated with the historical and ecological preservation movements , various forms of local boosterism , and , to a real extent , anticentrist sentiment . Scholars who work in institutes and centers of local studies , teach courses in kraevedenie , and author important textbooks in the field also often belong to nongovernmental organizations that agitate for the enforcement of restrictions on development , press for stricter pollution controls , and fight to gain or retain funding for regional museums and parks . They mix comfortably and sense themselves to have common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be fair to say that most kraevedy perceive themselves as part of a vibrant regional community whose unique character and voice both merits and requires protection . Interested in encouraging the growth of interest in local studies among the population at large and inclined to value many forms of speech on regional affairs , they will often include amateurs with little formal scholarly training or experience in their conferences and publishing projects : instructors who introduce material related to local studies into their elementary schools courses , high school students who have written exceptionally fine papers on regional history , artists whose work depicts local monuments and landscapes , as well as various sorts of enthusiasts and collectors . <p> A willingness to allow certain nonacademic community members to participate in scholarly forums on a limited basis represents a typical feature of identity disciplines . How can fields in which research and the quest for self-knowledge are regularly equated rigidly exclude beginners and enthusiasts ? Practitioners often feel impelled to encourage nonacademics starting off on what they view as the path toward self-realization and fulfillment . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason : they view it as an important primary source , an example of the way in which the self they study is popularly understood and experienced . Because of their relative inclusiveness , identity disciplines often continue to resemble popular movements even after they have substantially professionalized . They remain inextricably tied to the social and political crusades from which they evolved . <p> What explains the popularity of kraevedenie in Russia today ? What factors have contributed to the growth of interest in this essentially native-born identity discipline over the course of the last fifteen years ? Social and political turmoil , the collapse of the Soviet Union , and the emergence of a host of new nation-states and regional entities have no doubt played a role . As borders throughout Eastern Europe have shifted , old ways of imagining and understanding the self geographically have necessarily lost much of their relevance . Suddenly no longer part of a larger Soviet population group , Russians have had to redefine themselves as a people in a number of essential ways : they have needed to revise their national historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between themselves and their neighbors ; lay claim to new symbols ; and reassess their countrys role on the international stage . What , they ask themselves , does it mean to be Russian ? Where does Russianness begin and end ? As a discipline that deals with both identity and geographic space , kraevedenie represents an ideal forum for the contemplation of such questions . It offers Russians today the chance to forge regional identities that are at least potentially unmarred by the nationalist ( and internationalist ) excesses of the Soviet period . Will all the local identities fashioned through kraevedenie ultimately contribute to the growth of a new national sense of belonging that tolerates and even embraces regional differences as important reflections of Russianness ? Will kraevedenie help to draw post-Soviet Russia together much as , according to Alon Confino , heimat ideas and symbols did in Germany following the unification of 1871 ? Perhaps , but it is just as easy to read contemporary Russian regionalism in general and kraevedenie specifically as profoundly anticentrist in orientation , more conducive to continued division than to the reemergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shifting borders and the need to forge new post-Soviet collective identities go far to explaining the growth of interest in local studies in Russia today . Another less obvious historical factor has also almost certainly contributed to the current boom , however . Modern Russian kraevedenie emerged out of the confluence of several small intellectual and cultural movements , all of which were viciously purged in the late 1920s and the early 1930s . Leading researchers ended up in prisons and camps , institutes and associations closed , and journals folded . These events proved central to the self-conception of later generations of kraevedy . After Stalins death in 1953 , restrictions on free speech and fear of persecution eased enough to allow kraevedy to rediscover their heritage . Young researchers combed through both public and private libraries and archives in search of forgotten sources ; they read the books and manuscripts written by their early-twentieth-century predecessors and met with purge survivors . Inspired by what they learned , many ultimately came to understand the history and purpose of kraevedenie in allegorical terms . They eulogized the time just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; mourned the fallen as " martyrs , " savagely slaughtered by a centralized Soviet state that in terms of its rapaciousness was wholly comparable to Rome ; and identified themselves as " survivors , " destined to bear a special form of enlightenment forward into the world . In the decades that followed Stalins death , kraevedy worked hard to disseminate knowledge and expand the practice of kraevedenie , but , even when most successful , tended to perceive themselves as somehow " marginal , " operating outside or even against leading social trends , and , for this reason , as possible targets for official persecution . In a sense , Russias kraevedy ultimately embraced one of the central charges leveled against them in purge-era diatribes : in the post-Stalin era many practitioners came to regard kraevedenie as fundamentally anti-establishment . <p> Kraevedenies history as a martyred discipline and its countercultural self-conception in the post-Stalin years paved the way for its rapid expansion after the collapse of the Soviet Union . In the early 1990s , as other fields struggled to shake off the legacy of seventy years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had relatively little institutional baggage and could respond rapidly to political and social changes . Veteran investigators had often led such marginal existences during the Soviet period that they could not easily be accused of complicity in abuses of power . Strongly associated with various forms of regional activism and relatively inclusive by its very nature , kraevedenie seemed more democratic than many older and more established fields . When conflict between Russias national government and local interests intensified and emerged as a key political issue in the mid-1990s , kraevedenie resumed its traditional function as a forum for the expression of regionalist ideas . Even as it expanded and put down new institutional roots , it remained a viable avenue for airing minority views on important issues and hence at least potentially an organizing point for new political parties and groups . <p> I discuss the role of kraevedenie in post-Soviet Russia in somewhat more detail in the conclusion to this book . Earlier sections of this monograph focus on an issue that I see as more primary : the question of kraevedenies origin . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian local studies without tracing the history of the discipline . One must , to put the problem in more Foucaultian terms , first show how this particular discursive formation emerged out of a web of relations between centralized state government and various regional interests ; the public and the private spheres ; art and literary criticism , the educational profession , the scientific community , and central planning authorities ; and advocates of old and new aesthetic standards and value systems . <p> The account of the origin of modern kraevedenie that I provide here will center almost exclusively on a single Russian city : St. Petersburg . In this sense my work resembles the studies of the German heimat idea in the Palatinate by Celia Applegate and in Wnrttemberg by Alon Confino : I look at the way in which a phenomenon that existed throughout an entire country manifested itself in a single locality . It is worth noting , however , that by choosing Russias old imperial capital , I have opted to describe a regional school of kraevedenie that is influential as opposed to typical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Russian city or region can claim the same kind of developed cult of place as St. Petersburg . Founded by Tsar Peter the Great in 1703 as part of an ambitious modernization and Westernization campaign , St. Petersburg from the very first represented symbolic space . It was Russias window on Europe ; the location of the countrys largest port , most lavish palaces , and greatest cultural institutions . It was the self-consciously Western-looking capital of a half-Asiatic empire . During much of the last three centuries Russian writers and social commentators have used descriptions of St. Petersburg as a means of articulating views on their countrys history and destiny . The city obsessed both the Slavophile and the Westernizer camps in the 1840s , most of the great polemicists of the 1860s , and many early-twentieth-century intellectuals . Depending on ones point of view , Petersburg could represent a symbol of much-needed and entirely natural progress or an " artificial " city erected in defiance of Russias intrinsic character , the capital of a fallen empire or the cradle of the revolution . Speech about St. Petersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were Russianness and Europeanness at all compatible ? Should Russia strive to emulate the West ? Was it behind England , Germany , and France ? If so , how could it catch up ? Did Russia have some special contribution to make to the world ? What constituted the essential characteristics of the Russian people ? Were these traits at all in evidence in St. Petersburg ? <p> St. Petersburgs history and symbolic importance in Russian culture made it a natural site for the emergence of a strong school of local studies . In the early twentieth century , a whole series of popular associations and cultural institutions arose that sought to study Russias northern capital and/or preserve the citys most valuable historical and architectural monuments . Profoundly innovative in many respects , they developed new techniques for the investigation and description of local landscapes ; came up with concepts , programs for organizing research activity , and academic standards ; coined terminology ; and established far-reaching scholarly objectives . Kraevedy from all over Russia today acknowledge these structures as essential wellsprings from which the discipline they practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early-twentieth-century institutions and the vibrancy of local studies initiatives within St. Petersburg today , the city is widely regarded by contemporary Russian kraevedy as the " theoretical center " of modern kraevedenie . It boasts a huge number of self-professed kraevedy and produces more publications classifiable as works of kraevedenie than any other city or town in Russia . Trends that develop within its regional studies community continue , even now , to spread rapidly to scholarly collectives in other areas . <p> Nonetheless , my decision to write about kraevedenie in the context of St. Petersburg might , at least from a certain point of view , appear surprising . Although accepted as a truism by most contemporary kraevedy , the designation of St. Petersburg as the " theoretical center " of modern kraevedenie sometimes sounds paradoxical to both Russians outside the discipline and foreign observers with some knowledge of Slavic languages . The etymology of the term kraevedenie doubtless plays a role in fueling such reactions . In Russian , the word krai has a number of different meanings . It can refer to a local region or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it also calls to mind a host of other , more primary associations . It most frequently signifies the edge or furthest limit of some object or substance ( krai stola , krai odezhdy ; the edge of a table , the hem on a piece of clothing ) and hence , when used in reference to units of territory , tends to suggest location on the periphery ; distance from the center ( krai sela , krai sveta ; the outskirts of the village , the worlds end ) . Given this pattern , the term kraevedenie , if broken down into its constituent elements , might reasonably be understood to mean the study of the hinterlands , of those areas that lie farthest from the capital . It smacks of provincialism and , as a result , when used in reference to research projects centered in and on the seat of the old imperial government sounds incongruous to many speakers of Russian . Although geographically St. Petersburg does lie on the edge of Russian territory and in the spring of 1918 the city ceased to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of many Russians , of supreme cultural importance and hence far from provincial in character . <p> In this book I intend to explore those aspects of the history of kraevedenie that helped , despite the apparent etymological incongruity , facilitate the emergence of St. Petersburg as the disciplines " theoretical center and principal place of origin . I will look in detail at three cultural movements that were , to one extent or another , based in St. Petersburg and that contributed to the formation of modern kraevedenie . Chapters 2 and 3 will discuss the historical preservation movement that emerged at the very beginning of the twentieth century and that was , at least initially , loosely associated with the World of Art circle ( Mir iskusstva ) . In Chapters 4 and 5 , I will focus on the pedagogical excursion movement , emphasizing the work of the St. Petersburg excursion theorist Ivan Grevs and his disciple Nikolai Antsiferov . Chapter 6 will look at the network of local studies organizations that was affiliated with the Central Bureau of Kraevedenie ( Tsentralnoe biuro kraevedeniia TsBK ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 7 , I will attempt to show how the meaning of the term kraevedenie shifted and expanded over time by examining a single subfield : literary kraevedenie . In the case of each of the three movements I discuss in this book , I will provide fairly substantive accounts of the history of specific cultural institutions and will comment on the lives and work of individual scholars . This information represents an important part of the prehistory and mythology of modern kraevedenie and is essential to any understanding of the disciplines current self-conception . As I have already implied , contemporary Russian kraevedy tend to define themselves through comparison to early-twentieth-century people and institutions : as the followers of Benois , Grevs , and Antsiferov ; the heirs to the traditions of the Society for the Study and Preservation of Old Petersburg , the Petrograd Excursion Institute , and the Central Bureau of Kraevedenie . Tremendously self-reflective as a discipline , kraevedenie today devotes significant energy to discussions of its emergence and evolution . Virtually every collection of scholarly essays on kraevedenie contains a substantial section on the careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences , papers on similar topics abound . St. Petersburg preservationists , excursionists , and scholars associated with the Central Bureau of Kraevedenie invariably figure prominently in accounts of kraevedenies past . <p> Aside from an interest in the scholarly investigation of discrete geographic areas and the experience of persecution , what did early-twentieth-century preservationism , the pedagogical excursion movement , and the kind of organized local studies research promoted by the Academy of Sciences in the 1920s share ? What ultimately allowed them to be perceived , at least in hindsight , as part of a single disciplinary tradition , as cornerstones of modern kraevedenie ? Each movement had its own concerns and biases , a unique approach to the study of geographic space , and a distinct identity . Early-twentieth-century preservationists and excursionists did not , as a rule , think of themselves as kraevedy : until the 1930s , many Russians understood the term kraevedenie quite narrowly , as referring exclusively to the kind of local research promoted by the Central Bureau of Kraevedenie . I argue that one of the primary linkages that helped to bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subsumed within a single disciplinary category , was literary . Preservationists , excursionists , and researchers associated with the Central Bureaus kraevedenie organizations all shared an interest in a class of descriptive texts known commonly as putevoditeli ( roughly , guidebooks or written guides ) . Scholars associated with these movements read these texts , drew factual information from them , collected them , wrote about them , and promoted their dissemination . Emulating the men and women they revere as " forefathers , " modern kraevedy have continued this tradition . They consider old putevoditeli such essential texts that in the last fifteen years they have taken steps to reprint many classic works . Moreover , they work assiduously to promote the continued evolution of this textual form today , composing countless new putevoditeli every year . Although kraevedy , like other scholars , do write traditional book- and article-length studies , much of their most important and characteristic research reaches print in putevoditel form . <p> What exactly is this mode of expression that is so closely associated with kraevedenie today ? Broken down into its constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument ( thing ) that leads or guides one ( voditel ) along a path or route ( put ) " and hence , viewed from an etymological perspective , is , as I have already suggested , equivalent to the English-language terms " guidebook " and " guide , " in the sense of a written document . As used by most contemporary Russian readers , bibliographers , and publishers , however , the word has a somewhat broader meaning than its most obvious English-language translations tend to suggest . When applied to descriptions of geographic areas , it can refer not just to standard surveys of sights and places to stay for tourists or business travelers , but also to other , more sophisticated textual forms : inventory-like catalogs of the wonders contained in a particular Russian palace or city ; multivolume compendiums of historical anecdotes , statistics , and facts about a particular area ; popular surveys of architectural history ; and books that provide routes and sample monologues for group tours . Publications that in their titles contain the terms opisanie ( description , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primer ) , progulka ( stroll ) , and sometimes even ocherk ( sketch ) each one of which could designate a separate genreare often referred to today as putevoditeli , provided they describe a geographic area and its major landmarks or the way of life of its inhabitants . In fact , in the case of at least geographic descriptions and excursion primers , this trend is so pervasive that it would be fair to say that both are generally viewed by Russian readers as subcategories within the larger category of the putevoditel . A geographic description might well be defined as a putevoditel that , in certain respects , resembles an inventory or catalog ; the excursion primer as a putevoditel that provides those planning to lead a tour to a certain site with necessary background information and a sample route . <p> Some of the books that contemporary Russians classify as putevoditeli obviously cater to the needs of tourists , business travelers , or new residents . They provide basic factual information about a particular region , city , or sight and offer helpful tips for visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists of hotels , restaurants , and clubs ; sample itineraries ; and estimated costs . A surprising number of texts , however , seem geared more to the interests of long-term local residents . They assume a high level of familiarity with the area and include little practical information . Moreover , although they may contain basic historical facts ( when buildings were constructed , the names and nationalities of leading architects , the significance of various monuments ) , they are often not organized to allow readers to locate the answers to specific questions quickly . In many works termed putevoditeli today , the notion that the book itself represents an immediately useful portable tool , a kind of verbal compass that can lead the reader through physical space , holds true only on the level of metaphor . Authors , as I will explain in more detail in the next chapter , invariably imply that the landscape they survey merits our attention ; they often take great pains to point out its most beautiful and interesting features ; they may arrange part of their material geographically or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader at successive locations so as to create the illusion that , as we read , we also advance through physical space . The guides they write , however , are frequently too heavy to carry on walks and make unwieldy references . <p> Like certain forms of biography in the West , the putevoditel in Russia today appeals to a broad readership with diverse interests and requirements . Although , as I have already suggested , authors can and do craft texts with particular audiences in mind , a single well-written and researched book can attract various categories of readers : visitors to the area being described ; new arrivals eager to learn about the city or region to which they have just moved ; long-time local residents with an interest in history , geography , or culture ; enthusiastic armchair travelers ; and specialists in kraevedenie . As a result , such books often sell well . Works that describe Russias two modern capitals Moscow and St. Petersburg enjoy particular popularity , no doubt for fairly obvious reasons : each city has a large population , a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally important role in Russian history , provides the setting for many important works of Russian literature , and represents the focus of the desires and aspirations of much of Russias population . As Americans dream of life in New York and Hollywood , Russians fantasize about Moscow and St. Petersburg . Guidebooks about smaller regional centers and provincial areas , although they can sell well enough to justify publication , necessarily attract smaller audiences : with rare exceptions , they appeal primarily to residents ( or former residents ) and visitors . <p> Identity issues play an important role in the putevoditel . In these works writers do not just describe cities , regions , and countries , they also generally strive to characterize their inhabitants . Working from either an insiders or an outsiders perspective , depending on their personal loyalties and target audience , authors consider what it means to be a Petersburger , a Muscovite , a Siberian , or a resident of some other area . They struggle to define the personality traits , behavior patterns , and attitudes that , in general , represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meshes well with both modern kraevedenie and many of its most obvious precursors ; as a genre the guidebook intrinsically seeks to define the self ( and in some cases its counterpart , the other ) geographically . Early-twentieth-century preservationists , excursionists , and researchers associated with the Central Bureau of Kraevedenie were , no doubt , drawn to the putevoditel in part because the natural tendencies of this form mirrored their own proclivities . These geographic descriptions offered the forefathers of modern kraevedenie the opportunity to explore two issues that particularly fascinated them : space and identity . Semipopular in tone , they could be used to communicate with both other specialists and the public at large , something that suited the activist spirit of all three movements . <p> Because the putevoditel played such an important role in the formation of modern kraevedenie , because I see this textual form as a central element that helps to hold the discipline I am writing about together , I will devote considerable space in this volume to discussions of such texts . I will explain why early-twentieth-century preservationists , excursionists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the guidebook as an important form , show how they used old geographic descriptions as sources , and describe the way in which they both innovated and built upon preexisting descriptive traditions in the guides they authored . In order to facilitate this discussion , in Chapter 1 of this text I provide readers with some basic background information about the kinds of geographic descriptions that were written in Russia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , focusing as in the body of my book on material relating to the St. Petersburg area . <p> Before launching into this discussion , I want to point out that , although a comparatively young city , St. Petersburg has what in Russian terms counts as an old guidebook tradition . Topographic descriptions of the city began to appear in print soon after it was founded in 1703 and quickly evolved , acquiring , in the space of a single century , many of the attributes of modern guides . By the beginning of the nineteenth century , St. Petersburg had the most developed descriptive tradition in all of Russia . Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and areas . In other words , in guidebook-writing as well as in local studies in general , St. Petersburg represented an important locus of innovation . Trends that appeared in this region frequently spread , prompting similar developments in other cities several years later . Therefore , although the account I provide here of the emergence and evolution of the putevoditel will focus on St. Petersburg writers and texts , many of the more general observations I make will also be relevant to the larger examination of the guidebooks history as a national literary form .

Far from uncritically pursuing an egoistic stance , the Romantics criticize through their poetic drama the attempt to attain psychic autonomy .

It qualifies decades of critical speculation on " Romantic individualism " and " Romantic consciousness , " and helps return the ideal of imaginative sympathy to the central position held in the critical writings of the Romantics themselves .

Some of Hendersons employees were new hires , but most were experienced , having worked at other G. C. Murphy stores . <p> Stacked just inside the front entrance were plastic laundry baskets and womens raincoatsgiveaways for the first customers through the door . The laundry baskets were an appropriate ( and a little bit ironic ) feature , though few people realized it at the time . Back in the early 1900s , Mr. George C. Murphy himself had featured cheap laundry baskets at the grand-opening sales of his first five-and-tens around Pittsburgh . He had been dead now for a little more than sixty-one years , but somewhere , maybe , George Murphy was chuckling . <p> Inside Store No. 802 , the shelves were stacked high with specials .

The morning was cool but clear , and temperatures were expected to hit the mid-seventies by that afternoon . <p> The only question remaining : Would any customers be there ? The executives of the G. C. Murphy Company had plenty of reasons to worry . The chain , based in the nearby steel mill town of McKeesport , had 520 variety stores ( most people still called them five-and-tens , though few , if any , items were still available for a nickel or a dime ) from Connecticut to Florida , including some large locations in shopping malls and major cities .

Murphys was a tradition-bound company , and one of these traditions was helpful service . It had been a wrenching decision for Murphys to move its salesgirls out from behind their counters , install checkout lines , and allow customers to serve themselves ; executives were convinced the changes would harm the companys image as " The Friendly Store . " <p> Elsewhere in the industry , some old-time full-price retailers also looked on the upstart discount chains with scorn . " Do you know what discounting is ? " one old-time retail executive told a reporter . " Its nothing more than selling inferior merchandise on Sundays . " True , with their barn-like interiors , bare fluorescent light fixtures , and clothing displayed on plain pipe racks , early discount stores had none of the class or elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the showmanship and razzmatazz of big variety stores such as Murphys . But in their hearts , most Murphy executives knew that the chain had to move into discounting . They were being passed up by their old five-and-ten rival , Michigan-based S. S. Kresge Company , whose namesake had been a business partner of Mr. Murphy and a personal friend of former Murphy president Paul Sample . <p> In 1961 , the rundown old Kresge company , whose small , downtown variety stores were lagging behind those of competitors such as Murphy and F. W. Woolworth Company , changed its entire direction by closing many of those locations and opening big , suburban discount stores called Kmarts . Their success was instant and phenomenalKresge , which did $419 million in sales in 1960 , was doing more than three times that volume in 1970 . It had three hundred fewer Kresge dime stores but three hundred big new Kmarts , including seven right on the G. C. Murphy Companys home turf in Pittsburgh . <p> Murphy executives studied the new Kmarts with admiration and a little jealousy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to improve on , and they knew they could learn from Kresges mistakes . Blueprints and proposals for Murphy discount stores were even drawn up in the mid-1960s , but in secret for fear of bringing down Jim Macks wrath . When Mack died , one executive remembers , " The plans came out of the desk drawers the next day . " <p> Still , despite all the preparation , dealing with a high-volume discount operation was uncharted territory for Murphys , remembers Paul Hindes , who started his forty-three-year career with the company in 1942 as a stock boy in a five-and-ten south of Pittsburgh . By 1970 , he was buying infants and childrens wear for the chain . " I 'm not sure we knew how much merchandise we were going to need in that Bethel store , " says Hindes , one of the scores of employees from the Murphy headquarters , or home office , who stayed all night Tuesday to get the building ready . " We were working with types of displays we had never worked with before . " <p> Murphys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fieldthe company had pioneered variety store advertising and was the first five-and-ten chain to run television commercials in the 1940sand it was running flat out to promote the new store . Twelve pages of advertising ran in the citys biggest newspaper , the Pittsburgh Press , on Tuesday afternoon , guaranteeing that about a quarter million people were aware of the new store . <p> The newspaper further obliged by running several stories about the G. C. Murphy Companys new venture . In the process , some unknown editor made a mistake that would be repeated for the next fifteen years by newspapers and customers alike and would grate on Murphy employees every time they heard it . The Pittsburgh Press had referred to the new store as the " Murphy Mart . " It was supposed to be " Murphys Mart , " though , just as everything else about the new store , the name had been the subject of a protracted debate at the home office . <p> Marketing studies indicated that , thanks to Kmarts popularity , the word " mart " now meant " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Murphy discount stores have the name " mart " in them . Other retailers had reached the same conclusions when they launched their own discount chains ; for example , Federated Department Stores called its stores Fed-Marts . Inside Murphys , many people felt their companys name had high recognition , so " Murphy " had to be included , says Luther Shay , who was managing the merchandise investment control department . That ruled out one contender , " M-Mart , " which in retrospect was probably too imitative of " Kmart . " In any event , M-Mart " did n't  get to first base , " Shay says . <p> Hindes remembers that the clothing buyers wanted to capitalize on Murphys popular line of work clothes . " We wanted to call the stores Big Murph , " he says . " We had a drawing of a big lumberjack guy holding a sign that said Big Murph. They did n't  go for it . " Bill Kraus , another home office buyer , suggested " Murphys Merchandise Marts , " evoking the famous Merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M-M-M " or " Three-Ms . " The fear of provoking a lawsuit from the other 3M in Minnesota squelched that proposal . Thus , the Bethel Park store , and all its progeny , would be christened " Murphys Mart , " a compromise name that never pleased some in the company and confused customers for years to come . " We were stuck with it , " Kraus says . <p> Even the location , which was n't an entirely auspicious place to launch a new business venture , was a compromise . The first Murphys Mart was supposed to be a brand-new store north of Pittsburgh in the semi-rural community of Harmar Township , but Murphys sharp-eyed real estate men were able to secure the Bethel Park building , which had been occupied by a failed shopping complex called The Mayfair . Murphys construction division quickly converted the location for the companys needs , and the store was ready to open months before the Murphys Mart in Harmar . <p> Yet it begged the question : If The Mayfair had flopped in that spot , why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable history in more than twenty states . In Pittsburgh , four generations had grown up with the company . But it was known for five-and-ten storesthe kind of places where kids shopped for candy , mom bought lipstick and thread , and dad bought pipe tobacco and fishing lures . Those were low-volume , low-price items , not the higher-priced lines of clothing , appliances , and housewares that were the lifeblood of discount houses . <p> It was n't a given that Murphys even knew how to sell fashion apparel and automotive supplies , much less that the publics warm , nostalgic feelings for the Murphy name would be enough to draw customers away from Kmart , which incidentally had also placed several pages of advertising in Tuesdays Press , possibly to combat the publicity Murphys Mart was receiving . <p> If Murphy employees still had serious doubts Wednesday morning , they evaporated along with the dew . At 10:00 A.M. , Ed and Ken Paxtonbrothers and the companys president and chairman , respectivelyhelped cut the ribbon at the Murphys Mart entrance . By then , the thousand-car parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled to capacity and customers were crowding the doors . For the next four days , employees of the new Murphys Mart sold everything they could get their hands on . <p> The first day , more than $140,000 in merchandise was sold . " Opening day , you could n't get near it , " recalls Fred Speidel , who was an assistant manager . " Every road to the place was blocked off . The volume was so much ! . . . Up to that point , the biggest volume store I had ever been in was doing $200,000 a year . " By Saturday night , the Murphys Mart on Route 88 had done $455,215 in sales , including $10,000 at the restaurant , which translated into quite a number of 44 slices of pie . <p> Perhaps the Murphy name had some magic in it after all . Although theyd previously never run a discount house , there apparently was magic in those Murphys employees , too . After all , theyd been through the companys rigorous in-house training program , which was the envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager at the Bethel Park store , remembers that when the books closed on its first full year of operations , it had done $18 million in sales , " and that was a lot of money a long , long time ago . " <p> The impact on the community became humorously evident to Bishop a few months later . One of the hot items at the Bethel Park Murphys Mart was ladies polyester pantsuits . Murphys Mart was such a hit in the communities south of Pittsburgh , Bishop recalls , that " every corner I went to for the next month , I saw those pantsuits because we sold so many of them . " <p> The Bethel Park store would have problems to overcome , of course , as would the next two Murphys Marts in Harmar and Connellsville . Murphys would have to streamline its procedures , some of which had been in place for more than sixty years . It would have to shake off its dime-store mentality , which stressed high profit margins and low sales volume , to instead go for low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch up with Kmart by opening dozens of Murphys Marts would eventually threaten to sink the company . <p> New management closed the money-losing locations , trimmed some of the bureaucracy , and turned the company into a Wall Street darling in the early 1980s . That , ironically , would sow the seeds for the G. C. Murphy Companys eventual destructionthe surprising success of the humble retail chain in McKeesport , Pennsylvania , attracted the attention of corporate raiders . <p> Nobody knew that in 1970 , of course . Instead , the exciting new Bethel Park store seemed to be the dawn of a great new era for a venerable old company , which was much beloved by customers and employees . The first Murphys Mart " was the turning point for the company , " says Ed Davis , Murphys longtime public relations man , who , as had so many executives , started his career in the stockroom of a small-town five-and-ten . <p> Bill Kraus had been discouraged by the companys conservatism and had watched Kresges runaway success with increasing dismay . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas five-and-ten operator , Sam Walton , who had recently opened his own Kmart-style discount stores called Wal-Marts . In the end , Kraus couldnt tear himself away from Murphys , which he , as did so many employees , viewed as a family . <p> So when the Bethel Park store opened and the sales division started reporting the unprecedented volume of merchandise it was handling , Kraus felt his pride in Murphys swelling . He did n't  think of leaving again . " When it opened , it was dynamic , " Kraus says . " I thought , Man , we have finally hit it. We were on our way . "

Since they were siblings , they ought to share a last name . Yet they did not , by choice . The more famous of the two was Giorgio de Chirico ( 18881978 ) , a painter , sculptor , set designer , and accomplished writer . His younger brother , Andrea de Chirico ( 18911952 ) , first a composer and subsequently a writer and painter , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name : Alberto Savinio . The reasons behind the change are unclear , and we have no convenient explanation from Savinio . That he would leave the question a mystery is , however , not surprising . The most striking thing about the work of both de Chiricos is its enigmatic quality . Both chose to use the word " enigma " in painting titles , as in de Chiricos Enigma of the Oracle and The Enigma of a Day , or in Savinios Enigma of the Sea . Cloaks , veils , curtains , and dark corners appear over and over on the brothers canvasses as signs of the motif of secrecy . This led one critic to observe that de Chirico was " one of the most complex and contradictory artistic figures of our century . " It is not easy to be such a sphinx , but de Chirico was willing to offer some tips that were born , interestingly enough , out of his experience as a sibling . The best example of an enigmatic effect , he tells us , occurs when two brothers stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . One must stop and stare a moment because the two men look alike , yet not exactly . De Chiricos portrait of himself with his brother Alberto offers a concrete example of this kind of resemblance ( fig. 1 ) . Savinios name change only adds to the unsettling effect the brothers may have hoped their kinship might produce in others . ( I myself may be generating an uncanny effect when I refer to " the de Chiricos " in the plural and use " de Chirico " and " Savinio " when referring to them individually . ) <p> Were it not for their shared love of puzzles , to look at these two men together might seem odd . The art of individuals is always unique . There are , notwithstanding this , advantages in considering the brothers together . Most obviously , their shared thematic interests are worth investigating : both siblings painted mythological subjects and wrote about them ; both had a predilection for mannequins , nudes , tools , and toys ; and both obsessively depicted oddly skewed platforms and walls replete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within one framework , however , yields critical insights that move beyond the mere cataloguing of the innovative subject matter the brothers developed in tandem . When they are examined together , an important , neglected fact is thrown into relief . Alberto Savinio made crucial contributions to the artistic and literary movement known as the " Scuola metafisica " ( Metaphysical School ) that are too often ignored , especially outside Italy . The result is that de Chirico seems to have achieved his brilliant innovations single-handedly , while Savinio is rarely mentioned in twentieth-century histories of art . In fact , both brothers contributed to and theorized Metaphysical artistic practice . It is interesting to learn that , at the outset , Savinio had the broader reputation of the two , and it was de Chirico who was known mainly as Savinios brothera situation now reversed . One critic wrote , " we now know how much Metaphysical painting owes to Savinios thought . " To give just one example of Savinios brilliance , it was he who , inspired by Guillaume Apollinaire , first depicted an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poem " Les chants de la mi-mort " ( The Songs of Half-Death ) . The face without features , as though on a tailors dummy , later became de Chiricos hallmark . Looking at the two men together reminds us of the important double genesis of a movement that , according to Jean Clair , was the basis of both Surrealism and magical realism . <p> Another reason for studying the brothers together is that this book focuses primarily on literary works . De Chirico wrote two novels , both notoriously difficult . Neither has received the critical attention it deserves and both could benefit from a comparative interpretative approach that links them to other literary texts , by Savinio and others . Savinio was a prolific , original , and influential writer . It is therefore natural to focus on him when we consider fiction rather than painting . When we apply a literary framework to the Metaphysical School , Savinio in fact stands out as the more influential brother . Attention to the literary productions of the two men can compensate for an imbalance in critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Chiricoand on his paintingwithin the Metaphysical School . <p> The Double Artistic Biography <p> The de Chiricos shared backgrounds led to a remarkable twinning of artistic and literary motifs , interests , and styles . The brothers grew up abroad , where their father , an Italian engineer , was helping to build modern transportation systems for Italys own cultural older brother : Greece . Hellenic figures from Hector to Jason consequently appear throughout the works of both brothers in equal measure . While still young men , the de Chiricos lost their father and soon began a wayfaring life , moving among different artistic capitals in Europenearly always together . Needless to say , they shared a mother , one who followed them in their travels and strongly supported her sons artistic careers . So close were the mens outlooks and so strong their solidarity that they took to calling themselves the Dioscuri , after the sons of Zeus and Leda who joined the expedition of the Argonauts in search of the Golden Fleece . Like them , the de Chiricos were on the move and on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home after his fathers death in 1905 . He studied with Max Reger there during his first career ( of several ) , as a composer and musician . De Chirico soon followed his younger brother to Bavaria and became enamored of German Symbolist art and German philosophyespecially as it engaged Greek thought . Both were great readers of Friedrich Nietzsche . The brothers next moved to Paris , around 1910 . There the first hints of a " metaphysical " style emerged in de Chiricos painting . The epithet " Dioscuri " for Giorgio and Alberto became common in the avant-garde circles in which the brothers moved in France , where Apollinaire , a writer who shared their " international " origins , introduced them to Picasso , Picabia , Brancusi , Jacob , Modigliani , and Cocteau . So close indeed were the ties with Apollinaire that Savinio composed music for his friends drama , Les mamelles de TirTsias . A solo concert in Paris using his own compositions caused an uproar when Savinioin a pre-rock gesturedestroyed a piano on stage , leaving blood on the keys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimentation taking place in those years in France . <p> Savinio soon gave up music altogether ( he found it " irrational " ) , in favor of both a prolific literary effort and an intense , sustained theoretical reflection on aesthetic questions . In tandem , in Paris and then in Ferrara , the brothers articulated the concepts , methods , and practice that would lead to the growth of the Metaphysical School . It was the call to arms for the war that took the brothers from France to Italy . They met up in Ferrara in 1915 with Carlo Carra and the local artist Filippo de Pisis , both considered major contributors to the Metaphysical School . In Ferrara the de Chiricos also began to forge important ties with the Italian writers Giovanni Papini and Ardengo Soffician ex-Futurist . The " Scuola Metafisica " in fact followed after Futurism chronologically and took Futurist stylistic innovationssuch as simultaneous spatial perspectivesinto account . The de Chiricos were also , however , differentiating themselves from some exponents of Futurism . If Marinetti wanted to sink Venice , ancient and decrepit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have engaged in such a " physical " undertaking . The " metaphysical " bent of the de Chiricos led them to continue to draw from the " warehouse of the past " in their artistic experimentation . Both brothers insisted on " citing " the past so that well-known images and themes from the artistic heritage might be reshaped into disquieting poetic enigmas . In this sense , we can speak of an " other modernism " whose gaze did not fix itself in the direction of a spanking new future . <p> The brothers managed to be stationed together in Italy for only a short time . In 1917 Savinio was shipped to Salonika , at the Macedonian front , to be a translator for the Allies . De Chirico stayed on in Ferrara . In Salonika , besides engaging in important correspondence with Tristan Tzara , Savinio produced his first full-length literary work . Written in both French and Italian and renowned for its jarring , " nonsensical , " ironic , playful , and grotesque qualities , Hermaphrodito ( Hermaphrodite , 1918 ) was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " surrealist " texts , the novel turned literary traditions on their head by featuring odd juxtapositions of poetry and prose . At the same time it favored " realistic " modes , such as the historical narrative or the journalistic essay . <p> De Chirico never saw a front or a battle because he remained under " psychiatric care " at the military hospital in Ferrara . He relates in his memoirs how a doctor took one look at his receding chin and classified him as weak-minded . From 1916 through 1918 Giorgio worked to define in his painting and in his theoretical writings just what modern art should be and just what Italian art ought to be . It was in Ferrara , the city he called " highly metaphysical , " that he developed his notion that the Italian cultural tradition was " polymorphic " just when his brother was writing about a " hermaphrodite " in the Balkans . It should be said , though , that while the brothers work often seemed to have been produced in concert , de Chiricos painting in Ferrara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences . Giorgio generally shied away from Savinios black humor , and he never became the effective journalist his brother was . De Chirico clearly preferred seamless , elegant , slippery enigmas to puzzling , rough , comic grotesques in gender-blending shapes . Giorgio strove to capture on canvas a luminous Italy reminiscent of the Quattrocentoan effort his brother did not support . Interestingly , de Chiricos 1929 novel Hebdomeros is the one work most reminiscent of Savinios distinctive penchant for the grotesque . It is as though some outlooks repressed in painting can rise to the surface in prose . <p> After the First World War the brothers wayfaring continued . They moved principally between Paris and Rome . In Italy both were influential in what is called , rather simplistically , the " return to tradition " a tendency associated with the Italian journal Valori plastici ( 191822 ) and some others . It may be true that an intense period of artistic experimentation was behind them and that classical themes began to dominate ( especially in some of de Chiricos better-known paintings ) . We should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalism and traditional realism , which each put into effect in somewhat different ways . This refusal was , in any case , mediated in both brothers by a return to the classics , especially by recourse to a Greek way of conceptualizing nature . The central idea was that the Greeks imbued nature with a " senso archittettonico " ( architectural sense ) and saw " form " everywhere . Modern art should take a cue from antiquity to consider forms as values ; for example , the circle is ideal , the arch harmonious . Forms serve the purpose of edification in both senses of the term . De Chirico wrote in Valori plastici in 1920 : " Nature itself was seen by the classical painter with the eye of an architect and builder . " As Pia Vivarelli put it , for de Chirico " recuperating the past is understood . . . as a vector toward modernity . " <p> The title of the journal the brothers involved themselves with , Valori plastici ( Plastic Values ) , is important in this respect . The brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , how they might renew the cultural tradition in a modern key . It is therefore not surprising that , despite his postwar " return to tradition , " de Chirico took part in the founding of Surrealism in Paris when he returned to work there . We observe him at the center of Man Rays 1925 photograph of artists linked to La RTvolution SurrTaliste , in whose first issue de Chirico published a prose poem . Numerous Surrealist painters ( including Max Ernst , Yves Tanguy , Salvador Dal8 , and RenT Magritte ) acknowledged de Chiricos influence , and Cocteau quipped that the Italian " homme-enigme " was an " honneur de la France " ( an honor to France ) . The writer AndrT Breton provided the most laudatory account of the achievements of both Giorgio and Alberto when he asserted that " Tout le mythe moderne encore en formation sappuie a son origine sur les deux uvres , dans leur esprit presque indiscernable , dAlberto Savinio et de son frFre Giorgio de Chirico " ( All modern myth that is still evolving relies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alberto Savinio and his brother Giorgio de Chirico ) . <p> While keeping in mind Bretons acknowledgment of the inseparability of the brothers , his praise of them , and some affinities between the Surrealist and Metaphysical outlooks , it is also important not to gloss over some differences between the two movements . A dramatic break between Breton and de Chirico took place in 1926 . Debate over the " return to tradition " made for complicated , and sometimes bitter , relations . On the Surrealist side , some considered de Chirico a traitor to artistic revolution because of his penchant for antiquity and the epic tradition . In subsequent years , only work done before 1925 or so was considered by Bretonand by numerous other critics of all stripesto be original and innovative . The de Chiricos had reservations of their own about their counterparts . Both expressed skepticism about the Surrealist theorization of an " automatic " or " unconscious " generation of art , a theme addressed by Savinio much later , in a 1940 article in the journal Prospettive . In a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Surrealists on this score by explaining that he admired Freud principally because he peered into the " depths of the human " and stripped those depths of their " idealist superstructure . " For Savinio , Freud was able to demystify the " inner world . " There were also differences with Surrealists on how art might absorb or digest modern ways of circulating objects and images . Though the brothers worked in mixed media , they never came to feel the same fascination for the " ready-made " object that artists such as Duchamp and Ernst experienced . <p> One result of the parting of the ways between de Chirico and Breton was the emergence of a new and distinct critical terminology for referring to the brothers and distinguishing them from the French movement and even from the Ferrara period . The de Chiricos and a few other Italian nationals , such as Filippo de Pisis , were working in Paris in the later twenties , when Savinio began greatly to intensify his painting activity . The group came to be known in critical circles and in exhibitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Chiricos were not in Paris continually , the appellation stuck . In fact , both artists constantly had one foot in Italy . De Chirico sometimes exhibited his work with the group of painters known as " Novecento " ( Nine Hundred ) , and he and Savinio were also loosely allied with the " Scuola Romana " ( Roman School ) . <p> Precisely because both brothers moved back and forth between Rome and Paris for a good number of years , they came to be seen as altogether stateless ( " apolidi " ) . This term may have emerged as a form of praise at a time when Paris was drawing avant-garde artists and writers from all of Europe . Already in 1927 , however , Carra irritated de Chirico by calling him an insufficiently Italian " greculo " ( little Greek ) . In a more famous incident , also in 1927 , the brothers were called " Jewish " in an article in Il Selvaggio , presumably for having no homeland in their detractors chauvinistic and anti-Semitic view . Savinio was sarcastically dubbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In the thirties statelessness took on meanings of an ever more threatening nature . During the Fascist period , with its cult of the nation , the de Chiricos " international " choices began to cause them problems that were hardly " metaphysical . " At a very practical level , de Chirico suffered discriminatory treatment by the organizers of state-sponsored exhibitions that tended to exalt the nation . Ironically , the artist appealed to Mussolini in 1935 to try to remedy the situation . Within a few years , accusations of a lack of patriotism became very serious . In 1938 one critic , Telesio Interlandi , characterized de Chiricos 1929 painting " Manichini araldici " as " foreign , Bolshevik , and Jewish . " De Chiricos wife , Isabella Far , was Jewish , and he soon feared for her safety and that of other Jewish artists to whom he was close . <p> The ironies of this situation were multiple . Savinio had deployed a discourse about Jewishness in his own attempts ( in a piece entitled " My Jewish Hour " ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nationalistic " one . Jewish cultural cohesion despite the Diaspora had , he judged , given him a model for such an identity . De Chirico also articulated a discourse on Jewishness , declaring in his writings that he had been inspired by Jewish neighborhoods during the years he spent in Ferrara . He executed a number of paintings with explicit references to Jews , including the well-known Jewish Angel . This fascination with another ancient culturelike his love for the Greeks , Etruscans , and Romansworked its way deeply into de Chiricos thinking about style . More than once he attempted to theorize modern arts bent for abstraction in the context of a presumed Judaic disposition to the nonfigurative . In short , the de Chirico brothers generated a series of analogies between Italian and Jewish culture as they attempted to recast tradition for modernity . The project clearly backfired when they were branded as rootless " Jews . " This irony was compounded by the fact that the brothers had lived and traveled abroad so much that Italy was in a sense truly an enigma to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring the topic of Italianicity and laboring to give substance to their passport identities . They were charged , all the same , with an unpatriotic " internationalism . " <p> The de Chiricos unique " rootlessness " extends beyond biography to their concrete aesthetic opinions on painting and writing . In one sense , when they championed the notion they did so out of a desire for all things " unbound , " out of a desire to be cut loose from what they saw as stifling , narrow bourgeois " forms " including such " forms " as the " nation . " That desire for political and artistic freedom dovetailed with a modernist rejection of traditional artistic values in favor of experimentalism . Here the term " modernist " does not designate " those who are pro-modern " in the sense that they favor of an all-out modernization of Europe ; the term does not imply acceptance of a world marked by industrialization , science , and economic prosperity . All of these things might have been seen by modernists as linked precisely to prosaic bourgeois values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about rootlessness veers away from an association with the emancipatory and shades instead into one about " deracination . " As such , it was not employed in favor of intellectual and artistic liberty but instead in the pursuit of a critique of a modern culture that had brought with it the sense of being adrift , of alienation , of a lack of authentic humanness . <p> It was typical of the Metaphysical School to engage modernity in this ambivalent and contradictory way . There was a desire to liberate oneself and to cut all ties . At the same time , we hear laments about being unanchored . It was by no means a banal dilemma . But in the process of grappling with the problem of twentieth-century culture , the de Chiricos labored to imagine and define a countermodernity . They gave us in the bargain a new and unforgettable recasting of the classical heritage . Etruscan , Egyptian , Greek ( especially the pre-Socratics ) , and Roman cultures came forward through time to appear as countercultures to modernity . They become available in part through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . Here again the effort was common to both brothers . Theirs , of course , was not the only way of conceiving national identity . Others had competing views of what an overarching , collective identity might be . The Fascistic exalting of nationhood was one , the Marxist another . Antonio Gramsci argued that Italian identity could be derived througha proletarian class consciousness that could extend to other groups ( intellectuals and peasants ) . But the de Chiricos saw the antidote to both statelessness and its opposite , chauvinistic nationalism , in Italys distinctive cultural traits . <p> The political hot potato of statelessness provides another reason for looking at the de Chiricos work together , for both brothers sought to define identity in ways that set their thinking within a panorama of possibilities emerging in this historical period . To imagine a collectivity out of heterogeneous beings was broadly understood to be a task of modernity itself ; it was hoped that modernization would be the catalyst for the unifying process . It is important to recall that with their prerogatives of modernization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in the nineteenth century to emerge out of the old overarching empiresand on the Italian terrain there had been several of these ( Bourbons , Hapsburgs ) , not to mention a long period of papal dominion . The First World War , during which the Metaphysical School was developing its poetics , was the climax of a disputed process of national unification in which competing interests were promoting differing notions of identity . Shortly after the war , Fascist ideologues of nationalism claimed that a strong state could forge a strong , modern Italian identity . That identity was imagined in different ways by various concerned parties . The debate that most engaged the de Chiricos came in the later 1920s , when numerous articles appeared in the literary press on how to think of Italy as part of Europe after the advent of the Fascist movement . At issue , among other things , was Italys place in a " New Europe " that was supposed to separate itself from what was called , disparagingly , " Eurasia . " <p> Given this historical situation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen to have characterized the brothers output throughout their lives , and well after both settled down in Rome after the Second World War . Because of this , the subject of cultural politics is exceptionally engaging in their work . The controversies related to the rise of modern nationalist ideologies were in fact ever present in the texts of the de Chiricos . Outraged at not being considered Italian enough , de Chirico would gloat in his memoirs that even when he was living in Paris he understood Italy better than any Italian artist working on the native soil . He lamented that Italian avant-garde artists were the ones " Frenchifying " themselves , while he , in Paris , was " constructing in my paintings a forceful Italianicity unrivaled by our homegrown artists ( not just painters ) to this day . " <p> The idea of " Italianicity " that might differ from the " homegrown " variety also engaged Savinio as he tried to define an identity based not on birthright or residence but on a shared sense of the cultural past and a singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorship of a journal , Colonna , that set out in that direction . At issue in Colonna was the politics of framing the past , not only of Italy and but of other nations or constellations of nations . In the first issue Savinio wrote an editorial on the " destiny " of Italy . The complicated piece juxtaposes Mediterranean and northern cultures and claims that the latter had displaced Roman culture a thousand years earlier , at the end of the first millennium . By the end of the second millennium northern culture was degeneratingmuch to his relief : " Il capitale della cultura settentrionale ora non fruttifica pi : essa spende il capitale " ( The " capital " of Northern culture no longer fructifies : it is spending its capital ) . After a long dominion , Mediterranean Italy had in store a new political destiny and new culture that were not northern but were , as yet , inchoate : " ancora non ha nome " ( it still has no name ) . The piece rather pointedly does not supply the word " Fascist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace some of the nuances in what appears to be a generalized nationalistic fervor in Savinios essay . <p> Colonna did publish decidedly antidemocratic tracts , and one frequently finds racialist formulations in its pages . Savinio himself assumed racialist attitudes when , for example , he expressed his fear of a " pericolo giallo " ( yellow peril ) , an " Oriental " culture that might be powerful enough to replace the declining North . In Fascist Italy in the thirties , the question of how the countrys political destiny would intersect with some framing of its past was not inconsequential . The stakes were enormously high . The Nazis came to power in Germany in the same year that Savinio began to conceptualize his role in cultural politics through his editorship of Colonna . Savinio was certainly no supporter of the Nazis . Hitler had the obvious problem , in Savinios view , that he was a northerner . Savinio did not , additionally , believe in the possibility of the straightforward revival of any cultures past , and thus he could not concur with Mussolinis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing the power of the past to shape the future , Savinio also did not revere it as an unproblematic heritage . In fact , a supposed lack of reverence toward the national literary tradition led Fascist censors in 1939 to close down a journal for which Savinio wrote regularly ; in Omnibus he had asserted that the great Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi died from an overdose of ice cream . During the Second World War the stakes rose even higher , and Savinio had to adopt a pseudonym and eventually go into hiding when he was threatened with confinement . <p> Enigmatic Italy <p> To forge their theories of national being ( " Italianita " ) , the de Chiricos certainly drew on their familiarity with tradition , which they considered the supreme nourishment for their work . Italy was understood to be unique because of its abundance of old traditions ; it was to them the most " multiplicitous " and heterogeneous of places , possessed of rich layers of culture : Greek , Roman , Christian , and modern . Italianate seaports and shores ( evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roman , and Piedmontese plazas and villas , Renaissance arcades , municipal towers , and mythic cities all crowd their painterly extravaganzas , along with icons of ages past in the form of ruins , sculptures , and friezes . De Chiricos paintings and literary works alike have been called " an instantaneous vision of a long stratification . " De Chirico told of how , gazing at Piazza Santa Croce in Florence , he first understood how the physical Italian landscape absorbs memories and the traces of past outlooks on the world , from pagan times to the present . Italy and an enigmatic " other world " are joined in the Sante Croce narrative . An " impossible " bringing together of disparate temporal elements occurs as a matter of course in the Italian piazza and the Metaphysical text alike . Marcel Duchamp gave an astute explanation of the term " Metaphysical " when he wrote that de Chirico " organized on his canvas an encounter of things that could only be joined in a metaphysical world. " <p> The idea that the nation can be conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions concerning the nature of modern nationalism . The same applies to the uniquely mixed characters that populated Metaphysical texts , both verbal and visual . The Metaphysical School engaged the motif of a hybrid homo sapiens with an intensity equaled perhaps only by Ernst . Spectacular hybrids abound in the de Chiricos in the form of mannequins , dummies , statue-people , ephebes , hermaphrodites , humanoid furniture and architecture , bird people , and human beasts . Pure bodies , pure humanity , pure races , and pure sexes all seem to have disappeared . These characters dwell comfortably within the deformed , dislocated , " impossible " spaces that appear to be connatural with their essence . Savinios painting The Departure of the Prodigal Son ( fig. 2 ) , which sports giraffe-people , provides just one example . The differences between the oeuvres of the two brothers pale , in fact , when we look at them from the perspective of the thematics of mixture both propounded . <p> The art historian Waldemar George first drew attention to the stylistic corollary of the theme of multiplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tcriture picturale " ( pictorial writing ) for de Chiricos painting . Both de Chiricos favored the method of mixing media and genres of representation . They strove for mastery of the various arts , like Renaissance men . Metaphysical texts typically combine verbal and visual signifiers at the same time that they depict the shapes or forms born of cultures past : arches , columns , scrolls , the tympanum , and the letters of ancient and puzzling alphabets . Actual verbal texts can appear quite literally in a painting in the form of a trompe loeil marble tablet , as in de Chiricos 1920 self-portrait , which contains the inscription " et quid amabo nisi quod rerum metaphysica . " Highly literary titling for paintings is common , as in the famous Le Muse inquietanti ( The Disquieting Muses ) , which itself evokes multiple inspirationsthe plural muses . Visual subjects are often drawn from well-known literary narratives , as when de Chirico depicts Jason , Ulysses , or Hector , or from the Bible ( e.g. , the Prodigal Son ) . Both brothers did extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Massimo Bontempelli ) . In short , both brothers pushed their talents in many directions in order to produce this stunning multiplicity . <p> If such was their method , what was the purpose ? What do these methods and themes do for the de Chiricos or , put differently , what is at stake in their representations ? I take the view in this book that there is a purpose . In the first half of this book , on de Chirico , and in the second , on Savinio , I study how and why the brothers produced a puzzling mixedness in an attempt to define Italianicity in modernity . How is a great cultural tradition , rich with its diverse heritage , to be parlayed into a modern national identity ? How can that identity avoid the pitfalls of chauvinism ? How can artists resist critical norms dictated by ideologues who juxtapose to the " irrreal " styles of the de Chiricos a ( supposedly ) " classic , " " plastic " art consonant with Italian art and Fascism itself ? To answer these difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuova " ( new world ) . This had to be done by drawing on the cultural tradition that was to enable the project . For the de Chiricos , some cultures excelled in providing an outlook for the future , and they achieved this because of the way in which they had evolved . Some cultures come to appear heroic for their world-imagining talent , for being highly " Metaphysical . " <p> Yet is the cultural tradition , even reframed , really all that goes into imagining a " new world ? " Through a brief analysis of heroic motifs and the Dioscuri myth , we can see how not only tradition in the abstract but contemporary cultural notions or subtexts went into the making of the " new . " The deployment especially of symbolism , associated in the Western tradition to the two genders , male and female , is essential to the project the de Chiricos undertook . <p> Binding Tradition and Heroism : The Myth of the Dioscuri <p> A painting by Savinio done in 1929 tellingly depicts the hard labor , the bravura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is connatural with a new metaphysics . In his BGtisseurs du Paradis ( Builders of Paradise ) ( fig. 3 ) we view spectacularly muscle-bound men laboring up a spiral staircase . The scene is set against a celestial sky and made from what look like puzzle pieces or star points . The active , strong male body stands as the trope for tough cultural effort and achievement , for the hard work of constructing paradise . None too surprisingly in a painting depicting the construction ( " bGtisseurs " ) of metaphysics , Savinio opts to show labor performed by males who " carry " significance . In doing so , he invokes a Platonic metaphor immortalized in the Symposium and much beloved in the Italian tradition : the male body is the object of an erotic longing that ultimately detaches itself from things bodily and moves instead to embrace moral goodness as its object of desire . <p> Not for nothing do male heroes , in the form not only of builders but also of combatants and voyagers , constitute a founding trope of the Metaphysical School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hector , Jason , all abound as subjects . They represent examples of bread-and-butter heroic narrativestried and true , hardworking , long-lasting and worthy standbys in the Wests cultural project . The Argonauts expedition in particular sparked the imagination of the de Chiricos and was selected by them as a kind of personalized myth with autobiographical significance . The Argonauts journey became a clear and dominant metaphor for the de Chiricos own extensive journeys , from the time they left Greece . The Argonauts were also a select group of intrepid men , and this trait was easily assimilated to the ideology of the artistic avant-garde . ( In a letter to de Chirico , Papini once gushed with enthusiasm at attaining " Argonaut " status . ) <p> The heroic motif was fundamental in still other ways . Admirers of Metaphysical art appreciate the brothers for having liberated " moth-eaten " classicism , including heroism , from what Savinio called " domma classicista " ( classicist dogma ) . In fact , the heroic motif is not necessarily a move to pure cultural conservation and should not be associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that de Chirico enrolled himself in the Fascist party in 1930 , his " classicism " long predates Mussolinis initiatives . This is an issue I take up in two chapters on heroic figures in de Chiricos novel Ebd=mero . The de Chiricos male heroes do not ape Fascist aesthetics , which , as George Mosse has observed , used the beautiful male body in representing an ideology of power . Mosse himself has noted that the symbol of the male body can not in fact be reduced to a singular political content : " The beautiful male body was an important symbol in all European fascist movements . However , significantly , such a body was not merely a fascist symbol , but one which had already been adopted by society at large . . . . The beautiful male body as the eighteenth-century Greek paradigm had it , projected both self-control in its posture and virility in the play of its muscles ; it symbolized both the dynamic and the discipline which society needed and wanted . " <p> The de Chiricos undoubtedly deformed more traditionally harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain an " off " or strange look and style . The painting of the " BGtisseurs , " with its faceless , big-footed , and tiny-headed men provides one clear example . While their way of representing the male hero does not coincide with the Fascist way of exalting national strength , this does not mean that the grotesque maleness found in both de Chiricos can not be a form of cultural legitimization . The politics of representation in question must be qualified through close analysis of texts , which I attempt to do in Chapters 3 and 4 . <p> In the de Chiricos , an " off " masculinity and innovative artistic strategy come to the fore together . Chapter 4 addresses the representation of gladiators in de Chiricos work in the context of the legitimatization of a national identity that stands apart from a Fascist one . It is especially crucial to examine how Metaphysical art aimed to produce the new , " destined " culture in classicizing moves . What kind of modern Italian nation exactly is being imagined through reconceptualizations of classical stories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As several prestigious art historians have noticed , classical motifs contribute a sense of marvel to de Chiricos work because echoes of the past persist into the modern world . Past and present are blended . Heroic motifs therefore further the idea of admixture as a trait of modern Italianicity . It is not just that heroes stand with one foot in the mortal and one in the immortal realm but that their deeds make them eternal . Heroes appear in Metaphysical works as ever-present beings that migrate from epoch to epoch in an ever-changing cultural configuration . Hector can appear , for example , in a modern piazza and become the signifier of a multiplicitous and multilayered cultural past that extends to the present and occupies the Italian cultural imagination well into the twentieth century . ( Italian cinema capitalized from its beginnings on hero films and continued to do so right through the 1960s with peplum films such as Hercules Unchained . ) <p> The de Chiricos use of the Dioscuri myth illustrates this point . In one telling photograph , de Chirico posed alone on the Quirinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a statuary group depicting the nude twins with their magnificent steeds . His lone appearance , without the other Dioscuro , is interesting . In later years , the brothers grew apart . The reasons for this can not be explained in a superficial way , but we can at least say that de Chirico had spent much more time out of Italy , in Paris and in New York , than Savinio had . When in Rome in the same years , the men traveled in different circles . When Alberto died in 1952 , Giorgio , despite the estrangement , rushed to his home to place a poets laurel wreath around his head . A deep symbolic bond remained . This was perhaps possible because for both brothers the mythical pairing of the divine twins ran in fact much deeper than biographical considerations might suggest . <p> The Dioscuri are perfect subjects for modern recastings of the Western cultural heritage . Theirs is an established foundation myth ripe with multiple meanings that have journeyed down through time . Their story has come to signify much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exciting legends : their journey to recapture the Golden Fleece with Jason , their recovery of their kidnapped sister Helen , their immortalization , their supernatural aid to Roman armies in battle . In Rome the twins appear in statuary form in two highly symbolic places . One is the Quirinal Hill , where de Chirico posed for his photographic portrait and where the twins appear as colossal horse tamers . These Dioscuri were probably one of only a few statuary groups from antiquity to have remained continually above ground , rather than buried and then unearthed . Thus the sculpture symbolizes the genius , the longevity , and the continuity of a great cultural and artistic tradition . Unsurprisingly , the group currently occupies the piazza adjacent to the Italian presidential palace , the " Quirinale , " where the statues are of a piece with their public place . The twins position of glory there is lost on no observer . <p> A second enormous Dioscuri group , also marked by its public , political location , appears atop the Capitoline Hill , at the entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal seat of Rome , the Campidoglio . This group has perhaps an even greater resonance in Italian cultural history than the Quirinal group . The colossal Dioscuri stand , in a classical pose of rest , at the entrance to the famous square designed by Michelangelo , at either side of an immense descending staircase . Unearthed in the sixteenth century , Castor and Pollux now welcome millions of tourists to the Capitoline Museums on this most famous of the seven Roman hills . They dramatize the renewal of links , through their rediscovery , between the new and the old worlds . The tourist on the Campidoglio can not help but stand in awe of the majestic theatricalization and celebration of Roman cultural supremacy of which the twins are an element . They stand serenely at the entrance of an enclosed hilltop site near Michelangelos palazzi and among other statues of emperors , pagan gods , heroes , and saints . Did they not seem so natural , they might stand as sharp reminders of how classical works of art are redeployed in new cultural contexts , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact pointedly put classical architectural and sculptural motifs into new settings and new webs of meanings . <p> One should not neglect , among these , the mythic twins public , civic significance and their role in producing a sense of Italian cultural unity and continuity in the work of the de Chiricos . The political contexts and meanings of Metaphysical paintings may be indirect and difficult to grasp , especially because there are no manifestos . Yet a cultural narrative such as the Dioscuri myth , which evokes powerful fighters and loving , devoted brothers , is connatural with the constitution of a body politic . Thus even some of the most enigmatic works of art to be produced in the twentieth century ( BGtisseurs du Paradis is a case in point ) need to be understood as ideologically charged . This may seem difficult when the works in question appear to savor the unworldly and leave history and political ideas behind . The Dioscuri myth is nevertheless part and parcel of a politico-cultural landscape . <p> What is especially fascinating is how the civic continuity the Dioscuri evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An analysis of the de Chiricos move helps us to understand that not just tradition but specifically multiplicity and enigma figure in the de Chiricos representations of the classical heritage . This is done through a knowledgeable rereading of the heroic twins narrative . In the literary tradition , Castor and Pollux did not in fact simply represent likeness , simply two young strong men rather than one . In fact their bond was marked as much by separation and difference as it was by likeness and union . Doubleness and twins in the Dioscuri story can signify both the ideal union of two men or the tragic division between two men , for the duo is enmeshed in a complicated set of genealogies and divergent destinies . In some accounts of their origins , the Dioscuri appear as sons of Zeus , who in the form of a swan fathered them by Leda . Other texts , such as the Odyssey , cast them as the sons of Leda and King Tyndareos , while the Iliad ventures nothing about their father . According to Homeric hymn 17 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leda married Tyndareos , their stepfathers name led them to be called the Tyndaridai . The confusion over fathers is also confusion over their very natures : are they mortals or immortals ? <p> This split parentage leads to metaphysical ambiguities . Some texts have the horse tamer Castor as mortal and subject to death , while the boxer Pollux , alone fathered by Zeus , is immortal . The ambiguity was only partially resolved when Castor was killed in combat . Because of their brotherhood , Zeus awarded alternate-day immortality to both brothers . However , while it is clear that the two brothers spend some days under the earth and some with Zeus on Olympus , we do not know whether the brothers alternate with each other or together , or if they remain eternally separated or eternally united . The permeability between worlds and the fractured sense of time that we observe in the story of the divine twins are hallmarks of Metaphysical texts . <p> An important " Dioscuri " painting by de Chirico illustrates an impossible or " metaphysical " permeability between the ancient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Argonauts , 1921 ) shows the twins in a beautiful , harmonious space ( fig. 4 ) . As one critic noted , we see an " idea of space " rather than a real space . This is because the buildings evince a great diversity of formal architectural elements ( windows , arches , and columns ) . Past styles , architectural and pictorial , appear in this one place in an " impossible " way . In the Campidoglio , similarly , the twins tower up and supply the evidence of pastness in the present . Myths of permeabilityin which the Dioscuri travel between realmsproduce places where many worlds appear together . This world and the other are specular or , as de Chirico put it , " The way a man or a people sees life can always be judged by the way they see the beyond . " By the same token , what a culture imagines in myths and what it chooses to build in the world are of a piece . Through his own merging of styles , de Chirico followed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flaunts the staying power and presence of a continuous artistic tradition extending from Greek painting and Roman murals to the great Italian Renaissance artists Botticelli and Raffaello . When he evokes cultural plenitude in Il saluto degli Argonauti partenti , he can also counter those modernistsartistic or otherwisewho wish either to dispense with or to destroy the past . <p> At the same time that Il saluto degli Argonauti partenti evokes the power of a familiar tradition and the privileged place occupied by its heirs , certain deforming elements work in the direction of the unfamiliar . The twins of the past are not the twins of the present , so continuity between past and present is interrupted . It is the spatiotemporal positioning of the two males in the foreground of the painting that creates the telling contradiction . The pair appear to be bidding farewell to the Argonauts , whose sailing ship is on the distant horizon . Yet because they are a pair , the men evoke Castor and Pollux themselves , the only duo of Jasons expedition . Why are the two men on land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist in the original tale . <p> The trait of " mystery " is magnified in Savinios 1929 Les Dioscures ( The Dioscuri ) ( fig. 5 ) . Bereft of their steeds , the twins appear in a fully imaginary space defined by skewed walls that are covered in abstract signs . An off-kilter , trapezoidal window is partially veiled by a curtain in its upper right corner . The folds of material double as the suggestion of a ships sail and thus of the Argonauts seafaring journey . As in de Chiricos painting , the nude male heroes are immersed in webs of signs and are themselves enigmatic signs . For example , the chest and abdomen of the figure in the frontal plane inscribe a second , fantastic configuration unknown to torsos : a face with nipples for eyes , belly button for nose , and underbelly for mouth . The men are one thing and something else at once . <p> In Savinios painting , the mythic brothers are at once more separate and more conjoined than the figures de Chirico painted . Twin faceless small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh create a stark contrast . Yet a point of contact between the two mens bodies is a grotesque point of fusion , so that the arm of the back figure melts into the neck of the forward figure to forge asymmetrical Siamese twins . The seemingly impossible coming together of ages and styles in de Chiricos cityscape in Il saluto degli Argonauti partenti is made corporeal in Savinios Les Dioscures . The motif of strangely merging bodies is amplified by " impossibly " double sexual traits given by Savinio to the two bodies , for both Dioscuri are androgynous . They are highly muscular yet have womanly waists and hips , and they are devoid of male organs ( as in the paintings Le retour and Lastrologue mTridien , both executed in 1929 ) . Doubleness multiplies yet again when human flesh is sculpturalhairless and ultra-whiteand the two small heads wear a stony mass of perfect curls . The Dioscuri provide much more , then , than a privileged citing of tradition , although that too is crucial . Significantly , the display of tradition is joined to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely how cultural power and enigma are linked in the de Chiricos . <p> The Sphinx , Analogy and Method <p> An example of how a riddle or an enigma " sets up " a solution and therefore also implies a " master of enigma " will be helpful . It is important to see how mystery and mastery are of a piece . The classic myth of the sphinx , the riddler , and Oedipus , the master with the answer , provides a good point of departure , for the sphinx furnished one of de Chiricos earliest and yet most enduring iconographies , in , for instance , Sfinge ( Sphinx ) ( circa 1909 ) and the two versions of Edipo e la sfinge ( Oedipus and the Sphinx ) ( 1920 and 1968 ) . Savinio also treated the subject many times . Recall the puzzle that Oedipus unlocked . What goes on four legs , then two , then three ? The answer is a man in the three ages of his life . He goes on all fours as a child , on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cane , when old . The key to the solution is to recognize the metaphorical meanings of the word " leg , " which is literal only when it refers to the two lower limbs of the adult . In the first part of the riddle , " leg " extends to include the supporting arms of a crawling baby . In the third it includes a cane as a support . This second , metaphorical sense allows the three ages of humanity to be characterized correctly and sequentially . Oedipus can recognize the human despite its changing nature . This is the riddles lesson . Oedipus succeeds because he is able to read the human body in its relation to time , and thus he understands that humanity is not one but threefold : child , man , old man . Through his solution , or mastery , of the riddle he saves the city of Thebes . The de Chiricos , in constantly posing riddles , train our attention on the importance of " reading " multiple metaphors and giving a shape or form to what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , and three legs ) . <p> If enigma is a method of Metaphysical texts , the specific content of the sphinx narrative is also pertinent . Who is the more multiple being in this riddle , the man with his three different ages or the sphinx with her several animal natures ? The relation of the riddle poser and the riddle solver is clearly specular and thus the difference between riddler and master of the riddle difficult to gauge . Metaphysical poetics work from this consciousness that sphinx and Oedipus are like beings , that humans are as multiple as the enigmatic monsters and otherworldly beings produced by the human imagination . The human being is as much the puzzling product of culture as are deities , angels , ogres , the devil , or sphinxes . The human is a representation that comes into being through analogies with other realms of beingthe animal , the inanimate , the transcendent . Over the centuries , cultures modify their webs of representations . Metaphysical texts evoke this transformation and flux in their panoply of variable part-humans . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny , and therefore it can become a sign of continuity . Human nature is continually rewritten by cultures over time . Metaphor making becomes the one essence of human culture , as a passage written by Savinio notes : <p> ( Analogies are a form of security . They help us convince ourselves that the ground beneath us is firm its habitable , its inhabited , and that we are not in danger of stepping into the void . Analogies are a form of civic-mindedness , of literary sociability . It would be disastrous if the weave of analogies that surrounds us were to disappear . ) <p> Here analogy produces a world through a weavingof disparate strands . That weave is necessary to social stability , as is difference . Any web has to have its many threads . Human imagination is constantly reweaving a configuration that serves as a ground ( terreno ) . Just as constantly , it manufactures social cohesion . Analogy building is a " Metaphysical " activity necessary to a comforting " civic-mindedness . " <p> This outlook is seductive for the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The project of this book however , is to delve deeply into the choices of analogies and recurring metaphorical textures that appear in Metaphysical works . Can we humans truly frequent whatever world , culture , or tradition we choose , endlessly spinning out dreamy comparisons : like angels , like monkeys , like computers , like something else ? The question is not simple . Not every kind of multiplicity is , I shall argue , favored by the brothers , and the associations between one category of beings and another are caught up in a politics of alterity that is fascinating , instructive , and troubling at once . <p> Enigma and Ideologies of Alterity <p> A short story by Savinio about a prostitute , " Il rocchetto di Venere " in Hermaphrodito ( 1918 ) , sheds some light on the question , especially because important critics have noted the " promiscuity " of Savinios own art . The text is exemplary because it illustrates a dominant strategy in Metaphysical texts : the admixture of high and low topics . Typically , Metaphysical works invest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep meaning in order to create a startling representation . Equally important to the new image , however , is the lowly as it is associated with the marginal and the differentwith a certain idea of Africa , or Jewishness , or Woman . Savinios text about a prostitute , a figure prevalent in French and Italian modernist texts and studied intensely in recent years , is therefore useful in introducing my own approach to the de Chiricos way of imagining a " terra nuova " and mobilizing the idea of cultural and racial differences in the effort . <p> In this story in Hermaphrodito , the protagonist , Nivasio Dolcemare , is a soldier in Bologna during the First World War ( this character returns in Savinios prose over a period of more than thirty years ) . He meets Anita over dinner in a hotel . At the height of passion one night , she asks if he wants to " fare il rocchettone . " Soldier and reader alike are puzzled , as " rocchettone " is not a known word . The protagonist , too proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of erotic activities . He links the term in his imagination to the " rocchetto " ( spool ) used in spinning yarn , which only adds fire to his passion : <p> ( " Big spooler " . . . surely it has to be one of those games , those erotic intricacies , a pursuit of the depraved or a bed jugglers supreme effort . Its how they set themselves apart from our Palestinian forebears . I began to imagine a strange spool , a symbol of consuming eroticism , an invention of our aphrodisiac decadence ; I saw a revolving nucleus ; I saw a dizzying rotor gathering up caustic , sensual moves . And the instant I created those imagesthough it lasted only a secondI discovered a way to sublimate that mysterious object . I created a historical raison dOtre for it . I gave it origins in the Heroic Age . I assigned it a spot in mythology . I classified it first among the most glorious celebrations of love and I gave it a name . I called it the Venusian spool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these heroic erotic acts and granted them this illustrious Venusian genealogy , Anita quips " non hai capito , bestia " ( you do n't  understand anything , idiot ) ( 80 ) . The mystery is solved only after the soldier has decamped and a comrade explains that " rocchetto " means pimp . The narrative is set up as a dupe story with a final revelation . Someone else possesses knowledge that is unattainable but has , because of its elusiveness , generated a dizzying world of fantasy for the sorry fellow who must puzzle out its meaning . The protagonist , a knowledge seeker Savinio spoofs , goes on to assume the role of apprentice to an assortment of other marginalized characters who are also possessed of insider knowledgethe knowledge that the " different " purportedly have . He courts a Jewish woman in the novella " Isabella Hasson " and experiences a " Jewish hour . " In another work , Vita di Enrico Ibsen , Savinio describes how he , like Ibsen , is a " feminist " who tried to make a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you learn a language : " sul luogo " ( in the country ) . <p> In " Il rocchetto di Venere , " one " trip " to Anita opens the door to all travels in the mythic imaginary . Anitas womanly body takes her lover on a tour that is exquisitely cultural . All ages , all places , all arts converge in one locus : Woman . Anitas black hair is " architecture " ( 75 ) . Her rhythmic gait recalls dances of the Iberian peninsulathe bolero and farandola ( 75 ) . Her Etruscan blood makes " Anita legiziana " ( Anita the Egyptian ) a cult worshipper and a lover of death ( 78 ) . When the protagonist deserts her , Anita bares her teeth and gums like a dog with a bone ( 82 ) . Woman , a veritable conglomerate , is the perfect Metaphysical object . She is at once pure animal materiality and a warehouse of signs . <p> Savinio very consciously drew together " difference " and established cultural forms , such as architecture and dance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his aesthetic practice . In an important essay entitled " Origini e fini di unico e diverso " ( Origins and ends of oneness and difference ) , he described a conflict between dominant and marginal cultures in which " oneness " tries to repress " difference . " The latter is associated with " reality " over both the ideal and the rational . It comes with a desire for richness and augmentation of the " world " ( mondo ) . Recognition of the reality of difference is supposed to lead to " una pi vasta e pi rapida appropriazione del mondo " ( a vaster , more rapid appropriation of the world ) . Diversity is a strategy for gaining power : " Lunico ci conduce alla morte , il diverso alla potenza . A noi sta scegliere . Noi abbiamo , in questo momento , nelle nostre mani , le sorti del mondo " ( Oneness leads us to death , diversity to power . The choice is ours . We have , in this moment , the fate of the world in our hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savinio expresses his fervent desire that his fellow citizens will chose difference and multiplicity over illusory , repressive ideals handed down from the past , he falls into a classic trap . Does anyone choose their status as " different " ? When Savinio makes a prostitute a metaphor for a potential cultural admixture and fecundity , he makes a show of rejecting the norms of the dominant culture , aesthetic and moral . He moves from the center to the margins in search of alterity and deploys that alterity in his story of " enigma " ( what is " il rocchettone " ? ) . The marginal personage provides the stuff of renewal . She is the negation of the dominant and the normative both in her animalistic sexual behavior and in her near monstrosity . However , her negativity is defined by dominant culture . The margin is a margin by virtue of its banishment from the center . The " different , " not quite fully human characteristics Savinio bestows upon Anita consequently end up mirroring the supposed defects that misogynists had always attributed to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Anitas character , like many others , is difficult to digest , so that one critic called Hermaphrodito a " bubo . " <p> Each time a multiplicitous figure is put into play , there is an ideology at work . Behind every jarring effect there is a " politics of hybridity . " At the time that the de Chiricos began to deploy a gendered politics of mixedness , it was clear to all that the battle lines had been drawn . There were those who despised the blurring of once clear lines of demarcation and there were also those for whom hybrid figures came to embody a transgressive , liberating breakdown of restrictive social definitions . Where might we place the de Chiricos ? Savinios texts lend themselves to an analysis of the thematics of difference , and de Chiricos must also begin to be approached in these terms , for these issues also inform his works . Familiarity with the more outrageous , troubling work of Savinio only helps us to recognize in de Chiricos opus some aspects that have been too long ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the prose fiction . Students of the Metaphysical School must begin to map the ways in which an important , powerful aesthetic movement is forged out of ideologies of difference that sometimes are imbricated with forms of intolerance . <p> Ways of Reading : The Example of Hybridity Theory <p> Modernity does not of course have a corner on mixedness . The de Chiricos themselves drew inspiration from traditions of representation in which hybridity and monstrous thematics are common . Giorgio felt that Quattrocento painting bore clear signs of Italys perpetual polymorphism . In Beato Angelico and Piero della Francesca he discovered " tutti le fatali complicazioni e deformazioni e aggiunte " ( all the fatal complications and deformations and additions ) . Savinios prose recalls another , more grotesque mixed tradition , namely the " macaronic " onein which Latin and Italian combine to form a comic artificial language . It is useful , nonetheless , further to narrow the sense of the term " hybridity " in order to deploy it in discussions of the literature and arts of the twentieth century . If we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen to have an enormous weight as an ideology . <p> One way of understanding the weight given to hybridity by the de Chiricos is to see their texts as mirroringif in complex waysthe historical changes wrought by modernization . Beginning in the last four decades of the nineteenth century , after the unification of Italy , the cities and countryside were being reshaped . Vast landscapes in parts of the world both near and far were dramatically altered when great public works , such as the Sempione tunnel or the Panama and Suez Canals , were completed . Such projects undoubtedly transformed peoples sense of distance and mobility . The world looks different from an automobile than it does from a buggy . In more than one way , a new world was emerging . <p> The " deforming " process only intensified during the First World War , when the first mass mobilizations of the male citizenry were organized . We read in Savinio of young soldiers ripped from their familiar localities to combat in distant zones . Savinios 1918 La partenza degli argonauti ( The Departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solider shipped by train and then boat to Salonika , where Allied armies were fighting on the Macedonian front . The semi-autobiographical novel is an accomplished treatment of the incongruities experienced by military conscripts and the perverse operations of the modern state : thwarted logistics , strange roommates , difficult rationing , continual detours , and hiccoughing trains . Trains had revolutionized the transportation system , and railroad stations had changed the face of cities , creating a sense of displacement and unfamiliarity . In a later book , Ascolto il tuo cuore citta , Savinio wrote an entertaining history and typology of the first railway stations in Italian cities . This development so divided public opinion that Savinio makes it a watershed separating " nuovi mondini " and " vecchimondini " ( new-worlders and old-worlders ) . Hybrid figures in the Metaphysical School suggest , in short , the strangeness of this " new world . " <p> Filled with ambiguities , " mixed " modernity delivers ambiguous messages connatural with its essence . For example , it holds out the promise of prosperity through modernized economies , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears turned out to be well founded . In the name of modern hygiene and rational urban planning , historic buildings and neighborhoods were coming down throughout Italy because they were said to lack hygiene and rational structure . Urban displacement became common . In Rome , old neighborhoods were demolished when the city became the capital and began to grow quickly . Sixteenth-century urban complexes around the Forum and the Ara Pacis were demolished later , in the 1930s , when Mussolini himself wielded a pick-axe in the effort . The de Chiricos singular representations of space gave expression to the experience of such traumatic change . In them , human space is deformed , human measure altered by the machinations of modernity . As Wieland Schmied put it , " With his metaphysical painting de Chirico had found emblems worthy of a universe of alienation and reification . " <p> Just as the way of inhabiting space was changing , so was the nature of work . One facet of modern alienation appears to haunt the Metaphysical School : the changing pattern of labor in industrial work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory , the assembly line ) , the loss of a quintessentially " human " craftsmanship certainly motivated the Metaphysical fascination with a particular hybrid character : the faceless wooden " mannequin . " Kin to the mindless robot , this human/thing is the modern monster par excellence . Justifiably , the mannequin has been important in theorizations of the Metaphysical Schools critique of modernity . <p> When we look at representations of hybridity as a mirror of the deformity of modern times , other complexes of meaning can fruitfully be drawn into the equation . If , for example , modernity may turn people into objects and skew their vision , it also often appears in Metaphysical works to unsex them , for the mannequins evince a unique androgyny . In a painting such as de Chiricos Hector and Andromache , we do not distinguish between the two mythic mannequin characters because of their sexual anatomy or gendered dress , but almost solely on the basis of their size and stance . Yet the sense that the viewer is to attribute to androgyny in the many Metaphysical works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name just one ) is slippery . Like the facelessness of the mannequins , unclear sexuation helps the de Chiricos to build an argument about the monstrosity of the modern , but it also fuels the fire of enigma and thus allows the brothers to show the marvelous and the unexpected characteristics of modernity as well . <p> How does the motif of androgyny help the de Chiricos to establish their politics of hybridity ? We know that women in this historical period ( by the time the Metaphysical School emerged ) began not only to insist on emancipation and the vote but also began to live independently and to work outside the domestic sphere . Some moved into male trades . Literature on mixed sexes and " third sexes " began at that precise point in time to garner great public attention . In Italy the work of Scipio Sighele comes to mind . Sighele used the accusation of hybridity to brand as monstrous any " mannish spinsters " who did not submit to the social regulation of gender and could for that reason be disparaged as " amphibians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political waysin Sighele to uphold and preserve distinct gender binaries . If that is so , then androgynous beings in Metaphysical texts that embrace hybridity as a form of richness and wonder are political too . <p> How so ? Can we assume that the brothers invoked hybridity in the hope of breaking down norms rather than preserving them ? What gender politics exactly are at work ? What do the de Chirico brothers have to say in their essays on the subject of sexedness , gender , and modernity ? Do Metaphysical texts attempt only to reveal that an inalienable human essence may be robbed from us by modernity ? We must consider the possibility that their mannequins are associated not so much with despair over what modernity takes away from the " human " as with what modernity takes away from male domination . Is it really that modernity subtracts an inalienable characteristic of humansrepresented in the trope of sacrosanct , inalienable sexedness ? Or might we speculate that sexual hybrids are deployed in negotiating a frightening transfer of power away from males ? Some critics have overemphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough the gendering and the sexuality of the human body as it is represented in Metaphysical art . To give just one example , de Chirico did a series of paintings to which he gave the title Archeologists . They show faceless , stony white human creatures sitting side by side . These marble people are also , significantly , degendered people whose innards are on view . The bellies are not filled with any visceral or organic matter but with landscapes of buildings and trees , all ready , seemingly , to be either born or digested . There is a deformation of biological reproduction at work that subtracts generative power from females . <p> Just how might the de Chirico brothers use hybridity in the work of identity building ? Hybrids bind , we know , two or more elements into a composite figure . As a result , a wealth or abundance of components is bound up with the novelty of " difference . " The texts that depict mixedness accrue the power of abundance and the cachet of transgression at once . Yet what is included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priori building blocka male trait here , a female trait there . What if the building blocks that go into the mixed being retain in their new configuration their standard , not so transgressive connotations ? What if in making an androgyne you simply use long eyelashes to add the female bit ? You add a male-defined femaleness . The texts accrue a conservative function . A similar process is at work when Italy is cast as multiplicitous . How does a supposedly new Italy inscribe received notions of the nation and of collectivity itself ? <p> The chapters to come draw on advances in postmodern theory in examining these issues . Feminist theories of gendering have led me to focus on the " uncertain " masculinity de Chirico furthers in his unique representations of heroic men in visual and literary texts . I present a chapter on Savinios representation of a female avant-garde artist , Isadora Duncan , so that I may treat the authors way of deploying gender constructs to create a transgressive artistic stance . I delve into related attempts by Savinio to " undo " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein , in Chapter 7 I study how Savinio deploys his idea of Jewish identity in the essay " Lora ebrea " ( My Jewish Hour ) to figure the possibilities of an imaginaryor Metaphysical " transnational " culture for Italians and Europeans . The nation theory I have adopted studies how texts produce ideologies , and how , conversely , the nature of cultural identities is distinctly " textual . " An influential example comes in Homi K. Bhabhas view that " nations " are a " narration . " <p> Postmodern de Chiricos ? <p> Our response to this question mark depends on the frames of reference we apply . If we look at the historical unfolding of Giorgio de Chiricos work and consider its whole depth , one fact stands out : de Chiricos early opusthrough the First World War and into the early twentieswas the part of his production that was most widely appreciated , studied , and circulated through exhibitions and publications . Because of this emphasis , it is easy simply to consider him a modernist , since the early , well-known artistic production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls us in the direction of seeing Giorgio as a modernist painter . The very " hybridity " I have just discussed seems experimental and avant-garde . As Roland Barthes pointed out in S/Z , modernist texts differentiated themselves from traditional classical texts by violating their norms of unity with regard to temporality , space , and style . The characteristic mixedness of both de Chiricos work may therefore have led critics to consider them modernists . A third factor was that paintings done in the later twenties , the thirties , and later decades were dismissed as degenerate . Anything painted or written after the mid-twenties was discounted . It was as though it did not exist . De Chirico was frozen in his earlier period , the one that coincides most closely with modernism historically . <p> Why was this the case ? There was a critical double whammy . First , de Chirico was ejected from the avant-garde because of a supposed " reactionary " return to tradition that surfaced in his work immediately after the First World War . One set of criticisms came from Breton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly classical and too repetitious . It was a perverse criticism , because the artist had drawn themes from antiquity in the prewar years that Breton admired and had painted certain subjects repeatedly from the outset . Why notice this only a decade later ? What was actually being attacked was an ideological understanding of the past that Breton did not share because it did not fit his conception of aesthetic revolution twinned with political revolution . The charge that de Chiricos work had become repetitious stuck , with the result that any " late " work was continually disparaged as uninspired or , as Clement Greenberg said , " bankrupt . " In point of fact , de Chiricos painting changed a great deal over the years . A second , rather different set of criticisms came from Italian quarters : some of de Chiricos contemporaries found that paintings executed after the supposed glory years lacked the innovative forms appropriate to the culture of modernity , especially to a " Fascist " revolution . <p> In short , for several different reasons , the great bulk of de Chiricos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the term " New Metaphysics " was coined for the parts of his career that previously had been slighted . It should be said in the same breath that Savinios writings were out of print for entire decades and only came back into circulation in those same years , when a new market for his paintings grew up and began to flourish . <p> If we are now able to set aside critical models based on supposed deficiencies of all sorts , then it will be easier to focus instead on continuity across the production of each brother . It will also be easier to focus on the work of the brothers as a pair , as a recent exhibition on Die andere Moderne : De Chirico/Savinio in Dnsseldorf , curated by Paolo Baldacci and Wieland Schmied , has demonstrated . One way of focusing on continuity and longevity of experiment has been to invoke postmodern trends and read them back into the early years of the brothers work . This backward-looking frame of reference drops the " modernist " label and redefines our understanding of the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , as " a great postmodernist " possibly more postmodern than his brother . <p> One basis for choosing a default " postmodern " setting is that the term " modernism " had always fit the de Chiricos somewhat poorly when certain characteristics are taken into account . As Rosalind Krauss has pointed out , de Chirico did not embrace modernist ways of representing space on the canvas , specifically the way modernists broke down distinctions between background and foreground . It was also difficult to lump the de Chiricos with Futurism , Cubism , or Dada because of the enormous premium on tradition and classical iconographies . Claude Gintz , in an overview of the politics of labeling de Chirico , noted that his " historicist veneration of the past expresses a hypotrophy of the vital forces of the present and therefore a refusal of modernity . " That was what some Fascists had feared as well because their movement wanted to bill itself as innovative , as representative of change . The de Chiricos were in fact suspicious of the any rhetoric of " revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideologies were " masks . " <p> An antimodern strain in the brothers facilitated shifting them into " postmodern " critical terrain . But moving them there creates other problems . Most important , the de Chiricos were not the only ones to take issue with modernity . Plenty of " modernists " despised modernityusually for its banal bourgeois homogeneity . If postmodernists are those people who did not embrace the dream of a newly efficient and rational world marked by progress , then we have to say that those postmodernists shared much in common with quite a number of " modernists . " <p> How may we navigate these muddy genealogical waters ? Art historians working on Surrealism have made impressive progress in this area . Susan Suleiman , for one , has studied the modernist rejection of homogeneity and its " pursuit of heterogeneity " in ways that can help us to understand the work of the de Chiricos , and not only as precursors of Surrealism . To pursue heterogeneity meant to attempt to widen artistic discourse away from staid subjects and traditional styles . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hybridity . It is important , then , to begin to apply difference theory to the de Chirico brothers , a move undertaken by Rosalind Krauss , Hal Foster , and Suleiman herself . These critics have examinedif in somewhat different waysSurrealist models of the visual in the context of difference studies in order to she 'd light on how aesthetic transgression and sexual or gender transgression were twinned in Surrealist thinking . Seen in this way , the de Chiricos also appear as transgressors of established boundaries of various kinds . A basic bent toward heterogeneity is familiar to us in de Chiricos typical heaping of odd objects in unlikely places . A more subtle form is to be found in his way of representing space , of establishing multiple perspectives within a single painting . In Krausss view Ernst learned from de Chirico how to put multiple perspectives into play on a canvas and thus to warp " the classical proscenium of central-point perspectives stagelike cavity . " Drawing on Krauss , who noticed that spaces in Ernst are oddly " conflated " and that these spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sigmund Freud , Foster had the insight to look at these same issues outside the confines of " Surrealism " proper and to view de Chirico through the double critical lenses of psychoanalysis and feminist theory . Transgression , failures of transgression , trauma , and difference emerge as key critical concepts to be adopted in de Chirico studies . <p> It is necessary to move into historical specifics if we are to understand the de Chiricos in the context of debates surrounding the two terms " modernism " and " postmodernism . " It is important to acknowledge , first , that the term " modernism " was ideologically constructed from the beginning and , second , that it was constructed in ways that have meant a devaluing of Surrealist art and of the Metaphysical School . This point has been carefully documented by Hal Foster . Referring to Surrealism , Foster wrote specifically of a " past repression and present recovery " of the movement . In his view , historiographers of an " abstractionist " modernism tended to be repressive , while the postmodernist critique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complexities inherent in attempting to sketch out a periodization , not only for Surrealism but for the Metaphysical School : <p> In Anglo-American formalism surrealism was considered a deviant art movement : improperly visual and impertinently literary , relatively inattentive to the imperatives of form and mostly indifferent to the laws of genre , a paradoxical avant-garde concerned with infantile states and outmoded forms , not properly modernist at all . For neo-avant-garde artists who challenged this hegemonic model three decades ago , its very deviance might have made surrealism an attractive object : as an impensT of cubocentric art history , it might have exposed the ideological limitations of this narrative . But such was not the case . Since this formalist model of modernism was staked on the autonomy of modern art as separate from social practice and grounded in visual experience , its antagonist , the neo-avant-garde account of modernism , stressed the two movements , dada and constructivism , that appeared most opposed to this visualist autonomy . . . . Again surrealism was lost in the shuffle . <p> These same insights might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrative , or historicizing to qualify as modernist . Only the coming of postmodernist outlooks brought the advent of " a privileged point for the contemporary critique of this narrative , " and the Metaphysical School was indeed re-evaluated . Although Surrealism is " still often folded into discourses of iconography and style , " de Chiricos later work and Savinios painterly opus did begin to gain new attention . Savinios literary works were reprinted and translated into French , German , and English . A spate of major exhibitions began that were inclusive of more styles . New critical approaches were applied . A number of critics started developing critical theories that brought into perspective what Foster called " the imbrication of the sexual in the visual . " A gender-based viewpoint subtends a promising strand of thinking on a " postmodern " de Chirico . Emily Braun has observed , for example , that de Chirico effectively countered " hard-edged " male modernisma move she associates with the postmodern . <p> The longer we are out into our postmodern era , and thus the deeper into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more we can begin to see that in fact what we call the postmodern elements in the de Chiricos , in order to differentiate them from modernists , were already present even in nineteenth-century figures such as Nietzsche and MallarmT . Madan Sarup has written , " Postmodernism can not be said to be new ; after all , most of what it advocates was already present in Nietzsches work . We have to admit either that postmodernism has been around for a very long time , or that modernism has contained within itself , for quite a long time , a postmodern dimension . " <p> The influence of Nietzsche on the de Chirico brothers was undoubtedly considerable , as was German philological thinking in general . It is necessary here to specify , if very briefly , what is it about Nietzsche that we might call postmodern , and therefore what we may also attribute to the de Chiricos . One finds in Nietzsche the consciousness that human thought and knowledge must be understood to be systems of representation . The human being is a metaphor maker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or making things up according to particular conventions and for self-serving purposes . Representations of the " metaphysical world " and " God " become the central objects of Nietzsches critique , where they appear as illusions that , in vampire fashion , drain human vitality and health . What philosophy has called the " real " appears to Nietzsche as a series of rigid masks . Because of this , philosophy in a postmetaphysical epoch must relinquish the dream of perfecting a moral system and instead focus attention on the " strange and problematic . " Nietzsche cast himself in Ecce homo as the thinker who has knocked down the idols , the false gods , of past epochs . In his wake all will become " great politics , " and humanity will only understand itself in terms of its coming after him . <p> Undoubtedly these Nietzschean notions influenced both de Chiricos , pushing them to reflect intensely on cultural politics . Both de Chirico and Savinio possessed a Nietzschean awareness that any cultures discourses about the deity , or the supreme human " hero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially and politically . Debunking idols was probably more Savinios sport than de Chiricos , yet both shared the conviction that it was the fate of their epoch to face up to the collapse of Western metaphysics and to turn that passing away into art . Like Nietzsche in Ecce homo , they sought ways of expressing thought poetically through " enigmas . " <p> The Metaphysical School conceived itself to be , in other words , postmetaphysical . What are the consequences of this paradox for the brothers cultural politics ? Given my focus on questions of nationalism and identity building , I have drawn from certain thinkers more than from others in attempting to answer this question . My thinking on Nietzsche and on postmodernism has been filtered through a reading of Alain Touraine , who has undertaken a study of how " anti-modernity " is nuanced in important ways . In his Critique de la modernitT , Touraine argues that we should revise the ways in which the two terms " modernism " and " postmodernism " are understood . This should be done by revising our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood as the name for an aesthetic movement and should be used to cover not only the twentieth century but also earlier centuries in which the whole notion of the " modern " was developed . When this is done , the " postmodern " is what comes after several centuries of pro-modern thinking . Touraine usefully expands the historical horizons of the pro-modern/antimodern binary to explore just what the critique of modernity aims to revise , namely , the classic Enlightenment ideology that emphasizes the liberating power of reason . This ideological pro-modernity is inseparable , in his opinion , from modernization and secularizationrational economies and administration of the public good , the critique of privilege , the scientific ordering of the world . Touraine moves next into an analysis of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries through an accomplished discussion of the modern idea of the nationand its modernizing prerogatives . Touraine asserts that Nietzsche was the first thinker to dissociate the idea of the modern nation from the concept of a " rationalization " of the social . Touraine is able to go on to distinguish kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization . <p> I do not want to imply that Touraine embraces a Nietzschean view , for he does not . I do find Touraines distinctions useful in my analysis of the intersections of cultural identity , national identity , and international identity in the de Chiricos . For my purposes , Touraines particular terminology can usefully highlight the Metaphysical rejection of the idea that national " being " could have as a basis ideologies of rational , material progress . In Chapter 6 I examine Savinios spoof of modern doctors in the short novel La nostra anima . Medical , scientific knowledge appears there as wholly inadequate to the job of giving human beings any sense of place or grounding in a world in which " God is dead . " Science , in Savinios view , aims foolishly to negate the immaterial or imaginary realms human cultures so lovingly invent for themselves . Though it has no physical place and is purely " metaphysical , " the " imaginary " alone should , according to Savinio , furnish a sense of collectivity , a sense of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Zionism , in which he finds an everlasting desire for an imaginary nation in Israel ( he wrote before its actual founding in 1948 , obviously ) . <p> This move to conceive of the nation as cultural , or " metaphysical , " was not of course the de Chiricos alone , and Touraine , writing on Nietzsche , describes the general view we can associate with it : <p> Contemporary thought is marked by the growing division between those who , in the footsteps of Marx , replace being and the ordering and unifying principle of the world with struggle in the name of the human subject or nature against social domination , and those who , inspired by Nietzsche , turn toward a being-in-the-world which is energy but also the bearer of a tradition , of a culture , of a history , and which is defined above all on the basis of belonging to a nation . Nietzsche is at the same time the first one to have denounced the modernist illusion , the idea of a twin development of the individual and of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European thought in a nostalgia for being that often led to the exalting of a national being and a particular culture . Clearly the texts of the Metaphysical School fall within the latter grouping . Following Nietzsche , the de Chiricos texts make national being a terrain of aesthetic struggle . <p> The term " struggle " is an important one . In fact , nationalistic ideologies were never entirely able to achieve the unifying power they claimed they could wield . For example , Italian colonial wars in the 1930s brought more contradictions than " modern " economic prosperity . In conquering " foreign " lands , as Barbara Spackman has noted , colonial efforts also would undermine the oneness of the " autarchic , " or self-sufficient , nation . For Bhabha , all theorizations of the nation must recognize the " Janus-faced discourse " of nationalism . <p> Circling back to the idea of hybridity as a way of thinking about national identity , we can see that the de Chiricos had an important role to play in intensive ideological and cultural negotiations of the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiricos themes , spatial representations , characters , and narrativesvisual and verbalwork to bring forth a postmodern social imaginary ?

Lewis , The Silver Chair <p> John of Morigny , the man whose work is the principal target of my investiga- tion here , was a fourteenth-century Benedictine attached to the Abbey of Morigny near Etampes . He was highly educated , a monk and priest with an advanced degree in canon law from the University of Orleans , whose writing reflects deep acquaintance with the most important literature , poetry , art , and theology of the later Middle Ages . The extant book through which we princi- pally have access to him , the Liber florum celestis doctrine or Flowers of Heav- enly Teaching , is a complicated and polyvalent work that John wrote in installments and circulated to an expanding audience of ritual operators over many years . Until very recently there have been no printed editions of this text , ? which is one reason it has remained unknown and inaccessible since the early sixteenth century . Over the past two decades , I have been one of the pri- mary vectors for transmission of information about Johns Liber florum , so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this work , the pronoun <p> 2 rewriting magic <p> includes a much smaller range of readers and knowers than is usual even for the authorial " we " in scholarly writing . <p> Johns book deserves to be better read and more widely understood ; it is a serious , impassioned , and original work that was important to a readership across Europe for over two hundred years . While its most interesting features resist easy analysis , the overarching structure is clear : the Liber florum in its finished form breaks down into three principal parts . Part I is a visionary autobiography and apologia for the work , explaining its personal background and divine delivery ( the Book of Visions ) ; part II is a lengthy liturgy addressed to God and the angels for infusion of divine and curricular knowledge ( the Book of Prayers , culminating in a set of ritual instructions called the First Procedure ) ; and part III contains more visions and a set of figures designed to work with and enhance the ritual process ( the Book of Figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . ? <p> In the Book of Visions , John confesses to experimentation with both necro- mancy ( nigromancia , or black magic ? ) and a widely used and broadly con- demned angel magic text called the ars notoria , a ritual aiming to gain heavenly knowledge of the liberal arts , philosophy , and theology , which Johns own Book of Prayers is clearly structured to imitate . But Johns work is no lay or partially learned dabbling in magic ; it flaunts its erudition unabashedly . Using a biblical trope well known from the writing of Saint Augustine , John explicitly plunders the ars notoria , pulling its " sacred and divine words " into his own book " as the Hebrews plundered the Egyptian treasure . " And even as it reflects Johns knowl- edge of late medieval magic texts , the whole work also records the process of its own composition under the guidance of the virgin Mary ; its prayers , visualiza- tions , and figures are geared to enable the same sort of visionary communica- tion with the Virgin , Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johns literate intertextual references , layered composition , and interweav- ing of visions , rituals , and autobiography all add to the complexity of his book . However , a further complication was introduced when the book was , in effect , broken in the middle by a condemnation in 1315 from certain " Barking Dogs , " who are not named but must have had professional knowledge of canon law. ? The Book of Figures , which had already been circulating for some years , con- tained figures which , to the Barking Dogs , too much resembled " necromantic " figures . The scandal ensuing from this condemnation effectively blocked fur- ther use of the original Book of Figures . John could not very well recall the condemned part of the text from his community of operators ( after all , it had been approved and confirmed by the Virgin to begin with , and in all probabil- ity consecrated by individual operators when they copied it , too ) . Rather , he elected to add a new installment that offered an alternative model for the ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In great haste he rewrote the last part of his book , leaning even more heavily than before on the divine guidance and prophetic dreams that he describes to us as he goes along . The process of composition that resulted in the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching is thus partly represented as a rewriting of magic , but it is equally represented as a " delivered " text , a divinely inspired record of sacred communication that is mapped onto the work of the sacraments . <p> Introducing this work to a modern audience , even an audience of medieval- ists , is something of a challenge . This is not only because of its internal reflexiv- ity and its erudite frame , but also because of how recently it was discovered in extant manuscripts . Until 1987 , when the French scholar Jean Dupebe briefly noticed one of the Munich copies of Liber florum in an article on the ars noto- ria , ? the work had been referenced in modern times only through the record of its condemnation . The first extended notice of this condemnation occurs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de France , where it is written that a certain monk of Morigny had wanted to " inspire and renew a condemned heresy and sorcery called in Latin ars notoria . " The ars notoria is described , in a way conventional for the time , as a science that bestowed different branches of knowledge when its figures were contemplated with fasting and prayers , but which involved the invocation of " little known names which were firmly believed to be the names of demons . " According to the writer of this account , the monk , who himself condemned the ars notoria , nevertheless had com- piled a book filled with images in honor of the Virgin , the use of which pro- cured for the operator not only all branches of knowledge but also " any riches , honours or pleasures one wanted to have . " In the end , the book was declared " false and evil , against the Christian faith , and condemned to be burned and put on the fire . " ? <p> To any interested and serious reader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects inaccurate , if not unfair ( Liber florum is explicitly not concerned with earthly honors or pleasures , for example ) , but at least it makes clear that Johns book is a work distinct from the ars notoria . Later paraphrases of this entry , however , blurred the distinction , eliding Johns Liber florum ever more closely with the ars notoria itself . A much-compressed ver- sion occurs already in the fourteenth-century chronicle of Guillaume de Nan- gis , in which the invocation of names " firmly believed to be the names of demons " are cited as part of the description not of the ars notoria , but of the anonymous monks own book. ? Later , in a notice in the sixteenth-century Antiquitez , croniques et singularitez de Paris , the still anonymous monk of Morigny is falsely credited with inventing the ars notoria itself. ? And later still , in a single , hastily compressed sentence in the compendious history of the <p> introduction 3 <p> 4 rewriting magic <p> inquisition by Henry Charles Lea , published in 1887 , John is not credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized at Paris in 1323 for possessing a book on the subject ; the book was burned , and he probably escaped with abju- ration and penance . " ? <p> Thus a loose chain of quick paraphrases over six hundred years gradually effaced any mention of the long , complicated , and difficult text constructed and reshaped over more than a decade by John himself . The trail that might have led back to Johns work was sufficiently cold that even Lynn Thorndike did not catch its scent , though he may have held a copy of Johns work in his hands ( the same Munich manuscript later identified by Dupebe ) . Thorndike alluded to condemnations or to manuscripts of Johns book several times in his History of Magic and Experimental Science ( noting in passing a reference to the work in the Augustinian Jacques le Grands 1405 encyclopedia Sophologium , which also represents the text as a version of the ars notoria ) without connecting these references to the Grandes Chroniques account , or to one another. ? ? <p> It was not until the early 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johns New Compilation Liber florum by Sylvie Barnay in France , and Nicholas Watson and myself in Canada , made it clear that this work survived the burning. ? ? Indeed , by now it has become clear from ongoing discoveries of manuscripts across Europe that it had a vigorous life and was not nearly so successfully repressed as the Chronicle suggests. ? ? The spread of the Liber florumat least in part via Benedictine monks travel- ing from monastery to monasterymay have begun before 1323 , but it certainly did not end there . Predictably ( in terms of normal manuscript distribution rates , which tend to increase with time as manuscripts proliferate ) , all known copies postdate the burning . Manuscripts have been located in England , Ger- many , Austria , Italy , and Spain . Several of the copies still reside in Benedictine monasteries in Austria , and others were known to have been in the possession of religious houses at one time. ? ? It is clear , too , that most of the existing copies were made for use . John instructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of known copies are so personalized , with indi- vidual names in the prayers , and , where figures still exist , in the figures as well. ? ? All of these are mens names , so far : Albert , Andreas , Bernard , Erasmus , Geof- frey , Jacob , Peter , Rupert , Ulric . Copies that do not contain personal names are exemplars , at least in two cases held in monastic libraries for monks to copy and personalize for themselves. ? ? <p> We must thus be very cautious in accepting the " final " feel of the Chronicle account , with its suggestion that whatever illicit practices the monk of Morigny may have been dabbling in , they were nipped in the bud . The evidence of wide- spread transmission and ritual use of the Liber florum in the milieu of literate <p> monks after 1323 challenges the widespread belief that book condemnation constitutes effective censorship. ? ? As far as John himself is concerned , we must remember , too , that the Paris burning was not the first condemnation his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liber florum after the initial condemnation in 1315 , eight years before the sensational account in the Grandes Chroniques , challenges the static conception of categories like heterodoxy and orthodoxy by showing how , even in the face of condemnation , magic texts may continue to be consciously drawn into and engage with learned Christian dis- course and practice. ? ? Johns own work offers us a detailed account of how he negotiated the categories of magic and heresy , and how , in collaboration with Christ and the Virgin , he evolved , from the basic principles supplied by the ars notoria , a lived theology of liturgical and paraliturgical practice . The continued popularity of his book through the fifteenth century suggests that this was seen as a successful negotiation by its readers , many of them religious men suffi- ciently well educated to read and grasp the ritual force and theological claims of Johns work , and thus in a reasonably good position to make judgments about its orthodoxy . <p> The story told about the Liber florum in the Chronicle account of its con- demnation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of illicit magic . The Liber florum itself tells a story about a monk punished for the use of illicit magic , but it is about much more than that , too ; as I will argue here , it is in a larger and more important way a story about knowledge acquisitionin particular about the personal process of Johns own intellectual formation , but in a larger way about learning in general . It has theological and ethical ramifications that make it considerably more complicated than the story found in the condemnation account . <p> How to present the knowledge-arc of Johns story to twenty-first-century readers remains a puzzle , however . Prima facie it might seem as though Johns own extensive knowledgehis embeddedness in the intellectual contexts of twelfth-century Chartrain literature , liturgy , exegesis , and canon law ( all rela- tively familiar turf to medievalists , at least in theory ) ought to give an advan- tage to modern readers in finding access to his work . Yet in fact , while his literate background provides important starting points for study , John inte- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are somewhat unusual . His use of the angel magic of the ars notoria to gain knowledge of the liberal artsindeed , the remarkable witness he offers to its popularity in his milieuis both striking and so alien to modern intellectual practices as to make the grounds for condemnation of his text perhaps a little too easy to accept . The fact that his knowledge derives from a store of other magic texts , too , many no longer available to us in any form at all , makes certain aspects of <p> introduction 5 <p> 6 rewriting magic <p> his experience quite hard to get at . In the end , the Liber florum has been lost on several levels at once . It was lost in one way because the allegation of magic that is the inevitable reference point for history even now creates in readers a pre- disposition of disbelief in Johns own claims for the texts sacred delivery ; lost in another because the knowledge practices John engages are so much further from the practice of history than they used to be ; and lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the interpretation of the record of events , not the stream of events as such ) actually does have a tendency to repeat itself when the record of an original local memory disappears . <p> Rewriting Magic is part of a project shared with the handful of other schol- ars now engaged with Johns work to restore more of the local memory of the book under condemnation . The Latin edition of the Liber florum is an impor- tant piece of that work , the product of almost two decades of interpretive labor , but the access it provides to the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching is necessarily somewhat specialized . Rewriting Magic aims to tell a story that will open the work up further , embedding the knowledge-arc that governs Johns narrative in an account of its medieval sacramental and magical background , so that readersespecially readers completely new to Johns workwill have a stron- ger base for understanding the quest for knowledge that drove him to the study of magic and beyond it . <p> An inevitable part of that story is my own quest for knowledge about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my personal involvement in the labor of piecing together evidence for the layered composition and transmission of his work . The way in which Johns Liber florum comes into being as knowledge in the twenty-first century can not , at least for me in this book , be divided from the way I came to know it . For even as John was aware of being a medium that transmitted , to the best of his ability , the words of Mary , first-century mother of Jesus , to a fourteenth-century audience , I am aware of being a medium trans- mitting , to the best of my ability , the words of John of Morigny , fourteenth- century Benedictine , to an audience of twenty-first-century readers . <p> While I am far from resolving all the problems or answering all my own questions about his book ( questions naturally proliferate at a greater rate than answers ) , I do have a great deal more to connect it to than I did when I started an array of memories , ideas , other manuscripts , other texts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or might be connected , to the way John thinks and writes . The sheer volume of detail , the very intimacy of my view of Johns work , has , to use the modular image of my epigraph from Wittgenstein , gone from being something like a model home to something more like a model city . And not a finished model , either ; it is not that kind of thing . Wittgensteins metaphor allows knowledge to be viewed simultaneously <p> as a genuine whole system and an unfinished aggregate of historically striated regions . Like memory , it is also , and simultaneously , crumbling and being rebuilt , reinventing itself not as a whole , but in pieces . Yet the sense of identity of being one thing ( as a city is one thing through successive rebuildings ) remains . Thus , mutatis mutandis , my grasp of Johns work has built itself into a construct that has its newish parks and subdivisions , its historic districts , its condemned and burned-out husks of buildings , its neighborhoods where cab- bies would refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with so many bits trailing here and there off the edge of the cultivated land , paths winding up in great rutted heaps and piles of uncultivated data edging the vir- gin forest where the precise topography under the arboreal canopy is still only dreamt of , that this knowledge becomes increasingly difficult to hand on to new readers . <p> The problem is genuinely acute . It can not now , if indeed it ever could , be unloaded all at once . In our collaborative edition of Liber florum , Nicholas Watson and I offer Johns text with an apparatus that is something like a map of the central area , with various keys , tables , indices , and other legenda that guide readers to interactions between different parts of Johns system , and between Johns system and other systems . The edition , of course , is designed for a fairly advanced user , a reader of Latin , a knower and consumer of infor- mation about medieval manuscripts . In this volume , I am attempting some- thing different . I am writing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just about my knowledge of John of Morigny but also my learning of him ; it is about the way he has taken shape in my mind ( acquired a personal- ity , behaviors , tricks of speech , traits I recognize when he performs them ) , but also the way he has shaped me , made me who I am , which can not be entirely disentangled from the way I know him . My book is thus part ethnography , with John as a primary informant . It is part exegesis , as I try to glean from his book , with the aid of my own slowly accrued knowledge of medieval exegesis and liturgy ( a knowledge that was truly not there at all at the point of encoun- ter ) , a picture that might suggest a shape for what is missing . It is part intel- lectual history , and it is also a meditation on magic and religion . The object of this book is to map my own journey in a way that others might be able to fol- low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a journey-memoir suggests itself because John of Morignys Liber florum is a journey-memoir of the kind I am trying to describe . His book is about knowledge acquisition : it represents both a ritual means of acquiring knowledge and a narrative of that acquisition , and these two things influence each other . At the same time , he is engaged in rep- resenting his own knowledge process in such a way that the reader/operator <p> introduction 7 <p> 8 rewriting magic <p> may follow in his footsteps . His book resembles Wittgensteins language-city , in being composed of some old and some new regions , some being built and some decomposing ; it also resembles a great many poems , in the way that it records and actualizes its own process . It attempts not to tell about an experi- ence in language other than that experience , but rather to create an experience in language for usone that must transform us if we engage it , for it is also a work of conversion . <p> Underlying my exposition of Johns Liber florum , and part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an argument that the sacral knowledge process that John lays bare is a fundamentally familiar one , for it is still possible to perceive knowledge acquisition experientially as a transformation of self that is integrated with the transformation of knowledge in a larger communal sense . In the Liber florum , this transformation is conceived on a cosmic scale , as part of a divine transformation of the order of the universe in the work of human creation and redemption . The experience of internal transformation that is involved in this process is actually part of an external transformation that is tied to the entire community of the Christian faithful , and thereby also to the dispensation that maps a divine telos for this process . These inner and outer things are not merely parallel or analogous , but one single process in which John is always consciously and dynamically engaged . <p> In scholarly discourse now there are philosophical and social-scientific models for the way knowledge works that may be useful to certain readers for translating Johns theological process , because they also cast knowledge as processual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indi- vidual and communal . The theoretical approaches nurtured by Wittgensteins work on language games and by Bourdieu , with his terminology of " field " and " habitus , " offer related models of knowing as a constituent part of learned self- hood that is communally shared , produced and reproduced in the experienc- ing subject who is fluent in the rules of a specific knowledge practice , habitus , or language game . The term " language game " identifies a sphere of knowledge in practice that overlaps with ( but is not identical to ) the idea of habitus . Both terms rest on an assumption that when we seek to understand knowledge in its local manifestations , the target of our attention can not be static abstract refer- ents for knowledge bodies , nor specific rules of play , but rather must be knowl- edge as dissolved in the medium of practice ( the " game " ) . Obviously a " game " is not the rule card , nor the game board , nor the playing pieces , nor even the players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of " play . " Knowledge occurs in the state of play at the interface between the inte- rior self or subject and the outer ( communal and social , but also elemental ) world. ? ? The body of theory underlying these knowledge models lacks the direc- <p> tionality governed by divine telos that exists in Johns model , but as soon as you begin seeking to locate ethical action in the matrix , a certain directionality , a kind of shadow of an eschatology , begins to appear. ? ? <p> But we do not really need social theory to grasp the dynamic , inner and outer , forward motion of knowledge ; it is experientially available in other ways . When we write books , we settle into a habitus that may rest at the nexus of a plurality of fields ( in the common sense ) , and we engage a game that , if well played , may show fluency ( or expertise ) in several areas . The book , once pub- lished , is a material object that comes into being as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forward motion of play . In discussions of habitus and practice theory generally , for the most part simpler examples are used than writing books , for the same reason that Wittgenstein provided sim- pler examples of language games to establish what he meant by them . ( The " builders game " is the critical topos , ? ? and comes up in most discussions of language games , but it is not the only example , and perhaps not even the best one , of what a language game can be . ) Knowledge practices need not be engaged through books , but I point out that they can be , and that the writing of a schol- arly book is a valid example of how , embedded in a complex intersection of habitus , we pursue historical language games . <p> I place this example strategically here , because , though it is not simple , the writing of books is something that I expect many of my readers will under- stand fluently , expertly , and viscerally as experts in its practice , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other knowledge practices that John engaged ( whether the lettered practices , like canon law , liturgical composition , or exegesis , or the contemplative practices like praying the hours , using the ars notoria figures , or conversing with the virgin Mary ) . A few may know what it is like to pray the hours , but more of us will know what it is like to write a book . Composing a book , like praying the hours , is something that rests on daily habits . Any seriously written book changes the writer . Any given moment in the writing of a book is also engagement with a dynamic communal knowledge that we are trying to push on , to manipulate , to authorize changes in . At the same time , depending upon our initial position , we may be trying to change our status in a given field ( in both the common sense and Bourdieus ) . In writing , we seek not merely to produce a material objectthat least of all , perhaps , especially in this digital agebut really to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to take its place. ? ? All writers are familiar with the extent to which , in doing this , we live in the books imagined future even as we lick it into shape . <p> My investigation of Johns theology , and the entwined role of magic and the sacraments in his book , is at its basis an attempt to describe his engagement <p> introduction 9 <p> 10 rewriting magic <p> with certain language games . After this introduction I will limit my direct engagement with the vocabulary of Bourdieu and Wittgenstein because this is not a book about the ways they construct knowledge , but about the ways John of Morigny constructed it , the apparatus of meaning-making constituted in the Latin theological tradition that was the substrate of habitual daily knowl- edge for him . For we do have the potential to engage any language games we choose , including medieval ones , where a sufficient record is left of how they were played in the first instance . Learning the rules of these older and more recondite gameslearning how to play them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am not doing anything very different here , except that in certain places I try to lay my own writing a little more open to expose its process . <p> I want to make clear here at the outset that my interest in the narrative of discovery is not the story for its own sake . The object of the game is actually to locate and articulate the functioning of the hinge between personal and insti- tutional knowledge processes . The location of this hinge is necessarily internal . I am not the only actor in the story of Johns discovery , not the sole or first reader of his work . The knowing of John of Morigny is a communal project , and all the people who have also been holders of , and contributed to , the infant body of knowledge about John of Morigny ( most especially my collaborator in the editorial process , Nicholas Watson ) are all the more important just now because they are still so few . <p> At the same time , it is really only my own story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely untouched by history , so nearly pristinely institutionally unknown at the point of my engagement with it , the story of my learning of Johns book offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate how new knowledge must begin interior to a self even as it engages what may sometimes appear as an institutional overdetermination , the preexisting , necessarily over- simplified grid of historical knowledge as it begins to be known in curricula and in textbooks . I am , finally , interested in how the creative play of meaning- in-use both uses and gains leverage from , and exerts force on , the institution whose rules it follows . <p> In uncovering this process , I am aware of myself as in some instances per- forming more or less Wittgensteinian operations , but I am also aware of doing what John of Morigny did in his Book of Visions and Book of Figures , showing how knowledge initially exterior to the self ( whether first encountered in books or visions ) becomes interiorized through reading and rereading , and through practice , and then transforms the systems it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Johns practices by practicing his manner of preaching . If I have a single overriding goal , it is to make Johns work accessible , as much as possible <p> experientially available to my audience , to create an experience in language that is homologous with my own experience of coming to know John , con- densed into a smaller and more efficient format , a record of engagement with his text . <p> Because my readers are about to be plunged into this record of engagement at the deep end ( because I began , as we all must , with a knowledge of Johns habitus that was partly missing , partly wrong , and generally inchoate , and I must set the reader in medias res ) , I here offer a brief overview of the books shape as a reassurance that there is in fact a path to knowing embedded in it . The book is divided into two parts of three chapters each , with similar pat- terns in both . The titles of the two parts , " Foundation " and " Restoration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh of St. Victor to structure his work De sacramentis ( On the Sacraments ) . Johns own book also reflects this structure , in the sense that his New Compilation Book of Figures offers a restoration of the world described in the Old Compilation Book of Figures , mapping Johns redemption onto an idea of sacramental supersession within his book. ? ? <p> Part 1 , " Foundation , " primarily draws its evidence from Johns Book of Visions , although it touches base with things further on in the work . Its main external referent is the ars notoria . This part seeks to answer the question of why , even while he sought to destroy the ars notoria , John would re-create some of its most characteristic features in his own book . In pursuing my inves- tigation , I am mainly engaged with Johns visionary autobiography , but I do , particularly in chapter 3 , touch on some of Johns prayers as well . This is neces- sary because of the way parts of Johns autobiography are fed into the prayers , where we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prayers in particular are so linked to the visions that it is all but impossible to limit the autobiographical discussion exclusively to the prose narrative . <p> Part 2 , " Restoration , " primarily draws its evidence from Johns Book of Figures ( in both the Old and New versions ) , although it engages with episodes earlier in the work . Its main external referent is necromancy . This part of the book aims to answer the question of how John succeeds in continuing to understand his work as divinely delivered even after it gets broken by the accu- sation of the Barking Dogsa question that can not be entirely disentangled from other , harder questions about what necromancy actually meant to John , and how it , too , might partake in the sacramental and dispensational under- standing that he begins with . <p> Both parts have a similar interior structure . The first chapter of each section is narrative and descriptive , the second chapters are broadly contextualizing , and the third chapters involve close reading . Chapters 1 and 4 open with personal <p> introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounters with Johns Book of Visions and his original Book of Figures , respectively . Chapters 2 and 5 zoom out to elaborate broader contexts that are meant to domesticate the contingencies of the language games in which the ars notoria and necromancy acquire their significance and mani- fest their rules of play . Chapters 3 and 6 offer close readings of crucial moments in Johns narrative , showing how Johns expertise in theology is crucially com- pounded of vision and prayer . These chapters highlight both the game and the game-changing qualities of Johns work , where the reader is invited to observe whole clouds of philosophy condensed into a few drops of grammar .

On display were ten taxidermied polar bears , each isolated in its own custom glass case , all transported from separate locations across Great Britain to exist briefly together yet solitary . The exhibition marked the conclusion of Bryndfs Snbjrnsd=ttir and Mark Wilsons quest to find and photograph every mounted polar bear in the United Kingdom , a three-year journey that unearthed thirty-four bears . Most were located in natural history museums , some on display , some in storage , boxed in among filing cabinets and other discarded displays . Other bears stood in parlors and hallways of private homes or blended with the eclectic dTcor of a country pub . <p> Each of the bears was photographed in situ where Snbjrnsd=ttir and Wilson discovered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not their native environment , to be sure , but their second and more permanent home . Although the photographs exude a colorful vitality , there is also an indeterminate wistfulness to the images , a sense of lingering or waiting : the gentle sadness of the bears stoic persistence in the face of artificial ice floes , bottles of beer , and African animals . One of the bears holds a wicker basket of glowing plastic flowers ; another is penned in between a wallaby and a tiger ; yet another has been forgotten behind a dust-covered bicycle and a childs rocking horse . The compromising situations envelop the bears in a vague sense of noble tragedy , an aura captured by the projects ambiguously melancholic title:Nanoq : Flat Out and Bluesome , " nanoq " being the Inuit name for polar bear . " Flat out " implies death , fast forward , and flatten like stretched skins , while " bluesome " suggests both the bluish light of Arctic snow and the weight of melancholia . <p> The wistfulness of the photographs and exhibition title was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atmosphere of the gallery was marked by a sense of absence , an uneasy silence , a loneliness and longing . Perhaps it was the austerity of the space , with its white walls , white floor , glass , clean white metal , and isolated honey-white bears . Or perhaps the sheer physical presence of the bears captured and communicated something that two-dimensional photographic images never could . <p> As part of their project , the artists researched the personal history of each specimen . The bears were variously shot during Arctic adventures or euthanized in zoos . One died of old age ; another traveled with a circus . But whatever their precise story and route , polar bears are aliens to Great Britain ; they were all taken from their native landscapes at some stage of life or death and manhandled into everlasting postures . The artists choice to document specimens of an Arctic species , rather than creatures indigenous to Britain , adds an additional layer of significance to the polar bears . These are not " common " indigenous creatures . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessarily endowed with longing . Without the desire to capture , to kill , to see , to document , these bears would not be in Britain and certainly would not have been taxidermied . <p> Many of the bears date to the mid-nineteenth century and linger as relics of Victorians fascination with the Arctic . The bear at the Natural History Museum in London may have been killed during Captain Parrys efforts to find the Northwest Passage in the early 1820s . The National Museum of Irelands bear was shot in 1851 in Baffin Bay during a reconnaissance mission to discover the fate of the Franklin expedition . The bear in the Kendal Museum was shot by the earl of Lonsdale on an Arctic voyage prompted by the request of Queen Victoria , and the bear in the Dover Museum was one of sixty shot during the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition , which unexpectedly encountered Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen from the Fram , who had survived overwinter on polar bear and walrus meat . And with this early history , the bears also evince the Victorian infatuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the greats of late Victorian taxidermy , most notably Rowland Ward and Edward Gerrard &amp; Sons . The bears aggressive standing poses make clear the eras reveries of exotic animal dangers in distant lands . As such , the bears are documents of a British cultural imaginary which has slippedthankfully or notforever into history . <p> More pressingly , from a contemporary perspective , the bears can also be read as an anxious narrative of global warming . Here are so many bears from territories under threat . But if the bears are troubling environmental documents , they also stand as quiet educators . They offer visitors an opportunity to experience the majestic size of polar bears and to appreciate personally , intimately , the dignity and exceptionality of the species . If the bears provide a critique of past collecting practices , they also make material the intrinsic worth of preserving animals . If a creature becomes extinct , no matter how much video footage and photographic images may have been amassed , nothing can ever compare to the physical presence of the animal , admittedly dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of passenger pigeons , quaggas , great auks , and all other extinct species are precious beyond words . They are the definition of irreplaceable . <p> On display in Spike Island , the bears are also purloined objects of science . The majority were taken from natural history museums where they stood as examples of their species and representatives of Arctic whiteness . The display of ten polar bears is most probably a unique historical occurrence . It would be rare to see and such an assembly would never occur in a natural history museum . Most museums have a solitary bear , having neither the space nor the educational need to display more than one . More than one is unnecessary repetition . Amassed together within the neutral space of an art gallery , disconnected from the didactic trappings of a natural history museum , the polar bears are transfigured by their multitude and setting , together becoming animal-things that are neither fully science nor fully art : mysterious , unsettling , provocative , and overwhelmingly visually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , titled " White Out , " engaged speakers to discuss the bears significance . The title suggests a blizzard , an environmental obliteration , a toxic erasure of words and meaning , a blank slate , a new beginning , always with the bears as off-white canvases on which humans have inscribed meaning . The ambiguous title is fitting : the physical presence of the bears can not be entirely explained with language . Even living bears present a complex of interpretations . " We have witnessed how in living human memory , " Snbjrnsd=ttir and Wilson write in the exhibition catalogue , " the image of the polar bear has been appropriated and put to the most varied and unlikely purposesselling dreams , sweets , lifestyles , travel . " A formidable predator and a Coca-Cola icon of kitschy winter wonderland fantasies , the polar bear is " a catalogue of paradoxes , " a " prism with the capacity to contain and refract all manner of responses in us : fear , horror , respect , pathos , affection , humour . " How much more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar bears are trophies of nineteenth-century British infatuation with Arctic territories ; from another , they are cautionary tales offering traces of human activity carved in nature . They are contemporary art , scientific specimens , natural wonders , and symbols of contemporary environmental anxiety . They offer the opportunity to observe intimately a fearsome man-eater and indulge in the sheer pleasure of looking at beasts that may be nearly two centuries old . At once symbolic and individual , both victimized and saved , the polar bears resist any easy interpretation . And it is this ambiguity that makes them such potent objects . <p> As dead and mounted animals , the bears are thoroughly cultural objects ; yet as pieces of nature , the bears are thoroughly beyond culture . Animal or object ? Animal and object ? This is the irresolvable tension that defines all taxidermy . What , then , do the ten bears communicate to viewers ? What , for that matter , can any piece of taxidermy offer ? Do they talk about their makers , about human romances and obsessions with animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As the following chapters demonstrate , with taxidermy there are no easy answers . <p> The reasons for preserving animals are as diverse as the fauna put on view : to flaunt a hunters skill or virility , to contain nature , to immortalize a cherished pet , to collect an archive of the world , to commemorate an experience , to document an endangered species , to furnish evidence , to preserve knowledge , to decorate a wall , to amuse , to educate , to fascinate , to unsettle , to horrify , and even to deceive . This list can be simplified into eight distinct styles or genres of taxidermy : hunting trophies , natural history specimens , wonders of nature ( albino , two-headed , etc. ) , extinct species , preserved pets , fraudulent creatures , anthropomorphic taxidermy ( toads on swings ) , and animal parts used in fashion and household dTcor . A sportsmans trophy is a very different object from Martha , who was displayed alongside other extinct birds at the Smithsonian Institution : the last American passenger pigeon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different again from Misfits , a disconcerting series of taxidermied animals by the internationally acclaimed contemporary artist Thomas Grnnfeld , which includes such composite creatures as a monkey with a parrot head and a kangaroo with ostrich legs and a peacock head . Different again is a stuffed pet , or a herd of caribou posed in a " natural " scene behind museum glass , or a miniature diorama of kittens having tea . Despite the diverse reasons and causes for taxidermy and the plethora of genres , I argue that all taxidermy is deeply marked by human longing . Far more than just death and destruction , taxidermy always exposes the desires and daydreams surrounding human relationships with and within the natural world . <p> All organic matter follows a trajectory from life to death , decomposition , and ultimate material disappearance . The fact that we are born and inevitably disappear defines us , organically speaking . Taxidermy exists because of lifes inevitable trudge toward dissolution . Taxidermy wants to stop time . To keep life . To cherish what is no longer as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this inevitable course and to savor its form in perpetuum exhibits a peculiar sort of desire . Why this piece and not another ? Why the yearning to detain what should have passed from view ? Taxidermy is hardly a simple or swift practice . It takes patience , skill , time , and labor , all of which depend on an intense desire to keep particular creatures from disappearing . No doubt there are many idiosyncratic motives , but I offer seven incentiveswhat I call narratives of longingthat impel the creation of taxidermy : wonder , beauty , spectacle , order , narrative , allegory , and remembrance . The seven longings take different shapes . Some are aesthetic hungers ; others are driven by intellectual concerns , memory , or the force of personality , but they share a similar instability . As the very word longing suggests , fulfillment is always just beyond reach . <p> Although each of the seven chapters draws out a particular longing , to a degree , all seven longings are palpable in all taxidermy . All taxidermy is a disorientating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal beauty . It is always a spectacle , whose meaning depends in part on the particularity of the animal being displayed . It is motivated by the desire to tell ourselves stories about who we are and about our journey within the larger social and natural world . It is driven by what lies beneath the animal form , by the metaphors and allegories we use to make our world make sense . And finally , taxidermy is always a gesture of remembrance : the beast is no more . In short , the chapters all attempt to get to the heart of taxidermy by answering the two fundamental questions : why would anyone want to preserve an animal , and what is this animal-thing now ? <p> Longing is itself a peculiar condition . It works as a kind of ache connecting the stories we tell ourselves and the objects we use as storytellers . In a sense , longing is a mechanism for both pacifying and cultivating various lusts and hungers by creating objects capable of generating significance . And here , objects of remembrance or souvenirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticity from a lived experience that lingers only in memory : a plastic Eiffel Tower from a trip to France , a shell from a beach walk , a ribbon from a wedding bouquet . It is the longing to look back and inward into our past , to recount the same stories again and again , to speak wistfully , that gives birth to the souvenir : without the demands of nostalgia , we would have no need for such objects of remembrance . But nostalgia can not be sustained without loss , and souvenirs are always only fragments of increasingly distant experiences or events , and so are necessarily incomplete , partial , and impoverished . Yet this loss is precisely a souvenirs power : never fully recouping an event as it actually was but resonating with golden memories . In other words , a souvenir is a potent fragment that erases the distinction between what actually was and what we dream or desire it to have been ; equally important , its existence depends on the impossibility of fulfillment . The longings and daydreams encapsulated by souvenirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . <p> Remembrance is only one of the narratives explored in the following chapters , yet it offers a solid illustration of the relationships between storytelling , potent objects , and the uncertainty ( or impossibility ) of complete satisfaction that underlie all taxidermy . Taxidermy is motivated by the desire to preserve particular creatures , but what motivates that desire is something far more nebulous than the animal on display : the coveted object both is and is not the driving impulse . As with objects of remembrance , all narratives of longing and their taxidermied animals work together in curious circular tension . On the one hand , desire creates its objects : taxidermied animals are not naturally occurring . On the other , it is the animal itself that activates , substantiates , and perpetuates human craving for its vitality and form . This unfulfillable desiring permeates all taxidermy : the longing for the beast ( for its beauty , menace , or familiarity ) scars the beasts beauty , menace , or familiarity . <p> The seven longings take their own shape and emphasis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potency of nature . If we were unaffected by nature , we would have no need to render it immortal . It is this simultaneous need to capture pieces of nature and to tell storieswhether cultural , intellectual , emotional , or aestheticabout their significance within human lives that marks taxidermy so deeply with longing . We do not desire souvenirs from unmemorable events , and the same is true of all pieces of preserved nature : we do not need or desire parts that can not speak to us of where we are , what we think we know , and who we dream ourselves to be . <p> Storytelling , as we will see , is an important component of all encounters with taxidermy and , for that matter , most encounters with nature . By storytelling , I mean human interpretation and the creation of significance : the way we pull pieces of the world into meaningful and eloquent shapes . From cave paintings of animal spirits to zoos , from pets to hunting trophies , nature and all its nonhuman inhabitants have remained vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellert writes , the " human need for nature is linked not just to the material exploitation of the environment but also to the influence of the natural world on our emotional , cognitive , aesthetic , and even spiritual development . Even the tendency to avoid , reject , and , at times , destroy elements of the natural world can be viewed as an extension of an innate need to relate deeply and intimately with the vast spectrum of life about us . " The parts of nature we fear or admire , the ways we connect with animals , the philosophies we project over the natural world , and the hierarchies we build are all forms of human striving to make sense of our world and our place within it . Yet nature is its own abundance and exists beyond " meaning , " which is forever a human urge and imposition .

But it is to say that nature is a chaos of forms and colors and shapes and forces , and the various ways in which that chaos has been untangled and made legible should never be taken as natures truth but rather as natures possibility within a human imaginary . <p> Taxidermy is one medium for imposing the possibility of meaning or , more accurately , for exposing the human longing to discover meaning in nature , but always obliquely and often in contradictory ways . There is nothing unequivocal about the practice except that the animals are dead but not gone . In writing this book , I hope to clarify what sort of thing a preserved animal becomeswhat does it mean to be dead but not gone ? and also to explore why anyone would desire such an animal-thing to exist . <p> Taxidermy has a rich history . Most Western cultures have their own particular taxidermy traditions , their own taxidermists , their own collections and creatures . All natural history museums likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject is simply too broad , too nuanced , and too detailed to discuss in full . In part to negotiate such " arkish " proportions , several of the chapters deal with only one species . " Beauty " focuses on hummingbirds , " Spectacle " on lions , and " Order " on zebras . Other creatures were hardly unaffected by those particular longings , but I hope that these particular creatures offer exemplary windows into the particular narrative of longing . Although I make excursions into various eras and cultures , the heart of this book rests in nineteenth-century England . This focus is partly driven by my own interest and expertise and partly because taxidermy achieved its apotheosis in the Victorian imagination . Certainly other nineteenth-century traditions similarly elevated taxidermy as a superior technology for making nature visible , but it is , I believe , the heritage of Victorians attitudes and assumptions that in great part shapes how taxidermy is understood ( and perhaps misunderstood ) today . <p> Derived from the Greek words for order , taxis , and skin , derma , taxidermy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been a pragmatic process of assembly . How could it be ? It requires the death of our closest compatriotsour fellow sentient creatures . Looking at dead animals necessarily engages our emotions . The following chapters explore this engagement from a variety of aesthetic , intellectual , cultural , and ethical perspectives , but whatever the analytical angle , the raw fact is that taxidermied animals carry their deaths with them . <p> Death is what makes taxidermy possible , but taxidermy is not motivated by brutality . It does not aim to destroy nature but to preserve it , as if immortally , and to perpetuate the wonderment of natures most beautiful forms . As such , taxidermy always tells us stories about particular cultural moments , about the spectacles of nature that we desire to see , about our assumptions of superiority , our yearning for hidden truths , and the loneliness and longing that haunt our strange existence of being both within and apart from the animal kingdom .

Finkin is Visiting Scholar in Jewish Culture and Society at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign . <p> If these famous lines of Popes are the appropriate barometer of contentment then the Jews have been distinctly discontented . In Isaac Bashevis Singers mordant phrase , the Jews are " a people who ca n't sleep themselves and let nobody else sleep either . " Even when on their native Eastern European ground , their insomnia was chronic . The more Jews felt the pressure for nation , the greater the anxiety about their few paternal acres , wherever those might be . Not only longing for , but also actual connections to physical space transcend political or cultural autonomy . Natural , reflexive , and organic connections to places are part of being human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over that terrain .

But unlike Boriss father in Woody Allens " Love and Death " who owns a small piece of landwhich he carries with him under his coatland is not portable . Time , however , and with it a perception of history , a connection to an historically oriented sense of mission and of meaning , are all transmissible . <p> In his artful meditation on the connections between history and collective memory , the historian Amos Funkenstein makes the intriguing assertion that " reflection on the contents of collective memory gives rise to increasing freedom in their individual instantiation . In other words , the more a culture permits conscious changes and variations of the narrator in the contents , symbols , and structures of collective memory , the more complex and less predictable the narrative of history becomes . " The structures of memory are plotted in interesting ways along spatial and temporal axes . Moreover , the " narrator " of Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the historian , the political leader or public intellectual , but also indeed the writer and the poet . That an estimated 100,000 people accompanied the funeral procession of the Hebrew and Yiddish writer Y. L. Perets in Warsaw in 1915 requires some pause to consider . That a poet and short-story writer occupied that kind of cultural position says something fundamental about how literature is more than an aesthetic conceit . <p> This is the landscape in which the stakes of this project are set : understanding the trope of being homeless in the world , at home in a given place , but in George Steiners phrase frappante " housed in time . " This book is not a synthetic approach to the subject , nor an historical overview . Neither are the poems analyzed historical documents , but rather fictive conceits . Nevertheless , they are conceits that reveal core cultural concepts relevant to Jewish spatial , temporal , and indeed historical thinking . <p> The present volume represents a modest project , offering small aperturesproduced by a few preliminary stabs at understanding the ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to look at the uses of time and space in modern Jewish literatures . My focus on poetry , and on the Hebrew and Yiddish poetry of the high modernist interwar period , is unapologetic insofar as in these works there is concentrated so much energy devoted to figuring out the structures by which literary language works . Moreover , modernist literature offers one of the best vantage points from which to view the active engagement with these ideas because it was modernisms own valuation of critical self-reflection that places issues of perception front and center . The writing of such verse was driven by the poets shared belief that poetry had the power to shape the world through language : such poems are themselves some of the most contested of literary spaces . Poetry , as Paul ValTry put it , is language in the state of being born ; the cultural space which poetry occupies is the creative core of a language , and its metaphors of space and time are the engines of that creativity . To worry about time and space , history and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these texts . <p> Furthermore , this work proceeds on a broad assumption about East European Jewish culture : that it placed a premium on overt , as opposed to covert , semiotic systems . A great cultural premium was placed on texts and therefore on languagea point encapsulated not only in the concept of Jewish Discourse and the cultural practices certainly of Ashkenazi Jewry over close to the past thousand years but on the fact that Yiddish and Hebrew were perceived not only as Jewish cultural products but in many ways as constitutive of Jewish culture . But an equally consequential emphasis was placed on the development and deployment of sophisticated interpretive strategies . It is as if an inversely proportional relationship existed between a circumscribed Jewish political autonomy over physical places on the one hand and control over ever-expanding semantic spaces on the other . Modern Yiddish and Hebrew literature are born of that world . Notions of space and time , I argue , are integral to those developments . <p> * <p> Time and space have long been studied as the axes of perception , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings organize our experiences . The study of time and space as cultural categories in Jewish Studies , however , has a less lengthy history but has expanded in earnest in the past generation . Certainly a redvaluation of the relationship of Jews to history has been one of the most important factors in the making of modern Jewry , as the works of historians like Yosef Haim Yerushalmi and Amos Funkenstein have painstakingly pointed out . On the spatial side , a cohort of scholars of modern Jewish culture have participated in the " spatial turn " in the humanities , as can be seen most recently in the works of Barbara Mann , Shachar Pinsker , and Allison Schachter . Taken together , Jewish Studies is clearly working through the complexities and ramifications of the concepts of time and space and their deployment by Jewish intellectuals , writers , and artists . Again , the present volumeon the metaphorical interconnection of time and space in Hebrew and Yiddish modernist verseis one brick in that growing edifice . <p> In Yehuda Amichais poem " An old Bus Stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverie on the emotional pulls of the poets life , the temporality of his memory meets the physicality of the place . At the conclusion of the poem Amichai writes , " The stop is still there . God is still / Called Place , and I , sometimes , / Call Him Time. " In Barbara Manns illuminating reading of this poem she notes of the bus stop that it " represents a caesura in theological experience wherein the God of History is encountered in intimate terms , through a simple address in a particular location . " And moreover , insofar as the poem also meditates on the complexities of space in modern Israel , by speaking of emotional reflections in theological terms , she reads the poem as dealing with " a foundational question in Jewish theology : Is God revealed in time , in history , or in space , in the Land ? " Here the categories of time and space remain distinct , a separation which is very common . What interests me , however , are not those instances where it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an either/or situation , as in Amichais " sometimes . " Nor those in which we encounter an intersection , time and space . Rather , my interest is in those cases of mixing , of time as space or vice versa . <p> Stepping back , if we take the Bible briefly as a starting point , in Psalm 39:5-6 the supplicant pleads : " Make known to me , oh Lord , my end and what is the measure of my days , I will know how ephemeral I am . You have made my days but a few hand-breadths , and my duration is as nothing to you ; all men stand but as a breath . " These verses make momentary use of a felicitous spatial metaphor for time . That is , a period of time is marked out in terms of spatial distance . On its face this is not so startling , as many languages employ similar metaphorical figures . The goal of this book is to unpack the deeper significance of this metaphorical vocabulary when used by Jewish writers , often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> I do not mean to give the impression that this specific literary activity is unique to the Jews . The renowned English hymnodist Isaac Watts ( 1674-1748 ) , for example , creatively reformulates precisely this Biblical passage by focusing on that metaphorical structure : <p> Teach me the measure of my days , <p> Thou maker of my frame ! <p> I would survey lifes narrow space , <p> And learn how frail I am . <p> A span is all that we can boast , <p> An inch or two of time ; <p> Man is but vanity and dust , <p> In all his flower and prime . <p> Watts skilfully plays up the carpentry imagery of the psalm , going so far as to add workshop dust in order to highlight a tangible dust-and-ashes understanding of mortality . But while the carpenter measures the wood in order to cut and to construct , God measures time just as precisely in order to cut off and bring to an end . Watts foregrounds the psalms psychological insight into human insecurities about mortality by bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future may be unfathomable , the carpenters saw is all too real . The metaphorical language of the poem offers a profound understanding of how we as human beings can experience reality through literature . More specifically , this " inch or two of time " is a pithy example of the kinds of spatiotemporal conflations with which I am concerned in this book . <p> Put another way , while time and space are the axes according to which we understand the world , they can also be transformed from abstract organizational categories into aesthetic objects . This transformation unlocks dramatic metaphorical and creative potential , especially when space and time are made to interact , as in the striking " inch or two of time . " Indeed , engaging the metaphorical power of the interrelations of time and space is one of modern literatures innovative attributes . <p> This book presents , in a series of case studies , an argument for viewing the metaphorical interaction of time and space as one of the innovative techniques of modern and modernist literature , certainly in its Jewish inflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening chapter I will look at some of the important issues relevant to investigating time , space , and their connections to one another , these observations are in service of an argument that is ultimately a literary one . If we take as a starting point the metaphorical intuition contained within the " inch or two of time , " modern writers used that linguistic intuition in order to come to terms with the radical changes of the modern world with which they were confronted , including rampant accelerations in urbanization , industrialization , democratization , communication , transportation , privatization , secularization ; revolutions in politics , science , technology , warfare ; new conceptualizations of the individual , the community , the nation ; etc. , etc . The ability to create time out of space and space out of time is a complicated expression of a creative power to impose a kind of order on a world spinning dizzyingly out of control . There are those who maintain that a language , its grammar , structure , and categories , determine how we understand and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A modernist would say , however , that not only does language itself form the world , but we deform the world through language . This is languages power . <p> Mindful of that power , this book will focus its attention through three literary lenses . The first is modernism , specifically its literary high-water mark in the early interwar period . This was a moment when the order of the world was not only in disarray and chaos , but also in a cataclysmic , apocalyptic , revolutionary way . The second lens is poetry . In no other genre was the formative and deformative power of language both present and the subject of its own contemplation so immediately . While in prose we find a number of experimental , radical , and innovative hallmarks of modernist literature , I focus on that poetry in which the metaphorical potential of spatiotemporality was most concentrated . <p> Looking at all of modernist poetry in this way would be an enormous task , and one impossible to undertake in a single volume . What I propose for this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a third lens , namely Jewish literature , specifically modernist Jewish poetry in Yiddish and Hebrew . Jewish writers , certainly since the late nineteenth century , were dedicated to producing a literature that could come to terms with a modernity that they as Jews experienced in specific and important ways . Their perspectives , cultural history , socio-political vantage-point , etc. , gave them a unique perch from which to experience , examine , and understand what was going on in the processes of modernity . Moreover , as members of a **25;1692;TOOLONG community long denied the rights and privileges of autonomy or self-determination by political authoritiesand one with a dramatically internalized sense of exile and landlessnessthe Jewish writers at the core of this investigation reimagined and reinterpreted their spatial and temporal orientation and embeddedness . They set as the fulcrum of their imagery the metaphorical power of time and space both as calibrations of perception and as aesthetic objects in and of themselves . Where , for instance , non-Jewish writers might tend to view space as a given , as their foregroundan element of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given territorymany of the Jewish writers discussed in this project are just as likely to spatialize time . That is , they create an ersatz space out of time , out of history , whichgiven the cultural emphasis placed on traditional canonical texts articulating a national historical pageant experienced in annual ritual cyclesis the " space " they most comfortably inhabited . While such a scheme represents not a one-to-one correspondence but a set of interesting tendencies , the heightened sensitivity towards the literary potentials of spatial and temporal metaphors among these Jewish writers is one of the impetuses for this project . Indeed , the revolution in modernist Jewish-language poetry involved the reorganization of language itself as an organ of perception . That is why space and timeas well as the equation of space and a spatial sensorium with temporal conceptsare so important for literary studies of this period . <p> To take but one example ( expanded on later in greater detail in the third chapter ) , in the aftermath of a series of brutal Ukrainian pogroms in 1919-1921 the Yiddish modernist poet Perets Markish wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window we see on a wall how " clocks hang , hairy like hacked-off heads of calves , / And lick emptiness with the pendulums back-and-forth . " We find brutality and death merging into the domestic space . And within that space the objects of the senses , that is , the concrete , the tangible , the tasteablein other words the spatialare objectified as clocks . Their pendulums , like tongues , are the organs that experience that sensory , spatial world . The aesthetic domination of the senses has given way to ( has been displaced by ) time . This is typical of the disorientation and reorientation undertaken by many Jewish modernist poets , one of a number of strategies which make their poetry so challenging and so rewarding . <p> The convergences and divergences in the two literatures at the heart of this analysisYiddish and Hebrewwhich were produced by groups of writers and intellectuals living and writing in largely the same communities in the early part of the last century , offer a dramatic test case for the issues of space and time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any way of formulating a sense of time and space that is uniquely " Jewish " ? And if so , what are the necessary and/or sufficient conditions of such a formulation ? How do socialist cosmopolitanism and Zionist nationalism plot on these axes ? Does language choice affect the emphasis on time or on space , or does an understanding of these categories determine language choice ? So , for example , starting from stereotypical assumptions , would a Zionist writing in Hebrew , with his or her emphasis on land and political autonomy , focus more heavily on spatial topics , while a revolutionary Yiddishist , with his or her universalist principles and deterritorial outlook , stress temporal themes ? And as is alluded to by this latter pronominal indeterminacy , does gender play a role in questioning normative understandings of space and time ? These are some of the questions guiding this project . <p> In the first chapter I present not a tour dhorizon but a somewhat idiosyncratic exposition of some of the key spatial and temporal concepts involved in the close literary readings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stasis , linearity and cyclicality , parochialism and universalism all vie with one another as time and space enter a poetic free-for-all in the modern period . As I argue , however , the stakes of this wrangling are not merely aesthetic . How you conceive of the relationship between time and space , history and territory , has a profound impact on a range of other concepts , including the idea of the nation , a most fraught idea in Jewish modernity . Indeed , beyond the ideological ones , these metaphorical concepts have deep moral implications as well . <p> Though I have tried to impose a general kind of order to the progression of topics , from philosophy to linguistics to national space and history to literature , this seeming order belies the maniacal associative leaps in its composition reminiscent of Strindbergs " A Dream Play . " But as in the remarkable psychological perceptions of that work , time and space nowhere in literature function according to orderly systematic constructions . In their messiness lies some of their aesthetic appeal . <p> The second chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence in Jewish Eastern European , the shtetl . These places , anything from oversized village to small city , were the demographic center of gravity in Jewish Eastern Europe for a good deal of the modern period . These were also the native places of the vast majority of the writers dealt with here and formed the backdrop to many of their works . That said , these literary shtetls are not ethnographic locales ; they are profoundly intimate and contentious literary spaces . And in this space writers experimented with a number of political , ideological , and philosophical ideas . Intersecting with all of this is the notion of home and homeland . <p> Divided into two parts , this chapter deals with the idea of home as embodied first in the shtetl , and then in its natural environment and landscape , which I refer to as a " homelandscape . " Literary thinking about the shtetl is nearly coterminous with that habitation , but critical models for its description have not been updated for some time . This chapter is a preliminary step in reconfiguring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diasporic homeland . <p> The temporal ramifications of space are pursued in the next chapter . The metaphorical intersection of time and space , spatiotemporality , is most graphically portrayed in the aesthetic perception of time as an object of sensory perception . Briefly put , if time can be slowed down to a static moment , then it can be " sensed " like taste or touch ; time can , in effect , be spatialized . This spatialization of time I call " temporaesthesia . " I pursue the analysis of this metaphorical relationship in a comparison of two mainstays of European and Jewish modernist versethe German Expressionist Georg Trakl and the Yiddish Expressionist Perets Markishwho both use this technique from divergent perspectives , depending on whether space is in the foreground or the background of their cultural experience . This pairing also underscores both the participation of Jewish artists in other European trends as well as their own unique contributions . In the coda to this chapter , I explore the distinctive temporaesthetic technique of one of the most striking of Hebrew modernist poets , David Fogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicated in the readings of Markish and Trakl . <p> A different configuration of time and space lies at the heart of the fourth chapter . The first decades of the 20th century saw Europe and the world convulsed by world war , revolutions scientific , social , and political , civil wars , pogroms ; in short , all manner of chaotic transformation . One of the great explosions of Jewish creative energy not only coincided with these realities , but was catalyzed by the revolutionary atmosphere after the First World War and the Russian Revolution . The universalizing rhetoric of that heady period , which electrified many a Jewish writer , included the creation of a new model of personhood and a new time for that New Man to achieve his unfettered potential . That new revolutionary time overturned the past and , while looking to the future , focused on the concrete present , the fervent " now " in which the new man could transform his gaze from the dark past of tradition to the bright dawn of the future . The " moment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry . <p> Writing as members of a " deterritorialized " nation long invested in exploring temporal alternatives to that control over space which it lacked , Jewish poets were able to capitalize on an inherited vocabulary of temporality to write poetry that could easily match the new revolutionary spirit . This chapter deals with some of the signal achievements of this new temporal thinking , including two Soviet Yiddish poets of differing poetic temperaments : the more aestheticist Ezra Fininberg and , again , the brash and vociferous Perets Markish . ( I think it will not go unnoticed that many of the case studies presented here in some way deal with or intersect with Markish . On one level this is because I can not seem to escape the magnetism of his persona and his poetry . Yet more importantly , much of his early poetry especially is intimately involved in trying to understand and experiment with precisely these ideas of space and time . ) <p> In the final chapter I turn to one of the more complicated and enigmatic voices in Jewish modernism , the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is a poet who is mentioned far more often than her work is seriously attended to , the subject of only a handful of scholarly articles and one short monograph . Relevant here is her poetic experimentation with the vocabulary of time and space . One of the poets associated with the Moderna , the movement of Hebrew modernism in Palestine whose heyday coincided with the interwar period , Bat-Miriam is read very often both alongside and apart from its other major canonically associated figures . She is also often written into the framework of women writers of the period ( and the themes and styles with which they are linked ) . Yet Bat-Miriam stands out from these simplified categorizations as something of an enigma in modern Hebrew letters . This chapter focuses on the poetry of Bat-Miriams early period in order to outline some of the primary features of her experiment with developing that spatial and temporal vocabulary , including how memory functions as the connecting link between time and space . Her early poetry presents a kind of intimate spatiotemporality , weaving together memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine , through biblical , religious , and romantic/erotic imagery . The landscapes and timescapes of her verse defy easy interpretation and call for a continued investment in understanding space and time themselves , making her project an essential link in Jewish literary thinking about these topics . Bat-Miriams intuitions about the associative structures of temporality in particular are reflected in her use of memory , of poetic techniques such as synaesthesia , and of the poetic potentials of the Hebrew verbal system . Though submerged by the poetrys complexity , the boldness of Bat-Miriams investment in and investigation of time and space makes hers a distinct , if distinctly underappreciated , voice in Hebrew and Jewish letters . <p> The poetics of spatiotemporality offered a fertile vocabulary for modernisms exploration of the self , its relationship to community and nation , and its connection to the world . I provide for how poetry works as a kind of organ of perception on its own , and why Jewish literature presents a particularly dynamic system for working out the implications of that understanding .

Richardson <p> 1 . The Renaissance Cardinalate : From Paolo Cortesis De cardinalatu to the Present <p> Cardinals occupied a unique place in the world of early modern Europe . Appointed for life by popes determined to assert their spiritual supremacy over the authority of temporal rulers , these princes of the Church fulfilled a role that amply illustrates the ambiguous boundaries that then existed between religious and secular power . One popular metaphor of the period defined cardinals as the heirs of the apostles , co-workers of St. Peter , the first pope , who had been entrusted by Christ himself with the care of his flock . The fifteenth-century antiquarian Flavio Biondo , however , preferred to stress their importance in the secular world when he defined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate of ancient Rome . This latter definition was perhaps closer to the truth : the college of cardinals was essentially an advisory committee , its influence subordinate to papal authority , though it did acquire real power during the sede vacante ( the short period when there was no pope , between the death of one and the election of the next ) when the college took charge of running the Church after the death of a pope . This book , which is unique for its chronological span , is particularly concerned with the ways in which the visual arts were used to negotiate some of the conflicting ties of loyalty and identity inherent to the position of a cardinal in the Renaissance and baroque periods . <p> As the popes men , the cardinals played a key role in the dramatic events of a period that was to challenge both the power and authority of the papacy : the conciliar movement of the fifteenth century , the sack of Rome in 1527 , and the violent upheavals of the Habsburg-Valois wars ; the Protestant Reformation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Churchs retaliation and the Counter-Reformation ; the political ramifications of the rivalry between France and Spain that continued to divide Europe during the seventeenth century . The prestige of a cardinals hat , once acquired , was rarely renounced . Only four cardinals resigned between 1450 and 1605 : Odet de ChGtillon was deprived of his title in 1563 after converting to Protestantism , while Cesare Borgia , Ferdinando de Medici ( see Chapter 11 , by Suzanne B. Butters ) and Albert von Habsburg all opted for secular titles , as did John Casimir Vasa ( see Chapter 15 , by Susan Russell ) in the seventeenth century . <p> Cardinals were marked out by their distinctive red hats , the visible signs not only of impressive careers , which had brought them to the highest rank the head of the Church could bestow , but also of high social status and of political influence on an international scale . As one new holder of this coveted title was warned in 1503 , his activities and behavior would now be scrutinized by kings and princes , towns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the elite from whom the next pope would be chosen . As papal appointees , they took precedence over more senior churchmen in their native countries , a prominence even more significant in the context of the fact that surprisingly few were ordained as priests . As heirs-in-waiting to the papal throne , their rank was equal to that of the princes and dukes in the retinues of Europes secular rulers . Unlike these aristocrats , however , cardinals were not necessarily nobly bornamong sixteenth-century popes , negotiating as equals with kings and emperors , were the sons of bankers , lawyers , merchants , and even peasants . Nor were they courtiers in the conventional sensewhile they owed their spiritual obedience to the pope , their secular loyalties did not necessarily lie in the same direction . They maintained their own courts in Rome , independent of the papal court itself , and operated their own international networks of political patronage , strengthening the citys position as one of the chief centers of the European political systemjust how influential they were is amply demonstrated by the lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own man in the college . <p> One of the most striking aspects of the college of cardinals was its diversity . Most European countries were represented thereindeed , it was the presence in Rome of natives from the many Italian states , as well as those from the large centralized monarchies beyond the Alps , that gave the city its cosmopolitan character . There were also wide differences in wealth and social background , even in hobbies and agesthe youngest cardinal in the 1565 conclave was Ferdinando de Medici ( see Chapter 11 , by Suzanne B. Butters ) , aged just sixteen ; the oldest was the seventy-one-year-old Venetian , Francesco Pisani . <p> Cardinals belonged to one of Europes oldest elitesthe term " cardinal " had its roots in early Christian Rome . When Emperor Constantine moved his capital to Constantinople in 330 C.E. , the pope was given charge of the administration of Rome , and he brought in clergy to act as his aides , attaching them to churches and other institutions in the city . By the second half of the eighth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canonical term derived from cardo ( a hinge or tenon ) , because they had been removed from their original benefices and attached to new ones in Rome . Thus the term " cardinal " developed to describe the unique status of a special group of clergy closely linked with the pope , the bishop of Rome . Each received one of three different types of titlein order of precedence , bishop , priest , and deacon . Cardinal-bishops were in charge of the sees near Rome . Cardinal-priests were attached to the citys ancient parish churches , the tituli , many of which had been founded by Roman patricians as early as the third or fourth century . Cardinal-deacons , by contrast , were not attached to churches but to the welfare centers ( diaconae ) set up in each district of the city , though many had chapels attached . By the end of the twelfth century the number of titles had been fixed at fifty-twosix bishops , twenty-eight priests ( divided into groups of seven attached to each of Romes four principal churches ) and eighteen deacons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council of Constance ( 141418 ) and confirmed at Basle ( 143137 ) , was largely ignored by fifteenth-century popes . The number had already reached thirty under Martin V in 1426 , and continued to creep upward , to thirty-three under Eugenius IV in 1440 and thirty-six under Sixtus IV in 1477 ( see table 2 ) . Traditionally the pope published his lists of new cardinals during the penitential seasons of Advent and Lent . It was a significant act on his partPius II called it the consummation of his papacyand a prime indicator of the direction of his policy . The dramatic increase in the size of the college under Alexander VI , which reached forty-seven in September 1500 , reflected his need to acquire financial and political support for his plan to create a duchy for his son , Cesare . The unprecedented appointment of thirty-three new cardinals by Leo X in 1517 was designed to stifle the widespread opposition to the popes intention to install his nephew as Duke of Urbino , and evict the rightful duke by force . This massive creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required the addition of new titular churches to the traditional list , including several with no early Christian provenance . <p> Leo Xs successors continued the enlargement , though with less drama . The college did not reach sixty-three again until 1544 , under Paul III , and rose to sixty-six under Paul IV , when he created eleven new cardinals at Christmas 1557 . Paul IVs priorities were very different from the dynastic ambitions of Alexander VI and Leo Xhis cardinals were mainly pious churchmen , committed to rigorous reform of the abuses within the Church . Pius V , who had been one of these hard-line reformers ( the Dominican inquisitor-general , Michele Ghislieri ) , continued to fill the college with like-minded members and increased the number to seventy-two in 1570 with the creation of sixteen new cardinals ; he was also obliged to create several new titular churches . With the radical reforms instituted by Sixtus V ( one of the cardinals created by Pius V ) , the size of the college was fixed at seventy , in imitation of the seventy elders who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds that the college had to represent all nations and that the elderly and infirm would be unable to fulfill their duties . Sixtus Vs successors largely observed this limit , though it has recently been radically increased . <p> What kinds of men were made cardinals ? Although the college was an international body , the majority were Italian . The chapters in this volume illustrate the variety of backgrounds the college contained : a relative of the king of France ( see Chapter 2 , by Meredith J. Gill ) , the son of the king of Poland ( see Chapter 15 , by Susan Russell ) , princes of Italys ruling houses ( see Chapter 8 , by Mary Hollingsworth ; Chapter 9 , by Andrea Gldy ; Chapter 11 , by Suzanne B. Butters ; and Chapter 12 , by Opher Mansour ) , nobles from Naples ( see Chapter 5 , by Diana Norman ) , Milan ( see Chapter 10 , by Pamela Jones ; see Chapter 13 , by Lucy C. Cutler ) and Rome ( see Chapter 16 , by Lisa Beaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sons of merchants and bankers ( see Chapter 3 , by Carol M. Richardson ; see Chapter 7 , by Sheryl Reiss ; see Chapter 14 , by Karin Wolfe ) , and even men from the lower ranks of society ( see Chapter 4 , by Roberto Cobianchi ; see Chapter 6 , by Angelica Pediconi ) . <p> The Church was the traditional route to wealth and influence for younger sons of the European aristocracy ; a cardinals hat enabled them to establish their own power base , an option invariably denied to them at home ( see Chapters 1 , 2 , 5 , and 8 ) . For men from more modest backgrounds , the hat provided one of the few opportunities available in this class-conscious society for commoners to climb into the ranks of the nobility . The banker Lorenzo de Medici , who had used his financial assets to secure a red hat for his fourteen-year-old son , wrote jubilantly to the boy , the future Leo X : " You , and all of us who are interested in your welfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for the many honors and benefits bestowed upon our house , but more particularly for having conferred upon us , in your person , the greatest dignity we have ever enjoyed . " Lorenzos deal with Innocent VIII also involved a marriage between the bankers daughter and the popes illegitimate son . Few had the assets of a family bank to finance their ambitions and relied instead on their abilities as theologians , lawyers , diplomats , secretaries , or bureaucrats . They also needed shrewd political skills , a certain amount of luck , and the support of a powerful patron . <p> Overwhelmingly cardinals were appointed as political favors to the secular rulers of Europe . While they did not have a formal right to name their own cardinals , the constant pressure they exerted on the papacy ensured , more often than not , that they had their way . An ally at the heart of the papal administration was a prize worth pursuing . Privy to the discussions in secret consistories , a cardinal could provide far more reliable information regarding the direction of papal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a voice in future conclaves , even the chance , if he were Italian , of election himself . The appointment , of course , worked both wayspopes stood to benefit from cardinals who could facilitate delicate negotiations through their close relationships with Europes heads of state . The political nature of these appointments also ensured , inevitably , that the college split along the same fault lines of interest and nationality that fractured the wider European arena . <p> Very few cardinals were appointed solely for their piety . Of the relatively small number who belonged to one of the religious orders , most owed their position to the favor of foreign rulersthe Benedictine Guillaume dEstouteville for the king of France ( see Chapter 2 ) ; Francesco della Rovere , minister general of the Franciscans and later Sixtus IV , for the Duke of Milan ; Gabriel Rangone , a prominent Observant Franciscan , for the king of Hungary ( see Chapter 4 ) ; another Observant Franciscan , Ximines de Cisneros , for the king of Spain . It is a significant comment on the secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it did not appeal to those seriously committed to the religious life . The Jesuits , in particular , were initially discouraged from accepting the dignitySt . Francis Borgia , one of the early leaders of the order , is thought to have refused the offer , and Robert Bellarmine accepted his hat from Clement VIII only when the pope threatened to excommunicate him if he refused . <p> Other cardinals owed their promotion directly to the popein particular , his relatives ( see Chapters 3 , 7 , 10 , and 14 ) and his loyal servants ( see Chapter 6 ) , a group that accounted for some 10 percent of the total . Alexander VI appointed eight , including his son , Cesare ; he also gave a red hat to his beautiful mistresss brother , the future Paul III . Leo X appointed four nephews and his cousin , who was his right-hand man ( see Chapter 7 ) . Paul III gave hats to three of his grandsons ( indeed , the Italian term nipote can be translated as either nephew or grandson ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a red hat to the seventeen-year-old Innocenzo del Monte , a boy he had picked up on the streets of Parma several years before and persuaded his brother to adopt : " a vicious man with no religious or virtuous inclinations . " <p> The practice of nepotism , firmly entrenched by 1450 , reflected the very real need of popes to appoint men they could trust to the key positions in the Churchs administration , in particular , those concerned with state security . It was also a central feature of a policy pursued by most early modern popes , lubricated by access to unlimited funds , to establish his family so that the dynasty could withstand the death of its creator and the inevitable attempts of the next pope to dismantle his predecessors powerbase ( see Chapters 3 and 14 ) . Their attempts met with varying degrees of successthe Borgia ambitions failed spectacularly , the Piccolomini were modestly successful ( see Chapter 3 ) , while the Farnese and the Medici ( see Chapters 7 , 9 , and 11 ) managed spectacularly to install themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family had a knock-on and often disruptive effect on the internal hierarchy within the family itself . David R. Marshalls conclusions in Chapter 17 about the relationship between family and cardinalatial status are particularly interesting in this regard . <p> Nepotism , however , was not all bad . It is difficult to imagine a greater contrast between Innocenzo del Monte and Carlo Borromeo ( see Chapter 10 ) , the pious nephew of Pius IV who was created a cardinal in 1561 and would later be canonized for his services to the Counter-Reformation . With the growing appetite for Church reform during the second half of the sixteenth century , cardinal-nephews increasingly took over the secular aspects of papal authority , acting as a " prime-minister , " directing foreign policy and hosting the grandiose entertainments expected of a powerful ruler , as well as accumulating prestigious collections of art and building superb villas and palaces ( see Chapter 14 ) leaving the pope to concentrate on his role as spiritual leader of the Catholic world . <p> The publication of ones name in the lists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveted red hat . On occasion , the names of some were not made public , usually for political reasons , but kept secret , in pectore ( literally , in the breast ) , to be published when the time was right . All cardinals were expected to travel to Rome for the ceremonies that would officially install them as members of the college , though exceptions were made in special circumstances for legates abroad on important missions , for example , or for churchmen whose political position at home would be compromised by the long absence required for their journey to Rometwo English cardinals , Kemp and Wolsey , both received their hats from papal legates sent to England for the purpose . <p> The rituals that marked a cardinals official inauguration involved several separate events , spread over a period of days , even weeks . In 1505 , according to the diary kept by the master of ceremonies , the schedule started on 12 December with Julius IIs public announcement of the creation of nine cardinals . Five days later he distributed hats to eight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1821 December ) the cardinals were occupied with the first visitation , when the new cardinals paid visits to each of the " old " cardinals resident in Rome ; on 19 December Julius II held the closing of the mouth ceremony ( clausura oris ) ; on 22 December he held the opening of the mouth ceremony ( aperitio oris ) , and distributed rings and titles ; finally , on 23 January , the second visitation took place , when the " old " cardinals now visited each of their new colleagues . In Ippolito dEstes account of his experience of this arcane rite of passage , reported in a letter to his brother , the Duke of Ferrara , he explained that he had arrived in Rome on Sunday , 26 October 1539 and the following morning " the Pope Paul III gave me my hat and the usual ceremonies were carried out " ; on the Thursday " there was a private consistory which I attended and went through the customary ceremony of closing the mouth , as it is called , which will be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain lack of respect , that both visits and ceremonies were long and tedious . The rituals were finally completed on 10 November : " This morning there was a consistory in which the Pope performed for me those ceremonies which are customary for all new cardinals , opening , as they say , my mouth and giving me the title which was Santa Maria in Aquiro . . . , the ring and the usual dignities . " <p> The gap between the papal announcement of a promotion and the ceremonies that formalized it could be long . Ippolito dEstes appointment , for example , was announced in pectore on 20 December 1538 and not published until 5 March 1539 ( Paul IIIs refusal to name Ippolito in December was a ruse , designed to coerce Ippolitos brother into settling a dispute with the pope ) ; he received his hat on 27 October 1539 but only become cardinal of Santa Maria in Aquiro on November 10 . For others , the gap could be considerably longer . In March 1565 Pius IV created twenty-three new cardinals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December 1565 . The lack of a title did not prevent five of them from attending the conclave , and all nine were subsequently given titular churches by Pius IVs successorthe last , Francesco Commendone , who had been nuncio in Poland at the time of his creation , finally received his title , San Ciriaco , on 15 November 1566 . <p> In the first of the official ceremonies a new cardinal received his hat from the pope . This was the galero , the large red hat with its distinctive hanging tassels , which was held symbolically over his head by the pope during the ceremony and then proudly carried on his formal visits to the " old " cardinals , subsequently to be worn on entry to the city where he had been appointed legate . The galero finally reappeared after the cardinals death , displayed at his feet and in some places hung over the funerary monument , its gradual disintegration symbolic of the inevitability of death . This was his official badge of office , still visible today in hundreds of coats of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hat he wore on a daily basis . This was the biretta , the close-fitting scarlet beret , familiar to us from cardinals portraits and , as is evident from surviving inventories , had become the standard wear for cardinals by the middle of the fifteenth century . In addition to the hat , cardinals were invested with a ring after the closing of the mouth . These rings were adorned with jewels , usually a sapphire , the gem reserved for them ( though modern rings are mostly plain gold ) . According to the liturgies of Agostino Patrizi-Piccolomini , which date from the 1480s , this ring symbolized the marriage of the cardinal with his titular church , which was assigned at the same time , and it superseded his episcopal ring if he were the bishop of a diocese . <p> Red was the hallmark of a cardinal , the color that embodied his closeness to , and dependence on , the pope , who traditionally wore scarlet and whitePius V established white as the main papal color , although the pope today still wears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVIs elegant Prada shoes ) . According to the inventory of Francesco Soderinis possessions , his clothes , hangings , and furniture , even his cushions , were almost exclusively red , in a variety of shades from pale to dark . Soderini , like other wealthy cardinals ( see Chapter 8 ) , could afford the best quality red cloth made with kermes ( cremesino or cherimisi , from the Arabic qirmiz ) , a dye made from insect bodies and imported to Italy from the Middle East ; cheaper reds could be obtained with locally produced grana ( grain ) . As Paul II decreed in 1464 , kermes was " the cardinals purple , even though it was red . " The phrase " raised to the purple , " frequently used in reference to acquiring a red hat , derives from the ancient Roman habit of investing senators with a purple toga . In the 1480s Agostino Patrizi-Piccolomini explained that cardinals entered the conclave wearing the purple to represent their power during the sede vacante as equivalent to the senators of ancient Rome . The members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were known as the Purple Swans ( see Chapter 14 ) . <p> On certain occasions , cardinals also wore vestments of purple , or rather , a dark purple-red , a color recorded in the documents as pavonazzo or violet ( violaceus , violetto ) , which could be made from either kermes or grana . This was also the color used to identify the conclave cells of the cardinals created by the deceased pope . The various shades of purple may not have been identical but they were , liturgically speaking , the same . It was only with the Council of Trent that the rules of a cardinals dress were formally defined , obliging cardinals to wear purple on liturgical days of penitence . Even before Trent , purple was used by cardinals to mark penitential seasons : in 1505 the papal master of ceremonies advised the new intake that they should not dress like some " old " cardinals who wore varying shades of red , " sed omnino violaceum colorem but entirely in the color purple , " because it was Advent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules . However , in the 1450s Domenico Domenichini had criticized cardinals who allowed their retinues to wear anything but purple , which certainly implies that usage varied before , though this is an area where a lot more research is needed . <p> The final event in the cardinalatial ceremonies was the assignment of titular churches , more often than not a matter of what happened to be vacant at the time ( see Chapter 1 ) . Some titles were more attractive than others , particularly those with residences attached . When Filippo Calandrini was made a cardinal in 1448 by his half-brother , Nicholas V , he was given the popes old title , Santa Susanna , together with its neglected house ; three years later he persuaded Nicholas V to move him to San Lorenzo in Lucina , which came with a much grander palace . Other churches did not have separate lodgings , though some monastic establishments , such as San Clemente , seem to have included rooms reserved for the cardinals use . Dominicans were regularly assigned to Santa Maria sopra Minerva after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Maria in Aracoeli , while the Venetians monopolized San Marco from 1450 on . There are also several instances of familial assignmentthe Medici at Santa Maria in Domica , for example , or the Della Rovere at San Pietro in Vincolibut it is important not to confuse this with the practice whereby , soon after his election , a new pope distributed his old benefices to those who had supported him in the conclave and assigned his cardinal-nephew , usually the first cardinal to be appointed , to his old titular church . <p> Modern authors often express surprise over the fact that so few cardinals were ordained as bishops or even priests , but this is a relatively modern requirement . Moreover , this apparent anomaly was actually provided for by the ancient practice of assigning bishops and priests to churches but deacons to the welfare centers of Rome . During the early modern period , and particularly after the Counter-Reformation , young cardinals and those who had not been ordained were usually allocated a deacons titlethese were also an attractive option for those from ruling dynasties who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was the case with both Giovanni and Ferdinando de Medici ( see Chapters 9 and 11 ) and with John Casimir Vasa ( see Chapter 15 ) . Generally it was only those who had been ordained who were appointed as cardinal-priests ( new cardinals were never allocated to the bishoprics , which were used to reward papal favorites ) . There were exceptions , of course , especially for papal relatives : in 1534 Paul III gave a hat to his fourteen-year-old grandson , Alessandro Farnese , and the deacons title of SantAngelo in Pescheria , but the following year , when he appointed Alessandro as vice-chancellor of the Church , he also promoted him to cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Damaso , the title traditionally attached to his new positionAlessandro was only ordained in 1564 , as part of the reforms instituted by the Council of Trent . <p> Once the new cardinal had attended the opening of the mouth ceremony and received his titular church , he was able to take up his duties as a member of the college . Not all were resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , others traveled abroad on official diplomatic missions , and some were exiled from the city for misdemeanors ( see Chapter 8 ) . Absence could be a problem for the pope , who relied on resident cardinals for the efficiency of his administration : as Pius II put it , " The harvest is great but the workers are few . " Out of a total of seventy-one members of the college in December 1565 , less than half were in Rome when Pius IV died , though forty-eight cardinals entered the conclave ten days later ( only eighteen failed to make it ) . Resident cardinals were central to the social and political life of the city , not to mention its economic prosperity . <p> A cardinals duties have been defined by Lowe as conciliar , ceremonial , and social . At a conciliar level , he was expected to attend consistories and , occasionally , other private meetings with the pope at the Vatican . For those in the inner circlenotably cardinal-nephews and relatives , as well as loyal servantsthere would also be regular private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitated by their appointment as palatine cardinals with their own apartments in the Vatican ( see Chapter 6 ) . During the course of the sixteenth century , this inner circle of cardinals increasingly took over the advisory function of the collegeconsistories , which had taken place several times a week in the early 1500s , were held only twice monthly a century later . Its decline became terminal with the reforms instituted by Sixtus V , who , significantly , made a point of defining the cardinals as the heirs of the apostles , not the senators of ancient , pagan , Rome . His most drastic innovation was , in 1588 , to devolve much of the colleges power to separate committees of cardinals , the congregations , six covering the administration of the papal states and nine to take charge of spiritual matters . Cardinals remained , however , key figures in the complex networks of political patronage that operated throughout Renaissance Europe . For Romans and foreigners alike , they had siblings , cousins , nephews , and often children of their own , whose advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchmen who rose up the hierarchy thanks to the intervention of their patron . They had fellow compatriots , who would pay for favors . Endemic corruption allowed them to profit on a huge scale financially . Not all cardinals were corrupt , but many were rich . <p> A cardinals income came from several sources : his titular church , his attendance in consistory , any official position he might hold in the curia , the official tip ( propina ) he could earn from enabling favors in consistories , and above all , from his benefices . For most , and certainly for the rich , their income came largely from the secular world . From humble convent to grand metropolitan see , they owned agricultural land and real estate , charging rents to craftsmen and shopkeepers ; selling their grain , wood , and animals to merchants ; and levying tithes from the peasants working their fields . The list recording the tax levied by Pius V in 1571 on the benefice income of all Italian cardinals to finance a war against the Turks , shows just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the top of the list came Alessandro Farnese and Ippolito dEste ( see Chapter 8 ) with incomes of over 70,000 scudi a year , while ten out of the twenty cardinals , whose total benefice income was listed , earned below 10,000 scudithree of them registered incomes below 2,500 scudi , what Ippolito dEste had earned from his attendance in consistory in 1560 . It should be noted that , even on these incomes , cardinals were rich by the standards of the daya painter earned just 100 scudi a year in mid-sixteenth-century Rome ( see Chapter 8 ) . <p> Cardinals , however , unlike painters , were burdened with the financial obligation of displaying their wealth ( see Chapter 1 ) .

The problem was not simply one of wealth per se , but also expenditure on the grand scale to avoid the sin of avarice ( see Chapter 2 ) . <p> The great cardinals of the early modern period lived in style in their splendid Roman palaces and suburban villas , surrounded by large , sometimes huge , households . In each period much was made of the unparalleled glories of the cardinals residences ( see Chapters 12 and 16 ) , but the case studies presented here demonstrate that this was as much a concern for fifteenth-century cardinals ( see Chapters 2 and 5 ) . The cardinals busy social lives reflected the duality of their role as princes of the Church as they attended the papal masses held to celebrate Easter and the other major events of the Christian calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign dignitaries , and above all , the endless rounds of visits , dinner parties , and banquets .

While cardinals were technically expected to be celibate , few would have been unaware of the chapel in St. Peters , under the protection of the kings of France , which was dedicated to St. Petronilla , reputed to be the daughter of the first pope . Many cardinals had children : dEstouteville ( see Chapter 2 ) , Giuliano della Rovere , Ippolito dEste ( see Chapter 8 ) , Alessandro Farnese , whose lovely daughter was the mistress of Ferdinando de Medici ( see Chapter 11 ) , Ugo Boncompagni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gabriel Rangone ( see Chapter 4 ) . <p> The quantity of letters and treatises from the early modern period , outlining the role of a cardinal , his behavior , and the qualities expected of him , provide us with compelling evidence that these issues were far from settled ( see Chapter 12 ) . Sixtus Vs reforms had a significant impact on the secular character of the sixteenth-century college : cardinals should be ordained , and at least thirty years old ( though deacons could be as young as twenty-two ) ; they should be chosen for their " blameless purity of faith " ; and the college should include at least four theologians , while illegitimate men and those with children were excluded absolutely . There would be no place in the reformed college for figures such as Innocenzo del MontePius IV banished him to the monastery of Monte Cassino , in the company of two Jesuits , to improve his morals .

" There were even attempts in the seventeenth century to abolish the practice of nepotism , though a single papal relative could still be made a cardinal . <p> Above all , the early modern era saw the dramatic transformation of the visual fabric of the city of Rome . Although the impetus for this renewal came from the papal throne , the cardinals also played a significant role . In 1400 the city was shabby and dilapidated , with a population of 17,000 clustered around the banks of the Tiber . The huge area once enclosed by the ancient walls was largely empty , providing land for orchards and vineyards , pasture for cows and sheep , orchards , fields for crops , and hideouts for bandits . By 1650 Rome had become a thriving metropolis , with a population of over 100,000 , a city of grand roads and piazzas , magnificent churches , and superb palaces and villas , a visual statement of a triumphant Catholic Church . <p> How did cardinals deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose origins were based on the poverty and simplicity of the lives of Christ and his apostles , and also powerful men in an age when conspicuous expenditure was the prime vehicle for the display of prestige ?

Other contributors regard Quine as an unrepentant empiricist and , unlike feminists who seek to use or extend his arguments , they interpret his positions as far less radical and more problematic . <p> In particular , critics and advocates of Quine 's arguments that the philosophy of science should be " naturalized " understood and pursued as an enterprise continuous with the sciences properdisagree deeply about whether such a naturalized philosophy is " philosophy enough . " Central issues at stake in these disagreements reflect current questions of special interest to feminists and also bridge the analytic and postmodern traditions . They include questions about whether and how the philosophy of science , as a form of practice , is or can be normative as well as questions concerning the implications of Quine 's philosophy of language for the transparency and stability of meaning . <p> In representing feminist philosophy centrally engaged with the analytic tradition , this volume is important not only for what it contributes to the understanding of Quine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working against restrictive conceptions of the place of feminism within the discipline . <p> At the time of his death in December of 2000 , W. V. Quine was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Harvard University . Quine was born in 1908 in Akron , Ohio . He attended Oberlin College as an undergraduate and earned his Ph.D . at Harvard , under C. I. Lewis . He was the preeminent American philosopher of the twentieth century . <p> Quine falls within , and is influenced by , at least three intellectual traditions : the empiricist tradition of John Locke , George Berkeley , David Hume , the Vienna Circle , and , most importantly for Quines development , Rudolph Carnap ; the pragmatist tradition of William James , C. S. Peirce , John Dewey , and C. I. Lewis ; and the tradition of modern mathematical logic , running from Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead through Kurt Gdel and Alonzo Church . From the empiricist tradition comes Quines lifelong concern with explicating the relationships between experience and our best going theories of the world . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentativeness of all of science . From mathematical logic comes his commitment to extensionality and to Alfred Tarskis theory of truth . Quine is the clear heir to the empiricist program for which Carnap set the agenda in the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s . He is a product of this tradition . In our view , he is also its own severest critic and its ablest defender . But these views are not uncontroversial , as the essays collected here indicate . <p> Given the nature and the significance of Quines positions , it is somewhat surprising that feminist philosophers have been somewhat slow to show interest in his work . In the 1980s , feminist critiques of the philosophy of science were largely directed at the logico-empiricist tradition , particularly the positions associated with Carnap , Carl Hempel , and Ernst Nagel . Arguably , Quines positions constitute some of the most fundamental and far-reaching challenges anyone has offered to central tenets of this tradition . The 1990s saw more interest in Quines work , as reflected in the number of contributors to Linda Martfn Alcoff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quines positions ( Alcoff and Potter 1993 ) , and in the conference " Feminism and Naturalism , " co-sponsored by the Philosophy departments at the University of Missouri-St . Louis and Washington University in September 1999 . <p> But although relatively rare , feminist analyses that did engage Quines positions in the 1980s constituted significant contributions to feminist philosophy of science and feminist epistemology . Helen E. Longino appealed to Quines underdetermination thesis to argue for the plausibility of science critiques motivated by feminist perspectives ( Longino 1987 ) . Underdetermination is also a key premise of Longinos analysis and arguments in Science as Social Knowledge ( Longino 1990 ) , and of later articles in which she explores the viability of the traditional distinction between " cognitive " and " noncognitive " values ( e.g. , Longino 1995 and 1996 ) . Alcoff explicated Quines thesis of holism to argue that it makes the notion of " feminist social science " viable , rather than inherently contradictory as some feminist analyses were then suggesting ( Alcoff 1987 ) . Potter also appealed to holism as advocated by Quine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender politics and science ( Potter 1988 ) . Individually and collectively , these analyses demonstrated that the issues with which feminist scientists and science scholars are concerned are not limited to cases of " bad " science , and that positivism and relativism do not exhaust the options available to feminist theorists . Finally , in The Science Question in Feminism , Sandra Harding recognized Quines arguments against the analytic/synthetic distinction as constituting a devastating challenge to key tenets of the logico-empiricist tradition central to the work of Carnap , Hempel , and Nagel ( Harding 1986 ) . At the same time , Harding was highly critical of other aspects of Quines philosophy of science , particularly of what she argued to be a pervasive scientism within it . <p> Hardings critique of Quines positions and of empiricism serves as important background to the essays in this volume . Contributors who view Quines positions as having much to contribute to feminist philosophy of science and epistemology engage many of Hardings criticismsalthough it will be clear that there are substantive differences in how they understand a number of Quines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of Quines positions , and those who seek to further develop Quinean naturalism or to offer alternative versions of naturalism altogether , also engage Hardings arguments . In general , they share Hardings concern that central features of Quines philosophy of science straightforwardly preclude the kind and level of normativity feminist science studies calls for and invokes . Paul Roth , who advocates Quinean naturalism and its importance for feminist theorizing about science , concurs with the argument that naturalism rightly understood can not provide the kind of normativity that contributors critical of it take to be important . But in Roths view , this is not a failing of Quines arguments for naturalized epistemology ; it is what makes them sound and genuinely revolutionary . <p> Given these relationships , we review the major outlines of Hardings arguments . We set the stage for that discussion and for our introduction to the essays , themes , and agreements and disagreements in this volume by going back to the beginning , to Quines " Two Dogmas of Empiricism " ( Quine 1953 ) . Here Quine offered his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood , by rejecting both the analytic/synthetic distinction and verificationism . In doing so , he challenged the traditions understanding of the philosophy of science and the tenability of its projects . Since its publication , philosophers have debated the soundness of Quines arguments and argued about the extent of their implications for the philosophy of science and Anglo-American philosophy more generally . For Quine , the arguments of " Two Dogmas " served as the foundation of his subsequent work in the philosophy of science , and constituted the origins of others of his positionsincluding holism , the indeterminacy of translation , and his argument for naturalizing the philosophy of science ( epistemology ) . <p> We spend time explicating these arguments and their relationships to the positions just mentioned for two reasons . First , although most contributors do not directly engage the arguments of " Two Dogmas " ( but see Maureen Linker , Chapter 3 of this volume , for an extensive critique of them ) , they do engage the positions we maintain rely on its arguments , including holism and naturalism , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not presume extensive familiarity with Quines positions or the debates that have surrounded them . It goes without saying that not all contributors , let alone all Quine scholars or critics , will agree with our characterization of the structure , the implications , and the success of Quines arguments in " Two Dogmas " or of the other positions we outline . Readers who wish can go directly to the second part of this introduction , where we discuss the essays in this volume . <p> Finally , a word about terminology . Quine often uses epistemology when discussing the philosophy of science , that subdiscipline of philosophy that takes science , rather than knowledge in general , as its subject matter . Accordingly , we use philosophy of science when discussing many of Quines positions . But we also note that often Quine uses science in an inclusive sense to include so-called common-sense theories and theorizing , as well as philosophy , indeed " the totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs " ( Quine 1953 , 42 ) . <p> &lt;2&gt; " Two Dogmas of Empiricism " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own provincial conceptual scheme and scientific epoch , true ; but I know no better . <p> Quine , " Epistemology Naturalized " <p> &lt;end epi&gt; <p> Quine published " Two Dogmas of Empiricism " in 1951 in the Philosophical Review . In 1953 he included it as the second of nine essays in From a Logical Point of View . In it , he rejects outright both the analytic/synthetic distinction and verificationism , i.e. , the verification theory of meaning applied to individual sentences . The analytic/synthetic distinction has its roots in Humes distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact . The second dogma , verificationism , emerged as the basis of a strategy for completing one half of Humes agendathat of showing how all empirical knowledge flows from experience . <p> Quine sets out to show that common , and superficially promising , defenses of the analytic/synthetic distinction invariably turn out to presuppose , rather than elucidate , the notion of analyticity . An investigation of the nest of interrelated notionsanalyticity , synonymy , interchangeability salva veritate , andnecessary truthyields , Quine argues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like it . It has the form , figuratively speaking , of a closed curve in space " ( Quine 1953 , 30 ) . <p> Kants view , Quine claims , can be taken to be that " a statement is analytic when it is true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact " ( 21 ) . Quine finds meanings , in the sense of mental objects or ideas , to be " obscure intermediary entities " that are " well abandoned " in favor of an investigation of " the synonymy of linguistic forms " ( 23 ; cf. Quine 1966 ) . Instead of talking of meanings , he maintains , we can talk , given the notion of synonymy , of two linguistic formstwo sentences or two wordsmeaning the same if and only if they are synonymous . So we are making progress if we can give an account of synonymy . The progress is this : analytic statements fall into two subclasseslogical truths and statements that can be turned into logical truths by substituting synonyms for synonyms ( 23 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is married , " and his general characterization of a logical truth is " a statement which is true and remains true under all reinterpretations of its components other than the logical particles " ( 22 ) . An alleged example of a statement that is not a logical truth but yields one through the substitution of synonym for synonym is " no bachelor is married , " where bachelor and unmarried man are taken to be synonyms . <p> So , this first part of the closed curve seeks to explicate analyticity in terms of synonymy . But synonymy , Quine contends , " is no less in need of clarification than analyticity itself " ( 23 ) . Quine rejects the view that synonymy rests on definition , according to which bachelor is supposedly defined as , and is therefore synonymous with , unmarried man ( 24 ) . The problem , he points out , is that ordinary definitions , dictionary definitions , are not stipulations but reports on usage . " The lexicographer is an empirical scientist , whose business is the recording of antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not create usage or synonyms . <p> Quine next turns to the notion of interchangeability of terms salva veritate as a possible explication of synonymy . The proposal is that expressions are synonymous if they are everywhere interchangeable without changing the truth or falsity of the containing statement . The problem here , Quine argues , is that such allegedly clear synonyms as bachelor and unmarried male are not so interchangeable . For example , unmarried male can not be substituted for bachelor in 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Bachelor has less than ten letters 60005 @qwx470005 <p> without turning the above truth into the falsehood 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Unmarried male has less than ten letters 60005 @qwx470005 <p> ( 28 ) . To make the substitutivity test work we have to limit substitutions to whole words . The word spelled b-a-c-h-e-l-o-r does not occur as a whole word in the above example , though its name does . <p> So far so good ( assuming the notion of wordhood is unproblematic ) . But to make the substitutivity test workto prevent its declaring such co-referential but nonsynonymous expressions as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second husband of Martha Washington synonymouswe will have to consider substitutivity not only within such ordinary contexts as 60006 @qwx470006 <p> The first President of the United States was married to Martha Washington 60005 @qwx470005 <p> but also within such contexts as 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Necessarily the first President of the United States was married to Martha Washington 60005 @qwx470005 <p> for while the expressions the first President of the United States and the second husband of Martha Washington are intersubstitutable in the first context , salva veritate , they are not in the second . 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Necessarily the first President of the United States was married to Martha Washington 60005 @qwx470005 <p> is presumably false while 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Necessarily the second husband of Martha Washington was married to Martha Washington 60005 @qwx470005 <p> is presumably true . <p> But Quine now reminds us that to attach necessarily to a statement is just to claim that the statement is analytic . That is , 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Necessarily bachelors are unmarried 60005 @qwx470005 <p> is best understood as 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Bachelors are unmarried is analytic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . We can explicate analyticity in terms of synonymy , synonymy in terms of intersubstitutivity salve veritate , including in contexts governed by necessarily , and such necessity in terms of analyticity . <p> Quine next turns his attention to his second target , verificationism . Historically , discussions of " Two Dogmas " have largely ignored the second dogma , perhaps because many defenders of the analytic/synthetic distinction have no sympathy for verificationism . And indeed at first it seems odd that Quine would see these two positions as paired or related dogmas . On reflection one might conclude that having rejected the analytic/synthetic distinction , Quine had no choice but to also reject verificationism , precisely because he does not want to abandon the meaningfulness of logic and mathematics . If the only criterion of meaningfulness is verification by sensory experience , then mathematics and logic appear to be meaningless , for there are no sensory experiences that can be taken to confirm or disconfirm the alleged truths of mathematics and logic . The view of logic and mathematics as consisting of important nonsense is one A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of verificationism in Language , Truth , and Logic ( Ayer 1959 ) . Being unwilling to follow Ayer , one might conclude that Quine has no choice but to reject verificationism as a theory of meaning . <p> But we suggest that this is not the motivation for Quines rejection of verificationism . Quine does not take the truths of mathematics and logic to be unverified by the standards of verificationism . He notes that " as long as it is taken to be significant in general to speak of the confirmation and infirmation of a statement , it seems significant to speak also of a limiting kind of statement which is vacuously confirmed , ipso facto , come what may ; and such a statement is analytic " ( 41 ) . That is , Quine grants that " the truth of statements does obviously depend both upon language and upon extralinguistic fact " ( 41 ) . If we allow sentences to be candidates for truth and falsity taken one-by-one , it follows that we can explicate analytic sentences as the limiting case , those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " i.e. , where the role of extralinguistic fact is nil . Given verificationism , the truths of logic and mathematics and perhaps all commonly termed analytic statements are vacuously verifiedverified " come what may " by way of experience . Hence were verificationism to stand , it would itself constitute a basis for an explication ( and thus reinstitution ) of the analytic/synthetic distinction , analytic statements being those that are verified come what may . So if the analytic/synthetic distinction is to be banished as an unsupportable dogma , so must verificationism . In fact , Quine asserts not just that the analytic/synthetic distinction is a consequence of verificationism , but also that " the two dogmas are , indeed , at root identical " ( 41 ) . We return to this issue below . <p> Quine holds verificationism to be closely connected with , if not equivalent to , radical reductionismthe view that " every meaningful statement is . . . translatable into a statement ( true or false ) about immediate experience " ( 38 ) . Quines argument against verificationism and radical reductionism takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable reinterpretation . " Radical reductionism , he notes , goes back at least to Locke and Hume , who " held that every idea must either originate directly in sense experience or else be compounded of ideas thus originating " ( 38 ) . Quine credits Tooke with improving on this idea by moving the focus from ideas to terms , allowing the doctrine to be rephrased " in semantical terms , by saying that a term , to be significant at all , must be either a name of a sense datum or a compound of such names or an abbreviation of such a compound " ( 38 ) . But such a doctrine , Quine maintains , is " unnecessarily and intolerably restrictive in the term-by-term critique which it imposes . More reasonably , and without yet exceeding the limits of what I have called radical reductionism , we may take full statements as our significant unitsthus demanding that our statements as wholes be translatable into sense-datum language , but not that they be translatable term by term " ( 3839 ) . <p> Devising a scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnaps Aufbau ( Carnap 1928 ) . Although Quine finds Carnaps attempt impressive , especially the constructions utilizing " the whole language of pure mathematics " ( 39 ) , he believes the whole project is ultimately doomed to failure . This is because Carnap " provides no indication , not even the sketchiest , of how a statement of the form Quality q is at x ; y ; z ; ta point instant could ever be translated into Carnaps initial language of sense data and logic . The connective is at remains an added undefined connective ; the canons counsel us in its use but not in its elimination " ( 40 ) . Carnap abandoned his radical reductionism project subsequently to publishing the Aufbau . In " Two Dogmas , " Quine does not produce and criticize the arguments of those who continued to hold this view . Rather , he makes a " counter suggestion " a charitable reinterpretation of the verificationism and radical reductionism of the Aufbaunamely , that " our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This counter suggestion is , of course , holismone of two key doctrines Quine was to spend the rest of his career elucidating and defending ( the other being the explication of how experience does constrain theoriesthat is , of how we can have holism and empiricism ) . <p> The arguments that Quine gives against the analytic/synthetic distinction , the " closed curve in space " we have explored , are not decisive arguments . His strategy is rather to put the onus on those who want to rehabilitate the analytic/synthetic distinction . His challenge is this : If the analytic/synthetic distinction is to be maintained , then either the notion of meaning must be resuscitated and clearly enough explicated so as to provide grounds for deciding whether the " meaning " of one term is or is not included within that of another term ( Kants original notion ) ; or the notion of cognitive synonymy must be explicated , without appealing to analyticity ; or the notion of substitutivity salva veritate must be explicated , without appealing to contexts that presuppose analyticity but are strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Two Dogmas " Quines critics have taken up this challenge , offering views of meaning or synonymy , or of modal operators such as necessarily , that purport to break the " closed curve in space . " Although we are of the view that none is successful , there is not consensus concerning this . <p> We have noted that Quines rejection of verificationism sparked far less discussion than did his rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction . Those who reject Quines holism do not generally do so in favor of some form of verificationism . Rather , they usually argue for or presuppose some version of a correspondence theory of truth , and a realism that grants to middle-sized physical objects , or molecules , or atoms and subatomic particles , or whatever , some status other than posits of our best going theories . That is , Quines discussion of verificationism occurs , as it were , within the family of empiricist views that grants a special status to experience or some refinement of it ( firings of sensory receptors ) ; within this family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holism exhaust the available options . <p> Finally , we return to Quines claim , generally neglected in the literature , that the " two dogmas are . . . at root identical . " If they are , then those who find verificationism implausible or unacceptable should take the same view toward the purported distinction between analytic and synthetic statements . Quines argument to the effect that if verificationism can be defended then so too can the analytic/synthetic distinction is reasonably clear and has already been reviewed . Is there an implicit argument in the other direction ? Perhaps . If there is an analytic/synthetic distinction , then it makes sense to distinguish the role of linguistic convention and the role of extralinguistic fact in determining the truth or falsity of a given statement . So if we are able to distinguish analytic statements from synthetic ones , it must be that we are able to identify the factors that determine their truth-values , the linguistic and nonlinguistic components , on a statement-by-statement basis . So for each synthetic statement we can identify the extralinguistic elements , the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then we are free to identify the meaning of the statement with those extralinguistic elements . And this is just what verificationism does . So , in this sense , verificationism does follow from the analytic/synthetic distinction , if one is prepared to identify meaning with the experiences relevant to a synthetic statements truth or falsity . Traditional empiricists were ready to do this ; but Quine , at least in this respect , is not a traditional empiricist . <p> We have noted that holism is Quines alternative to the analytic/synthetic distinction and verificationism . But there is in " Two Dogmas " no full-blown argument for holism , no lengthy explication of it , and no exploration of how it transforms empiricism . We next briefly outline our understandings of the relationships between the arguments so far summarized , Quines theses of holism and of the indeterminacy of translation , and his arguments for " naturalizing " the philosophy of science . Again , not everyone will agree with our analysis . <p> Although not argued for in " Two Dogmas , " the classic statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that article , entitled " Empiricism without the Dogmas. " 60006 @qwx470006 <p> The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs , from the most casual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic , is a man-made fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges . Or , to change the figure , total science is like a field of force whose boundary conditions are experience . ( 42 ) 60005 @qwx470005 <p> The first intertwined thesis of holism is that all of science ( here , broadly construed to include " the totality of our so-called knowledge " ) is our own construction , and that even the apparently most disparate parts are , in fact , interconnected. 60006 @qwx470006 <p> A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field . Truth values have to be redistributed over some of our statements . Redvaluation of some statements entails redvaluation of others , because of their logical interconnectionsthe logical laws being in turn simply certain further statements of the system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions , experience , that there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to redvaluate in the light of any single contrary experience . ( 43 ) 60005 @qwx470005 <p> The second intertwined thesis is that a recalcitrant experience can force an adjustment in the network of theories to which we are committed , to the totality of science . But such an experience can not force a change of commitment to any particular belief or component sentence of science . This is because 60006 @qwx470006 <p> No particular experiences are linked with any particular statements in the interior of the field , except indirectly through considerations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole . ( 43 ) 60006 @qwx470006 <p> And this is the overarching thesis of holism : Our theories of nature face experience as a collective body , not sentence by sentence , not even particular theory by particular theory . There is no one-to-one relationship between most sentences of this body and specific experiences . <p> We suggest that this overarching thesis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chunk of language has empirical meaning only if there are experiences that will confirm or disconfirm it . There are no such confirming or disconfirming experiences for most individual sentences . There are for sentences taken collectively , for bodies of theory , for our whole going theory of the world . So , for the most part , it is only sentences taken collectivelybodies of theory , or our whole going theory of the worldthat have empirical meaning . Empirical meaning or content is spread across the sentences that together can be tested against experience . <p> In subsequent years , Quine offered a number of arguments for holism , and it emerged as a substantial doctrine ( e.g. , Quine 1960 , 1966b , 1981a ) . Holism argues for the tentativeness of all theories and beliefs , from the most theoretical of the theoretical sciences to the most down-to-earth , common-sense theories and beliefs . In our view , but there are contributors who disagree , if holism holds , correspondence theories of truth go by the board and , with them , any possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the plausibility of " meta-level " theories of truth and for truth as immanent , a la Tarski . If there is a future for empiricism , it is as a theory of evidence : a theory about how the evidence provided by sensory receptors serves as the basis for warranted beliefs , and of how language contributes to " meaning , " but not in a way that can be isolated on a sentence-by-sentence basis . <p> If holism holds , foundationalism also goes by the board ; there are no Archimedean standpoints . We work , to paraphrase Quine , as scientists , laypersons , and philosophers , from withinfrom our vantage points within an evolving body of theory that we inherit and seek to improve , on the basis of phenomenological experiences significantly shaped by this very same body of theory . Working from within this theory , we indeed take the claims we find to be warranted to be true . But truth is immanent and the firmest of warrants is provisional ( see , e.g. , Quine 1981a ) . <p> Finally , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation follows . As we outline below , its consequences are profound . As Joseph Rouse puts this point , Quines thesis fundamentally challenges the " transparency and stability of meaning and experience " and , in this general respect , parallels challenges offered by feminist theorists Donna Haraway , Karen Barad , Judith Butler , and others ( Rouse , personal communication ) . <p> In works as early as Word and Object ( 1960 ) and as late as The Pursuit of Truth ( 1990a ) , Quine explores the implications of holism for empiricism , i.e. , for the relationship between experiences and theories . Noting years later that the notion of " experience " in " Two Dogmas " " still awaited a theory " ( 1981b ) , he subsequently worked to develop a physicalist notion of experience ( e.g. , as " the firings of sensory receptors " or " the triggerings of exteroceptors " ) , and he drew on anatomy , physiology , and empirical psychology to do so . This , we suggest , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the relationship between , on the one hand , this nonlinguistic and nonphenomenological notion of experience and , on the other hand , obviously linguistic objects such as theories and hypotheses . In these efforts , Quine makes use of a stimulus-response account of language acquisition to carve out a notion of an observation sentence , and ultimately that of observational categoricals , to argue that it is sentences of this kind that provide the link or bridge between the theoretical sentences of science , common-sense , and philosophy on the one hand , and experience construed in physicalist terms , on the other . Here we can only sketch this project , but the essays in this volume by Addelson , Antony , Duran , Linker , and Roth all address , to some extent , Quines " theory of mind " and/or " theory of language . " <p> In Quines account of language acquisitionboth in the case of a child learning its first language and the field linguist attempting to construct a translation manual for a language entirely foreign to her ( which Quine calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pivotal . Such sentences include literally one-word sentences ( i.e. , sentences that can not function as part of a longer sentenceQuines example is ouch ) , terms like red that can function as a complete sentence , and multi-word sentences when construed holophrastically , i.e. , as one-word sentences . Quines contention is that , in both cases of language learning , one-word sentences ( either literally one-word or multi-word understood holophrastically ) are the first learned and initially keyed directly to sensory stimulation ( experience physicalistically construed as , say , the firings of sensory receptors ) . There is , at this stage , no individuation or reference . Thus , for the infant , mama is a feature-summoning or noting device on a par with water ( Quine 1969b , 7 ) . For the linguist undertaking radical translation ( i.e. , translating a wholly foreign language ) , the question of whether Gavagai ? , which is typically assented to in the presence of observable rabbit-like phenomena , is really Ga va gai ? is deferred ( Quine 1960 , 3552 ) . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation , translating Gavagai as rabbit , sensory stimulations do not warrant this ; they only warrant a link with specific sensory stimulations equally compatible with Gavagai signaling a rabbit-event or an instantiation of Rabbithood . ) <p> Eventually , Quine suggests , the infant will catch on to the mechanics of individuation of her language community and learn to understand these initial sentences as incorporating reference and individuation . The linguist will solve the problem of how to translate the foreign language by importing her own conceptual scheme ( Quine 1960 , 1969c ) . And although beyond the scope of this discussion , we note that Quine famously or infamously maintains that " there is no fact of the matter " in terms of what the terms of our own language or those of a language we are attempting to translate refer to . In the case of our own language , we simply take our home language " at face value " ( here again holism is at work ) . In the case of radical translation , we impose the same home language taken at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference itself , given Quines thesis of the inscrutability ( or indeterminacy ) of reference , has withered away . <p> Quine uses the ability for a multi-word sentence to be construed holophrastically and linked directly to the firings of ones sensory receptors in response to specific stimuli , and the ability of the same sentence to be made up of multi-words and incorporating reference , to carve out notions of observation sentences and observation categoricals ( Quine 1990a ; cf. Quine 1981a ) . The dual nature of these sentences , Quine maintainsthat when construed holophrastically they are directly linked to sensory experience , and when not , contain theoretical terms that reappear in theory formulationsprovides the link empiricists traditionally sought between a respectable notion of experience and the sentences of theories . It remains a matter of considerable debate , including among contributors to this volume , whether what we elsewhere call Quines effort to " reconstitute empiricism " to reconstitute the relationship between experience and theories in light of holismis successful ( Nelson and Nelson 2000 ) . <p> We now turn to the relationships between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of translation . We begin by noting that it is distinguished from the weaker thesis of the inscrutability of reference just discussed . Both theses are elusive , but we believe the following is a defensible interpretation of the thesis of indeterminacy of translation . <p> According to this thesis , it is possible to construct alternative translation manuals for translating one language into another , for example , Japanese into English , such that for any fairly extended passage of the language being translated , the manuals will yield different translationsdifferent to the point that , in multiple instances , a sentence of the language being translated will go over into a true sentence of English in one scheme and a false sentence of English in the other scheme . Overall the translation manuals will be deemed equally acceptable , for they make , on the whole , equally good sense of the behavior , linguistic and otherwise , of the speakers of the language being translated . The difference between weak indeterminacy and strong is that in the former , but not the latter , truth is preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis come from and what is the evidence for it ? We elsewhere suggest that Quine takes the thesis to be , though strong and important , also obvious . It is an obvious consequence of his notion of empirical contentof his willingness , indeed eagerness , to identify empirical meaning or content , in the only clear sense he can give to this notion , with experience itself understood as the firings of sensory receptors , and with most individual sentences not enjoying , on their own , empirical content so understood . Put another way , Quine accepts the verification theory of meaning , but maintains that the relationship with experience is , in the case of most sentences , spread across the network of theories ( this , again , is the thesis of holism ) . Strong indeterminacy of translation follows ( Nelson and Nelson 2000 ) . <p> Again , our recapitulation of Quines argument is not uncontroversial . But we draw attention to Quines remarks in response to Roger Gibson in The Philosophy of W. V. Quine : 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Gibson cites Fllesdals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the verification theory of meaning . Fllesdal mistrusts this defense because of doubts about verificationism , and I gather that Gibson agrees . But I find it attractive . The statement of verificationism relevant to this purpose is that " evidence for the truth of a sentence is identical with the meaning of the sentence " ; and I submit that if sentences in general had meanings , their meanings would be just that . It is only holism itself that tells us that in general they do not have them . ( Quine 1987 , 15556 ) 60005 @qwx470005 <p> Holism precludes the assigning of meaning to individual sentences other than observation sentences and observation categoricals . As a result , translation is obviously indeterminate , for there will be multiple ways of translating sentences other than these special casesand all of them will yield equally plausible though nonequivalent bodies of theory to be attributed to the native speakers of the language in question . <p> Why is the strong indeterminacy of translation thesis controversial and troubling ? Suppose two field linguists have been studying a new language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed two nonequivalent manuals of translation . Suppose also that the population whose language this is has theories of genetics , the sophistication of which are on a par with ours . Suppose that the nonequivalent translation manuals that these linguists have developed yield nonequivalent translations of these theories of genetics . Suppose also that the two field linguists ( and their research teams , who have all gone bilingual ) assure us that the genetic theories in question seems as good as oursas sophisticated , as predictive of future experience , and as well integrated into the broader science of this population as our genetics is into our science . <p> If Quine is right , the alternative translations of this theory of genetics will constitute , in English , two different and inconsistent theories of genetics . The linguists will grant that both can not be accurate translations of the theories in question . We will see that both can not be true . And the population being studied , who we may presume have had their field linguists studying us , will produce multiple translation manuals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these manuals may well be equally acceptable . And there is no fact of the matter concerning which manual is correct . <p> Finally , we might as well picture ourselves as becoming field linguists studying ourselves , and developing alternative translation manuals for English to English while being bound only by the requirement of preserving stimulus meaning and the canons of holism . We will develop distinct manuals of English to English translation , and they will attribute to us distinct , nonequivalent , theories . This is the strong indeterminacy of translation brought home ( see , e.g. , Quine 1990a , 50 ) . <p> Thus , the only apparent way of resolving the indeterminacy , by accepting one translation manual and rejecting all alternatives , has more arbitrariness about it than does accepting ones native tongue at face value , or so it seems . Strong indeterminacy holds that we could revise any significantly sized body of theory , throwing out some sentences and compensating for those by adding others , and end up with a theory that , on holistic grounds , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this thesis for notions of " meanings " and realism are profound , and both the thesis and its implications seem to us worthy of more exploration in feminist theory . As we outline below , the thesis also constitutes part of Quines argument for naturalizing the philosophy of science . Before turning to these arguments , we summarize Quines underdetermination thesis . <p> We have noted that feminists appealed to Quines underdetermination thesis in the 1980s in their efforts to explain the issues raised in and by feminist science critiques . Some contributors to this volume do so as well . Although many , including Quine , view the thesis as relatively straightforward ( whether they accept it or not ) and distinct from the strong indeterminacy thesis just discussed ( see , e.g. , Quine 1990b ) , we are no longer sure . Accordingly , we simply outline the grounds for the thesis as Quine explicates them . <p> Quine takes theories to be underdetermined in at least three ways in addition to , or as elaborations of , general Humean underdetermination . Sensory experience underdetermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and atomic and subatomic , in the sense that there may be ( and presumably are ) alternative posits that would connect past sensory experience with future sensory experience equally well . This is true , but esoteric . Given our actual scientific heritage we are unlikely to abandon our ontology of physical objects for one of events or numbers or whatever else . Second , even given our choice of physical objects as the primary constituents of the bridge science affords between past sense experiences and future sense experiences , the details of the bridge are underdetermined by experience . We can redistribute truth-values at will ( perversely ) , or in response to a recalcitrant experience , while retaining our overall commitment , more or less , to the familiar physical objects and to the bulk of the sentences of our present theories . Finally , Quines reconstructed notion of sense experience , be it as the firings of sensory receptors or the triggerings of exteroceptors , is itself a theoretical construct derived from our best going theories , of anatomy , physiology , neurology , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , like all theories , underdetermined by available evidence ( in the above senses ) . So we could , and future discoveries may lead us to , alter it ; and thereby set the stage for a different science connecting , in different ways , our new versions of past sense experiences with our new versions of future sense experiences ( see , e.g. , Quine 1953 , 1960 , 1981c ; see also Roth , Chapter 7 this volume ) . <p> As we noted earlier , we suspect there is more to underdetermination ( specifically , more of a relationship with the strong thesis of indeterminacy ) , but what we have said is perhaps sufficient background for the essays included here . We conclude this section by relating the arguments so far summarized to those Quine offers for naturalizing the philosophy of science . <p> Quines suggestion that traditional philosophy of science be abandoned in favor of self-conscious science , for a " reciprocal containment of science and epistemology , " follows closely on the heels of his recognition that the project Carnap undertook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doubts as early as 1936 that sentences of logic and mathematics are true by definition ( Quine 1936 ) . Both figure in the arguments of " Epistemology Naturalized " ( Quine 1969a ) . In addition , Quines rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction makes the alleged nonempirical status of the philosophy of science or epistemology a nonstarter . <p> The opening pages of " Epistemology Naturalized " locate the sources of Quines arguments for naturalizing the philosophy of science in the failure in the first half of the twentieth century to fulfill Humes mandate of showing that every truth can be accounted for either on the grounds of meanings ( for logic and mathematics ) or on the grounds of sensory experience ( for empirical truths ) . Quines focus in this essay is , of course , the second project ; but he begins by discussing the first . This enables him to later draw parallels between the failure of the first project ( generally recognized by the time he published " Epistemology Naturalized " ) and the failure he sees as inevitable ( but not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore these opening pages ( but see Roth , Chapter 7 this volume ) . <p> Quine notes that there were two focuses in studies into the foundations of mathematics . " Conceptual studies " were to show that the concepts of mathematics can be defined in the terms of logic . " Doctrinal studies " were to show that mathematical truths can be derived from the " obvious or at least potentially obvious . . . truths of logic " ( 1969a , 70 ) . Obviously , the two projects are linked . If mathematical concepts are definable in the terms of logic , then the truths of mathematics are , in the end , truths of logic . If the latter are self evident , so are the former . <p> The project failed , on both the conceptual and doctrinal sides , Quine notes , because it turned out that mathematics does not reduce to " logic proper , " but only to set theory ( 70 ) . This was a deep disappointment for two reasons . " The end truths , the axioms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend them than do most of the mathematical theorems we would derive from them . Moreover , we know from Gdels work that no consistent axiom system can cover mathematics even when we renounce self-evidence " ( 70 ) . Thus , the reduction of mathematics to set theory does not " reveal the ground of mathematical knowledge , " does not " show how mathematical certainty is possible " ( 70 ) . <p> Against this background , Quine turns to efforts to identify the foundations of ( recognizably ) empirical science . Here , too , there is a conceptual project and a doctrinal project . The conceptual project , dating back to Hume , is to define sentences about physical bodies in terms of something directly linked to ( or identical with ) sensory experience . In this project , Quine sees progress . For Hume , bodies were to be identified with bundles of sense impressions , an approach Quine describes as " bold and simple . " The subsequent shift from impressions to sentences as the bearers of empirical meaning shifted the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sentences about bodies derive from , or reduce to , sentences about immediate sensory experience . <p> But again it turned out that set theory was needed . And , as in the study of the foundations of mathematics , set theory compromised the conceptual project . Comparing the recourse to set theory with that of recognizing sentences as the bearers of meaning , Quine notes that " the two resorts are very unequal in epistemological status . Contextual definition is unassailable . Sentences that have been given meaning as wholes are undeniably meaningful , and the use they make of their component terms is therefore meaningful , regardless of whether any translations are offered for those terms in isolation . . . . Recourse to sets , on the other hand , is a drastic ontological move , a retreat from the austere ontology of impressions " ( 73 ) . <p> Quines earlier discussion of studies into the foundations of mathematics is now brought to bear . The reason that recourse to set theory in studies of the foundations of empirical science was not generally recognized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the " deceptive hints of continuity between elementary logic and set theory " ( 73 ) . These hints led Russell to be willing to define the conceptual project as that of accounting " for the external world as a logical construct of sense data , " a project that Quine credits Carnaps Aufbau with coming " nearest to executing " ( 74 ) . Even if Carnaps project had been successful , it would not have aided the doctrinal project . To show that the sentences of science can be so reconstructed does not show that these sentences " can be proved from observation sentences by logic and set theory " ( 74 ) . " On the doctrinal side , " Quine notes , " I do not see that we are farther along today than where Hume left us " ( 72 ) . <p> Yet , Quine acknowledges , there were reasons to continue with the conceptual project , even in light of the failure of the doctrinal project and the retreat that recourse to set theory represented . One could still hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elicit " and " clarify " the sensory evidence for science , even if the steps between such evidence and scientific theories " fall short of certainty " ( 75 ) . The reconstruction would contribute to understandings of how " all inculcation of meanings of words must rest ultimately on sensory evidence , " for had Carnap or others succeeded , " the sensory content of discourse would stand forth explicitly " ( 75 ) . It was not even necessary for Carnap to be able to demonstrate that the construction he arrived at was " the right one . " " The question would have had no point . He was seeking what he called a rational reconstruction . Any construction of physicalistic discourse in terms of sense experience , logic , and set theory would have been as satisfactory if it made the physicalistic discourse come out right . If there is one way there are many , but any would be a great achievement " ( 75 ) . But , for reasons earlier considered , Carnap did not succeed and Quine proposed holism as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for Quines suggestion in " Epistemology Naturalized " that the conceptual project be abandoned altogether . " But why all this creative reconstruction , all this make-believe ? The stimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody has to go on , ultimately , in arriving at his picture of the world . Why not just see how this construction really proceeds ? Why not settle for psychology ? " ( 75 ) . The turn to psychology ( and Quine himself also appeals to linguistics and evolutionary theory in exploring questions traditionally of interest to the philosophy of science and epistemology ) does represent a " surrender of the epistemological burden " to science ; but this is appropriate given the abandonment of the doctrinal project . 60006 @qwx470006 <p> If the epistemologists goal is validation of the grounds of empirical science , he defeats his purpose by using empirical science in the validation . However , such scruples against circularity have little point once we have stopped dreaming of deducing science from observations . If we are out simply to understand the link between observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available information , including that provided by the very science whose link with observation we are seeking to understand . ( 7576 ) 60005 @qwx470005 <p> Suppose , however , that we lower our sights on the conceptual side , seeking only to show that sentences of science can be translated into sentences involving sense data , logic , and set theory . If possible , such a translation would further the Humean project by demonstrating " the essential innocence of physical concepts , " showing them to be " theoretically superfluous . " In so doing , " it would legitimize themto whatever degree the concepts of set theory , logic , and observations are themselves legitimate " by demonstrating that " everything done with the one apparatus could in principle be done with the other " ( 76 ) . The project might also retain a role for philosophy . " If psychology itself could deliver a truly translational reduction of this kind , we should welcome it ; but certainly it can not , for certainly we did not grow up learning definitions of physicalistic language in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and observation " ( 76 ) . The problem , Quine notes , is that Carnaps project did not succeed even in terms oftranslation . The point at which it becomes clear that Carnaps translation will not succeed , Quine argues , " comes where Carnap is explaining how to assign sense qualities in physical space and time " ( 76 ) . In " Two Dogmas , " as we have seen , Quine argues that Carnap is unable to show how to translate a " statement of the form Quality q is at x ; y ; z ; t a point instant . . . into his initial language of sense data and logic " ( 40 ) . Thus , Carnap is forced in subsequent writings to settle for " reduction forms , " something far less than straightforward translation . <p> This is a far cry from the outcome that translation " of the sterner kind " would have generated . To give up the project of defining , via translation , physical concepts in terms of observation , logic , and set theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we supposed rational reconstruction to have over straight psychology : namely , the advantage of translational reduction " ( 78 ) . <p> As he did in " Two Dogmas , " Quine suggests in " Epistemology Naturalized " that the source of the failure of the various projects just summarized is that most sentences do not have their own empirical meaning . The problem is not that " the experiential implications of a typical statement about bodies are too complex for finite axiomatization , however lengthy , but that the typical statement about bodies has no fund of experiential implications it can call its own " ( 79 ) . Thus , if we persist in translation projects , we will need to focus on the " significantly inclusive portion " of a theory that has empirical meaning , axiomatizing " all the experiential difference that the truth of the theory would make " ( 79 ) . This , Quine suggests , would be a " queer translation " because it would involve translating " the whole but none of its parts " and , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have , in the end , might better be termed the " observational evidence for theories , " their empirical meaning ( 7980 ) . <p> But we would do still better togive up translation projects altogether . This is because the indeterminacy of translation plagues " even ordinary unphilosophical translation , such as from English into . . . Chinese . " Here , Quine repeats the argument earlier outlined , that " we can justify the translation of sentences of English into Chinese or Japanese only together as a body " that there will be translations that will preserve the empirical implications of the theory we are translating ( the observation sentences and observation categoricals it implies ) , and thus , there will be no grounds for saying one is correct . That is , if holism holds , indeterminacy of translation follows for everything but observation sentences and their kin . " If we recognize with Peirce that the meaning of a sentence turns purely on what would count as evidence for its truth , and if we recognize with Duhem that theoretical sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger blocks of theory , then the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sentences follows . And most sentences , apart from observation sentences , are theoretical " ( 81 ) . <p> In the end , then , holism and the indeterminacy of translation that it yields dictate the abandonment of the various conceptual projects to identify a foundation for science in sense data . In contrast to those who see " the irreducibility " involved as " the bankruptcy of epistemology , " Quine suggests , " it may be more useful to say rather that epistemology still goes on , though in a new setting and a clarified status . " Epistemology , " or something like it , simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science " ( 82 ) . <p> A question much debated since the publication of " Epistemology Naturalized " is whether the philosophy of science as Quine envisions it does or could carry normative import or force . As the summary of individual chapters to which we next turn indicates , there are deep disagreements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly among those who are skeptical about Quinean naturalism , in terms of its answer . We would only briefly note that Quines work subsequent to " Epistemology Naturalized " does suggest a normative role for naturalized philosophy of science , albeit not of the sort or to the degree that critics of his vision of naturalism believe are possible and necessary . <p> For example , the topics of Quines " Natural Kinds " are two hallmarks of human reasoning " our sorting of things into kinds " and inductionthe relationship between things , and what explains them ( Quine 1969d ) . Each , Quine argues , is a problem . On the one hand , it is an implication of research in psychology and linguistics that there is " nothing more basic to thought and language than our sense of similarity , our sorting of things into kinds " ( 160 ) . Sorting by resemblancein terms both " of a resemblance between the present circumstances and past circumstances " in which a word is used , and in terms of phonetic resemblanceis necessary to language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects " ( 11617 ) . On the other hand , " the notion of similarity or kind , " so basic to human thinking and induction , " is alien to logic and set theory " ( 121 ) and " characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status " ( 123 ) . Moreover , " the relation between similarity and kind is less clear and neat than could be wished " ( 121 ) . <p> Having spent considerable time in the essay to establish these several points , Quines question is this : " For me . . . the problem of induction is a problem about the world ; a problem of how we , as we now are ( by our present scientific lights ) , in a world we never made , should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right , when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate , scientifically unjustified similarity standard " ( 127 ) . In brief , the answer Quine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain inductive reasoning and sorting by kind ; both might be adaptations . At the same time , Quine argues , it is also a result of science that the first is fallible and the second is indefensible ( i.e. , undermined by our most serious theories ) . In the end , then , what makes natural selection " perhaps enough of an explanation " is that it can explain inductions " conspicuous failures " ( 127 ) . Sorting by color seems endemic to the species and explicable in terms of its survival value ( for example , it is useful for food-gathering ) . At the same time , our most serious theories of nature suggest that colors do " not qualify as kinds " and that the " distinctions that matter for basic physical theory are mostly independent of color contrasts " ( 127 ) . <p> This sets the stage for the second part of Quines answer to the question he has posed . Quine maintains that science both reveals innate similarity space and dispositions to induction , and possibly explains them using natural selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and success , of the sort Quine here engages in , suggest that " things about our innate similarity sense that are helpful in one sphere e.g. , color to food gathering can be a hindrance in the other the search by science for more significant regularities " ( 128 ) . As a result , Quine suggests that 60006 @qwx470006 <p> Evidently natural selection has dealt with the conflict by endowing man doubly : with both a color-slanted quality space and the ingenuity to rise above it . <p> He has risen above it by developing modified systems of kinds , hence modified similarity standards for scientific purposes . By the trial-and-error process of theorizing he has regrouped things into new kinds which prove to lend themselves to many inductions better than the old . ( 128 ) 60005 @qwx470005 <p> This suggests that naturalized epistemology as Quine engages in it is an explanatory and a normative enterprise . " The career of the similarity notion , " Quine maintains , " is a paradigm of the evolution of unreason into science " ( 138 ) . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientific theorizing . It draws on knowledge provided by the sciences and simultaneously assesses scientific theorizing on the basis of that very same knowledge . And this , we suggest , is holism at work and naturalism illustrated . <p> &lt;1&gt; II . Feminist Interpretations of Quine <p> We noted at the outset of this introduction that analyses in the 1980s of Quines positions offered by Linda Martfn Alcoff , Helen E. Longino , and Elizabeth Potter constituted important contributions to feminist philosophy of science and epistemology . <p> The essays by Lynn Hankinson Nelson and Louise Antony ( Chapters 2 and 3 ) , published respectively in 1990 and 1994 , were among the first to undertake more extensive explorations of Quines positions in light of feminist scholarship . Antony and Nelson are concerned to analyze the implications of Quines positions for feminist theorizing about science and vice versa . They are also concerned to defend the usefulness of Quines positions to feminist science studies against feminist critiques of empiricism and " modern epistemology " offered in the 1980s . <p> Representative critiques were offered in essays by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding and Merrill Hintikkas ground breaking collection , Discovering Reality ( 1983 ) ; in Hilary Roses " Hand , Brain , and Heart : A Feminist Epistemology for the Natural Sciences " ( Signs 9(1) , 1983 ) ; and in Alison Jaggars Feminist Politics and Human Nature ( 1983 ) . Common to these analyses are arguments to the conclusion that empiricism is an inherently flawed doctrinea doctrine that underwrites or propounds views of knowers , of evidence , and of science that are erroneous , that are incapable of accommodating the emergence and results of feminist science scholarship , and that function to insulate science from critical scrutiny . But , as earlier noted , Sandra Harding offered the most sustained and influential critique of empiricism in The Science Question in Feminism ( Harding 1986 ) . <p> Harding identified three general epistemological frameworks available to and drawn upon by feminist scientists and science scholars : feminist empiricism , feminist standpoint theory , and feminist postmodernism . Describing each framework as a hybrid that combined or attempted to combine feminists questions , concerns , and findings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nonfeminist tradition , on the other , Harding explored how their advocates found themselves having to wrestle with a " parent " tradition not designed to accommodate or explain the issues emerging in feminist science critiques and scholarship . <p> Harding insisted on the contingency of her analysis , maintaining that each framework is unstable and would evolve in response to its own internal tensions , developments in the other two frameworks , and future developments in feminist science studies ( cf. Harding 1994 ; Rooney , Chapter 5 this volume ) . She also maintained that each is best thought of as a " tool , " useful or not depending on the specific domain being engaged . For example , Harding viewed feminist empiricism as the most useful tool when feminists were attempting to engage scientiststhis because , in her account , feminist empiricism does not challenge traditional empiricist norms ( 25 ; but see Campbell , Chapter 9 this volume ) . Notwithstanding these qualifications , it is an implication of Hardings arguments that feminist empiricism is the least promising of these approaches , if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems at issue were within empiricism itself . " Empiricist conceptions of scientific method , " she maintained , " create obstacles for and in feminist thinking about science " ( 36 ; italics in original ) . <p> In brief , Harding argued that the Marxist and postmodernist traditions in epistemology trace their roots to " emancipatory " projects . In contrast , she argued , empiricism is an inherently conservative tradition , committed to the view " that scientific method is sufficient to account for historical increases in the objectivity of the picture of the world that science presents , " and rules out any relevance of movements of social liberation in fostering advances in knowledge ( 2526 ) . Although Harding took Quines challenges to the analytic/synthetic distinction as an advance , she attributed several other " dogmas " to twentieth-century empiricists , including Quine , that would make it difficult to construct a viable explanation of the emergence of feminist science scholarship . Finally , Harding maintained that epistemologies are as much justificatory as they are explanatory , and that these same dogmas would preclude justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dogmas Harding attributed to empiricism include the distinction between the contexts of discovery and justification ( 25 ) ; the tenet that " the social identify of the inquirer is . . . irrelevant to the goodness of the results of research , " an assumption Harding linked to the context/discovery distinction as well as to the empiricist thesis that sensory evidence is the source and check point of knowledge ( 25 ) ; and the " sacred science dogma , " which Harding described as the principle that " human understanding is decreased rather than increased by attempting to account for the nature and structure of scientific activity in the ways science recommends accounting for all other social activity " ( 38 ) . <p> If feminist empiricism is necessarily committed to these dogmas , as Harding then assumed ( i.e. , if a framework not so committed is not empiricist ) , some significant problems immediately arise . As she noted , these dogmas would require feminist empiricists to assume that bias of any sort , and surely political bias , is inherently compromising . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feminist science critique , which are obviously motivated and informed by feminist politics ( i.e. , bias ) , and difficult to explain how or why feminist perspectives are more objective than those they criticize . In addition , feminist empiricists would need to assume that the problems feminists identified in scientific researchfor example , androcentrismrepresent failures on the part of scientists to adhere to empiricist norms and methods , not flaws in the norms or methods themselves . Hardings characterization of feminist empiricism reflects both assumptions : " Feminist empiricism argues that sexism and androcentrism are social biases correctable by stricter adherence to the existing methodological norms of scientific inquiry . . . and that the womens movement produces not only the opportunity for . . . an enlarged perspective but more women scientists , and they are more likely than men to notice androcentric bias " ( 25 , italics in original ) . We must note , Harding argued , the contradictions internal to such explanations . To explain feminist science studies on the basis of the womens movement or womens alleged abilities to more readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the social identity of the inquirer is irrelevant to the goodness of the results of research " ( 25 ) . Thus , Harding concluded , feminist empiricists will be unable to offer plausible explanations of the emergence and findings of feminist scholarshipor , if they do so , the explanations will " deeply subvert empiricism " by exposing the " empirical inadequacies in empiricist epistemologies " ( 2526 ) . <p> &lt;2&gt; Part I : Early Feminist Defenses of Quine <p> Although we later identify what we take to be very significant differences in the details and general conclusions of Antonys and Nelsons arguments , we begin by noting some parallels . Both argue that the characterizations of empiricism with which critics such as Harding were working in the 1980s are outdated , and use Quines positions to support this claim . Neither sees Quine as committed to the dogmas Harding attributes to empiricism ; rather , each maintains that Quine fundamentally and successfully challenged these dogmas . Both offer arguments ( but quite different ones ) that Quinean naturalism and holism are compatible with and promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antony and Nelson take Quine to be everywhere right . Each criticizes aspects of his work , albeit different aspects of it . <p> In " Who Knows : From Quine to Feminist Empiricism " ( Chapter 1 ) , Nelson frames her discussion of the implications of Quinean positions and feminist science studies for one another in terms of issues she takes to be central to Hardings critique of empiricism and to those other feminists offered . In one line of argument , she seeks to distinguish empiricism as a theory of evidence from empiricist theories of science built from this theory , such as those developed in logical positivism and postlogical positivism . In a second , Nelson argues that several of Quines positions represent significant advances over positions maintained not only by the Carnap/Hempel/Nagel tradition but also by Kuhn , and that there are important parallels between Quines positions and those suggested by the emergence and findings of feminist science studies . In particular , Nelson maintains , Quinean holism and naturalism call for empirically based studies of science and for explanations commensurate with actual scientific practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in feminist science studies indicates are needed . Nelson also maintains that naturalism and holism constitute viable and promising alternatives to two assumptions implicit in Hardings characterization of empiricism and feminist empiricism : that there is a need for a philosophy of science that can justify feminist claims , and that there is an epistemological chasm between feminists and their nonfeminist colleagues that can not be bridged by evidence . <p> Among those of Quines positions on which Nelson focuses are his arguments concerning the relationships between metaphysics and science , so-called common sense and science , and science and the philosophy of science ( or epistemology ) . Each , she argues , can serve as an important resource for feminists ; at the same time , each needs to be expanded or revised in light of the emergence and results of feminist science studies . For example , Nelson takes Quines arguments that scientific theorizing and theories are interdependent with those of common sense to represent an important advance over views that portray science as uninformed by common-sense beliefs ( but see J. Nelson , Chapter 8 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can serve as a model of evidential relationships that might explain the presence of androcentrism in scientific research , and the ability of feminist scientists to recognize it . In her view , holism also makes an unbridgeable chasm between feminists and nonfeminists implausible ; there are many theories about which these groups will agree and these can be appealed to in attempting to adjudicate their differences . <p> But Nelson also maintains that Quines account of " common-sense theory " is ahistoric and artificially limited , virtually exhausted as it is by what Quine calls " physical object theory . " One obvious implication of feminist science scholarship , she argues , is that many kinds of " common-sense " beliefs inform scientific research ; another is that so-called common-sense beliefs are no less dynamic than scientific hypotheses and theories . In a related line of argument , Nelson argues that the boundary Quine maintains between good science and ( nonepistemic ) values is no more real than the other traditional boundaries he challenges . <p> In her conclusion , Nelson supports Quines argument for naturalizing the philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . Responding to Hardings arguments , she maintains that although Quinean naturalism is not justificatory , it is normative ; it represents the abandonment of the traditional project to justify sciencean abandonment she takes Quine to show is unavoidable ( see also Roth , Chapter 7 ) . But Nelson also argues that the individualism implicit in Quines vision of naturalized epistemology is in fact undermined by his arguments against foundationalism and for holism . She maintains that these arguments , and research in developmental psychology , indicate that genuinely naturalizing epistemology requires abandoning individualism and taking communities or groups as the primary epistemic agents . She seeks to develop this project for the philosophy of science in " Feminist Naturalized Philosophy of Science " ( Chapter 11 ) . <p> At the outset of " Quine as Feminist : The Radical Import of Naturalized Epistemology " ( Chapter 2 ) , Louise Antony notes that she finds it " both unfortunate and ironic " that feminists interested in the philosophy of science and epistemology have " uniformly neglected " Quines work and , for this and other reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feminist science studies . In her larger discussion , Antony offers several arguments for why feminists should draw on the resources of analytic epistemology , and seeks to illuminate what she takes to be " confusions " and " distortions " in feminist critiques of analytic epistemology . In particular , Antony maintains that contemporary naturalized epistemologyboth as it conforms to what Quine envisioned and as it has moved beyond problematic aspects of Quines workprovides the necessary and sufficient resources for justifying feminist claims . <p> Antony uses the question " How is bias properly conceptualized ? , " which figured prominently in Hardings analysis of feminist epistemologies , to frame these arguments . The question is a pressing one for feminists , Antony maintains , because exposing androcentric assumptions and other forms of bias is a central goal of feminist science scholarshipat the same time that feminists express skepticism about the possibility or desirability of impartial perspectives . Antony notes that , taken together , these features of feminist theorizing about science raise an important question : " Put baldly , if we do n't  think its good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mens being partial ? " <p> Whether impartiality is possible , Antony argues , is an empirical question , an answer to which will need to rely on evidence supplied by empirical psychology and the cognitive sciences . But what can be said of analytic epistemology subsequent to the turn to naturalism is that work undertaken in it demonstrates that partiality or bias ( of at least some sorts ) conveys an " epistemicadvantage . " Citing Quine , Nelson Goodman , Hempel , Hilary Putnam , and Richard Boyd , Antony maintains that not only have they and others demonstrated that bias can not be eliminated , they also demonstrate the " positive value of certain forms of it . " And although Antony argues that the vindication of rationalism demonstrates the failings of Quines behaviorism and his " theory of mind , " she sees Quines general argument for naturalism as important . It was the turn to naturalism , she contends , that allowed for questions within analytic epistemology concerning the plausibility of value-neutrality , and led to the view that such neutrality is " not sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn demonstrate that naturalized epistemology authorizes precisely the kind of critical assessment of epistemic norms that feminists call for . <p> This is not to say , Antony maintains , that analytic epistemology has answered all the questions that a proper conceptualization of bias needs to address . Epistemologists , including feminists , still need to address the question " How do we tell the good bias from the bad bias ? " According to Antony , this project further illuminates the costs feminists incur when they reject analytic epistemology . For , she argues , we can not expect an answer to this question to be provided solely through the empirical investigations into the processes through which knowledge is generated that feminists advocate . The question calls for a normative answer , and any such answer is impossible for an approach " that eschews the notion of truthfor any theory that tries to steer some kind of middle course between absolutism and relativism . " Antony describes feminist standpoint theories and postmodernism as such approaches , and maintains that it is because the notion of truth remains central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition can maintain an " appropriately realist " conception of truth able to make sense of the distinction between " the world as we see it " and " the world as it is . " <p> Thus , realist conceptions of truth make it possible to identify bias that is conducive to truth-seeking as " good , " and bias that " impedes " truth seeking as " bad . " Feminists , Antony argues , must be willing to talk about truth and falsity when critiquing epistemic ideals or particular theories that are sexist , racist , or in some other respect wrongheaded . Finally , Antony argues that the notion of truth is appropriately brought to bear on epistemologiesthat what warrants acceptance of a feminist or any other epistemology is the belief that it is likely to be true . Here too , Antony maintains , naturalized epistemology has the advantage . It is likely to be able to " explain the facts " ( including the " central " fact of " the long-ignored experiences and wisdom of women " ) and thus likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory rather precipitously , particularly in light of her own arguments concerning the positive role of bias , we take her arguments concerning the recognition of the positive role of bias and other developments in analytic epistemology as making a strong case that more inclusive approaches in feminist theorizing about science and knowledgein which the resources of analytic epistemology are seriously considered and evaluatedcould contribute to feminist philosophy of science . <p> We earlier noted parallels between Antonys and Nelsons views concerning the relevance of Quines naturalism and holism to feminist theorizing about science . We next note what we take to be fairly fundamental differences in their positions . Perhaps the most obvious is that Nelson holds that there is work done and remaining to be done by the feminist of feminist philosophy of science and feminist epistemology , i.e. , that feminist science studies contribute unique insights into the nature of the sciences that have not in fact been embraced in analytic epistemology . In contrast , Antony sees the resources of analytic epistemology as not only important for feminist theorizing about science in the ways earlier outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no need for distinctively feminist theories of science or knowledge . In addition , and we suspect related to the next difference we discuss , Antony takes naturalized epistemology to be a theory ( and likely a true theory ) ; Nelson views naturalism as a methodological approach to which the notions of true or false do not apply . <p> There is another difference that is a good deal " thicker , " and we later suggest that it recurs in a number of essays in this volume . Antony argues that feminist philosophers neglect and misunderstandings of analytic epistemology , including Quinean naturalized epistemology , have resulted in the perception that there is a need for distinctively feminist epistemologies ( such as feminist standpoint theories ) and feminist interest in postmodernist approaches to science and knowledge . According to Antony , the resources of analytic epistemologyin particular its robust notions of truth and realismare necessary to the defense and justification of feminist claims about science . In contrast , Nelson does not view Quine as an analytic philosopher ( nor , arguably , did Quine , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We suggest that this disagreements is far more than a semantic quibble . <p> We noted in our summary of her chapter that Antony disavows Quines behaviorism and what she calls his " theory of mind . " We believe that it is these disavowals that enable her to both champion some of Quines positions and not accept the full implications of Quinean holism , including the indeterminacy of translation . If Quines arguments for these theses are successful ( and Antony does accept Quines arguments for holism , from which we , along with others , argue the strong thesis of indeterminacy follows ) , the notion of " meanings " as stable entities , the notion of " truth " as more than " immanent " ( more than a predicate of a metalanguage attributable to sentences of an object language , as Tarski defined it ) , and a version of " realism " as robust as that advocated by " scientific realism , " are nonstarters . Nelson assumes Quines arguments to these several conclusions are successful . Antony , so it seems , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carve out a middle ground between " absolutism and relativism " can succeed . Nelson takes Quine to have developed just such an approach ( as do a number of other contributors ) . Accordingly , their accounts of the resources Quines positions afford feminist theorizing are significantly different . <p> We bring together the essays by Maureen Linker , Lorraine Code , Phyllis Rooney , and Kathryn Pyne Addelson because each is , to a significant degree , critical of Quines vision of naturalized epistemology . In apparent contrast , the essays in Part III are generally supportive of the turn to naturalized philosophy of science that Quine envisions and maintain its usefulness , together with others of Quines positions , for feminist theorizing . <p> But the contrast between the two sections is not as neat or straightforward as our organization of these sections suggests . Briefly put , Code offers a constructive alternative version of naturalism , Rooney seeks to demonstrate that those who describe themselves as naturalized epistemologists are not in fact engaged in the kind of research Quine called for or they say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of naturalized philosophy of science so that it actually reflects the pragmatism she attributes to him . Linkers chapter , although also constructive , argues for a " feminist rationalized epistemology " as an alternative to naturalized epistemology . Conversely , although generally supportive of Quine , most essays in Part III seek to extend or revise one or more of Quines positions in light of feminist science studies . ( The exceptions are Roth , Chapter 7 and Duran , Chapter 10 . ) Thus , what divides most essays in the two sections is not whether naturalism itself is viable , but whether Quinean naturalism ( at least in its present form and as individual authors understand it ) is viable for feminist theorizing . <p> There are other themes common to the essays in Part II . One is that the philosophy of science and/or epistemology , and certainly feminist research in these fields , must enjoy a healthy autonomy from the sciences if they are to yield the kind of critical , and not simply affirmative , stance toward the sciences that is called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Another is that Quinean naturalism does not seek such autonomy and , at least as some authors understand it , may be incapable of it . <p> In " The Case for a Responsibly Rationalized Feminist Epistemology " ( Chapter 3 ) , Maureen Linker argues that aspects of Quinean naturalism make it straightforwardly unsuitable for feminist theorizing about knowledge and science . Linker maintains that naturalized epistemology and holism of the sort Quine advocated and L. H. Nelson supports in Chapter 1 fail to allow for even " minimally satisfying " conceptions of meaning and truthand certainly not conceptions able to underwrite the normative force of feminist claims . Linker advocates the development of a " rationalized feminist epistemology " as an alternative to naturalism on the grounds that it will allow for realist conceptions of meaning and truth sufficiently robust to justify the normative principles that motivate the empirical correctives feminists advocate . <p> Linkers main argumentsagainst the appropriateness of Quines positions for feminist epistemology and in support of a rationalized feminist epistemologyare connected in her analysis through her sustained critique of Quines arguments against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a core assumption of these arguments and of Quines thesis of the indeterminacy of translation is that substitution criteria define the identity criteria for meanings . This assumption , she argues , is unwarranted , here building from arguments offered by J. J. Katz and from research in linguistics . Linker also maintains that a realist theory of meanings along the lines that Katz advocatesa theory that posits a realm of mind-independent sentences , senses , and sense relationshas significant advantages over Quines denial of meanings . Among others , such a theory is able to explain data from linguistics that any viable theory of meaning must be able to explain and Quines account can not . These include the " infinite expressibility of the syntactic and semantic components of language , " " literal meaning , " and " the relationship of literal meaning to pragmatic meaning contexts . " Moreover , Linker argues , the mind-independent objects that figure in Katzs realist theory of meanings constitute an objective source of language use and an objective constraint on it . <p> Linker uses several arguments to explicate the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quines arguments against the analytic/synthetic distinction are unsuccessful , so too are his challenges to " a priori truth " and to a distinction between science and the philosophy of science/epistemology . Thus , both remain available to the would-be rationalist . Second , Linker maintains that " a priori truth " allows for the objectivity of values and normative claims , and yields far more robust criteria for the assessment of claims and theories than those to which Quinean holism would limit us ( coherence with sensory experience and with accepted theories ) . This is important , she maintains , because the " empirical correctives " feminists advocate in their analyses of science are notidentical with the moral and politicalcorrectives that motivate their empirical investigations and recommendations . And neither Quinean naturalism nor feminist naturalism of the sort L. H. Nelson advocates can provide the grounds on which these moral and political principles can be defended . The justification of principles of " reason and fairness " requires a correspondence theory of moral and logical truthsomething disallowed by naturalism but embraced by rationalism . Thus , a rationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend feminists normative claimse.g. , that " the exclusion and oppression of persons by institutions of knowledge and power is both morally wrong and at odds with the goal of truth production . " <p> Lorraine Code begins " What Is Natural about Epistemology Naturalized ? " ( Chapter 4 ) by drawing a distinction between , on the one hand , naturalistic approaches to processes and institutions that generate knowledge that is likely to produce " potentially transformative consequences " ( such as Foucaults ) and , on the other , " the North American version of naturalism " that traces its roots to Quines arguments . Code attributes three general features to Quinean naturalized epistemology that " thwart . . . its transformative possibilities . " These include its " veneration of physical science " and its assumption that science is the only knowledge-producing institution " worthy of analysis " ; its reliance on scientific psychology and cognitive science , which in turn precludes critical evaluation of these disciplines and " begs the question " concerning their epistemic status ; and its problematic representations of physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich possibilities " for " a well-conceived naturalism " ( i.e. , a naturalism that responds to postmodern , postcolonial , and postpatriarchal critiques ) , Quinean naturalism is not well conceived in these senses . The first sections of Codes chapter are devoted to a critique of naturalized epistemology as Quine proposed it . In the last section , she argues for an alternative version of naturalism , which she maintains is more in keeping with the results of feminist scholarship and avoids many of the problems she attributes to Quinean naturalism . <p> Code sees research undertaken by Hilary Kornblith and others who look to empirical psychology for knowledge about " humans as cognizers " as representing precisely the sort Quine envisioned , and maintains that it suffers from some significant problems . For one thing , she contends , the scientism that informs both psychology and naturalized epistemology excludes many kinds of knowledge and subjects . Folk psychology and " the practices and wisdoms of extra-scientific , nonmainstream , marginalized people " are denigrated by empirical psychologists and cognitive scientists , and thus by naturalized epistemologists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and science . <p> As importantly , Code argues , and contrary to the assumption of both psychologists and epistemologists , the subjects who figure in the observer-observed laboratory experiments to which naturalists appeal are not " natural objects " ; in effect , they have been " denatured . " Given an underlying assumption that human beings form a " natural kind , " given as well methodological commitments to " gloss over human differences and specificities , " the " new human subject " that is the focus of psychological research is as much the result as it isthe subject of such research . Its specificity , its historical and cultural " particularity , " are set aside , resulting in the creation of a decidedly artificial " human subject . " Moreover , Code maintains , " the rhetoric of the natural claims a proximity to the real that exercises a normative persuasion . " This rhetoric , which Code argues figures in both the scientific research in question and epistemology , would suggest that no " stipulating " is occurring . But Code identifies factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make choices concerning what counts as " human natural identity , " which expressions of it warrant empirical study , and so forth . Given scientism , Code argues , choices of the sort she details are unlikely to be reflected upon , let alone scrutinized , when psychologists and epistemologists assume that only scientific knowledge can provide " truly explanatory accounts " and when epistemology is taken to reduce to psychology . <p> Unlike many critics and advocates of Quinean naturalized epistemology , including some whose essays are included in this volume , Code does view this enterprise as normative . But she takes these dimensions to amplify the problems just noted . So practiced , Code argues , naturalized epistemology " will transform epistemologys justificatory strategies , " but not in critically reflective ways . <p> Code next turns to the positive project of her chapter , that of identifying a kind of naturalism that would " reclaim " its emancipatory promise . She recommends " a revisioned naturalism , " an epistemological approach the core assumptions of which are analogous with those that inform the discipline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued in this epistemology will be concerned to investigate the implications for humans as potential knowers of living in certain environments , and the potential for cognitive practices that will create environments " where people can live well . " <p> In " Feminist Epistemology and Naturalized Epistemology : An Uneasy Alliance " ( Chapter 5 ) , Phyllis Rooney introduces several distinctions to lay the groundwork for her argument that the alliance mentioned in her title is not only uneasy but should remain so . Rooney begins by drawing a distinction between what naturalist epistemologists do and what they say they ought to do . She argues that although naturalists are committed to making substantive use of scientific research in their theorizing about knowledge and science , they typically do not do so . Instead , it is the work of other philosophers , published in the main in philosophy journals , which is typically cited in naturalized epistemology . Nor , Rooney argues , is it common for naturalist epistemologists to engage with scientists , even those in empirical psychology and cognitive science on whose work they claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce a distinction between what she calls the " noun-sense " of epistemology and the " verb-sense . " According to this schema , those who subscribe to a noun-sense of epistemology take " a specific fixed theory of knowledge " as their goal and , in this and other ways , are committed to " final philosophizing " in the case of epistemology , to " some final conception of knowledge . " In contrast , those who subscribe to a " verb-sense " of epistemology are concerned with doing epistemology and are more likely to devote critical attention to " particular kinds of motivating concerns , questions , and methods " that shape the way they do epistemology , rather than taking a final theory as their goal . Rooney uses this distinction to argue for what she takes to be important differences between naturalized epistemology and feminist epistemology as they are currently practiced . Those engaged in the former , she maintains , typically engage in epistemology of the noun-sense . Feminist epistemologists , on the other hand , typically engage in what she describes as verb-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in naturalized epistemology that she takes to illustrate a commitment to a noun-sense of epistemology and other " non-naturalistic " features of work in the field . She cites assumptions of individualism , " that knowledge and knowing ( and hence epistemology ) are paradigmatically about having and acquiring beliefs , " that scientific knowledge and practices are paradigmatic examples of knowledge and knowledge-producing activities , and that psychology can provide an accurate account of how people " actually arrive at beliefs . " Rooney also argues that naturalized epistemology presupposes more " uniformity and generality " in scientific methods and practices than empirical investigations of scientific practice indicate is warranted . For the self-styled naturalist , Rooney contends , the problem with maintaining these assumptions is that they reflect philosophical preconceptions rather than empirical investigation . <p> In identifying what she takes to be differences between naturalized and feminist epistemologies , Rooneys analysis suggests that the approaches characterizing the latter are more naturalistic than those characterizing the former . Rooney argues that feminist epistemologists are more concerned with the nature and consequences of their practiceswhat she cites Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means " to do epistemology as a feminist " than arriving at some specific theory of science or knowledge . She maintains that feminists engage with practicing scientists ( something naturalists prescribe but rarely partake in ) , and assume a more critical stance toward scientific practice and theories , and philosophical theorizing about them , than do naturalists . Finally , Rooney maintains that feminists are typically more conversant and comfortable with the diversity and " messiness " of the knowledge-generating practices they study . Rooney takes these things to reflect feminists engagements with practicing scientists , their attention to sociological and historical analyses of science , and their familiarity with debates within and across scientific specialties . <p> Rooney uses an extended case study to provide concrete examples to support her arguments . She concludes that , rather than feminists drawing on naturalized epistemology as some contributors advocate , naturalist epistemologists should look to feminist epistemology and feminist philosophy of science for " inspiration . . . and guidance . " <p> At the outset of " Naturalizing Quine " ( Chapter 6 ) , Kathryn Pyne Addelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Janus-faced . " Addelson credits Quine with exposing a number of problems in the assumptions and commitments of logical empiricism . At the same time , she argues that Quine preserves important aspects of that tradition and offers new solutions to its problems , including the research tradition of naturalized epistemology as its intellectual heir . Addelsons chapter as a whole reflects her positive and negative appraisals of Quines work . She argues that the most significant and positive premise of Quines arguments in " Epistemology Naturalized " is that knowledge is a natural phenomenon to be studied like all such phenomena . She also maintains that Quine clings to some dogmas even as he challenges others , and that the dogmas he retains both shape and limit his naturalized epistemology . <p> Among the dogmas and assumptions Addelson attributes to Quine and questions in her chapter are " that knowledge of nature and reality is embodied in language " and particularly that knowledge of nature " is given in the discursive , representational use of language " ; that science is a network of sentences ; that science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship of the knower to the known " ; and the dualism , criticized by Donald Davidson , " of conceptual scheme and experience . " Addelsons analysis of these assumptions and dogmas is by no means limited to critique ; she works to extend Quines own positions about science and naturalized epistemology in light of the pragmatism that she also finds within his work and seeks to develop . <p> In another constructive project , Addelson seeks to demonstrate that there can be a philosophy such that its notions of science and knowledge do not assume that knowers are individuals , that knowing is observational rather than participating , or that nature is " an object of study " and she explores how such a philosophy might underwrite a naturalized epistemology that would enable scientists to understand their own practices in a more reflective way . Addelson offers several arguments to demonstrate the possibility and coherence of the philosophy she envisions and to explore its normative dimensions . <p> In her most extensive example , Addelson uses historian Wamba-dia-Wambas explication of the classic Kongo world picture ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues , we have an example of a coherent worldview and set of practices that does not posit or create " individuals " in the sense assumed in Western ( modern ) societies , epistemologies , and sciences . Addelson argues that this worldview helps to demonstrate that the individuals that figure in Western worldviews are themselves constructed beings whose " collective enactment " is culturally specific . Addelson also uses the Kongo world picture as an example of a " presentational " rather than " representational " view of language that in turn entails a view of translation that does not reduce the " enactment " of the world or meaning to discursive representation able to be translated or evaluated on the basis of notions of " truth " and " falsity . " Finally , she uses the Kongo cosmovision to " show people and their world as generated in collective action . " From this perspective , Addelson maintains , one can interpret Quines arguments concerning objects as " posits " and his talk of redistribution of truth values in " Two Dogmas " in far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " of collective activity in making a world not as a linguistic game . " <p> In her conclusion , Addelson builds from these arguments to use the notion of " sensitizing , " which figures in the tradition of symbolic interactionism in sociology , to discuss how Quines effort " to embody knowers as actors in making knowledge " might be developed in ways that would allow scientists to accommodate the philosophical insight that they are " producing the account of the relationships between knower and known . " <p> We take an important argument common to the essays of Part II to be that epistemology and the philosophy of science , ofanysort , are active and interventionist engagements with forms of knowing and knowledge-makingwhether those engaged in these enterprises recognize or embrace this and recognize responsibilities attendant to it . Seen this way , the philosophy of science and epistemology are inescapably normative , whether engaged in from philosophers armchairs ( in Rooneys sense of " noun-sense epistemology " ) , self-styled as " purely descriptive " ( as some naturalists see their efforts ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another common argument is that a philosophy of science or an epistemology worth undertaking and taking seriously will be , to a substantial degree , empirically focused on and grounded in empirical research . Each author maintains that a viable epistemology will make use of and critically engage at least research in those scientific disciplines that provide or claim to provide insights into knowledge-making . Taken together , the authors cite cognitive science , empirical psychology , cross-cultural studies , and linguistics among the sciences to be drawn on and/or to be critically engaged . <p> Yet there are differences in the implications the authors attribute to their analyses of the relationships between Quines positions and feminist theorizing within and about the sciences . Linker advocates a rationalized rather than a naturalized epistemology on the grounds that only the former can underwrite the normative force of feminists claims and projects . In contrast , Code and Addelson do not reject naturalism itself ; Code takes Quinean epistemology to be insufficiently " emancipatory " or " transformative , " and Addelson seeks to further develop it . And although Rooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remain " uneasy , " her central argument is that feminists engage in the kind of research and interaction with science that is called for and that naturalists say they " ought " to do but do n't  . This suggests that it is not the self-described project of naturalized epistemology that is problematic , but the failure by self-styled naturalists to execute it . In this argument , Rooney engages Codes arguments in Chapter 5 , exploring their common uneasiness over an alliance with naturalized epistemology but offering somewhat different reasons for it . <p> There are also parallels and contrasts between the essays of this section and those of the first . We have noted that Linker directly engages L. H. Nelsons arguments in Chapter 1 concerning the usefulness of holism and naturalism for feminists . She also engages Antonys arguments . Both Linker and Antony maintain that a realist conception of truth is necessary to underwrite the normative force of feminists claims , and both take rationalism to be necessary to any such conception . But Linker advocates rationalism as an alternative to naturalism , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistemology she argues for would seem to be informed by both . In contrast to the fallibilism Antony and Nelson attribute to Quine and to naturalized epistemology , Code and Rooney argue that aspects of Quinean naturalized epistemology are informed by scientism . Finally , Antony maintains that naturalized epistemology can provide " aid and comfort to feminists . " In contrast , and as earlier noted , it is an implication of Codes and Rooneys analyses that naturalist epistemologists would do well to look to feminist epistemology and philosophy of science for models of genuine naturalism . In terms of this issue , Rooney engages Antonys arguments directly , maintaining that an alliance between feminist and naturalized epistemologies should " take the direction of influence in the direction opposite to that which Antony submits . " <p> Finally , it seems to us that the essays by Code , Rooney , and Addelson raise the bar in terms of the criteria to be met by a genuinely naturalistic epistemology , and all four essays in this section raise the bar in terms of the criteria to be met by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays by Paul Roth , Jack Nelson , Richmond Campbell , Jane Duran , and Lynn Hankinson Nelson are in general supportive of Quines positions and see them as specifically relevant to feminist theorizing about science . But , as noted , there are also substantive disagreements among these contributors concerning the nature and implications of some of Quines positions , and most seek to extend or revise some of them . <p> The first chapter of this part , Paul Roths " Feminism and Naturalism : If Asked for Theories , Just Say No " ( Chapter 7 ) , most clearly connects the chapters of this section with those of the preceding section . Like other authors in Part III , Roth advocates Quinean naturalism and argues for its relevance to feminist approaches to science . But Roth is also in agreement with the general claim that Quines naturalized epistemology can not be used to the normative ends that some so-called naturalist and feminist philosophers of science try to use it . As he indicates in his introduction , Roths central argument is that Quines arguments in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death knell of philosophical theories of sciencethan self-described naturalists in mainstream and feminist philosophy of science have come to terms with or embraced in their approaches to studying science . <p> In the first section of his chapter , Roth lays out what he takes to be the salient features of " philosophical theories , " features he will go on to argue are not only not attributable to naturalized philosophy of science or epistemology , but also vitiated by Quines arguments . According to Roth , philosophical theories are solutions to conceptual puzzles , unable to be falsified by experience , and proposed without the aid of science or any empirical inquiry . Moreover , he contends , the failure to solve these puzzles is not regarded as disconfirming the theory in question , but as identifying a " difficulty " that calls for more philosophical theorizing . Roths examples of philosophical theories in the philosophy of science are the verifiability theory of meaning and the rational reconstructions sought by Carnap and others . Roth also criticizes the efforts of contemporary self-styled naturalists , such as Philip Kitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to arrive at some sort of " limited , " as opposed to " radical , " naturalism . These efforts , he maintains , misrepresent or misunderstand the implications of Quines " Epistemology Naturalized , " which are radical indeed . <p> Roth next turns to a detailed explication of the arguments of Quines " Epistemology Naturalized " and what he takes its implications to be for the philosophy of science . Roth takes a primary source of Quinean naturalism to be ( Quinean ) holism , and holism in turn to be the obvious consequence of developments in empiricism post-Hume . To those who have taken " the holist turn , " Roth argues , questions about the justification of empirical claims " must be adjudicated intra-theoretically , " and " Epistemology Naturalized " explicates the consequences of doing so . Central to Roths analysis is his argument that Quine demonstrates a parallel between the demise of foundationalist projects in mathematics and what Quine takes to be the demise of the foundationalist project to justify recognizably empirical claims . Roth maintains that Quines arguments for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate that we are no worse off surrendering the epistemological burden to the sciences than we are in accepting incompleteness theorems of mathematics . Finally , in response to a common critique of Quines arguments in " Epistemology Naturalized , " Roth maintains that the issue of normativity is not " whether to be normative " but " how . " If Quines arguments are successful , as Roth maintains they are , legitimation projectssuch as those undertaken in traditional philosophy of science and , according to Roth , in feminist philosophy of scienceare nonstarters . <p> In the balance of his chapter , Roth turns to the specific implications of his analysis of Quines arguments for feminist philosophy of science , including the work of feminists who describe themselves as naturalists . Emphasizing what he takes to be parallels with the Strong Programme in feminists efforts to develop " social epistemologies " that can provide " causal/social constructionist " explanations of scientific practices , Roth maintains that all such efforts represent precisely the kind of philosophical theorizing Quine shows to be vacuous . The faith , reflected in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some underlying structure that " explains " why people ( including scientists ) believe what they do is , Roth maintains , philosophical baggage . For experience tells us that " whatever processes there are that lead people to associate beliefs in the way they do , " they are impenetrable . Thus , in Roths view , many engaged in feminist philosophy of science , including those who describe themselves as naturalists , are not yet engaged in a truly revolutionary project . Recognizing " the limits of reason in light of the science of the late twentieth century " limits that Roth credits Quine with identifying and embracingwould yield ( genuinely ) revolutionary and constructive approaches to science in feminist philosophy of science . <p> In " The Last Dogma of Empiricism ? " ( Chapter 8 ) , Jack Nelson addresses the general question of whether the distinction between science and values that Quine upholds can be maintained in light of Quines own holistic view of evidence . Nelson argues that there are strong Quinean reasons for rejecting the distinction and that it is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , vitiate the objectivity of science . Indeed , Nelson maintains that there is a compelling reason to attempt to accommodate value claims in science " the hope of bringing something of the objectivity and openness that are characteristic of science to bear on value claims . " <p> Nelson devotes the first section of his chapter to outlining what he refers to as " some fairly noncontroversial boundary conditions " that any viable view about the relation between " facts " and " values , " or about the nature of science , must work within . On the one hand , he maintains , it is an implication of holism that none of the theories we currently accept is immune to revision or possible abandonment . On the other hand , Nelson argues , no theory or thesis that presently challenges the basic success of science ( at least large parts of it ) is itself viable . " Any viable philosophy of science , " he argues , " must recognize the indisputable success of science , " a success that Nelson attributes to sciences demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship , Nelson suggests , is whether sciences success can only be accomplished " by building and maintaining an absolute wall between science and values . " Nelson proposes to explore this question within the bounds of empiricism and the views just outlined . <p> In the next sections of his chapter , Nelson explores Quines reasons for upholding the science/value distinction and the tenability of that distinction given other of his positions . He considers a number of traditional views that took values and the sentences of value theory to be problematic , and argues that only one of these is a likely reason for Quines defense of the distinction " that in Quines view empirical controls work only on science . " Nelson next explores two themes within Quines work that , at least on the surface , argue against " a complete science/value distinction " : holism and Quines " notion of posits and reality . " Nelson argues that the implication of holism is that what counts for or against a claim or theory are two things : " how it is integrated in a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnected claims and theories collectively predict , explain , and integrate the firings of our sensory receptors . " Thus , on the surface , Quinean holism would seem " to invite , or at least allow , " the inclusion of value-laden claims or value claims within science . So too , Nelson argues , Quines arguments that our ontological commitments are to those things that we must posit to make the sentences of our theories come out true ( in the Quinean sense of true ) also suggest that such claims are included in the holistic web . " To the extent that we are concerned to understand us , Homo sapiens , our theories also posit social structures , and individual and social goods and rights , " and we have collectively constructed a world " in which pain , suffering , happiness , joy , and prejudice are as real as trees , cars , political entities , and quarks . " <p> Nelson next considers aspects of Quines work that suggest that the holism Quine has in mind is , in fact , " far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analyzing Quines discussions of holism , Nelson suggests that it is probable that Quine includes only the natural and social sciences within this networkthat it does not in fact include what Nelson describes as " all of our seriously held beliefs . " Nelson next asks what the consequences are of the view that " rationally based agreement is obtainable on all and only the claims of the traditional science . " He argues that two are particularly untoward : first , that " we may mistake broad agreement concerning some specific belief with that belief as being part of science " ; second , that we may be " too ready to tolerate divergence of belief in areas outside the traditional sciences . " In light of these problems , Nelson advocates a broader holism than that which he attributes to Quine , according to which the web of interconnected theories consists of " all our seriously held beliefs , our whole world view including beliefs about values and value-laden beliefs . " Including the disciplines of moral theory , political and social theory , and aesthetics , Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . And , in the end , deciding whether science itself can , in principle , " be made value free " is less important than " bringing reason and evidence construed holistically to bear on value issues . " <p> In his conclusion , Nelson explores the consequences of a science that , at a minimum , makes less of the science/value distinction . He argues that whether or not the science/value distinction is abandoned , the failure to take values seriously works against the doing of good science . Nelson has added a postscript to his chapter that reflects some changes in his views concerning what motivates Quines skepticism about values and value-laden claims since his essay was originally published . <p> The projects of Richmond Campbells " Feminist Epistemology Naturalized " ( Chapter 9 ) are to defend feminist empiricism , to explicate the logic of feminist naturalized epistemology , and to extend some of Quines positions so as to develop a normative realism . Although Campbell defends Quines holism and his arguments for naturalism , the feminist naturalized epistemology he envisions differs in important respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Quine in terms of the viability of a fact/value distinction and in terms of the objectivity of values , and he uses Quines own arguments for holism to counter Quines skepticism about values . In the conclusion of his chapter , Campbell builds on these several arguments to advocate what he calls " a feminist normative realism . " <p> Key to Campbells argument that feminist empiricism is viable is a distinction he draws between what he calls " internal feminist empiricism " and " external feminist empiricism . " Campbell maintains that arguments against feminist empiricism , in particular those of Hardings we earlier outlined , ironically assume the distinction between the contexts of discovery and justification they typically criticize . What critics of feminist empiricism have in mind , Campbell argues , is " external feminist empiricism , " according to which feminist commitments are only brought to bear within the context of discovery ( i.e. , in forming a research agenda ) not in the context of justification where , as Harding and others assume , only empiricist norms function . Campbell uses Quinean holism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the context of justificationthus , he maintains , even in what Harding calls " science as usual , " it is not only empiricist norms that are at work . An " internal feminist empiricism , " in which both feminist and empiricist norms function , is a more accurate understanding of feminist empiricism , and the latter is , indeed , a viable framework . <p> Campbells argument that feminist empiricism should be understood as a version of naturalized epistemology proceeds in several stages . In the first , he seeks to demonstrate that naturalized epistemology is normative , even if " Quine misunderstands his own project . " Campbell maintains that not only are empiricist methodological norms ( such as induction ) inherently normative , so too are the " end norms " that give them their purpose . Naturalized epistemology engages in research and/or makes use of scientific research to determine whether the methodological norms scientists and laypersons use do result in theories that satisfy the ends inquiry sets itself . Campbell builds from this argument to outline the logic of feminist naturalized epistemology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as end norms and in the application of methodological norms such as explanatory power . To take a naturalistic approach to feminist epistemology , Campbell argues , is to follow the logic of naturalized epistemology so described to investigate whether specific methodological norms lead to hypotheses and theories that satisfy the " end norms " of feminist politics . <p> Campbell next turns to questions concerning realism and objectivity , first in terms of recognizably empirical theory ( such as science ) , and subsequently in terms of moral theory . His account of the purpose and justification of the methodological and end norms that guide inquiry are central to his arguments for a feminist normative realism . He works first to demonstrate that the justification of methodological norms on the basis of their relationship to objectivity requires that we assume they are more likely than any alternatives to help us arrive at " reasonably accurate models of what the world is like . " Campbell next argues that realism is required if we are to be able to make sense of the notion that the end norms guiding inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact-value holism " as a framework that allows for the evaluation of end norms , including feminist norms , on the basis of notions such as objectivity . <p> In a third line of argument , Campbell maintains that Quines arguments that the empirical meaning ( content ) of particular sentences is largely determined by their relationships to other sentences come to the claim that the " factual and meaning components of language are inextricably intertwined . " If we also grant , as Campbell earlier argues , that holism so understood extends to normative commitments , and that there are reciprocal relationships between ones acceptance of descriptive claims and ones norms , then it is clear that normative realism is as viable as empirical realism . Moral claims , Campbell maintainssuch as " the suppression of women is unjust " are like empirical claims in that both " can be true independently of their being recognized to be true . " <p> In " The Importance of Quine for Feminist Theory " ( Chapter 10 ) , Jane Duran argues that Quines naturalism , which her analysis suggests she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistemology , is the most significant aspect of his work , and deeply commensurate with core feminist principles . Duran characterizes Quines naturalism as the view that it is " futile " to attempt to " divorce our experience of the world from our theorizing about it . " Quine demonstrates , she argues , that efforts to disentangle language , theorizing , sense data experience , and observation are necessarily doomed . <p> Duran builds from her account of Quinean naturalism to argue that there are fundamental differences between , on the one hand , Quines positions and , on the other , logical positivism , Carnaps positions , and " the Received View " that long dominated the philosophy of science . Duran maintains that Quines view of the relationship between language and world led to his critique of sense data as a form of experience prior to conceptualization and language , and ultimately to his arguments against foundationalism . Quines view of the language/world relationship in turn relied on a model of language acquisition that maintains that childrens sensory experiences are inseparable from their experiences of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inseparability in the language-learning process of experience , conceptualization , and categorization as also attributable to the esoteric observations and categorizations of the sciences . The physicist encountering the world , using her senses and the categories implicit in her language , does so in ways and to ends not different in kind from the child who is learning a language . <p> Durans third line of argument emphasizes Quines rejection of the a priori and of what she terms " universalizability , " positions that she maintains sharply distinguish Quines naturalism from much Western philosophizing . Duran locates Quine " directly in a line of thinkers , beginning with James and Dewey and including Rorty , " who have denied the possibility of " One True Account " and whose challenges to this are grounded in a rejection of the possibility of universalizability and an a prioriconstruction of ontology . Duran takes the source both of Deweys emphasis on the importance of experience and " the weakness of a priori theorizing " and of Quines naturalism to be in their common view of the relationships between language and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language has " a nonhuman , hypostatized link to the world . " <p> In her conclusion , Duran argues that there is a deep convergence between Quines naturalism and feminists commitments to theorizing on the basis of the realities of " womens lived lives . " Duran draws parallels between " the sense-oriented nature of a gynocentric world view " that reflects " immersion in the world of mundane particulars " and the emphasis in Quines theorizing on sensory experience . In more general terms , Duran argues , Quinean naturalism is valuable for feminist theorizing " precisely because it takes us thoroughly out of the realm of a priori theorizing . " <p> In " Feminist Naturalized Philosophy of Science " ( Chapter 11 ) , Lynn Hankinson Nelson explores the implications of Quines positions and feminist science studies for the philosophy of science . Extending and revising " A Feminist Naturalized Philosophy of Science " ( 1995 ) , Nelson advocates a philosophical framework for studying science that makes use of three methodological principles she argues to be commensurate with the implications of Quinean holism and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of science . " Her central thesis is that an approach to science based on these principles allows for the recognition that many of the questions feminist raise about the social processes that characterize and influence science are simultaneously questions about the bodies of evidence available to and drawn upon by scientists . That is to say , the distinction between the " sociology of science " and " epistemology of science " that both traditional philosophers and sociologists of science assume is not genuine ( cf. Rouse 1996 ) . <p> Nelson positions her discussion in relation to recent debates in naturalized philosophy of science . She notes that three criteria for assessing methods used in the discipline have emerged in these discussions : the commensurability of the explanations such methods yield with the actual history and current practices of science ; sufficient grounding in empirical research relevant to the study of the sciences ; and consistency of methodological approaches , in particular , a consistent approach to episodes deemed progressive and nonprogressive . Nelson argues that the general commitment among naturalists to evaluate philosophical methods on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between philosophical methods and a current state of science and science scholarship , make feminist naturalized epistemology a viable and promising methodological approach . <p> In the second section , Nelson introduces the three methodological principles , maintaining that they both satisfy the criteria largely accepted in naturalized philosophy of science and better satisfy them than currently available alternatives . Two principles concern the construal of evidence , and the second represents a revision of the article originally published with the same name ( Nelson 1995 ) . The first builds on what Nelson takes to be the implications of Quines arguments for holism ; it maintains that the evidence for specific hypotheses and theories is both empirical success and integration with bodies of accepted theory . She takes an implication of feminist science studies to be that holism must be construed inclusively so as to include claims and theories in which social beliefs and values are integrated . <p> Nelsons second methodological principle seeks to refine Quinean holism so that it reflects the substantial body of evidence indicating that the sciences are in fact less unified , and characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has identified in earlier publications . She adds to the principle calling for inclusive holism by building on the work of Alison Wylie and Ian Hacking to argue for a principle that emphasizes the importance of " evidential independence . " She argues that the evidence for a particular hypothesis , whether in the form of empirical results or intertheoretic integration , is stronger if it enjoys some degree of independence ( vertical and/or horizontal ) from the research program within which the hypothesis emerged . Nelsons third methodological principle takes science communities , rather than scientists qua individuals , as the loci of philosophical reconstructions and explanations of scientific practice . She maintains that this focus is an implication of the holistic account of evidence she advocates . <p> In her conclusion , Nelson considers the question of whether feminist naturalized philosophy of science as she has outlined it is normative . She seeks to demonstrate that it is a significant implication of research in both the feminist and naturalist traditions that the methods employed in the philosophy of science carry both empirical and normative import , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we have had reason to note in several contexts , even contributors who support Quines arguments for naturalizing the philosophy of science and holism , and who also agree that these positions are relevant to and promising for feminist theorizing about science , sometimes disagree deeply about the nature and implications of these positions . There is , to start , obvious disagreement about whether naturalized philosophy of science is justificatory . And like the disagreement we noted between Antonys analysis and L. H. Nelsons in Part I , contributors in this section differ sharply in their understandings of the implications of holism for realism , for correspondence theories , and for related notionsdisagreements that , in some cases we suggest , are partly related to disagreements concerning the viability and/or implications of Quinean holism and his thesis of the indeterminacy of translation . <p> We conclude by noting some significant parallels and disagreements in the volume as a whole , and what we think are important and unresolved questions concerning the implications of feminist scholarship for Quines positions and vice versa . <p> A number of contributors analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extent and implications . Linker maintains that this doctrine is inherently conservative and , as such , incompatible with feminist theorizing . Others , including Campbell , J. Nelson , L. H. Nelson , and Roth , argue that holism is an important resource for feminist theorizing , but the first three contributors seek to extend it so as to include more than science narrowly construed and , certainly , values . The second chapter by L. H. Nelson also seeks to develop a view of evidence that , although holistic , avoids the conservatism that she takes to rightly concern Linker . There are also important differences in the ways those sympathetic to Quinean holism understand this position . For example , Jack Nelson argues that holism as Quine understood and advocated it may only encompass the sciences , and identifies what he takes to be some unfortunate consequences if this is the case . Campbell , Duran , and L. H. Nelson , on the other hand , take Quines arguments to entail a more inclusive holism , one that encompasses common-sense theory and theorizing as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls Quines " fact/meaning holism " as the basis for his own argument for " fact/value holism . " In his efforts to expand Quinean holism to include values , Campbells interest parallels that of J. Nelson , but their specific understandings of holism seem to us quite different . <p> Roth maintains that Quine does not draw distinctions between types of sciences , but understands science as incorporating any form of inquiry that respects the experimental method . At the same time , Roths arguments would suggest that the ways other contributors seek to use Quinean holism and naturalism reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Quines arguments . The disagreements involved are significant , for they raise the question not only of what the philosophy of science postnaturalism is or could be , but also questions concerning where Quines work is located in relationship to " analytic " philosophy and postmodernism . <p> At its heart , the disagreement seems to us to concern whether naturalized philosophy of science properly understood is or could be an explanatory enterprise or whether it is , instead , ( merely ) interpretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features he attributes to " philosophical theories , " Roth focuses on Helen E. Longinos arguments for viewing science " as social knowledge " and on the guidelines she proposes for science communities to further the kind of objectivity she articulates . But Roths arguments have much wider applicability . In this volume alone , a number of contributors identify themselves as feminists and naturalists , and suggest philosophical approaches to studying scienceapproaches that they , like Longino , take to be simultaneously philosophical and empirical inquiries . If Roth is correct , these are in fact philosophical in ways Quine that showed are untenable . What reason is there for thinking this is so ? <p> As we read Roth , any attempt to explain the beliefs of individuals or of groups is a nonstarter . Feminist theorizing , thenincluding that self-described as naturalistis not empirical inquiry , but philosophical theorizing of a sort Quine showed to be a dead end . This raises several questions , perhaps the most obvious being just what is the philosophy of science ? And in what does the continuity between the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quines argument for naturalization , consist ? If the sciences are explanatory and the philosophy of science is limited to offering interpretations , it is not clear that any such continuity obtains . Perhaps , given that the problems with causal explanations that Roth emphasizes concern efforts to explain beliefs , he is of the view that the social sciences and the philosophy of science can not be explanatory , but the physical and life sciences can . But again this seems challenged by Quinean holism and the breadth ( which Roth himself stresses ) of Quines notion of what constitutes " empirical inquiry . " Given these positions , it would seem to follow that either all empirical inquiry is interpretive , rather than explanatory , or all empirical inquiry , including some approaches taken to the philosophy of science , is explanatory . <p> Whatever the answers to these questions , we take these issuesat the heart of this disagreement and others we have noted concerning the implications of holism for the notions of realism and truth , explanation and interpretation , and all of these for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in feminist theorizing . For they suggest that Quines philosophy bridges the philosophies of the analytic and postmodern schools that many , including some contributors to this volume , take to be diametrically opposed . <p> On one level , there is apparently more consensus concerning Quines commitment to individualism than there is concerning holism . Of those who discuss it , most see aspects of Quines work , including his arguments in " Epistemology Naturalized , " as presupposing epistemological individualism and view this position as problematic . On another level , there are differences in the weight contributors attribute to individualism as they evaluate the usefulness of naturalism to feminist theorizing . Codes and Linkers essays suggest that Quinean naturalism is inseparable from individualism . Duran , J. Nelson , and L. H. Nelson , while critical of Quines commitment to individualism , see room for developing naturalism beyond it . And Campbell , J. Nelson , and L. H. Nelson argue that others of Quines positions undermine any residual commitment he has to individualism . As importantly in terms of this issue , we take Rooneys analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction between the individual and the social that informs some of the other essays , and about the not uncommon assumption that research focused on the cognitive capacities of individuals can not yield results with any relevance for feminist science studies . <p> A question enjoying center stage in these essays is whether naturalism and others of Quines positions are able to yield a sufficiently normative philosophy of science . Although contributors disagree in their answers to this question , we end by noting arguments that we find common and significant . <p> Most contributors maintain that , by current lights , the methods employed by philosophers of science should be empirically grounded and should yield critical evaluation of the sciences , including those that naturalists seek to use . And all call for critical self-reflection on the part of philosopherswhether feminists , naturalists , rationalists , or some combination thereofconcerning the empirical warrant and the normative implications of our practices .

No one knows the beginning of it , and no one knows the end . <p> Dona Maria Geralda Ferreira , Jatob <p> Dona Maria said this to me on a sunny , dry day in August 1995 as we sat on her front porch looking out on the yard , where the annual festival for Our Lady of the Rosary was about to begin . Dona Maria , born 4 July 1906 , has spent most of her life as part of the Festa do Reinado de Nossa Senhora do Rosrio ( Feast Day of the Crowning of Our Lady of the Rosary ) , known in the vernacular as the Congado ( Fig. 1 ) . She plays an important role in the festival in Jatob , a region on the industrial periphery of Belo Horizonte , the capital of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais . Her brother had been an important and powerful captain of the congado ( ritual group ) known as the Mozambique ; she was the widow of the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival for more than forty years , and she was the mother of the current leader , Jopo Lopes . In her own right Dona Maria has long been a benzedora , or healer , using prayers and herbs to treat the sick , who come from miles around to ask for her help , and during the festival , all the leaders come to ask for her blessing before going out to do the ritual work of the festival . One participant described her as having a " spiritual force , a knowledge , and she maintains the blood of the brotherhood to not let it fall . " On her porch that day in 1995 we waited for the costumed groups of Mozambiques and Congos to arrive with the King and Queen of Congo , whom they had escorted from their homes to the yard , now a ritual space , in front of Dona Marias house and the chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary . When they arrived , the yard filled with the syncopated rhythms , swirling colors , and large and small rituals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria and all congadeiros , as participants in the festivals are called , are heirs of the rosary brotherhood tradition , which dates from the first years of colonization in Minas Gerais . Congadeiros are primarily black , both phenotypically and economically , and live in the working-class and poor neighborhoods of the large cities and small towns of Minas Gerais . During the festivals , congado groups , some using the names of African nations and wearing the colors of the saints , play drums and shakers , sing and dance , and escort their kings and queens . The festivals include the coronations of these kings and queens in the part of the festival known as the Reinado . The festivals open up a ritual space in which the participants can call on Our Lady of the Rosary and the other saints associated with the festival to intercede on their behalf or to thank them for their intercession . In order to ensure the good reunion of the people without any trouble from seen or unseen forces , the participants engage in special rituals at the crossroads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pretos velhos , the spirits of old , black , African slaves . The festivals are the apex of the ritual year for the communities that celebrate them , and they work to reinforce their links to the unseen world , to the past , and to one another . <p> Dona Maria in many ways embodies some of the paradoxes inherent in the study of the rosary brotherhoods and festivals in Minas Gerais . She identifies herself as an Afro-Brazilian , celebrates the relationship between Our Lady of the Rosary and blacks , and affirms the link between Our Lady of the Rosary and the emancipation of slaves . " The blacks are the sons of Our Lady , and that is why slavery ended . From slavery there was freedom and from freedom came the Congado , the festival of Our Lady . . . . Our Lady helped everyone and here all of the blacks are very happy with Our Lady of the Rosary . " However , when asked about the personal history of her family , she recounts that her family was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century . Like Dona Marias own memory of her familys history and its devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary , the rosary brotherhoods and their festivals in Minas Gerais blur boundaries erected by scholars to understand the history of Africans in the Americas in general , and in Brazil in particular , in three distinct ways . <p> First , scholars , for the most part , followed the lead of contemporary commentators who considered the brotherhoods and their festivals to be " slave " organizations , even though through much of their history a majority of the membership was free . The communities , built on both kinship and affective ties , were based on a common heritage rather than a shared legal status . Second , the relationship between the brotherhoods and the church and the state authorities made them appear to be accommodating , in the traditional accommodation/resistance dichotomy . Indeed , there can be no argument that the rosary brotherhoods were Catholic lay organizations that Africans and their descendents enthusiastically joined . Nevertheless , participants have long either ignored or resisted attempts to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the coronations of their kings and queens and the drumming and call-and-response singing that continues to define the festivals . Finally , at the time of independence , and then almost a century later after the abolition of slavery , rosary festivals seemed to fade away in many parts of Brazil , but not in Minas Gerais . There , the festivals only grew stronger as the twentieth century progressed . <p> How , then , can we understand the brotherhoods of the rosary in Minas Gerais ? The current day celebrations , the rituals , and the legends developed from the colonial rosary brotherhood traditions in Minas Gerais in which African- and Brazilian-born slaves and free blacks formed communities , celebrated their saints , and helped one another on to the other world through rituals of death . The formation of communities developed concurrently with the rituals and celebrations and with all activities within groups of recently arrived slaves in Brazil . Joseph C. Miller points out that slaves would have drawn " on differing aspects of their home backgrounds as they searched for a morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming contradictions in the rosary brotherhoods can be understood when they are viewed as a process of the formation and maintenance of transnational and multiethnic communities of the African diaspora . The idea of community that has emerged among these groups is not exclusively one of place , or of neighborhood , but rather of a people who have worked to maintain a group identity through generationsan identity formed by the annual reaffirmation of a shared , remembered history as descendents of Africans and devotees of Our Lady of the Rosary . <p> The remarkable resilience of the rosary brotherhoods has resulted from centuries of negotiation and compromise with secular and ecclesiastic authorities and within their own populations . Historian Thomas A. Abercrombie in his discussion of the Aymara people of Bolivia argues that " the institutional matrix and cultural meanings of ethnic cultural survival in the Andes have been shaped by native peoples active and collective engagement with , rather than flight from , the power-infused cultural programs of state elites . " Likewise , Africans and their descendents in Minas Gerais actively participated in organizations that simultaneously linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue practices that served as a foundation for their existence and endurance as communities . The strategy of these groups exposes the limitations of the resistance/accommodation model , replacing it with the examination of processes of negotiation , change , and continuity . This book , then , is a history of the descendents of a group of slaves and free blacks who creatively used the cultural materials at hand , who were , in the phrase of historians Jopo JosT Reis and Eduardo Silva , " between Zumbi and Pai Jopo , " in order to ensure their survival as a community , maintain their devotions and the link to their ancestors , and foster a pride in their African roots . <p> Identity , Memory , and History <p> This book explores the long history of the congadeiros through the examination of the main themes of community , devotion , and identity , set into the context of the endemic asymmetry of power in Brazilian society . I do not use the word identity in the sense of an individuals sense of uniqueness as an autonomous being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group . Brazilian anthropologist Roberto DaMatta asks whether " the notion of the individual really has absolute validity in social systems where it is conceived as merely residual if not negative social category . " In both Brazilian and African societies in the eighteenth century , the family or kin group composed the smallest social unit , and autonomy from such a group often meant marginality . Therefore , the identity of individuals was intimately wrapped up in the identification with a group . This certainly would have been the case for Africans , who , as Miller points out , " thought of themselves primarily in terms of social identities constructed out of family and other local communities . " The groups with which many Africans in Minas Gerais chose to align themselves were the brotherhoods of the rosary of the blacks . <p> The rubric of the blacks brings up the problematic question of " race " in Brazil , where this is a category that has both been fluid and slippery . Max Weber defines race as something that " creates a group only when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when a neighborhood or the mere proximity of racially different persons is the basis of joint ( mostly political ) action , or conversely , when some common experiences of members of the same race are linked to some antagonism against members of an obviously different group . " This definition , which stresses the relativity of race , serves well for the rosary brotherhoods . The antagonism of the groups in Brazil came from the hierarchical social system in which the members of the rosary brotherhoods , both slave and nonwhite free men and women , had the least power within the society . Once they joined the community of the brotherhood , they joined a group of blacks . They sought incorporation with others who shared both " subjectively perceived " common physical traits as well as a common heritage and also shared experiences of slavery , poverty , or both . The brotherhoods provided a forum for the development of identities based on " race , " or being black in the colonial period , that rosary brotherhoods in the following centuries could build upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was erected on two foundations that brought the community together . The first was the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary , the patron of the blacks . The second was expressed in the annual festival to Our Lady of the Rosary , in which blackness was reinforced by the constant rearticulation of links to Africa through songs , drums , and ritual action and the calling on the pretos velhos . The participants have continuously constructed a social memory and thus built and reinforced a group identity , through the action , or work , of the festival . Sociologist Maurice Halbwachs argues that through membership in groups people are able to " localize and recall their memories . " Paul Connerton takes this idea a step further by locating the formation of social memory in the action of rituals , both religious and commemorative . <p> Although sociologists have worked to understand how groups remember their past , the term memory , both because of and despite its recent popularity , has come under fire in the field of history . Kerwin Lee Klein recently critiqued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that memory is most often paired with identity and with a " clustering of quasi-religious terms . " He warns that the use of memory represents a desire to " re-enchant our relation with the world and pour presence back into the past . " Despite Kleins discomfort with the term , the use of the links that remembering provide are not only helpful but necessary when discussing a people who perceive their past as inseparable from their beliefs . One of the earliest historians to talk about history and memory , Pierre Nora , poetically identified memory as lived history , as " life , borne by living societies founded in its name . . . a perpetually actual phenomena , a bond tying us to the eternal present . " More recently , Abercrombie articulates Noras ideas by juxtaposing memory and history , demonstrating the ways in which social memory is constructed in an Andean village through myth and ritual in relation and opposition to Western historical discourse . History and memory are presented as being on different sides of an unequal equationan equation that places rational/secular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sacred " history on the other . Abercrombie exposes the danger in this equation , demonstrating that writing the history of a people " without a history , " using a Western model , ends up producing a history that the people themselves would not recognize , in effect recolonizing the peoples past . Understanding nondominant groups involves using all the resources available for discovering that past , including the ways that the groups themselves construct that history . <p> Analyzing how memory works , however , involves understanding the mechanisms through which the remembering is achieved . Memory , the noun , implies a static concept , a substantive " thing " that may only dwell in the minds of individuals . Yet memory is not a static concept but an active one . People do not simply have memories ; they actively remember through ritual and storytelling . Remembering , then , is a practice , and it is both similar to and linked to the act of believing . Marilyn Motz points out that " a belief exists only because people believe it : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . " In exactly the same way , a memory exists only because a person , or group , remembers it , and like believing , it is a process better defined by the verb than the noun . The processes of believing and remembering are both articulated in the rituals and narratives of the Congadosin fact , they are inseparable . Through the ongoing and intertwined practices of believing and remembering , the congadeiros maintain a strong and positive sense of community identity and their own " blackness " through reinforcing a living link to an African past . <p> The scope of this book is broad both chronologically and geographically . I divide the book chronologically into three parts . In Part 1 , I examine the antecedents of the mineiro ( that is , of Minas Gerais ) brotherhoods both in Europe and in Africa . The brotherhoods in Minas Gerais , and the devotion that evolved within them , began at the intersection of a cluster of sub-Saharan cosmologies , many of which already included elements of European culture and Catholicism and eighteenth-century Iberian folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior of Brazil . In Chapter I , I investigate the roots of the devotion and the nature of lay Catholicism in early modern Europe in order to demonstrate the complexity of Catholicism and the importance of lay activity at the time of the explorations of Africa and the Americas . The mentalities of that period served as a cultural backdrop for the Portuguese and as a foil for the Africans who came into contact with it . I explore the development of brotherhoods and specifically the brotherhoods of the rosary and other lay organizations formed for Africans on the Iberian Peninsula . I also address the explorations and settlement of the Portuguese and the beginning of the slave trade . The focus of Chapter 2 is Africa and the primary locations from which slaves destined for the mines were taken . Specifically , I examine the dynamic histories of West and Central Africa during the first centuries of the slave trade , discuss local worldviews and practices from those areas , and explore the emergence of dynamic creole cultures . <p> In the late seventeenth century , gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to be known as Minas Gerais . In Part 2 , I examine the brotherhoods of the rosary of the blacks in Minas Gerais from the time of the arrival of the first Europeans and Africans and through to the end of slavery in Brazil in 1888 . Again , the chapters are divided chronologically . Chapter 3 centers on the development of the brotherhoods in the chaotic gold-mining boom that occurred in Minas Gerais from 1690 to about 1750 . In that wild , frontier context , brotherhoods , including rosary brotherhoods of blacks , emerged as fiercely independent organizations . The autonomy of the organizations during this formative period would shape the ways they confronted outside pressures in the following centuries . By 1750 the boom had gone bust , the frontier society of Minas Gerais began to settle down , and the first new diocese was created in Minas with the city of Mariana at its hub . Life was changing in the metropolis , too , as the marquis de Pombal came to , then fell from , power and Brazil moved closer to independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-eighteenth century to 1822 and these external pressures on the rosary brotherhoods , as well as the internal dynamic of the organizations as they confronted increasing oversight by state and church authorities . It was toward the end of this period that travelers began to leave records of the rosary festivals and their coronations and dances . Chapter 5 begins in 1822 and follows the rosary brotherhoods through the transitional period of the Brazilian Empire and to the end of slavery , with another look at both the societal pressures of church and state and the internal reactions of the brotherhood members . Through the colonial period and the empire , although the brotherhoods constantly negotiated with the state and church authorities , little changed in the actual brotherhood structure , and the organizations continued to be based on foundations laid in the early colonial period . By the nineteenth century it was apparent that the Afro-Brazilian devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary had become a customary and accepted celebration among many sectors of society in Minas Gerais . <p> This relative stability came to an abrupt end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I examine the rosary brotherhoods and the ongoing methods used by congadeiros to keep their festivals alive from 1889 to 1980 . The subject of Chapter 6 is how the reorganization of the church after the abrupt division of church and state at the founding of the First Republic in 1889 affected the brotherhoods . Oral testimony and archival sources recount the evolution of the festivals in the twentieth century and their struggle to survive in rapidly modernizing Brazil . It turns out , however , that the rosary devotion of the blacks had the power to shape and influence popular sentiment in Minas Gerais , and despite changing attitudes of the church , the rosary organizations and festivals survived . Although I bring in the voices of the congadeiros throughout the book , in the final chapter I step away from the historical narrative and allow participants in the Congadocommunities today to express their own thoughts about their devotion , their history , and their identity as devotees of Our Lady of the Rosary of the blacks . <p> The scope of the project required me to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rosary brotherhoods in Minas Gerais came out of my personal experience with the festivals dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary . I traveled to Minas Gerais in 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , and 1997 to research the material in this book , and during those years I attended several festivals . I decided to concentrate on two festivals , one in the town of Oliveira in the agricultural region of Minas Gerais southwest of the capital , Belo Horizonte , and the other in Jatob , located in the industrial periphery of the capital . The participants in these festivals expressed strong ties to an African past and a pride in their " blackness " both elements also apparent in the rituals that made up the festivalswhich seemed to contradict much of what I had learned about attitudes toward blackness in Brazil . Soon the energy of the festivals , the stamina and devotion of the participants , the rituals with the crowns and the rosaries , the lyrics of the songs , and the words of the tales all drew me into the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While not attending festivals , I haunted large and small archives in Minas Gerais . The books of the brotherhoods are not housed in a central location but instead are spread across an array of various archives . The State Archive in Belo Horizonte ( Arquivo Pblico Mineiro ) had some of the brotherhood books , especially for the period of the Empire to the present , and also contained valuable correspondence , laws , and other materials that helped to construct the story of the brotherhoods . The most comprehensive collection of documents for the colonial brotherhoods is housed in the Ecclesiastic Archive in Mariana ( Arquivo Eclesistico da Arquidiocese de Mariana ) , but I also worked with the documents of some brotherhoods in small archives of particular brotherhoods , such as that in the rosary brotherhood of Spo Jopo del Rei , the Museum of Sacred Art in that city , and the local archives in Oliveira . There is no telling how many small parishes have their own collections of rosary brotherhood documents . Because of the variation in storage techniques , some of the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fortunately many survived . What remained supplied an abundance and variety of documents that enabled me to piece together a picture of the history of the rosary brotherhoods over several centuries . Finally , documents in the National Archive and the National Library in Rio de Janeiro helped to supplement the brotherhood documents and put them in a larger context . For the chapters on Europe and Africa I relied heavily on published primary sources and the work of scholars of those areas . Those works , and the present-day festivals , legends , and stories , shed light on the documents contained in the archives and enabled me to put together this long story . Although some amount of depth has been sacrificed in order to achieve this breadth , my hope is that authors of future studies will be able to look more closely at particular periods , places , and events in order to continue to build a comprehensive understanding of these important organizations and the people who participate in them . <p> This study as a whole , then , explores the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afro-Brazilian communities of Minas Gerais . Within the infrastructure set by the dominant sector of society , Africans and their descendants creatively and actively organized and used the brotherhoods to create a community in a new place . Far from being a co-optation of their religion and culture , or simply a conscious form of cultural resistance , a study of the brotherhoods of the rosary offers a look into the messier and less-easy-to-categorize strategies of survival that abounded not just in Brazil , but throughout the Americas wherever large numbers of slaves were taken . The centerpiece of these strategies was the ability to form strong and long-lasting communities . The study of the rosary brotherhoods of blacks in Minas Gerais shows the success of groups in one particular region , and the congadeiros today express their achievement through the vibrancy of their faith and the strength of their communities , in which the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary continues to flourish .

Vento <p> &lt;1&gt;Abstract <p> This chapter will focus solely on the responses of river systems to climate change during the Sub-Boreal climate interval or Transitional Archaic period in the Middle Atlantic region and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period begins at approximately 4200 BP and ends at 3000 BP . The Sub-Boreal , much like the preceding Younger Dryas ( ca. 11,200 BP ) and later Little Ice Age ( 700400 BP ) climate intervals , was a time of renewed stream channel migration and active overbank deposition . Unlike the Younger Dryas or Little Ice Age interval , however , when fluvial erosional disconformities were associated with either cold and dry or cooler and wetter climatic conditions , respectively , the Sub-Boreal interval , which coincides with the Transitional Archaic , occurred during a 1,200-year period of decreased effective precipitation associated with climatic conditions that are warmer and drier overall than those present today , for example . The following discussion examines both archaeological and paleoenvironmental lines of evidence in the Middle Atlantic region and elsewhere for the above assertions . <p> &lt;1&gt;Archaeological Evidence <p> Archaeologically , the Transitional Archaic period is defined by broadspears , which date to between approximately 4,000 and 3000 BP . In addition , and following the lead of several researchers , this period is distinguished from the Late Archaic and Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonlocal lithic types , for example , metarhyolites , that were typically available in massive bedrock formations , as opposed to tabular chert or pebble sources . This period is also documented by a change to bifacial core technology , a staged biface reduction process , the caching of bifaces , curated tools , steatite bowls , large and numerous fire-cracked rock ( FCR ) features , the beginning of fired clay pottery , occasional burial ceremonialism , and a preference for riverine environments . Based on the current recorded site database , Transitional Archaic populations appear to have preferred encampments along larger perennial streams rather than smaller first- or second-order tributaries . Could this preference for larger perennial streams reflect the fact that , during sustained warm and dry periods , small streams would have been more affected by a lower input of water from base flow and surface runoff and thus have been less attractive to Transitional Archaic populations ? As Kurt Carr has argued for at least two decades , the change from an expedient flake-and-blade technology during the Late Archaic to a biface technology during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a food economy procurement strategy that reflects environmental stress due to warmer and drier climatic conditions and lower discharges along streams in the Middle Atlantic region . <p> Effects of the warmer and drier climate included a decrease in the number of low-order streams , lower water volume in streams generally , a decrease in biomass on ridges , and a lowering of the water table ( Graetzer 1986 ; Watts 1979 ) . Evidence provided by correlations of pollen core data with pollen from surface samples of known vegetation types suggests that the overall composition of the vegetation did not change radically ( Bradstreet and Davis 1975 ) . On the other hand , changes in hydrology and decreases in productivity would likely have had some effect on the distribution of prehistoric populations . Specifically , upland areas would have become less attractive , whereas major riverine areas such as the Ohio , Delaware , and Susquehanna River floodplains and associated terraces would have been more attractive ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Although there is some disagreement regarding the occurrence of a Middle Holocene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement regarding the climate following 5000 BP . A number of researchers have presented evidence indicating an environment characterized by severe climatic fluctuations , including a warm and dry , or xerothermic , period between 5000 and 2600 BP ( Carbone 1976 ; Curry and Custer 1982 ; Custer 1988 ; Vento and Rollins 1989 ; Vento et al . 2008 ) . Arthur Joyce ( 1988 ) notes that researchers have presented a variety of dates within the Middle Holocene for the proposed xerothermic period . Dennis Curry and Jay Custer ( 1982 ) argue that the xerothermic corresponds to the warm and dry conditions of the Atlantic/Sub-Boreal period in the Blytt-Sernander system ( Figure 1.1 ; described in Zeuner 1952 ; see also Vento et al . 2008 ) , originally developed to describe European climatic change but frequently applied without reservation to North America . In contrast , other researchers argue that , although there were undoubted fluctuations in temperature and moisture after 5000 BP , these were no more than low-amplitude fluctuations of short duration ( Beckerman 1986 ; Joyce 1988 ; Watts 1979 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues ( 2003 ) have argued that the impacts on vegetation were likely minimal and the composition of the forest , as a result , was similar to the present-day forest in many respects . Custer ( 1984 , 1988 ) points to a decrease in hemlock and an increase in hickory in many of the major pollen studies of the northeastern United States . Hickory , in this sense , is considered an indicator of relatively dry conditions . But , as both Jay Custer ( 1988 ) and Victor Carbone ( 1976 ) remark , the inability to identify pollen to the species level renders such an interpretation problematic . Mesic species of hickory exist ( Carya cordiformis , C. ovata ) and are common in the modern biota ( Joyce 1988 ) . Most xeric hickory species also grow and thrive in moist , fertile soils . The sudden and synchronous decline of hemlock across a wide range of latitudes , cited as an indicator of dry conditions , strongly supports disease rather than climatic change as the cause ( Bhiry and Filion 1996 ; Davis 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiles do not show the significant increases in nonarboreal pollen , such as grasses , amaranth , and Chenopodium , that would suggest a major decline in overstory vegetation resulting from decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Carbones ( 1976 ) quantitative analysis of data from the Shenandoah Valley is often cited to support the proposition that warm and dry conditions were present in the Middle Atlantic region during the Late Holocene . His analysis followed a methodology developed by Thompson Webb and Reid Bryson ( 1972 ) , who took modern pollen samples and modern climatic data from seventy-three sample locations in the Midwest and , using canonical correlation , calculated a set of mathematical transfer functions relating pollen frequency to climatic variables , which they then applied to three fossil pollen cores located within the same region . Carbone applied this methodology to raw data from Hack Pond , located in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia , concluding in his 1976 study that the climate of the Shenandoah Valley involved a warm and dry period that culminated around 4350 BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was characterized by " increased temperatures , increased desiccation and moisture stress " ( Carbone 1976:106 ) . It is not clear in Carbones discussion when temperature and precipitation reached modern levels , although he states " the climatic shifts of the last 4,000 to 5,000 years can be better understood as perturbations of the modern pattern rather than as actual long-term shifts " ( Carbone 1976:107 ) . Problems in dating these shifts may arise from the fact that the most recent radiocarbon sample from Hack Pond was from a depth of approximately 140 centimeters and returned a date of 9520 200 BP ( 11,26210,251 BP or 93139302 BC calibrated ) . Although Carbone does not explicitly say so , he apparently assumes a constant rate of deposition over the last 9,000 years , an assumption that may be invalid , given what is known of variation in alluvial deposition during this period ( Vento and Rollins 1989 ; Vento et al . 2008 ) . <p> Webb and Bryson ( 1972 ) assume that climate can be considered the primary controlling factor for the composition of past vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the proposition that other factors controlling vegetation , such as topography and soils , are constant between the modern and fossil samples . Carbones 1976 study violates the assumption , however , in that he uses the same mathematical transfer functions developed by Webb and Bryson for the Midwest , rather than developing transfer functions from sample sites in the Shenandoah Valley , where factors such as soil and topography are radically different from those in the Midwest ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Noting Webb and Brysons caution that climatic factors controlling pine in the Midwest are different from those controlling pine in the Southeast , Carbone ( 1976:100 ) reasons that , because deciduous vegetation in the two regions was similar , the pine problem is unlikely to significantly affect the overall results . However , any number of similar , but unrevealed , problems may exist as a result of applying transfer functions developed in the Midwest to the Middle Atlantic region ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Alluvial stratigraphy has also been cited as evidence for warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition rates have been interpreted as indicating increased runoff resulting from decreased vegetative cover . Such an interpretation is based in part on James Knoxs ( 1983 ) study of the morphology of stream channels and floodplains in southwestern Wisconsin and on investigations within the Susquehanna , Ohio , and Delaware River valleys ( Vento et al . 2008 ) . Knox interprets increased alluviation prior to 6000 BP as resulting from a warm and dry period , whose climate was primarily influenced by dry westerlies . This period is well documented in the pollen profiles of the Midwest , which indicate an eastward migration of the Midwestern prairie prior to 6000 BP ( King 1980 ) . Knox ( 1983 ) theorizes that increasing rainfall and vegetation after 6000 BP would have resulted in a decrease in the magnitude and frequency of peak flows , thus also a decrease in overbank deposition . Knox notes that the period of greatest sediment yield during the climatic fluctuation from humid to arid to humid conditions would have occurred at the end of the warm and dry period , during which vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Studies of alluvial stratigraphy in the Middle Atlantic region indicate that overbank deposition was rapid during the period between approximately 5000 and 3000 BP . Frank Vento and Harold Rollins ( 1989 ) and Vento and colleagues ( 2008 ) have identified rapid vertical accretion in the Ohio , Upper and Middle Delaware , and Susquehanna Basins , consisting of sediments with Late and Transitional Archaic cultural material . Richard Scully and Richard Arnold ( 1981 ) found evidence of increasing vertical accretion in the Upper Susquehanna Basin after 4900 BP . Carbone ( 1976 ) points to the rapid deposition of culturally sterile , sandy-clay loam between 5,000 and 2,700 BP as evidence that vegetation was at a minimum due to increased temperatures and decreased rainfall ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Despite the significance of Knoxs ( 1983 ) study for understanding the relationship between changes in the climatic optimum and changes in the stream channels and floodplain characteristics of the Midwest , the presence of similar alluvial characteristics in the Late Holocene ( Sub-Boreal ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same climatic changes were in progress . Hydrological studies show that the decrease in precipitation needed to substantially affect sediment yield and flood size is quite large . According to data gathered by Walter Langbein and Stanley Schumm ( 1958 ) , a decrease in precipitation causing vegetation change from forest to grassland would result in only a 30% increase in sediment yield . Late and Transitional Archaic overbank deposition apparently increased to at least this degree , yet there is no evidence in pollen profiles of grassland vegetation during this period . Data presented by Knox ( 1983 ) indicate that changes in mean annual precipitation above 650 millimeters per annum have little effect on flood size . Modern precipitation in the Susquehanna , Delaware , and Ohio Basins is approximately 900 millimeters per annum . Thus , for decreased rainfall to affect either the sediment yield of drainage basins or the magnitude of overbank flooding , arid conditions would have been required , but , as noted above , there is no evidence of vegetation changes in the Late Holocene pollen data of the Middle Atlantic region that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pollen data cited as evidence for a warm and dry period would indicate a shift in overstory forest composition involving an increase in xeric species , although , again as noted above , this interpretation of the pollen profile is subject to challenge ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Vento and Rollins ( 1989 ) and Vento and colleagues ( 2008 ) accept the hypothesis of a warm and dry Sub-Boreal , and they attribute rapid vertical accretion to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns . Based on Knoxs ( 1983 ) discussion of the effects of zonal versus meridional circulation , Vento and colleagues ( 2008 ) and Joyce ( 1988 ) point to an increase in meridional circulation that resulted in more frequent cyclonic storms , causing more frequent overbank flooding . Patricia Miller , Frank Vento , and James Marine ( 2007 ) note that such an interpretation does not depend on an overall decrease in either precipitation , vegetation , or both to explain the increase in alluvial deposition . Although there are at present no independent supporting data for a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollen data , as is the hypothesis of severe climatic change ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> Miller and colleagues ( 2003 ) further note that there is no conclusive evidence of a widespread warm and dry climate such as that hypothesized by Carbone ( 1976 ) and by Curry and Custer ( 1982 ) for the period between 5000 and 2600 BP . Rather , data suggest that modern levels of temperature and precipitation generally prevailed in both the eastern United States and the Ohio River drainage basin . Cyclonic storms , as evidenced by flood scouring and the deposition of coarse-grained material on the floodplain , likely occurred with greater frequency than in previous periods . Floodplain and terrace soils supported mesophytic species such as beech , oak , tulip tree , ash , sugar maple , and walnut . Upland soils supported forest communities dominated by chestnut , hickory , and oak ( Figures 1.11.4 ) . The Late Holocene forest differed from the modern forest primarily in age structure , containing trees of all ages , with a mosaic of gaps caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regeneration . These gaps gave rise to a variety of edible resources that grow best in the open , including blackberries , raspberries , and a variety of tubers ( Miller et al . 2003 ) . <p> &lt;insert figs. 1.21.4 about here&gt; <p> &lt;1&gt;Geomorphic Fluvial Evidence <p> With regard to the fluvial geomorphic evidence , based on more than thirty years of personal experience in the region , I see a clear patterning in the stratigraphic record that supports my contention that rivers and streams in the region responded to these warm and drier climatic conditions by undergoing more active lateral channel migration along smaller drainage lines or more rapid vertical accretion along the major drainage lines , often reflected in the stratigraphic profiles by distinct autogenic flood events . If we briefly examine some representative sites that have a lengthy Holocene record from the Ohio , Susquehanna , and Delaware Basins , it becomes clear that the Sub-Boreal , and thus also Transitional Archaic , culture period was one of environmental change . All of these sites occur on Late Wisconsin terraces that contain a thick Holocene package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cambic B horizons . At some sites , the cambic B horizons are immediately overlain by a surface A horizon ; at others , they are capped by a cumulic A horizon that dates to the Sub-Atlantic climate interval ( 30001750 BP ) . The stratigraphic horizons and thickness of the Holocene soils that cap the Transitional Archaic horizons reflect variables such as channel morphology , height of the terrace above the active stream channel , valley morphology , and stream order . <p> The Leetsdale Site ( Miller 2012 ) and Point State Park Site ( Blades et al . 2008 ) on the Ohio River at Pittsburgh document rapid rates of late Middle Holocene vertical accretion . At the Leetsdale Site , the Transitional Archaic period encompasses , in places , more than 1 meter of overbank deposition in less than 1,100 years . This soil package , or defined allostratigraphic unit , in Area 1 consists of a series of nested lamellae ( stacked AC/C couplets ) that document a series of relatively high magnitude flood events . The rates of vertical accretion for the Sub-Boreal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preceding Atlantic or subsequent Sub-Atlantic climatic phase . In addition , in Area 2 , which is situated closer to the active river channel , the soil profiles show clear evidence for channel migration and incision of the terrace . <p> In the upper reach of the Allegheny River near Tionesta , Pennsylvania , recent investigations ( Verbka , Vento , and Shaffer 2013 ) at the Hunter Station Bridge Site identified more than 2.5 meters of Holocene alluvium with artifacts occurring throughout the profile . Once again , the Transitional Archaic horizons at the site include a cambic B horizon documenting continuous slow vertical accretion of the terrace . <p> At the Jacobs , Gould Island , and Memorial Park Sites on the North and West Branches of the Susquehanna River ( Vento et al . 2008 ) , the Sub-Boreal phase alluvial deposits form a thick cambic B horizon documenting continuous slow vertical accretion of the terrace between 4200 and 3000 BP . In the Route 11/15 corridor , extending from near Selinsgrove to Liverpool , Pennsylvania , along the main stem of the Susquehanna River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with thick cambic B horizons that , in places , were intercalated with coarse-grained autogenic flood events ( C horizons ) . <p> Soil profiles at the Smithfield Beach , Frenchtown , and Shohola Bridge Sites in the Delaware River valley document increased rates of overbank deposition during this time . At the Shohola Bridge Site , much like at Leetsdale , multiple AC/C horizons represent continuous flood deposition between very short lived episodes of stability for the period 4200 to 3000 BP . At the Frenchtown Site on the Middle Delaware River , the Transitional Archaic is evidenced by slow vertical accretion of the floodplain . I contend that the higher rates of vertical accretion along the larger drainage lines , the absence of cumulic A horizons documenting long episodes of stability , and the more active lateral channel migration along smaller internal drainages all support the presence of generally warmer and drier climatic conditions favoring increased rates of surface runoff , higher sediment yield to streams , and thus also higher rates of vertical accretion . <p> In the Upper Delaware River valley , the Transitional Archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holocene ( 50003200 BP ) phase ( Phase IV ) of reworking and aggradation ( Stinchcomb et al . 2012 ) . Following Middle Holocene ( 60005000 BP ) incision , average flood deposit grain size decreases , and widespread soil formation occurs along the higher T2a alluvial terrace . Adjacent to the T2a is a lower T2b terrace that contains evidence of rapid sedimentation and multiple weakly developed buried soils . Because overbank sediment was accumulating along the lower surfaces ( active floodplain ) , the higher , less flood-prone T2a surface became more suitable for habitation . This T2a buried soil often holds evidence of Late and Transitional Archaic occupation . Carbon isotope composition of organic matter from Delaware River alluvial soils suggests that the Transitional Archaic period follows a shift from higher to lower C4:C3 plants , centered at 4500 BP ( Stinchcomb et al . 2013 ) . This shift may be related to major climate reorganization ( the 4200 BP event and Middle to Late Holocene transition ) , incision and riparian development after 60005000 BP , or both . <p> Geomorphic evidence ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and dry climatic conditions comes from the recent excavations at the Beech Ridge Site near Dover , Delaware ( Barse and Marston 2006 ) , where a deep , strongly weathered paleosol containing Dalton Hardaway points is overlain by a thick package of windblown sands . The late Middle Holocene component of these overlying sands is thicker and slightly coarser grained than that of sands at lower and higher levels . In fact , much of the aeolian sand package appears to have been emplaced during the late Middle Holocene . The increased rates of aeolian deflation and deposition during this time were in response to warm and dry climatic conditions . Over the years , Dennis Curry , much to his credit , has argued for aeolian deflation and subsequent burial of prehistoric sites during the Holocene on the Maryland Coastal Plain . There is now strong evidence along the entire eastern Coastal Plain for a period of late Middle Holocene aeolian deflation , proving him correct . <p> &lt;1&gt;Geomorphic Evidence Outside the Middle Atlantic Region <p> In Georgia , David Hurst Thomass extensive work on Late Archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollins , and Thomas 2011 ) documents a shift in settlement due to a potential marsh regression of 1.5 meters in the period 4000 to 3500 BP . Frank Vento and Patricia Stahlman ( 2011 ) , working on now-buried paleosols on Saint Catherines Island , have documented , in places , more than 3 meters of Holocene aeolian sands , with a thick portion of this package occurring during the Sub-Boreal climatic phase . <p> Other researchers in the region , conducting sea level and tidal channel migration studies , argue for a late Middle Holocene sea level regression or standstill at this time ( e.g. , Gayes et al . 1992 ) . Timothy Chowns ( 2009 ) notes that , around 4000 BP , sea levels regressed , changing the coastal processes from tidal to wave dominated , which in turn favored tidal channel migration and spit development . Recent studies in central Florida indicate drying on the basis of a change from mangrove swamps to yellow and loblolly pines during the late Middle Holocene ( e.g. , Rich , Vento , and Vega 2011 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Atlantic region , there is a large set of data that documents a clear decrease in hemlock pollen as a proxy for warm and dry conditions during the period 4200 to 3000 BP . Recent pollen studies completed on cores extracted from Chesapeake Bay ( Willard and Bernhardt 2004 ) show clear decreases in pine pollen in association with atmospheric cooling at 8000 BP and again during the Little Ice Age ( 700400 BP ) . In the data for the period 4200 to 3000 BP , there is a large increase in pine pollen , suggesting warmer and probably drier climatic conditions . In their recent paper on pollen extracted from a deep core along Sandy Run Creek on the Georgia Coastal Plain , Heidi LaMoreaux , George Brook , and John Knox ( 2009 ) show wetter conditions than now from 4500 to 1000 BP and a sharp decrease in groundwater levels , aridity , and lower stream discharges beginning at 4500 BP . LaMoreaux , Brook , and Knox argue that this drying reflected increased winter solar radiation that raised winter temperatures , with the replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the absence of the Laurentian ice sheet , there would have been less orbitally induced seasonality , thus weakening both the polar and subtropical jet streams and opening the door for other climate change processes such as the El NioSouthern Oscillation ( ENSO ) . Consistent with a less stormy jet stream pattern , there was a decrease in meridional flow of moist Gulf air into eastern North America and the Upper Mississippi Valley after the Middle Holocene climatic optimum , or hypsithermal , leading to drier conditions and reduced river discharges . That said , much of the problem to date is the dearth of detailed and comprehensive archaeobotanical studies for the Transitional Archaic period in the Middle Atlantic region . If warming and drying did dominate the climate , then we should see evidence in the form of grassland expansion , an increase in pine , evidence for lower water tables , and the desiccation of swamps and bogs . Clearly , there need to be additional pollen , macrobotanical , and phytolith studies on soils that target the period 4200 to 3000 BP . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climatic episode ( beginning as early as 6000 BP ) and resultant high alluvial deposition fit with data from the Upper Ohio and Upper and Middle Susquehanna and Delaware River drainage basins . Stratigraphic evidence , in the form of coarse-grained vertical and lateral accretionary deposits , especially along the first- , second- , and third-order streams within the basins , documents the increased occurrence of large storms after 6000 BP . Similar stratigraphic evidence in the northern Midwest supports the idea of more frequent large floods after 6000 BP ( Knox , McDowell , and Johnson 1981 ) . The increased rates of overbank deposition along the major drainage lines ( i.e. , the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers ) and more active lateral channel migration and incision along their tributary streams precluded the development of cumulic A horizons during the Sub-Boreal climatic phase ( 42003000 BP ) . <p> Not surprisingly , the incision of the Pre-Boreal and Boreal valley-fill deposits in most areas of these basins occurred about 6000 BP , coincident with increased meridional circulation , a condition that promoted strong cyclonic storms via the lifting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry air masses out of Canada ( Grissinger , Murphey , and Little 1981 ; Vento and Fitzgibbons 1987 ) . This episode of Middle Holocene incision and more frequent large floods may be responsible for the general paucity or near absence of Paleoindian , Early Archaic , and Middle Archaic sites in low-terrace contexts along most of the streams in these basins . On the other hand , there are sites along the major rivers in the Middle Atlantic region such as Leetsdale , Point State Park , Shawnee Minisink , Shawnee Island , City Island , Smithfield Beach , Cremard , Memorial Park , High Bank , Piney Island , and Canfield Island , as well as the Route 11/15 sites ( Bressler , Maietta , and Rockey 1983 ; Hart et al . 1995 ; Kent 1996 ; Miller et al . 2003 ; Miller , Marine , and Vento 2007 ; Schuldenrein and Vento 2002 ; Vento and Rollins 1989 ; Vento et al . 1992 , 2008 ; Kurt Carr , personal communication 2014 ) that clearly contain intact artifact-bearing remnants of fine-grained overbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see Figures 1.11.4 ) . <p> During the period 4200 to 3000 BP , the genetic stratigraphic package on the lowermost Port Huron and Valley Heads terraces in the Ohio , Susquehanna , and Delaware Basins marks various episodes of erosion and deposition that can be attributed to atmospherically induced changes in climate . The typically thick , often mottled , cambic B horizons or C horizons of the Sub-Boreal were likely emplaced during warm and dry conditions , probably in association with meridional stabilization of the Bermuda-Azores anticyclone over eastern North America and the increased importance of warm and dry zonal flow ( much as in the 1930s ) that reduced vegetative cover , increased surface runoff , and promoted vertical accretion on low terraces within the basin . This situation occurs when the Bermuda-Azores high becomes particularly large and strong and retrogrades westward over the eastern portion of North America . This decreases the likelihood of precipitation while simultaneously advecting warm , dry air from the Southwest . Such conditions often occur during present-day summers . <p> As noted earlier , the decline of hemlock ( Pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3000 BP ) supports the presence of warm and dry conditions during this time . The absence of well-developed cumulic A horizons and associated floodplain instability in the period 4200 to 3000 BP may also be attributed to these conditions . The forest of the Sub-Boreal ( Pollen Zone C-2 ) was dominated by oak and hickory , and there is a marked reduction in pine , birch , and alder ( Prentice , Bartlein , and Webb 1991:2047 ) . A dramatic decline in hemlock that began around 5000 BP ( Haas and McAndrews 2000:81 ) continued throughout this interval , whose cultures include those of the Late and Transitional Archaic periods ( Figure 1.1 ) . The warm and dry climate of the Sub-Boreal phase , which reduced vegetative cover and increased erosion , is associated with floodplain instability and the formation of mottled Bw horizons and C horizons along larger streams in the Middle Atlantic region ( Figure 1.1 ; Vento and Rollins 1989 ; Vento et al . 1992 , 2008:22 ) . <p> By 3000 BP , the climate abruptly transitioned to warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandic ( 17501200 BP ) , and Neo-Atlantic ( 1100750 BP ) climatic episodes mark a transition to warm and moist , cool and moist , and warm and moist conditions , respectively . The transition from the previous climatic episode allowed for several hundred years of floodplain stability and subsequent long-term development of A horizons . Clearly , the effect of meridional circulation , and the associated cyclonic and convectional storms , was much reduced during these climatic periods ; a subsequent return to more abundant hemlock pollen from its low levels during the warm and dry Sub-Boreal indicates lowered rates of evapotranspiration and more effective precipitation . <p> Cooler and moister climatic phases such as the Scandic ( 17501200 BP ) and Pacific ( 700400 BP ) effectively arrested development of A horizons as a result of frequent large floods that favored rapid vertical accretion ( cambic B horizons and autogenic units of coarse-grained C horizons ) on low terraces within the Middle Atlantic region . This may be a result of an increase in tropical storm ( i.e. , hurricane ) frequency or more frequent cool-season flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from intensive low-pressure cells , such as those of the 1955 and 1972 tropical cycloneinduced floods , could have been rather common during these climatic phases as atmospheric flow characteristics approached those of modern times . Prior to 6000 BP , blocking effects induced by the presence of the Laurentian ice sheet would have precluded such tropically induced flood events . All of these data provide a strong argument for a marked change in the environment during the late Middle Holocene and especially during the Transitional Archaic period . <p> 2011 Drainage Changes at Ossabaw , St. Catherines , and Sapelo Sounds and Their Influence on Island Morphology and Spit Building on St. Catherines Island , Georgia .

The firstEnlightenment liberalismstresses the development and exercise of our capacity for autonomy , understood as " individual self-direction " and entailing a " sustained rational examination of self , others , and social practices " ; this is the liberalism of not only Kant and Mill but also a number of contemporary thinkers , including Don Herzog , Stephen Macedo , Jeremy Waldron , and the preeminent Kantians ( Barbara Herman , Christine Korsgaard , Onora ONeill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity and the toleration that encourages it , where diversity is understood simply as " differences among individuals and groups over such matters as the nature of a good life , sources of moral authority , reason versus faith , and the like " ; this is the liberalism of not only Madison and Isaiah Berlin but also contemporary thinkers such as Galston himself , Charles Larmore , and Donald Moon . These two varieties of liberal theory are often mutually supportingas Galston puts it , " the exercise of autonomy yields diversity , while the fact of diversity protects and nourishes autonomy " but in a surprising number of cases they conflict , whether over the accommodation of group difference , the design of civic education , or the promotion of liberal values internationally . In fact , much of the so-called **27;1753;TOOLONG debate is an intramural affair , pitting Enlightenment and Reformation liberals against one another . <p> One might reasonably ask where John Rawls , arguably the greatest political philosopher of the twentieth century , would fall in this debate . He certainly had many Enlightenment-liberal credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Korsgaard , and ONeill ) , lectured on Kant extensively , and characterized his magnum opus , A Theory of Justice ( 1971 ) , as " highly Kantian in nature . " By the same token , though , Rawlss later work Political Liberalism ( 1993 ) " applies the principle of toleration to philosophy itself , " thus taking a diversity-based approach that has been a major influence on such Reformation liberals as Galston , Larmore , and Moon . We might therefore understand Rawlss intellectual trajectory as the opposite of the historical one : it begins with the Enlightenment and ends by circling back to the Reformation . <p> This depiction of his trajectory is far too crude , however . Political Liberalism may be a Reformation-liberal text , but is Theory really an Enlightenment-liberal oneor , more precisely , is it a Kantian-liberal one ? Many scholars have called Rawlss Kantian credentials into question , including Kerstin Budde , Otfried Hffe , Oliver Johnson , Larry Krasnoff , and Andrew Levine ( see Budde 2007 , Hffe 1984 , Johnson 1974 , Krasnoff 1999 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larmore ) have discerned certain justificatory ambiguities in Theory , such as the commingling of Enlightenment-liberal and Reformation-liberal elements . Most importantly , Rawls himself saw a strong continuity between the arguments of Theory and Political Liberalism , suggesting that the Kantianism of the former work may have been oversold , not only by himself but by others as well . <p> I will therefore begin in chapter 1 by showing just how Kantian Rawls was during his most Kantian periodroughly , from Theory of Justice to his " Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory " ( 1980 ) and " Social Unity and Primary Goods " ( 1982 ) . I demonstrate here that Rawlss theory is even more Kantian in this period than has generally been recognized : from his Kantian conceptions of person and society to his construction procedure ( including the formal constraints of the concept of right , the veil of ignorance , and the thin theory of the good ) and on through the principles , institutions , and psychology of justice that this procedure generates , his insights track those of Kant nearly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this period are possibleas Rawls himself argues and as I will show in chapter 7but their essentials are profoundly and almost unremittingly Kantian . <p> The interpretive work of chapter 1 provides the essential backdrop for the reconstructive task of part 2 ( chapters 26 ) , which shows just how dependent Rawlss arguments for the most distinctive features of justice as fairnessnamely the lexical priorities of right , political liberty , civil liberty , and fair equality of opportunity plus the difference principleare upon his extreme and controversial Kantian conception of the person . Its very extremity and controversiality will only become clear , however , in the process of ( re ) constructing his arguments for these features : through a procedure of " backwards engineering , " I will show that any conception of the person that is capable of grounding the arguments for these features must be one that is itself grounded in Kants model of finite rational agency , properly elaborated . These reconstructions of Rawlss arguments are required because either ( 1 ) they are incomplete ( as with the priority of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are basically missing ( as with the priority of fair equality of opportunity ) . Moreover , the principles of justice that these arguments sustain play such a central , consistent role in the various incarnations of Rawlss theoryfrom Theory ( 1971 ) and Political Liberalism ( 1993 ) to Justice as Fairness : A Restatement ( 2001 ) that flaws in their justification imperil his evolving political project . This reconstructive task occupies the heart of my book , supported by the prior interpretive work of chapter 1 , which not only offers materials for this task but also assures us that a Kantian reconstruction does no violence to Rawlss texts . <p> I begin this task in chapter 2 by presenting a more detailed and comprehensive Kantian conception of the person than Rawls uses in his own works , but one that is required to justify his theorys most distinctive features . This conception of the person , based upon Kants own model of finite rational agency , is a hierarchy of Kantian conceptions of autonomy : in descending order , they are Kantian moral autonomy , Kantian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this hierarchy offer the most compelling interpretations of their parent concepts and can be reached along both deductive and inductive routes . The first route utilizes a procedure analogous to Rawlss four-stage sequence to derive the lower conceptions from higher ones along with their associated plans and rules , while the second constructs an ideal cognitive-developmental psychology , an epicyclic system using an iterative model of agency to explain the emergence of higher conceptions from lower ones . This hierarchy of Kantian conceptions will be used in later chapters to ground a parallel hierarchy of lexical priorities , with the priorities of right and political liberty at the top , the priority of civil liberty in the middle , and the priority of fair equality of opportunity ( or FEO ) at the bottom . This rich system of relationships is depicted graphically in figure 1 . Notice that all priorities as well as their grounding conceptions of autonomy can be traced back to a Kantian conception of moral autonomya result anticipated by Kant in his Groundwork , as I shall argue ( see GMM 4:41517 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for the distinctive features of his theory and show that only those arguments securely grounded on the hierarchical conception of persons presented in chapter 2 offer genuine promise . Chapter 3 does this for the priorities of right and political liberty , arguing that they are founded on a Kantian conception of moral autonomy and also that ( contrary to Rawlss assertion in his famous " Reply to Habermas " ) political liberty takes priority over civil liberty in his theory , giving it a somewhat civic-humanist character ( PL 206 , 413 ) . Chapter 4 reveals the grave inadequacy of two of his three arguments for the priority of ( civil ) liberty and shows how the third and most promising one , which grounds this priority on a Kantian conception of personal autonomy , can be bolstered . Chapter 5 offers for the first time a defense of the priority of fair equality of opportunitywhich is entirely ( and peculiarly ) missing from the corpus of Rawlss textsa defense that is constructed with existing resources in Theory ( including the Aristotelian Principle and the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-realization through work , which has Marxist undertones . Finally , chapter 6 explicates and gives additional support for his notorious difference principle . I contend here that his latter-day defenses of the difference principle ( especially those present in Justice as Fairness : A Restatement ) are inadequate and that the most compelling case for it can be made by means of a reconstructed version of an earlier defensenamely , the formal one elaborated in Theory 26 ( see esp . TJ 13235 ) . This reconstructed defense relies , though , on a whole series of Kantian assumptions about asceticism , the unavoidable ends of duty and finitude , and the essential nature of persons . As one moves through these five reconstructive chapters , the extent to which justice as fairness depends upon specifically Kantian presuppositions becomes increasingly apparent , strongly reinforcing the conclusions of chapter 1 . <p> In part 3 of the book , I turn to " reflective equilibrium , " Rawlss innovative technique of moral justification , and to its role in vindicating his Kantian conception of the person . In chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theory and " The Independence of Moral Theory " ( 1975 ) , and point to its ambiguous treatment of moral objectivity . This ambiguity is reflected in Rawlss evasive answer to a central question : how can we bring about a coincidence of reflective judgments among moral agents , which he maintains is " a necessary condition for objective moral truths " ( IMT 290 ) ? One answer suggested by Rawlsnamely , a reliance on " self-evident first principles , " like Kants practical postulate of freedomis rejected during the 1980s in favor of another : by way of preexisting ( near ) consensus on considered convictions of justice found in " a democratic society under modern conditions " ( IMT 289 ; KCMT 3056 ) . I enumerate Rawlss powerful reasons for rejecting the first answer and then describe in great detail the mature theory that he eventually developed from the second answer in Political Liberalism . <p> In chapter 8 , I contend that the Reformation-liberal answer given in Political Liberalism to the above questionroughly , that justice as fairness can serve as the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern liberal democraciesis impoverished in at least two senses . First and more narrowly , no comprehensive doctrine but the Kantian one is capable of endorsing the strong Kantian conception of the person that underwrites justice as fairness . Thus , no overlapping consensus on justice as fairness is possible ; the best that can be hoped for is an overlapping consensus on a class of liberal political conceptions of justice , with justice as fairness as just one competitor conception among others , its centrality determined through political competition and the strength of the supporting socioeconomic interests . Second and more broadly , even if we assumed justice as fairness could act as the focus of an overlapping consensus , the system of justification involved would offer us little moral guidance , whether in a domestic or an international context , regarding the appropriate width and content of overlapping consensus : because political liberalism has no independent criterion of reasonableness , it can not refuse extension of the scope of toleration to include illiberal , even indecent groups and nations . Moreover , its agnosticism regarding the width and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural relativism , would lead to a dramatically diminished role for political philosophy , effectively turning it into a handmaid of the social sciences . These are sharply revisionist claims , of course , but I believe they are borne out by the chapters arguments , which as a whole suggest the profound poverty of political liberalism and Reformation liberalism more generally . <p> Finally , the conclusion offers an alternative way to answer the question of justification , showing that a Kantian conception of the person must , unsurprisingly , be grounded in a Kantian way : on a practical postulate of freedom as a necessary presupposition of finite rational agency . I argue here , however , that this defense need not rely upon Kants transcendental idealism , that is , we can dispense with metaphysics in grounding Kantian liberalismeven the " thin " metaphysics of Kantrendering the postulate potentially ratifiable by a wide variety of persons as well as belief systems . This justificatory approach is Rawlss " road not taken , " and by following it ourselves , we can turn justice as fairness into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of Theory and helping secure its place within the canon ( Frost 1969 , 105 ) . <p> Even if this reconstruction of Rawlss Kantian liberalism is found uncompelling by some persons , it can still be seen by them as a worthy companion to other cosmopolitan Enlightenment liberalismsfor example , Millian plural-perfectionism , Benthamite or Sidgwickian liberal utilitarianism , and Lockean religious liberalismin the fight against illiberal principles and institutions around the globe , including theocratic , secular authoritarian , and totalitarian regimes and their sustaining ideologies . While Reformation liberalism is virtually impotent in such contexts , too unsure of its own relevance in illiberal societies , universalistic Enlightenment liberalisms are not hobbled by such doubts . Their very diversity is a source of strength , in fact , because different Enlightenment liberalisms are likely to appeal to different individuals , groups , and societies . As I contend in the conclusion , these liberalisms offer us the vision of a liberal world order ( " a republicanism of all states , together and separately , " as Kant put it ) and a mode of justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as members of various religious , racial , and national groups ( MM 6:354 ) . Their optimistic cosmopolitanism makes them worthy of our allegiance andif the arguments of this book are soundmakes the Kantian liberalism of a reconstructed Rawls the most worthy of them all .

Most prominent among the party leaders who supported this policy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1979 a power struggle between Amin and Taraki ended with Taraki 's murder and Amin 's assumption of the presidency . This development led the Soviet Union to begin planning to intervene . The Soviets had become convinced that Amin 's harsh policies could only lead to the defeat of his government , which could in turn lead to the emergence of a government unfriendly to the Soviet Union in a state on the Soviet border . To avoid this eventuality the Soviet Union began moving troops into Afghanistan on December 19 , 1979 . An effort to arrest Amin on December 27 led to his death . Later that day , Babrik Karmal , leader of a faction of the PDPA more moderate than that of Taraki and Amin , proclaimed in a radio broadcast ( described as originating in Afghanistan but actually coming from Soviet territory ) his seizure of power and a request for Soviet assistance . <p> Over the next seven years the Soviet Union found itself entangled in a frustrating guerilla war . Soviet troops and the Afghan army were unable to defeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the use of such tactics as Afghan air force bombing of Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan . Finally , in December 1986 , Mikhail Gorbachev , by this time leader of the Soviet Union , informed Najibullah , who had replaced Karmal as president of Afghanistan , that the Soviet Union would be withdrawing its troops that year . This led to the conclusion of an April 14 , 1988 , agreement at UN-mediated talks , ostensibly between Pakistan and Afghanistan but involving the Soviet Union and United States as well . Under the pact , Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed on mutual noninterference in one another 's internal affairs . The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to guarantee the pact but also acknowledged that the United States had the right to continue providing arms to the mujaheddin if the Soviet Union continued to aid the Afghan government . The Soviet Union further undertook to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan . Its withdrawal was complete in February 1989 . <p> The Soviet withdrawal did not end the war . The PDPA held its own for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Soviet Union each agreed to suspend provision of arms to the side it was supporting . Continued UN efforts to mediate between the Afghan combatants failed , and the Afghan government , crippled by defections of military units , finally collapsed in April 1992 . The rebel groups installed a government , but there has been much fighting among them ever since . <p> Third-state reaction to the Soviet invasion was intense and negative . Pakistan and the PRC continued their arms supply . The United States also provided arms , first supplying Soviet-made arms with Egyptian assistance and subsequently providing Western arms such as land mines and portable surface-to-air missiles , first British and later American . Iran also provided aid to mujaheddin groups . <p> Other sanctions were imposed as well . The United States refused to ratify an important strategic arms treaty it had negotiated with the Soviet Union . A number of states opposed economic sanctions on the Soviet Union , including the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , New Zealand , and the European Community . A number of Western and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and Yugoslavia were also harshly critical . A number of states , including the United States , boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games in protest of the invasion . The 1981 Islamic Conference demanded an immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan . Similarly , the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of Nonaligned States in that year also called for a foreign troop withdrawal . Strong opposition was also expressed in the General Assembly ; a resolution calling for the withdrawal of " foreign " troops from Afghanistan was adopted each year from 1980 through 1987 , attracting more votes in 1987 than in 1980 ( 123 compared to 104 ) . At the same time the secretary-general began efforts at mediation in 1981 , which continued until a successful agreement was finally achieved , as noted above . <p> All of these reactions had an effect on the Soviet Union 's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan ; negative reactions to its invasion had caused a decline in its relations with the third world , increased difficulty in negotiating arms-control agreements and trade arrangements with Western states , and contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Gorbachev 's desire to reduce reliance on the use of force in international relations , the general worsening in the Soviet Union 's international situation caused by its actions in Afghanistan clearly contributed to the Soviet decision to reverse its policy . The strength of the mujaheddin also contributed to the decision to leave , and that strength reflected in part aid given the guerillas by third states . <p> This conflict was a cross-border invasion aimed at obtaining the invader 's desired outcome in a civil war by installing in the invaded state a government friendly to the invading state , albeit one lacking any appreciable support in the invaded state . The invasion was justified by false claims that the invading forces had been invited to enter the invaded state . Third states reacted harshly , providing military support to guerillas fighting the invaded state and cooling their relations with it as well . The invaders ultimately decided to withdraw , realizing that the diplomatic and military costs of attempting to remain were simply too high . <p> Afghanistan/Pakistan ( 1961 ) <p> At the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged its border with Pakistan , known as the Durand Line , claiming the border between the two states should rest instead on the Indus River . Somewhat contradictorily , it strongly supported the idea that the Pakhtun ( Pathan ) people should be able to create an independent state , Pakhtunistan . Since Pakhtun tribes lived on either side of the Durand Line , the creation of such a state would also serve to remove Pakistan from that boundary ; to the extent that Afghanistan could dominate the new state , Pakhtunistan 's creation would serve the same Afghan end as a change in the border . <p> In September 1960 , Afghanistan 's push for an independent Pakhtunistan led it to bribe the ruler of one of the small states within Pakistan to attack one of his feudatories . In May 1961 , after Pakistan had accused Afghanistan of fomenting trouble between the two rulers , fighting broke out between the two states .

One may speculate that this stand was at least partly motivated by the hostility to Pakistan , which had aligned itself with the United States in the Cold War .

In line with this approach , the United States offered its good offices to help resolve the dispute but did not go so far as formally proposing itself as a mediator , and offered no suggestions regarding the basic dispute . <p> This small conflict was a border dispute left over from the period of British colonial rule on the Indian subcontinent . Afghanistan was seeking to alter its border by the use of force and also by manipulating the doctrine of self-determination .

By 1715 the city was far different from what it had been in 1590 . There were now large geometrical public squares with statues of the King at their focal point .

The gnawing in your belly was almost as strong after supper as before it . Your older brothers had sat in silence , not quite staring the other way , but deliberately avoiding your eyes . Your exhausted mother is heavy with yet another child . <p> The next morning , you packed your other shirt in a little canvas bag , put on your hat , and set off alone on the road to Paris , some eighty miles away . A three- or four-day walk . Finding a straw stack last night was no problem , for the harvest has just ended . A cousin on your mothers side of the family , who is a cook and lives with a printers family on the rue Saint-Jacques , can be counted on to put you up for a few nights when you reach Paris . Somewhere , somehow , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cellar cleaned out , manure loaded onto a wagon , water carried upstairs , or ashes removed from fireplaces . You walk along the dusty road in the August sun . When the cousin had gone to Paris , they had had to find someone with whom she could travel ; for only women of i 'll repute , or the very poor and the aged , walked the highroad alone . Your name is Jean . <p> Are you fictional ? Are you historical ? The answer is : A bit of both . Until you marry , or more accurately , if you marryor until you commit a major crime and get caughtno one will ask you for your surname : Jean will suffice . You lack the cash to be apprenticed to an artisan , so your only hope is to become a household servant , somewhere in the capital . Work in an inn is a possibility , or work in a stable . <p> Are you part of history ? Yes , but not the high , lofty type of history that centers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and villages to , as the phrase went , " seek their fortune " in the capital . Their parents had loved them , but by the time adolescents were fifteen or sixteen , they were considered more than grown-up ; and there simply were too many mouths to feed every night . The Parisian population in the seventeenth century was not yet self-sustaining , that is , more infants died than reached childbearing age . Without the steady arrival of teenagers such as Jean , the population of the capital actually would have declined ; and since that population is known to have roughly doubled over the seventeenth century , there clearly were thousands of young migrants such as Jean . There is something startlingly contemporary about teenage migration to Paris in the seventeenth century ; for today it still occurs , legally , vaguely legally , or downright illegally , around every great urban center of the world . <p> Normans , Picards , Bretons , young people from the Beauce and from Champagne who know how to take care of babies , make fires , rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some sense of pride at hailing from a particular market town or provincecame to Paris in search of work . If a foreigner asked them where they came from , " France " was the immediate reply ; but if a French person asked the same question , the name of the province of their birth was the answer . These young migrants would seek out relatives , often not all that close , or other young people from their village , and would beg for shelter ; and as in all cultures of poverty , the hospitality they received was often accompanied with a warning that it was temporary . It was discouraging to walk the streets , looking for work or for a handout . On each street , in each quarter , the artisans , their apprentices , and the common laborers knew one another : they drank and caroused together . Merchants and their wives conversed as they set up their stands , all the while eyeing passersby or " idlers , " to ensure that they did not filch a sausage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the street sociability of the capital . Knowing someone , and being introduced , was almost indispensable . <p> At certain hours , traffic was horrendous . Coachmen shouted , " Make way for the Duchess of Such-and-Such , " and in reply arms would fly up , with an obscene gesture . Clergymen , judges , attorneys , and physiciansin the gowns and caps appropriate to their profession and rankmajestically skirted the slop-filled potholes in the street , their trains or capes held up by livery boys dressed in the colors of their master . Wearing livery was a source of pride , not servitude : it indicated that the wearer belonged to a household , that he ate regularly , that he had a roof over his head . <p> Street scenes certainly changed over the course of the seventeenth century . As the decades passed , there were more richly gilded and carved coaches than ever before . Sedan chairs proliferated , as did great two-wheeled carts loaded with huge barrels of wine .

There would be serious epidemics , that is , plague , in the first quarter of the century , and in the 1680s cold weather ruined wheat crops and drove up the prices for flour and bread . When bread prices climbed , the city fathers would legislate to keep them down , and they would post militia guards at flour and bread markets , to reduce the danger that the hungry poor would riot . Monasteries and prominent , well-off , and devout Parisians would open soup kitchens . The typical Parisian cared little about the power relations between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed decisions about bread prices , excise taxes on wine , and regulations concerning the places where one could work and the hours during which work could be done . Over the century , a more hands-on regulatory administration would be created , along with special police and judicial powers and officials . Heaps of legislation , decrees , and orders had been pasted on walls or announced by town-criers , but enforcement remained ineffectual until well into the 1660s . <p> The laws regarding work rules , marketing , quality-control in manufacturing , acceptable or unacceptable street behavior , and even drinking , gambling , and loudness in cabarets , were much more coherently promulgated and enforced in the reign of Louis XIV than they had been over the previous centuries . Parisians had little choice but to conform to these state-enforced rules , most of which came down from high , that is , from the king in council through the office of lieutenant of police , created in 1667 . <p> The word police in seventeenth-century France was a very general moral and legal concept that extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced . Police meant not just the good society , but the way to live the good life together , in community , according to divine and natural laws . On the one hand , police meant the governments duty to lift up the wayward , protect any and all persons and provide them with charity , and repress all threatening , violent and heretical behavior and thought . The laws establishing police were not only moral but religious and political . They all came down from the king for the good of each and everyone ; and individuals had little if any right to challenge , in court , the royal definition of the best life-style and the best community . <p> For almost two centuries , historians have used the term " absolutism " to characterize this new regime of laws and police power , be it for Paris in particular or for the entire realm . The word , in its political and legal significance , simply means total , complete , without appeal , unquestionable . Royal power was not only deemed to be legitimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal or spiritual grounds for disobeying it . <p> Confronted by the lieutenant of polices coercive powers to legislate and enforce a virtually religious utopia in the form of a safer , cleaner , morally conformist , and more regimented and more prosperous Paris , the old city officials saw their power decline and their functions become largely ceremonial . Political emasculation in the name of absolute legal and royal authority ? Yes , in a sense . While the old , late-medieval oligarchical city government run by merchants , lawyers , and guild officers had not been democratic , there had been at least a modicum of citizen participation in the Paris H ( tel de Ville . <p> Could some medieval centuries actually have been more " democratic " than the Parisian governance prevailing in the seventeenth century ? This idea challenges our one-directional sense of progress involving civic rights for individuals and government by laws established by and for the people . Such was the case , however , in the history of Paris , in no small measure because the sixteenth-century movement not only to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zealous Catholic religious reform movement that had as its principal aim the conversion , the exclusion , and finally the execution or murder of Protestants .

There were more than twenty churches on the island . Along the rues <p> de la Lanterne , de la Juiverie , and du MarchT Palu , all torn down in the nineteenth <p> century , stood many medieval houses , by then subdivided into several dwellings , in <p> which lived bourgeois and notaries .

Housed there were the Parlement , Chambre des Comptes , Cour des <p> Aides , and Cour des Monnaies , together constituting the highest courts in the kingdom . <p> The Sainte-Chapelle , built in the thirteenth century as a vast reliquary for a <p> thorn from the crown of thorns , stood in the center of the great courtyard , its flFche <p> rising higher than all the buildings around it . In 1600 the interior was still little <p> changed from what it had been in Saint Louis time , except that many relics and altarpieces <p> had been added to this royal chapel , endowing its wealthy , aristocratic clergy <p> with a rich treasure . The lower chapel served as a parish church for those living in the <p> Palais and nearby streets . <p> To the Palais scurried a population as diverse in interests and status as Paris itself . <p> There were probably four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> officials such as huissiers ( doorkeepers ) who together made up the personnel of the sovereign courts .

In this maze of corridors and chambers the principal attraction remained <p> the grande salle itself , with its marble floor , heavy columns lined with statues of French <p> kings , and gold ceiling . It was considered smart to go to the grande salle , for it was a <p> favorite meeting place for distinguished people or for those who wanted to see them <p> and buy luxury goods . <p> From the gates of the Palais the street led north past the Tour de lHorloge , across the <p> Pont-au-Change to the ChGtelet and the ville ; or south across the Pont Saint-Michel to <p> the University . The Right Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the <p> commercial part of Paris , had lost this special significance as early as the fourteenth century , <p> when merchants settled on the Left Bank , or University , around the Place Maubert . <p> Before reaching the Right Bank , one passed under a fortress gate . The ChGtelet was <p> originally built as a castle to guard the bridge to the CitT , but very early it came to <p> house the courts and prisons of the prTv ( tT of Paris . Jurisdiction was both civil and <p> criminal , equivalent to that of a bailliage in the provinces , nominally under the control <p> of the prTv ( t of Paris ( not to be confused with the prTv ( t des marchands ) , who rendered justice in the kings name in the city and who , in processions , marched right after the <p> president of the Parlement and before the nobility .

Street names were <p> usually functional : the rue de la Savonnerie ( soap ) , rue de la Chausseterie ( stockings ) , <p> rue de la Cossonnerie ( fowl ) , and rue de la Lingerie ( linens ) . There merchants , as <p> many as two dozen strong , would gather along a street to sell the same products . The <p> rue de la Fripponerie contained many clothing shops where one could bargain , trade <p> in the clothes on ones back for some others , either used or new , and pay the difference . <p> Up the rue Saint-Denis from the ChGtelet , and west along the rue de la Ferronnerie , <p> stood the Church and Cemetery of the Innocents . The chapels , galleries of charnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dance of Death , and the open common graves <p> aroused the morbid curiosity of visitors in 1600 . Some parts of the cemetery were <p> reserved for the dead of special corporations , such as the hospitals of Sainte-Catherine <p> and the H ( tel-Dieu , the chapter of Saint-Germain-lAuxerrois , and the ChGtelet , but <p> most of it contained common graves for Parisians from every part of the city . The <p> earth of the Innocents was said to be remarkable , because it could manger son cadavre <p> en neuf jours ( consume its cadaver in nine days ) . When graves had to be dug again in <p> the same spot , the bones were pulled out of the earth and stored in piles along the <p> walls . Two or three common graves stood open at the same time . <p> Adjacent to the cemetery on the northwest were the Halles , a series of pavilions <p> where merchants rented stalls to sell chiefly grain , leather , cloth , and meat , and where <p> articles were sold retail and wholesale to merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apparent confusion on market days belied the stringent laws and <p> customs regulating sales , the use of land in the nearby streets , and the organization of <p> produce by its place of origin . The Normans tended to put their stands together in <p> one part of the market , to stay in the same inns , and to travel together , as did merchants <p> from other provinces and foreign countries . Commerce was still familial and <p> provincial . The houses in the market parishes of Sainte-Opportune , Saint-Jacques-dela- <p> Boucherie , Saint-Martin , and Saint-Denis were both commercial and residential , <p> with their ground floors invariably a shop , either for sales or manufacture , and the <p> upper floors living quarters for merchant or artisan families , servants , and apprentices . <p> In the midst of these stands , pavilions , inns , and houses stood several monasteries , <p> each with its own cloister , refectory , school , and gardens . They varied in size and function , <p> but like the parish churches they were filled with chapels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by various guilds over the centuries . These chapels served as <p> meeting houses for guilds and for weddings and funerals of the members . Paid masses <p> on behalf of the living and deceased members of their company were said in the guilds <p> own sanctuaries , often decorated with trowels , scissors , or some other instrument serving <p> as their emblem . <p> This commercial section was bounded on the west by an aristocratic quarter , beginning <p> with Saint-Eustache and the H ( tels de Soissons and Longueville . It extended on <p> the east as far as the H ( tel de Ville and the Place de la GrFve before it . The H ( tel de <p> Ville was an unfinished palace in the French Renaissance style in 1600 , but it served as <p> the meeting place for the bureau de villethe elected officials of the bourgeois of Paris <p> and for receiving members of the royal family and visiting dignitaries , such as ambassadors . <p> The registers of the elections and business and legal proceedings of the prTv ( t des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms for the militia , the seals of Paris , and <p> its official weights and measures . The Place de la GrFve was then much lower than the <p> present square and was frequently flooded by the Seine . In the minds of Parisians , La <p> GrFve evoked the numerous public executions that took place theredecapitation for <p> the nobility , hanging for commoners , and burning for heretics and sorcerers . People <p> living on the square rented out their windows on days of public executions . <p> Except for the area bordering the quays , Paris beyond the H ( tel de Ville and the <p> Church of Saint-Jean-en-GrFve was mainly aristocratic . The Marais , or parishes of <p> Saint-Gervais and Saint-Paul , was the most fashionable and wealthy part of the city . <p> Since the late Middle Ages , when the royal residences of Saint-Pol and the Tournelles <p> had attracted numerous aristocrats and clergymen to build in the area , the Marais had <p> been the most homogeneous and solidly aristocratic part of the city . After the demolition <p> of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its land to a president <p> of the Parlement , who built the H ( tel de Carnavalet , numerous judges and new <p> aristocrats also bought and built in the area between the H ( tel de Ville and the Bastille . <p> But the princes still set the tone . Diane de France , and later Charles de Valois , built and <p> lived in what is now the H ( tel Lamoignon ; the Guises had built a little to the northwest <p> of them ; and later , Sully settled in the rue Saint-Antoine not far from the Duke <p> of Maine . The medieval H ( tel de Sens had served as a kind of headquarters for the <p> Leaguish plots . Most of the favorites of the last Valois kingdO , Gondy , Vitryhad <p> installed themselves there , as had the Jesuits who built Saint-Louis . Gardens stretched <p> back to meet each other ; the new streets were wide enough to let carriages pass . <p> Though the least medieval section of Paris in 1600 , several monasteries , the H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Temple still assured the inhabitants that they were in the old <p> city . The Temple was a walled-in , turreted , and crenellated fortress that served as a residence for aristocrats , artisans , and debtors seeking to avoid the police of Paris . Artisans <p> could work there free from the restrictions of a guild because the grand prieur <p> defended the independence of the Temple against both the city and the monarchy . <p> The city was still very sparse west of the Halles . From the north the walls built <p> by Charles V came down abruptly to the gates of Montmartre and Saint-HonorT , to <p> disappear under the Grand Gallery of the Louvre . Outside were fields and windmills , <p> just four or five narrow streets away from Saint-Eustache . This church , begun in <p> 1532 , rose high and spacious , reflecting the wealth and status of the merchants west <p> of the Halles , and of the courtiers who lived in the houses and inns near the Louvre . <p> Richelieu was baptized there in 1586 , while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long fashionable because of its proximity to the Louvre , the area became a European <p> center of art and culture in the late sixteenth century . Catherine de MTdicis built a large <p> h ( tel there , later called the H ( tel de Soissons ( all that remains of it is the astrologers column <p> between the Bourse de Commerce and the Halles ) , and by this means attracted <p> numerous favorites to an otherwise mercantile and monotonous district of the city . <p> The rue Saint-HonorT , leading west from the Cemetery of the Innocents to the city <p> gates of Saint-HonorT , was lined with late medieval houses and inns , where courtiers <p> who had to follow the Court stayed when the king was in the Louvre . The Porte Saint- <p> HonorT , with its turrets , drawbridge , and guardians , still stood about where we today <p> find the little square between the antique shops of the Louvre and the ComTdie <p> Frantaise . The Hospice of the Quinze-Vingts , founded for the blind by Louis IX , <p> occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to where the rue de Rivoli <p> now is . In addition to the blind , numerous artisans lived there in order to be under <p> the protection of the Hospice and thus escape the restrictions of the guilds . Judging <p> from the inscriptions on the tombs of the Quinze-Vingts , the neighborhood around <p> it must have housed some of the first families to move from commerce into the service <p> of the Crown . Referred to simultaneously as noble homme , merchant , and notary to <p> the king , those interred so near the Louvre must have been some of the first robe families <p> of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . <p> Several streets ran behind the hospital , between the Louvre and the walls , approximately <p> where Napoleon was to build the Arc du Carrousel . <p> After demolition of the donjon and the south entrance of the Louvre under Francis I , <p> one gained access to the Louvre from the east side , in the rue dAutriche , which <p> descended from just east of where the Oratoire now stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Louvre , to reach the quay of the Seine . This postern <p> entrance had been built by Charles V as a part of the flamboyant , even fanciful Gothic <p> residence into which he had transformed the old fortress of Philip Augustus . After <p> crossing the drawbridge over the moat and passing under the east wing , one entered a <p> courtyard crowded with people , carriages , and horses . The people had either come out <p> of curiosity or to beg , steal , or otherwise seek their fortune in the Louvre , for the courtyard <p> was open to anyone wishing to enter . <p> The Gothic walls of the " old " Louvre on the north and east sides of the courtyard <p> must have been in sharp contrast to those facing the Seine and the west . These latter <p> had been built in the last half of the sixteenth century in the Renaissance style .

Judging <p> from the number of travel accounts that include descriptions of the rooms , it must have <p> been relatively easy to visit the interior and even the royal apartments . In both the old <p> and new parts , the rooms on the ground floor were very long and wide , with huge <p> painted beams and supporting cross beams painted with arabesques and monograms of <p> the last Valois kings . On the floor above , the ceilings were even more magnificent , <p> done in the Italian style of plaster and panels , covered with gold leaf and frescoes representingscenes from classical mythology . Only one of these ceilings has survived in its <p> original place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Braque . <p> Some of the older galleries , with their massive fireplaces and dark , smoked-up ceilings , <p> looked much like the interiors we can see today in the much-restored H ( tel de Cluny , <p> built a hundred years later . Tapestries covered the walls from floor to ceiling . The monumentalfireplaces and the small windows and doors , cut through here and there at random , were reminiscent of a fortress and gave these rooms a somber dignity outmoded <p> by the bright , sensual , regular style of the Renaissance wings . <p> On the south side of the Seine , opposite the Louvre and up a hundred yards from <p> the bank , stood the richest abbey in the +le de France . Founded by Childebert in about <p> 543 , Saint-Germain-des-PrTs grew under the double aegis of the Benedictine order <p> and royal favor .

Surrounded by a wide ditch , high <p> crenellated walls , towers , drawbridges , and gates , the abbey remained as independent <p> of Paris physically as it was legally . <p> The abbey church housed numerous relics and a vast treasury of altar vessels and <p> manuscripts . Its three towers ( only one survives ) dominated the entire Left Bank below <p> the " mountain " of Sainte-GeneviFve . Within the walls were chapels , a large and a small <p> cloister , a bakery , a refectory , storehouses , numerous gardens , stables , and a new palace <p> for the abbot constructed in about 1690 ( now 3 , rue de lAbbaye ) .

It plays on the title of the Introduction to the Nietzsche volume in this Rereading the Canon series : " Why Feminists Read Nietzsche " ( Oliver and Pearsall 1998 ) ; but it attests , also , to the relative sparseness of feminist engagement with Gadamer by contrast with work that addresses , finds resources in , and challenges even so reputedly misogynist a philosopher as Friedrich Nietzsche , who died in 1900 , the year of Gadamers birth . In his intellectual autobiography which introduces the 1997 volume The Philosophy of Hans-Georg Gadamer in the Library of Living Philosophers series , Gadamer testifies to the enormity of Nietzsches influence during his Marburg years that began in 1919 , where young philosophers critical of the " methodologism " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of phenomenological description . But , Gadamer observes , " it was life-philosophy , above allbehind which stood the European event of Friedrich Nietzschethat was taking hold of our whole feeling for life " : he remarks that " behind all the boldness and riskiness of our existential engagementas a still scarcely visible threat to the romantic traditionalism of our culturestood the gigantic form of Friedrich Nietzsche with his ecstatic critique of everything , including all the illusions of self-consciousness " ( Gadamer 1997a , 5 , 6 ) . My entry into this discussion through a contrast with Nietzsche rather than by situating Gadamer in relation to the more frequently cited influences on his philosophyof whom Hegel , Husserl , Heidegger are the most notablecomes out of a sense of how intriguing it is that a philosopher so embedded in tradition , who often betrays a certain conservativism in his respect for it , should claim so early and overwhelming a debt to Nietzsche , the arch-iconoclast , the bitingly polemical , ironic critic of western philosophical , religious , and moral traditions . The contrast is provocative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminists committed to displacing and breaking with an intransigently patriarchal philosophical tradition , by comparison with a pervasiveif not seamlessscepticism about whether or how a space could be opened for feminist debate with so tradition-saturated a thinker as Gadamer , and an attendant puzzlement about what he can offer to feminist projects . <p> In their Introduction to the Nietzsche volume the editors observe that feminist readings of Nietzsche have tended to take one of two directions : asking " how to interpret Nietzsches remarks about women and femininity " thus how to contend with his infamously derogatory stereotypes of women ; or concentrating on questions about how Nietzsches philosophy can stand as a resource for feminist thought , on what feminists can gain from him . ( Oliver and Pearsall 1998 , 2 ) . Because images of or references to women , derogatory or otherwise , are so rare in the vast corpus of his published work , it is reasonable to conclude that there is no " woman question " for Gadamer : hence variations on and modalities of the second option are more readily available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the essays in this volume , feminists turning to Gadamer often read him " against the grain " , past the silences about women and other Others , to discern what they might garner from a Gadamerian approach to language , history , knowledge , politics , or literature ; and/or to evaluate the philosophical significance of the consistent maleness of his putative interlocutors and the rarefied academic and social universe he has inhabited throughout his life : this masculine milieu that he depicts so clearly in his 1997 intellectual autobiography . <p> On February 11 2000 , when the essays in this volume were being completed , Hans-Georg Gadamer reached the age of 100 . The bibliography of his published works in the Library of Living Philosophers volume runs to thirty printed pages , with an additional ten pages listing published interviews and broadcast tapes ; and the publication dates run from 1922 to 1996 : the final date marks the publication date of the volume itself , not the cessation of Gadamers philosophical writing who , more than a year after his 100th birthday was still philosophically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverses an entire century Gadamer has , inter alia , been elected to Academies of Arts and Sciences in Germany , Greece , Italy , Hungary , Belgium , England , and the USA ; elected Knight of the " Order of Merit " for the Arts and Sciences " the highest academic honor given in Germany " ; and received Doctorates " Honoris Causa " in Germany , Poland , the USA , and Canada . His is a towering philosophical presence . Yet it would be strangely incongruous to think of him as a public intellectual , for his has been a more politically sequestered life than that of many thinkers of comparable stature : Sartre , Foucault , Derrida come to mind . Despite his having lived through a century that witnessed and participated in two world wars and through the upheavals of the new social movements of the inter-war and post-second-world war years , Gadamers has remained a markedly insular , scholarly life . His account of his quietistic , intentionally unobtrusive pursuit of scholarship throughout the Second World War ( 1997a 1315 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the second half of the twentieth century , are striking for what they fail to address . Moreover , the " world " he depicts in his intellectual autobiographythe long lists of the male students he " brought with him . . . from Frankfurt " to Heidelberg , and equally long lists of the influential , all male , philosophers and students he knew , taught , and worked with , beginning with Karl Lwith and concluding with " a great number of Americans " ( 1997a 17 ) , in patterns of friendship , mentorship and discipleship , may prompt female readers to wonder where the speaking , or indeed even the listening place , for women could have been in these conversations . Thus , feminists cognizant of the social and political oppressions and philosophical exclusions that have been womens lot throughout the history of the western world , and of the part canonical western philosophy has played in sustaining them , have to work hard to find in Gadamer a social-political ally , or a even silent friend of feminist projects . <p> Yet so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments in his work are consonant with central aspects of second-wave feminist thinking that it is less surprising after all for feminists to turn to Gadamer than to discount him as a source of transformative insights and untried conceptual resources in their projects of rereading the post-Enlightenment western philosophical canon , contesting and reinterpreting its fundamental assumptions . Gadamers very embeddedness in and commitment to tradition , perhaps paradoxically , presents a way of engaging with the deep historical rootedness of the circumstances and structures feminists at the beginning of the twenty-first century have to understand and challenge , even as aspects of his immersion in tradition pose obstacles to entering into unconstrained conversation with his work . <p> To feminist and other theorists of subjectivity , agency , history , and knowledge who are disillusioned with an empiricist-positivist legacy that manifests itself in epistemologies of mastery and domination , with an operative conception of objectivity that requires dislocated , interchangeable knowers who stand as distant , disinterested spectators of the objects of knowledge , Gadamerian hermeneutics for which knowing is engaged , situated , dialogic , and historically conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " barrenness " of positivism " right up to the present day new positivism " ( 1997a 6 ) among factors that have shaped his hermeneutic philosophy . Repudiating the positivistic view that knowledge worthy of the name will derive from an idealized model of knowing in the physical sciences , achieved by means of replicable empirical observations in ideal observation conditions and formulated in empirically verifiable propositions , hermeneutics is an interpretive , historically conscious practice of working to achieve understanding . For Gadamer , it draws its exemplary models of inquiry from the human sciences and , in particular , from history and from the place of art in history . Hence it is itself as much an art as it is a science ; reliant on phronesispractical wisdomrather than on disengaged rationality . Whereas knowing , in the Anglo-American mainstream , tends to be conceived as an all-or-nothing matter , exemplified in discrete , punctiform , yet uniformly knowable and ubiquitously salient " facts " , hermeneutic understanding is multifaceted , complex , richly textured : it varies not just quantitatively but qualitatively in its reciprocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious and reflexively conscious of its own historicity , it is achieved dialogically , in conversations between the " foreknowledge " that comprises the " horizon " from which an interpreter enters an encounter , and texts , events , works of art , other people , that are equivalently historical . Thus Gadamer writes : " Whereas the object of the natural sciences can be described idealiter as what would be known in the perfect knowledge of nature , it is senseless to speak of a perfect knowledge of history , and for this reason it is not possible to speak of an object in itself toward which its research is directed " ( Gadamer 19601989 , 285 ) . Hermeneutic understanding is less definitive than orthodox empirical knowledge aims to be , but in some sense " truer to " the texts and experiences it engages . <p> By contrast , then , with knowledge-making projects that aim at maximal completeness , foundationally established and deductively achieved , hermeneutic understanding seeks to attain a form of coherence manifested in what Gadamer calls a " fusion of horizons " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will see , produces ambivalent responses from Gadamers feminist readers . For some , it signals possibilities of the communal , mutual understandings that positivist-empiricist approaches can only thwart : for others it cautions against appropriation , mergings , in which separate identities and points of view are subsumed , often to the disadvantage of less privileged participants . Yet either way , it represents a potentially rich , powerful departure from the attenuated goals and methods of positivistic inquiry . <p> Initially , and quite simply , Gadamer conceives of the horizon as the aspect of a situation or standpoint that " limits the possibility of vision " ( 1989,302 ) while ordering items within the range of vision according to their relative significance . The term is especially pertinent to historical understanding , as it points to the interpretive necessity of seeing the past in its own terms ( i.e. within/as its own horizon ) thus not as an aspect of the values and prejudices of the interpreter : to the necessity of placing oneself within another situation in order to understand it , while remaining open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreknowledge integral to ones own horizon . Translated into everyday conversations , it cautions against naively , unthinkingly assimilating anothers point of view , values , concernshorizonto ones own , and against placing ones own beyond interpretation . Although many commentators read in such cautions a commitment to respecting and preserving otherness while endeavoring to understand the others horizon from within , others propose that the purpose is more accurately represented as one of overcoming particularities in the synthesis that an achieved fusion of horizons can accomplish . Gadamer names as examples of conversations that could provide starting points for discovering the co-conversants standpoint , his/her horizon , " certain kinds of conversation between doctor and patient " ( 1989 , 303 ) , or encounters between two people who are attempting to find a common ground ( 1997a 45 ) : situations that reveal our preconceptions to us as much as to the other ; making them strange , requiring us to re-consider them as a way of overcoming both " our own particularity . . . and that of the other " ( 1989 , 305 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon of the present meets and interprets the horizon of the past : the horizon of the present can not be understood apart from its past ; nor can a person strip her or his past away on entering a conversation ; yet understanding is possible only when the tension between past and present , be it world-historical or personal , textual or conversational , is read as a productive tension out of which , ideally , a fusion of horizons may be achieved . <p> Achieving understanding for Gadamer , is thus not the isolated , individualistic enterprise detached from the particularities of the world that acquiring scientific , historical , and other knowledge in Anglo-American philosophy commonly is , where self-reliance tends to be touted as an epistemic virtue and contrasted with the uncertainties of reliance on sedimented opinion or on " hearsay " or " testimony " . The centrality he accords the conversational/dialogic interpretive process ; his insistence on the linguisticality and historicity of the social world , points to a commonal enterprise of engagement in and with the Lebenswelt ( life-world ) whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative projects whose participants work together toward understanding , in dialogue with one another and/or with texts . Readers/co-conversants come to inquiry with their fore-knowledge , their pre-judgements ( = Vorurteile ) in place : for Gadamer , it could not be otherwise , given his starting place in human embeddedness in the world and in history : in-der-Welt-sein can only , plausibly , be historical , at a fundamental , constitutive level . Yet this recognition of the heuristic value of prejudice , pre-judgement is not without its problems for feminists and other Others ; hence feminists seeking to determine what they can glean from Gadamer have to work out how to accommodate the very idea of prejudice , with its deep roots in tradition . Nonetheless , Gadamers insistence on the inevitability of prejudice , pre-judgement , situatedness and horizons is by no means all bad from a feminist point of view : it is in many ways more intellectually honest than " the myth of the given " and its empiricist cognates , where a cluster of curious , often tyrannical , quasi-tabula-rasa assumptions persists as more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presuppositionless , theory-neutral , value-free knowledge is both possible and necessary , not just of medium-sized material objects , but of human lives , situations , events , creative endeavors , facts , artefacts , and thoughts . As Gadamer observes ( 1989 : 275 ) : " there is one prejudice of the Enlightenment that defines its essence : the fundamental prejudice of the Enlightenment is the prejudice against prejudice itself , which denies tradition its power . " A central objective for feminist philosophers , theorists , and activists is to interrogate the androcentricity and other centricities that , often silently , covertly , inform and indeed saturate the western social intellectual , political , social , cultural order . Feminists need to know these centricities well if they are to achieve and enact tranformative understandings . When pre-judgements and the constitutive effects of situatedness are cloaked by a veil of unknowing ; unacknowledged and/or systematically disavowed , as this " prejudice against prejudice " requires , the intellectual labor of examining and contesting them is arduous indeed . Thus feminists can find cautious inspiration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are there from the beginning , explicitly part of what any conversation , any understanding is about . Yet the issue , as we will discover , is not just about the inescapability of prejudice , but also about which prejudices Gadamer himself is prepared to acknowledge , committed to unsettling or modifying ; and here feminist endorsement of the detail of his project is more equivocal . <p> Now , especially in his early work , Gadamer did not conceive of hermeneutics as " an epistemology " , nor , even now , is it likely that he would accept the label , especially in its Anglo-American stipulations . Not only are mainstream epistemological projects more thoroughly physical-science-based and -modelled than hermeneutics could ever be , but two of the principal sources of Gadamers hermeneutics are in areas where present-day orthodox epistemologists would not venture : first , the interpretation of texts , where hermeneutics traces its origins to biblical exegesis and philology ; and second , experiences of works of art , and through those experiences to arts constitutive part in the production of historical consciousness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of knowledge that extends beyond itselfowes a debt to Martin Heidegger , particularly in " The Origin of the Work of Art " , where Heidegger talks of the work as a place where " the truth of beings has set itself to work " ( Heidegger 1977,164 ) . Truth reveals itself in the work of art , in the openness that receptivity requires : openness and receptivity that , for Gadamer , translate into the open dialogue that makes the fusion of horizons possible . These preoccupations alone give some sense of why Gadamers work sits uncomfortably with or in relation to the principles , goals , and methods of epistemological orthodoxy . Indeed , for the most rigorous positivist-empiricist , neither textual interpretation nor works of art can be objects , or sources , of the knowledge that it is orthodox epistemologys business to analyze , for there is no way , empirically , of demonstrating their truth or falsity . Nonetheless , the very prejudices that prompt theorists of knowledge to exclude such knowings and understandings from their domain of inquiry are the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tradition , together with its a-historical methodologism and the dislocated picture of knowledge and knowers that it underwrites . The truncated understandings that an a-historical philosophy engenders out of its practices of abstracting from all specifiable human situations , and its relegation of language to a neutral medium through which " facts " are filtered , stated in monological , formulaic propositions and allegedly untouched by the filtering process , have prompted Gadamer to broaden and deepen the scope of his hermeneutics well beyond the places of its original inspiration . <p> A third source of Gadamers philosophical hermeneutics is also salient with reference to issues that animate this volume : his debt to nineteenth-century philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey , whose term Erlebnis ( roughly translated " lived experience " ) opens out a way of engaging in the human sciences as a study of experience and meaning , where experience is lived linguistically , and language , as productive of meaning , is constitutive of the world that these sciences , in particular , seek to understand . Here , the subject/object dichotomy that functions as a basic positivist-empiricist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither autonomous in nor abstractable from processes in which knower , known , and knowing are bound together in the Lebenswelt that interpretive inquiry studies . In elaborating these ideas Gadamer , like Dilthey , maintains a methodological and thence epistemological division between the human sciences ( Geisteswienschaften ) and the natural sciences ( Naturwienschaften ) , with the consequence that interpretive understanding , as he details it Truth and Method , pertains primarily to the methods and products of knowing in the human sciences . Yet in his philosophical autobiography Gadamer observes : " The image of the natural sciences that I had in mind when I conceived my ideas for Truth and Method was quite one-sided . It is now clear to me . . . that a whole broad field of hermeneutical problems has been left out . . . . Nevertheless , the fact that a hermeneutical problematic is present in the natural sciences was already clear to me when I read Moritz Schlicks convincing critique of the dogma of protocol sentences in 1934 " ( 1997a 41 ) . Not only does this observation indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more broadly than he initially did , but it suggests that feminists and other Others who look to hermeneutics as a way of developing insightfully historicized understandings beyond the scope of the human sciences , and indeed stretching even into the natural sciences , need not be charged , before the fact , with distorting Gadamers theoretical-conceptual apparatus beyond what it can bear . <p> Gadamers historical-hermeneutic approach to interpretation is addressive rather than observational : inquirers , for him , are no removed spectators of distinct and distant " objects of knowledge " , but engaged participants in conversation , dialogue with one another and with what they seek to know . They look as much to what texts , works of art , and human co-conversants have to say to them as to what they have to say to or about texts and other people : as much to the part their prejudices play in the conversation as to the fore-knowledge others bring into it . For Gadamer , the logic of this inquiry is a logic of question and answer , distinguished from formal propositional analysis by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every philosophical theory , every text is an answer to a question : not an eternal or perennial question , but one posed out of and informed by specific historical circumstances . It is questions that open up processes of interpretation : thus , integral to interpretive inquiry are processes of uncovering the questions to which a text , a work , a point of view is a response . Understanding , then , is not a matter of winning an argument against an opponent ; rather , the dialectical conversation in which this logic of question and answer is enacted " requires that one does not try to argue the other person down but that one really considers the weight of the others opinion . " ( Gadamer 1989,367 ) . Feminists who have learned to look at philosophical **25;1782;TOOLONG through new lenses , following Janice Moultons now-classic diagnosis of how " the adversary method " thwarts philosophical understanding ( Moulton , 1983 ) , will find in Gadamer a potential ally on this issue .

" ( Gadamer1989 , 299300 ) . Here too is a dimension of Gadamerian philosophy that could serve as a feminist resource ; for feminist inquiry , virtually by definition , is situated . It eschews quests for detached , dislocated , putatively " timeless " knowledge to insist that knowledge , understanding , interpretation , and knowers are always , as Susan Bordo puts it " somewhere , and limited " ( Bordo1990 , 145 ) historically , materially , socially-culturally located and constituted , thus predisposed to realize the significance of what Gadamer calls an effective-historical consciousness . Whether Gadamer would understand or acknowledge the histories of social-political structures , sexual and racial oppression , material plenty or scarcity ; or of stereotypes that situate and constrain human beings against their will , imposing some of the limitations Bordo and other feminists refer to , is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next section of this Introduction , and in the essays that follow .

In fact , I am increasingly persuaded that much of his considerable value as a thinker consists in the way he confronts , enriches , and problematizes these central matters : figuring out what it is we want when we turn to other people is no simple matter , and it is , in some sense , even less so after reading Rousseau . But his writings illuminate the hidden dimensions of these mysteries with an unsurpassed power and penetration , and have resonated so strongly with so many readers for so many years that it is difficult to dismiss Rousseaus analysis of social phenomena as the romantic fancy of an overheated imagination . <p> Given the importance of the questions guiding this book , it may be fairly wondered whether there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interrogated as frequently as Rousseau is , and many , if perhaps not all , of the component parts of the argument presented here have been subjected to close , and repeated , scrutiny by other scholars . There are , for instance , many treatments of Rousseaus understanding of romantic love ( e.g. , Bloom 1993 ; Wingrove 2000 ) , and many , many more on his theory of politics ( too many , in fact , to cite here ) . There are some very fine books , and piles of articles , on amour-propre ( e.g. , Dent 1988 ; OHagan 1999 ; Rawls 2007 ; Neuhouser 2008 ) , and even a bit of research on his conception of friendship ( e.g. , Reisert 2003 ) . Yet this is , to my knowledge , the first comprehensive treatment of Rousseaus theory of human relations . That is to say , I know of no other study that presents a reasonably complete survey of the major forms of human association as they recur in Rousseaus work , along with a theory that explains both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can satisfy the desires to which they give rise . This , then , is what the present volume proposes to do . <p> I happily grant that it was both a pleasure and a relief to find that this particular set of questions needed more attention , for after a long graduate career spent combing through vast archives of books and articlespausing only to convince myself that there must be something moreto say about Rousseau , and then pausing again to worry that there wasntit was a delight not only to find some space in the literature but also to find it precisely where I wanted it to be . The very questions I most wanted to ask of Rousseau , those that his oeuvre seemed to me to be so well-designed to illumine , had still not been put to him , or at least not in quite the way I thought appropriate . Eureka ! My first real idea . Maybe I was right not to go to law school . <p> One other feature of the argument offered here deserves mention : its skeptical or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friendship , and political or civil association , I shall be at pains to show how each form of association , whether considered individually or in sum , systematically fails to solve the problem of " dividedness " that I take to be located at the center of Rousseaus thought ( Starobinski 1988 ) . Rousseaus moral universe is a fragmented and unforgiving placeit is full of costly trade-offs , difficult choices , and frustrated expectations . The margin for error is razor thin , and people pay dearly for the mistakes they inevitably make . Considerations like these lead Rousseau , on my view , to conclude that social life necessarily prevents us from enjoying even a decent approximation of the unitythe feelings of oneness both within ourselves and with our environmentthat we have by nature and that full satisfaction requires . This initial characterization of the argument is very broad , and perhaps too much so , but it is intended merely as a way of fixing ideas . <p> In emphasizing the skeptical tenor of Rousseaus social theory , I find myself both in and indebted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways on Judith Shklars ( 1969 ) claim that Rousseau provides two incommensurable and unrealizable utopian visions , on Arthur Melzers ( 1990 , 151 ; 1983 ) belief that the coherence of Rousseaus thought can not be comprehended unless its pessimistic and " hardheaded " character is understood , on Clifford Orwins ( 1997a ; 1997b ) and Richard Boyds ( 2004 ) concerns about the ethical limits of compassion , and on Scott Yenors ( 2011 ) and Allan Blooms ( 1993 , 138 ) worries about the stability of romantic love . The " skeptical " dimension of the interpretation developed here is thus not sui generis . It is , however , far from orthodox and may be viewed as a corrective to any number of influential accounts of Rousseau that paint him , alternatively , as an illiberal Pollyanna ( Talmon 1952 ; Nisbet 1943 ; Berlin 1990 ; Crocker 1995 ) , a reasonable optimist looking to effect practical political reform ( Rawls 2007 ; Cohen 2010 ) , or a compatibilist whose domestic and political theories are interdependent aspects of a unified vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternatives ( Strong 1994 ; Fermon 1997 ; Neuhouser 2008 ) . <p> A brief word on the structure of argument , and then we may move on .

Chapters 2 and 3 make up the first part of the argument proper . They are theoretical and psychological : in them I examine the psychic foundations of Rousseaus project , with the broad aim of showing both the possibility and indeed the necessity of the more ambitious social and political possibilities that Rousseau sought to establish . To this end I analyze the natural bases of human relationssexual desire and pityand show how they ( 1 ) enable and delimit specific forms of association like romantic love and friendship , ( 2 ) perform assignably different functions within the psychic economies of human beings , and ( 3 ) interact in such a way to help correct for each others excesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral longings , pity helps to counteract the forms of antisocial anger that these longings can inspire by reminding us of our own limitations and imperfections . Likewise , we shall see that a moralized psychosexual energy constantly infuses human life with new meaning and fresh purposes , and thereby helps to offset the resignation and indifference to which an overactive sense of pity can lead . Thus our natural unity is preserved through the proper management of a dynamic tension between the developed forms of our social passions . <p> With this psychological model in tow , I go on to derive from it the specific forms of associationsexual love , friendship , and political associationthat Rousseau treats in his oeuvre and to show how each of these associational forms fails to satisfy the requirements of wholeness and are therefore most properly seen as tragic . In chapter 4 my examination of human association proper begins with an analysis of Emile and how it discloses the tragic dynamics of sexual love . Chapter 5 pursues the same theme and shows the same dynamics at work in Rousseaus epistolary novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider the role of friendship in Rousseaus social theory and show it to be too anemic to satisfy our deepest social longings . The final two chapters turn to the political association and argue that Rousseau sought through the creation of a " moral ecology " to re-create between citizen and state the same harmonious relation that obtains between natural man and his environment . They also argue that even this comprehensive reconstruction of the citizen-subjects surroundings can not establish a stable harmony between man and his environment , for it can not reconcile the demands of the private realm with those of the citizenship . The underlying problem in the just polityas it is elsewhereis the intransigence of natural , individuating self-love , which resists with overwhelming strength all efforts to recruit it for social and political purposes . Indeed , I take the insolubility of the problems posed by the intransigence of self-love to be perhaps the central theme of this book as a whole . Rousseau , for all his strong and persuasive criticisms of reductive modern materialism , was ultimately unable to overcome its limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failureis worth more to us than a modest success would have been , for his analysis of our condition both undermines our comfortable certainties while pointing to the limits of Rousseaus own critical act .

This was not a rare occurrence ; ships destined for Spain stopped in Santa Marta with some frequency . But this particular vessel generated an unusual amount of excitement among Santa Martas residents . The ships exotic cargo included some unique treasures that had been collected from somewhere along the Pacific coast of South America , by a band of conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro . Pizarro hoped that these gifts would earn Crown favor and thus help him to secure a royal contract ( capitulaci=n ) to conquer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which included several strange New World sheep , only hinted at the fabulous riches that Pizarro and his followers would win when they returned to Peru four years later . <p> Rodrigo Alvarez Palomino , however , Santa Martas governor at the time , was so impressed by the 1528 cargo that he immediately organized an expeditionary force to explore Colombias interior in an effort locate the source of these riches . Alvarez assembled three hundred foot soldiers and fifty horsemen for the expedition , but his untimely death doomed the venture before it even left Santa Marta . Further attempts to launch overland expeditions from Santa Marta failed to locate rich new lands , and all were plagued by severe shortages of men , money , and supplies . Thus , with the continued failures of expeditions into the interior , coupled with an increasingly hostile local indigenous population , Santa Marta faced possible abandonment . <p> Four years later , news of Pizarros exploits in Peru reached Santa Martas already disgruntled residents . This only served to make matters worse . With rumors of unimaginable riches to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants abandoned the province and made their way to Peru . One of Santa Martas residents later testified that the reports from Peru had sparked a mass exodus , leaving the coastal town virtually abandoned . By early 1535 , only nine horsemen and forty foot soldiers remained to defend the city from potential attacks from local natives , or from French or British pirates . The city desperately needed a massive infusion of men and resources , without which the Crown risked losing what little presence it had along South Americas northern coast . <p> The solution to Santa Martas woes came from a most unlikely source . In late 1534 the sixty-year-old governor of the Canary Islands , adelantado don Pedro Fernndez de Lugo , sent his son Alonso to Spain to negotiate terms for the conquest and governorship of Santa Marta . Twice the Crown rejected Lugos proposals , until at last the two parties reached an accord . In the final agreement , signed on January 22 , 1535 , don Pedro promised to recruit , organize , and equip an armada of seventeen hundred men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the construction of three fortresses to defend the town from attack , and he agreed to build six brigantines in order to launch an expedition to discover the source of the Magdalena River . Eager to prevent the complete abandonment of the province , and at the same time promote further exploration of the South American interior , the Crown offered Lugo ( and his son ) a long list of concessions , including the governorship of all new lands conquered between Santa Marta and the South Sea ( that is , the Pacific Ocean ) . Santa Martas fortunes were about to change . <p> At the end of November 1535 , after more than seven months of careful and costly preparations , don Pedro Fernndez de Lugos armada departed from the port of Santa Cruz on the island of Tenerife . In all , the armada consisted of no fewer than ten ships , which together carried somewhere between one thousand and twelve hundred passengers ( among them a small number of women and black slaves ) . After a brief stop on the island of Hispaniola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marta , where it arrived to great fanfare and celebration on January 2 , 1536 . The new governor wasted no time in his effort to recoup the expenses he had incurred over the previous months . After several moderately profitable campaigns into nearby provinces , Lugo selected his lieutenant general , Gonzalo JimTnez de Quesada , to command an expedition up the Magdalena River . In early April , just three months after his armada had arrived in Santa Marta , don Pedro sent the JimTnez expedition into the Colombian interior . <p> The Other Andean Conquest <p> It is unfortunate that the conquest of New Granada has not captured more popular or academic interest . Its influence on the broader historiography of the conquest era has been marginal at best . However , a closer examination of the JimTnez expedition reveals several important characteristics that challenge conventional wisdom about the conquest period in general and the lives of the conquistadors . For example , a brief comparison of the ages , previous New World experience , and attrition rates for Francisco Pizarros forces ( the " men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some long-held notions about the conquest of the New World and the conquistadors who participated in it . <p> Previous New World military experience , or lack thereof , is one of several striking differences between Pizarros men of Cajamarca and JimTnezs men of New Granada . For example , more than half of Perus first conquistadors had at least five years of military experience in the New World . Furthermore , almost all the leaders of the expedition were hardened veterans ; men such as Francisco Pizarro , Sebastin de Belalczar , and Hernando de Soto had been in the Indies for two decades . By contrast , with less than four months experience in the Indies , Gonzalo JimTnez de Quesada was a true chapet=n , an unseasoned and inexperienced newcomer to the Americas . And he was not the only one . Of the ninety-three veterans of the expedition for whom we have data , only sixteen had more than five years of experience in the Indies . A handful had previous military experience in other parts of Europe , but 63 percent of JimTnezs men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority , JimTnez among them , had only arrived in the Indies in January 1536 , as part of Pedro Fernndez de Lugos ten-vessel armada . Thus , unlike either the CortTs expedition to Mexico or Pizarros forces in Peru , the conquest of Colombias eastern highlands was , for the most part , carried out by newcomers to the Americas . <p> Not only did JimTnezs men lack military experience in the Indies , but their inexperience was also combined with youth ( see Table 1.2 ) . Among Pizarros men , roughly 31 percent ( 34 of the 107 men for whom there is evidence ) were under the age of twenty-five when they arrived in Cajamarca in 1532 ; by contrast , of the 121 veterans of the JimTnez expedition for whom we have data , 55 percent fell into that category , with another 17 percent falling between the ages of fifteen and nineteen . The median age of the " men of New Granada " was only twenty-three . This combination of youth and inexperience perhaps explains why only 179 of the roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; still , as we will see below , those who reached Muisca territory tended to live long lives . Not only that , but most veterans of the JimTnez expedition chose to remain in New Granada ; only twenty men are known to have returned home to Spain , and no fewer than 108 decided to settle permanently in some part of New Granada . <p> Perhaps the most striking difference between Pizarros men of Cajamarca and the men of New Granada , and a topic that certainly merits further inquiry , is the dramatic variation in the attrition rates ( see Table 1.3 ) . Among JimTnezs men , the median age at death was more than sixty years old , astonishing for the sixteenth century and even more remarkable among conquistadors . No fewer than forty-two veterans of the expedition lived beyond the age of sixty-five , and half of those lived well into their seventies or early eighties . For reasons not yet fully understood , the conquistadors of New Granada enjoyed far longer lives than their counterparts in Peru and , most probably , elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that New Granada did not experience any of the bitter civil wars that claimed the lives of at least thirty-one of Pizarros men before peace finally came to Peru in the 1550s . Military conflicts , either between competing Spanish factions or against the Muisca population , were rare affairs in early colonial New Granada . But it is unlikely that postconquest violence , or lack thereof , accounts for such a dramatic difference in the attrition rates of the two regions . <p> Perhaps more important than challenging some of the conventional wisdom about the conquistadors in general , a more rigorous examination of the conquest of New Granada forces us to reconsider several of the accepted notions of the JimTnez expedition itself . Even the purpose of the expedition should be subject to greater scrutiny . Most accounts of the conquest of New Granada explain that the expeditions aim was twofold : to discover an overland route to Peru , and to follow the Magdalena River to its source , which many believed would lead them to the South Sea . A 1537 letter from Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 of this volume ) , written just thirteen months after don Pedro Fernndez de Lugos death , certainly supports the claim that the JimTnez expedition had been sent to discover a path to Peru . <p> Indeed , news of Pizarros exploits in Peru generated widespread excitement in the governorships of Cartagena , Santa Marta , and Venezuela . In August 1533 the members of Santa Martas cabildo ( town council ) sent a letter to the Crown explaining that local Spanish sailors were convinced that following the Magdalena River would lead to the South Sea and to Peru . Six months later , Santa Martas governor , Garcfa de Lerma , reiterated this belief . Similar letters were sent to Spain from the governorships in Cartagena , Venezuela , and even from the Audiencia ( high court ) of Santo Domingo . For example , in a letter dated November 27 , 1534 , Santo Domingos secretary , Diego Caballero , wrote a letter in which he urged the Crown to send at least five hundred Spaniards to Santa Marta . According to Caballero , not only would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Marta to Peru , it would also lead to the discovery of " many other Perus " that must exist between the two regions . It is likely that Caballeros letter reached Madrid just as the Crown was finalizing the details of its agreement ( capitulaci=n ) with don Pedro Fernndez de Lugo . <p> While the discovery of an overland route to Peru would have appealed to the Crown , a careful examination of other documentary evidence reveals that the participants themselves probably had different motivations and expectations . In fact , it is unlikely that the men who volunteered to join the JimTnez expedition had much interest in plotting an overland route to Peru , a place that already had been conquered and settled by Spaniards ; moreover , the spoils of the conquest had long since been divided among the fortunate few who had followed Pizarro from Panama . Likewise , the quest to find the Pacific Ocean did not motivate men to invest their earnings and risk their lives on this venture . Instead , what JimTnez and his followers wanted was to find was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of their very own . In fact , in the rich corpus of available documentary evidence , few veterans of the JimTnez expedition ever suggest that their mission was to discover an overland route to Peru , or to locate a river route to the South Sea . Instead , when asked about the purpose of the JimTnez expedition , most men simply stated that the goal was to discover tierras nuevas , new lands . <p> Even Pedro Fernndez de Lugos motivation for authorizing the expedition was based on the desire to find new lands , and with them the profits needed to cover the debts he had incurred in mounting his armada . Of course , the search for an overland route from Santa Marta to Peru and the South Sea most certainly would have appealed to the Crown , something that Lugo used to his advantage in his negotiations to secure the rights to conquer the region , but that goal did not inspire Lugo himself . JimTnez and his men were sent out to win riches , and Lugo stood to earn 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not forget that Lugo had been granted the governorship of all new lands discovered between the city of Santa Marta and the South Sea . Most assuredly , then , Lugo was interested in reaching the South Sea , if only to determine the full extent of his governorship . Still , it is also worth noting that in Lugos written instructions to JimTnez , drafted four days before the expedition departed from Santa Marta , there is no mention of Peru , nor are there any references to the search for the South Sea , let alone what the men should do if they succeeded in finding either . Instead , of the fourteen instructions given to JimTnez , eleven addressed either the just treatment of the indigenous populations they should encounter or the nature in which all the gold ( and other booty ) should be acquired , recorded , and distributed . Undoubtedly , the conquest of Peru provided powerful incentives to launch expeditions into undiscovered parts of the South American continentbut the participants who joined these ventures , and the governors who authorized and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding new riches of their own . <p> As the opening paragraph of the preface suggests , narrative accounts of the JimTnez expedition bear a striking resemblance to the Peruvian conquest narrativethe timing , the Andean backdrop , the numbers of men involved ( 168 in Peru , 179 in New Granada ) , as well as the captured cacique , his promised ransom , and his subsequent execution . These are all shared features of both conquest narratives . A closer examination of the conquest of New Granada reveals far more differences than similarities , however . Perhaps the most enduring misconception of the Spanish conquest of Muisca territory involves the story of the indigenous civil war , and its influence on the eventual outcome . Interpretations of the conquest of Peru and the conquest of New Granada both emphasize the importance of the bitter civil unrest at the moment Spaniards first arrived . And while there is indisputable evidence of such a conflict between Atahualpa and Huascar in the Inca realm , there is no compelling evidence in either Spanish or Colombian archives to support the occurrence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove otherwise , but the so-called Muisca civil war between the Zipa of Bogot and the Zaque of Tunja appears to be nothing more than an invention of later Spanish chroniclers ( none of whom participated in the conquest ) , whose treatment of the conquest of New Granada simply borrowed from the Peruvian conquest narratives . Curiously , despite the lack of corroborative evidence , historians have never questioned the veracity of the Zipa-Zaque civil war , and it continues to be repeated in virtually every treatment of the Spanish conquest of New Granada . <p> Readers will note that none of the primary documents that follow , which represent some of the earliest firsthand accounts of the conquest story , makes any reference to a civil war between the caciques of Bogot and Tunja . Not only that , but readers will also notice ( in Chapter 5 ) that when Bogots ruler , Sagipa , offered his allegiance to JimTnez in exchange for Spanish military assistance , it was not to launch a campaign against Tunja but rather to fight against Bogots real enemies , the Panches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the conquest of Muisca territory was facilitated by an internal civil war between the Zipa and the Zaque should thus be viewed with deep suspicion . <p> The Sources <p> As mentioned earlier , no single account stands out as the authoritative voice on the conquest of New Granada , but the absence of such a voice should not suggest that there is a paucity of documentary evidence on the subject . What follows , then , is a reconstruction of the JimTnez expedition and the conquest of Muisca territory , told from the perspectives of seven different sixteenth-century primary documents . Five of the documents included in this study appear in their entirety ; two others have been abridged slightly . Readers will note that most of the book is based on three lengthy accounts , namely , the anonymous " Relaci=n de Santa Marta " ( probably written by Captain Antonio Dfaz Cardoso circa 1545 ) , Captain Juan de San Martfn and Captain Antonio de Lebrijas " Relaci=n del Nuevo Reino " ( 1539 ) , and the " Epftome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts appear in Chapters 2 , 3 , and 4 in order to maintain a clear chronology of the events as they unfolded and to facilitate a comparative examination of the sources . Detailed footnotes also have been added throughout the translations , many from the vast body of colonial probanzas de mTritos , or " proof-of-merit " petitions . Brief introductions to each chapter establish the historical context for the documents that follow , and in some cases an additional preface has been added for further clarification . <p> The story begins in late 1534 , with don Pedro Fernndez de Lugos negotiations with the Crown for the rights to the conquest and governorship of the province of Santa Marta . The three documents in Chapter 2 include don Pedros initial petition , his son Alonsos amended proposal , followed by the final agreement ( capitulaci=n ) , signed in late January 1535 . Chapter 3 picks up the story fourteen months later , shortly after the Lugo armada has arrived in Santa Marta . The four documents in Chapter 3 include short excerpts from the two Relaciones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council ( cabildo ) of Santa Marta . All four documents chronicle the first stage of the Gonzalo JimTnez de Quesada expedition , a seven-month period that begins with the departure of JimTnezs ground forces on April 5 , 1536 , and ends as JimTnez and two hundred followers abandon their route up the Magdalena River and begin their climb into the eastern highlands . <p> Chapters 4 and 5 include excerpts from the same three sources , namely , the two Relaciones and the " Epftome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada . " Chapter 4 follows the few surviving members of the expedition across the Op=n Mountains and into Muisca territory , where they arrive in early March 1537 . It also contains a lengthy section from the Epftome , which provides rich details of Muisca culture and society . The fifth and final chapter , the longest in the book , chronicles a two-year period bound roughly by the Spanish sacking of the Muisca pueblo of Tunja in August 1537 and JimTnez de Quesadas return to Spain in early July 1539 . This period witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest , such as Bogots murder , the military campaigns against the Panches , the distribution of the booty , and the search for the Amazon women . Two of the three documents translated in Chapter 5 also chronicle the circumstances surrounding the capture , arrest , torture , and subsequent death of Bogots successor , Sagipa . And all three sources end with the arrival in New Granada of the two other expeditionary forces , one from Venezuela , led by Nicols Federmn ( Nikolaus Federmann ) , the other from Peru , under the command of the conquistador Sebastin de Belalczar . For JimTnez , the unexpected arrival of competing groups of conquistadors led all three men to return quickly to Spain to press their claims to this newly discovered region , and it is with their departure for Spain that the accounts end . <p> One final note of caution before proceedingas valuable as the following sources are for helping to piece together the details of the JimTnez expedition and the subsequent exploration , conquest , and colonization of Muisca territory , it is important to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scores of black slaves , or native carriers , guides , cooks , and translators , all of whom played important if forgotten roles in this story . And although some of the accounts that follow , the Epftome in particular , include some of the earliest descriptions of Muisca culture , including details of their religious beliefs and practices , diet , weapons , clothing , and government , these descriptions are all presented from Spanish perspectives . Not only that , but the accounts reveal almost nothing about the multitude of non-Muisca peoples who resided along the Magdalena River ; the only other native group discussed in any detail are the Panches . Spanish descriptions of Panche society are highly untrustworthy , however , and should be read with great care . As a people who resisted both Muisca and Spanish incursions into their territory , the Panches have been treated very unkindly by colonial documents . In the few accounts where they are discussed , the Panches are judged harshly , often reduced by Spanish observers to nothing more than naked cannibals whose daily lives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unfortunate that for New Granada there exist none of the native accounts of the conquest period that have so enriched the historiography of other parts of the Americas .

They were legendary within Chile for their political role as a Communist base of supportindeed , their region became known as a " Red zone . " They were also renowned among Latin American workers for their social solidarity and combative grassroots actions . With their proximity to Concepci=n , the birthplace of the Revolutionary Left Movement ( Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria ; MIR ) , it is not surprising that the people of the coal communities actively mobilized during the radical years of the 1960s and 1970s . <p> In 197073 , the coal mining zone emerged as a stronghold of support for President Salvador Allende and his leftist Popular Unity coalition , which tried to implement Socialist reforms within the bounds of constitutional democracy . As part of this project , in December 1970 , the Chilean national development agency CORFO ( Corporaci=n de Fomento de la Producci=n de Chile ) became the majority shareholder of the countrys largest coal mining company , Carbonffera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . This period of dramatic experimentation with new social , political , and economic arrangements ended abruptly with a military coup on September 11 , 1973 , led by Augusto Pinochet . During the sixteen-year dictatorship that followed , the coal mining communities experienced brutal repression , with thousands of people arrested and tortured and hundreds executed . <p> On my first trip to Chile , in July 1996 , less than a decade after the country began its long road back to democracy , coal miners and their families flooded the streets of Santiago on strike against the National Coal Mining Company ( Empresa Nacional del Carb=n ; ENACAR ) , created under Allende , which was now insolvent and on the verge of shutting down at any moment . Given the centrality of miners in Chile , both as an economic force and as a symbol in the national imagination , an entire era of Chilean history appeared to be coming to an end . The coal miners strike became the focus of popular and intellectual debate throughout the country , as reflected in a Sunday feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " in Chiles leading newspaper , El Mercurio . Here sociologist Elena Irrzabal presented the coal miners as the last vestige of a tradition of radical working-class politics forged in Chile in the twentieth century . <p> Powerful public images of coal mining derive in part from vivid portrayalsmost notably in Baldomero Lillos classic 1904 novel Sub-terraof the arduous work conditions in mines extending deep beneath the Pacific Ocean . Equally important is the regions historical assertion of a distinct and strong cultural and political identity through which " the Lota coal miners " have appeared as a singular cultural and political force within the nation , particularly at critical junctures . As its historically dominant town , Lota has stood for a diverse region structured around the extraction and transportation of coal . <p> By mid-1997 , all of the large coal mines in the country had shut down , and the region struggled to find viable projects of economic development . Newly created industrial parks tried to attract business , while workers sought retraining to cope with the new economic realities . The famous Lota slope mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ del Diablo ) became a tourist site where former miners led underground walking tours . A nearby mansion built for company administrators was converted into a museum , staffed by working-class women dressed up as matrons of the late nineteenth-century local elite . State agencies and nonprofit organizations promoted such projects as a way to " preserve " the regions unique history and create jobs at the same time . <p> Despite these efforts , the coal mining region quickly fell to the bottom nationwide in all indicators of social and economic well-being . Elderly coal miners now sat in the central plaza reminiscing about the regions past , as they watched their grandchildren head north to Santiago or the copper mines in search of work . In the coal mining town of Curanilahue , a new , fully equipped industrial park stood empty , and people soon began to notice a form of reverse migration . Those whose ancestors had migrated from the countryside to the burgeoning coal mines in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century were now heading back to family plots or agricultural estates to eke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly charged memories , the coal mining region presented a tragic tale of the social and cultural destruction wrought by adherence to a neoliberal socioeconomic model . <p> In July 1996 , winter in the Southern Hemisphere , I sat in Lotas huge , dilapidated union hall ( fig. 1 ) talking to desperate coal miners and their leaders as they fought what looked to be their last fight , negotiating for the best possible terms as the industry shut down . It was clear to me that the historical significance of these changes would emerge only through a deep understanding of the politics of industrial relations and class struggle during the regions twentieth-century heyday . Over the next several years , I studied the coal miners role in Chiles national development model , which began in the 1920s and came to an end with Pinochets structural readjustment policies in 1975 . Mining for the Nation focuses particularly on the coal miners heightened participation in local , national , and international politics during the turbulent 1930s and 1940s .

On June 12 , 2009 , when former first lady Rosa Markmann , wife of Gabriel Gonzlez Videla , died at age 101 , the Chilean press and public debated the legacy of this presidential couple with an interest not seen for decades . In 1947 , President Gonzlez Videla had sent Army troops into the coal mines to repress worker activism and had then outlawed the Communist Party , which remained illegal for the next ten years . <p> Also in June 2009 , Chilean political scientist Carlos Huneeus published the first major study of the late 1940s , La guerra frfa chilena : Gabriel Gonzlez Videla y la ley maldita ( The Chilean Cold War : Gabriel Gonzlez Videla and the " Damned Law " ) . The book caused a great stir both in Chilean academic and political circles and in broader Internet forums , partly due to its timing : it coincided not only with the death of Rosa Markmann but also with the signing of a historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chile ; PCCh ) and the centrist governing coalition , the Concertaci=n . Known as the " Agreement Against Exclusion , " the pact was designed to circumvent prejudicial aspects of Chiles electoral system , which particularly hinders smaller parties such as todays PCCh . Its signing prompted renewed public reflection about Chiles prior experiences with coalition politics aimed at making society more democratic , less exclusionary , and more equitable . The story of the coal mining communities in the 1930s and 1940s brings to life one of Chilean historys least-studied democratic experiments .

No less determinant in the shaping of Domenicos account of his fathers life is the fundamental nature of all early modern biography , especially art biography : as modern scholarship has by now amply demonstrated , a good deal of such biography in fact represents not " truth alone " but , rather , the more or less fictionalized recasting of the historical data in accordance to the dictates of literary-rhetorical convention and with recourse to an abundant supply of time-honored thematic commonplaces . Why all of this recasting and manipulation ? To make the biographical narrative conform to contemporary expectations of how the life of ( in this case ) an artist should unfold and how that artist , especially a great one like Bernini , should think , feel , and act .

" Equally determinant of the content and tone of early modern art biography is its essential nature as a form of the rhetorical genre of panegyric : accordingly , the fundamental purpose of the artists vita is to praise its subject and to offer to the reader inspiring examples of exceptional human achievement . <p> Nonetheless , as Sohm also observes , " Historical truth can coexist with mythologized biography .

Ehrlich , Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians <p> Dianne Harris is Assistant Professor of Landscape Architecture and Architecture at the University of Illinois , Urbana-Champaign . She is the co-editor of Villas and Gardens in Early Modern Italy and France ( 2001 ) . <p> This book examines the cultural landscape of eighteenth-century Lombardy , focusing on visual and material culture to illuminate a particular place and time . It offers a spatial history , one that emphasizes the physical framework of spacearchitecture , gardens , agricultural fields , and infrastructureas the setting for and an agent in the development of eighteenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hub ( and with fertile agricultural lands surrounding the capital city ) , Lombardy became the coveted colony of the Habsburg court , which referred to it as " the Indies of the Court of Vienna . " Later historians would call it " the cockpit for the defense of Italy " because of its strategic geographic position as a northern stronghold on the Italian peninsula ( Fig. 1 ) . <p> &lt;comp : insert Fig. 1 approximately here&gt; <p> Although frequently overlooked by scholars who have privileged Rome , Tuscany , and the Veneto in their studies , Lombard history is particularly rich for landscape historians , because the province served as a testing ground for the economic , social , and political reforms that ultimately became associated with the enlightened absolutist governmental system of the Habsburgs . Tested and applied in Lombardy , their new approaches to tax reform , legal administration , and manipulation of social structures later became the guiding systems in all Habsburg territories . Many of the reforms then spread beyond Habsburg lands and became the model for reforms throughout Europe . <p> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province , Lombardy provides a compelling case for studying the particular to understand something much more general . Indeed , its small size and the intense scrutiny it received under the Habsburgs for the duration of the eighteenth century make Lombardy an ideal case study , one that illuminates the complexities of social interaction , landscape transformation , reform politics , and the built environment . Villas were at the center of cultural transactions , and they provide a focus for the examination of larger cultural themes . Therefore , the particular case study here centers on a set of villas and the families who owned them . In this book , I argue that landscape and its representationsboth textual and visualbecame explicit tools in a highly stylized system of social distinction . The sources I analyze reveal a great deal about the demands and anxieties of social positioning within an aristocracy characterized by the same fine-grained distinctions as those found in other European elite societies of the time . As in other court , noble , and aristocratic cultures , the politics of display played an enormous role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , however , were especially poignant for Lombard nobles of this period because of the destabilizing impact of the Habsburg reforms . <p> During the eighteenth century , noble life increasingly took place in the countryside , and the villa became the site for experiments in modern land management and resource control . Arthur Young , whose travel writings provide important documentation of the Lombard landscape , saw the province as exemplary in its agricultural practices ; these , he said , were " carried to such perfection as to prove that agriculture is equal to the sole support of a modern and most flourishing society . " Under the agrarian economy ( which accelerated in Lombardy during this period ) , villa building and reconstruction occupied the time and resources of noble families intent on forming agricultural dynasties . A villa culture had long existed in Lombardy , as it had in other parts of the peninsula . But , as I will demonstrate , an intensification in villa construction and remodeling projects characterized the eighteenth century , as did new ways of representing the estates themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds indicate a society driven by a secular world of agricultural industry , one that stands apart from earlier villa cultures of the Italian peninsula . <p> Recent scholarship has focused on the construction of space as the apparatus that produces social relations . This intellectual trajectory , coupled with the increased interest in critical theory as a starting point for understanding environmental transformation , gives my studywith its emphasis on the material environment as a historical agent in the age of the Enlightenmenteven greater relevance . Built form , I contend , is the consequence of culturewhich , in turn , it also shapes . Buildings , gardens , and the products of visual culture are , of course , produced in an artistic climate and thus reveal aesthetic trends . But they also reflect and result from the events , both monumental and minute , of their time . Landscapes and the artifacts related to them shape history ; they are active agents in the formation of culture . <p> The social history of early modern European elites is relatively well documented . What this study demonstrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated and uncultivated fields , the ordinary and the elite built environment , including the architecture of villas and the life supported within themin the structure of that social history . I intend to she 'd new light on the role the built environment played in the structure and display of elite life and to provide a new way of documenting aspects of that history that might not be available through other forms of evidence . By examining landscape and its representationsand here I include the architecture of the villa in my definition of " landscape " a more detailed view of aristocratic country life comes into focus . In the context of the Habsburg reforms , specific regional variants emerge as well , revealing subtleties related to the aspects of culture privileged by the Lombard elite . <p> The landscape created by the Habsburg reforms in eighteenth-century Lombardy certainly existed as a specific physical entity ; moreover , it represented a new way of controlling , displaying , seeing , and describing the world . It was not only a physical landscape whose spatial qualities were determined by emergent habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new social and cultural configuration in the villa compound and its surroundings . I therefore examine the landscape in this study as a visual and aesthetic phenomenon , but not exclusively or even primarily so . Instead , I am interested in interpretive strategies that reveal both the complex richness of the landscape and its role as a fundamental aspect of everyday existence for specific groups of people . <p> This study reconstructs a picture of the built environment using artifacts of visual and material culturebuildings , gardens , prints , and mapssynthetically , analyzing landscape and architecture , cities and countryside as part of a single continuum . It forms a historic panorama through the analysis of a wide range of evidence , including the villas themselves , printed images of the villas and surrounding landscape , family and estate records , cadastral maps and registers , legal documents , agricultural practices , real estate documents , water rights , lease agreements , travelers accounts , and detailed studies of the social , economic , and political history of Lombardy under the Habsburgs . It is a book based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary materials , and I have made no attempt to be archivally exhaustive . As an architectural and landscape historian , I have a particular affinity for visual and material artifacts , and so these constitute the majority of the evidence assembled here . <p> Among the most significant remaining artifacts related to these complexes is a set of printsMarcAntonio Dal Res Ville di delizie o siano palaggi camparecci nello Stato di Milano , published in 172627 and 1743 . This study begins with Dal Res printed images of the villas and develops outward to an increasingly specific examination of various aspects of selected villa compounds . The books structure reflects my efforts to understand as much as possible about everything depicted in the prints , and the inquiry follows the path of my eye through the images : I move from the artifact of the print itself to the exterior agrarian landscape , to the villa , and into its gardens . <p> Despite their compelling sense of accuracy , Dal Res prints are highly idealized and are often aggrandizinga fact that I support in detail in Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , and in this sense , they present a kind of fiction . Of course , all representations are constructed , and are , to some degree , fictionalized . In the context of this book , I use the term " fiction " to mean that the prints seldom portray the villas as they actually existed but instead indicate what the patrons desired , which is its own kind of important truth . Dal Re sometimes invented , sometimes made subtle alterations to the reality of a site , and sometimes simply selected aspects for display over others . But in all cases , these deviations from what we might consider mimetically authentic portrayals are themselves deeply significant . In the chapters that follow , I will demonstrate that the prints are more ( and often less ) than accurate depictions of lost sites , which they were never intended to be . More than simply telling us what a particular site may have looked like at a specific point in time , prints such as Dal Res are part of a complex discursive field related to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape in the workings of everyday life and in the shaping of culture . <p> The sweetly innocuous title of the printed seriesVillas of Delightlikewise belies the complex reality of life on these eighteenth-century estates . Throughout this book , I will contrast Dal Res use of the term " delizie " with the life and activities that actually took place in the villas . A tradition of applying the word delizie to describe villas and villa life was fixed by the eighteenth century , and Dal Re was undoubtedly aware of it , adopting the word as it had been used in villa literature since at least the sixteenth century . He probably did not use it ironically or to persuade in any ideological sense . Dal Re certainly saw no conflict in his use of the term to describe villas that served as retreats and as carefully managed agricultural estates , because such a custom had already been firmly established . Nonetheless , he neither described nor explicitly displayed the productive aspects of the villa compound , choosing instead to promote only the villas delightful aspects . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Res title for the series . <p> In the past , and even the very recent past , historians have generally accepted Dal Res prints as authentic depictions of the actual built state of the villas in their time , and they accepted the term " delight " without question as well . A significant point of this study , then , is to examine carefully these narratives and to try to uncover the dimensional reality of Lombard villa life . Compared with various forms of evidence , the prints clearly disclose Dal Res fabrications . Moreover , it is impossible to ignore the physical facts of the Lombard plain . Hot and humid in the summer , the flatlands and their rice paddies were malarial , hosting swarms of insects . We can only imagine how uncomfortable they were in the middle of summer for aristocrats in eighteenth-century garb . Winters brought the cold , damp fogs that today plague the Linate and Malpensa air-traffic controllers . Only the villas in the pre-Alpine lake areas , where little cultivation occurred , had the climate and surroundings to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sift through the fiction presented by the prints and through decades of villa scholarship that often perpetuated Dal Res version of Lombard country life . <p> Approached critically , the prints pose the same challenges as a literary text : they present a visual narrative that seldom records the actual form of villa compounds . Because the prints distorted spatial realities , they are most authentic in their representation of what mattered to this group of elite landowners . To borrow a phrase from Pierre Bourdieu , the prints reveal the symbolic and cultural capital of the eighteenth-century Lombard nobility . They show us that what mattered to the villa owners was a complex brand of power that was not solely rooted in materialism , though this was certainly of great importance . Authority also depended on the symbolic capital of prestige and family honor and on the cultural capital derived from competenceacademic knowledge of and participation in a variety of fields that allowed cultural distinction . Dal Res prints contained the visual cues that permitted his patrons to establish their distinguished positions and his viewers to discern the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hierarchy upon which noble life was founded . Even more , the prints may also have allowed the nobility to display their wealth and power at a time of cultural destabilization caused by the Habsburg colonization . That their appearance coincided with the acceleration of the social and economic reforms associated with the enlightened-absolutist policies of the Habsburgs is , to my mind , of real significance , and I assume these to be linked phenomena . If this is correct , then the prints both registered and affected cultural change . In addition to displaying the villas architectural delights , the prints reveal far more about issues ranging from the reorganization of the system of taxation to aristocratic social crises regarding the new egalitarianism associated with colonial reform . Dal Res views , however distorted and fictionalized , hint at meaningful connections between villa and landscape , city and countryside , built form and class relationships , environmental control and economic power . In short , his panoramic views require a panoramic approach to historical inquiry . <p> In broadening the scope of inquiry , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuous and aesthetic pleasures of villa complexes and gardens . These were chronicled by a very few travelers and by a greater number of local writers , and in this book , their descriptions appear alongside evidence that points to some less pleasant realities . Moreover , the prints of the Ville di delizie are indeed delightful to look at , and I have spent many long and enjoyable hours examining every detail of Dal Res views . They were , no doubt , equally delightful and perhaps even titillating for contemporary viewers , for whom a lifestyle from which they were excluded was richly and minutely displayed . But we must recognize that by their very nature , villas were entirely dependent on the surrounding landscape and the city beyond . We can not ignore the fact that villas cost a great deal of money to build and maintaina simple point , but one with complex ramifications . To understand the villa , we have to understand where the money came from , how it was gained , and how villa life was economically sustained . I therefore sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to more traditional forms of evidence . <p> In this light , the villa becomes a complex manifestation of a range of strategies to maintain a specific social and economic status quo during a time of cultural destabilization resulting from intracontinental colonization . Villa life depended on and was determined by the vagaries of economics , political factors , and cultural structures ; by their very nature , villas were entirely dependent on the surrounding landscape and the city beyond . I have presented this subject from both sides of the villa wall , scrutinizing the lives of those who resided in the grand estates , those who supported their existence , and those excluded by this particular system of spatial control and production . But the central subjects around which this analysis pivotsbuildings and the landscapeare the fundamental settings for the workings of culture . Thus the built environment , including constructed nature , remains at the heart of this historical reconstruction . <p> As noted previously , the books structure follows the path of the viewers eye through one of Dal Res panoramas . Chapter 1 focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and revealing the numerous fictions they contain . Chapter 2 examines the Habsburg cadastral mapping project , an effort that dramatically influenced the formation of the eighteenth-century landscape . Profoundly controversial throughout the eighteenth century , the massive cadastral project aimed at uniform and comprehensive economic and social reforms , and it resulted in a reconstruction of the conceptual basis of the landscape and external nature itself . The cadastral maps were a remarkable record and agent of historical change and another means for the visual rendition of space . They bring the agricultural Lombard landscape into much sharper focus , just as the history of their production illuminates life in the eighteenth-century Duchy of Milan . As David Harvey has written , " Power struggles over mapping . . . are fundamental moments in the production of discourses . " The maps , the history of their production , and the records of opposition to the mapping effort make the cadaster an ideal case study , revealing the specific practices behind a variety of spatial theories . Maps , prints , and visual images , then , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative as the physical apparatus of the villa itself . <p> Chapter 3 examines the particularized social knowledge displayed in the genre scenes that appear in the estate views . Focusing especially on the depiction of human figures in Dal Res prints , this chapter clarifies the position of these subjects within the constellation of signifiers that distinguished elite members of Lombard society . In this chapter I argue that the figures are more than mere accessories to the central subject of the view : instead , they serve as carefully chosen and configured components in the cult of appearances that characterized noble life . Drawing on a range of sourcesincluding books on etiquette , civility , gesture , and comportmentalong with iconographic analysis , I demonstrate the key role played by such scenes and figures in the complex staging of aristocratic self-fashioning . <p> Chapters 4 and 5 analyze the architecture of eighteenth-century villa compounds , demonstrating that villa architecture was ideally suited to the masterful control of surrounding environmental resources . The accumulation of property assumed great importance for Lombard villa owners . Such holdings conferred status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources and economic gain . The environmental control exerted by villa owners was integrally linked to the advertisement of landownership , which was crucial to the maintenance of the owners place in the social hierarchy . Laws that regulated access to landscape resources also served to reinforce social status ( though historians have rarely studied this linkage ) . An examination of the three villas belonging to the powerful and prominent Clerici family forms the focus of these chapters . I chose to focus on the Clerici for two reasons . First , Dal Re dedicated one volume of the 1743 edition of the Delizie to the Clerici , and he represented three of their villas in that volume , indicating that they were both significant patrons for the series and providers of ample visual source material . Second , the Clerici were both politically and socially prominent in Milan , and their well-preserved archives are easily accessible in the Archivio di Stato di Milano . Their villas reveal that the need for a functional , carefully controlled building that could serve as an administrative center primarily determined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific architectural splendor . Relaxation and escape entered the equation only as tertiary concerns . <p> Chapters 6 and 7 enter the exclusive realm of the garden . Here , I argue that gardens served as a material microcosm of the same impulse toward display , production , and social regulation found in the larger villa complex . The gardens of the Barbiani di Belgioioso family provide a focus : the Barbiani di Belgioioso were also important patrons of Dal Re , and he depicted three of their villas . And , like that of the Clerici , much of the Barbiani di Belgioioso archive is accessible for study . Lombard nobles used their gardens like their villasas a means for displaying their wealth to outsiders in order to legitimize their right to title , status , and power . The garden was an extension of the villa architecture , and it exhibited the same environmental control found in the villa complex . Here , the regulation of nature was not only mastered but also masterfully displayed . Gardens constituted an essential component of noble and aristocratic self-fashioning . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these elites naturalized the appearance of the prevailing social order . The gardens became an important refuge and a symbol for a group whose elite status would remain protected , even in the face of varying political circumstances and encroaching modernity . <p> The literature on Lombard villas and gardens is not large ; for the most part , it comprises the work of local historians whose efforts have aided my own and whose titles appear in the notes . Likewise , Lombardy itself seldom appears as a subject for historical study . It remains in the scholarly margins , a peripheral territory frequently overlooked in favor of Rome , Florence , or Venice . But important foundational precedents exist for this project , among them the eloquent and learned studies by James Ackerman , David Coffin , Elisabeth Blair MacDougall , Mirka BeneT , Denis Cosgrove , and Claudia Lazzaro . Though their approaches and interests differ from mine , each of these scholars has contributed much to the field of villa studiesand without their works , this one would not have been possible . Although political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art historians have tended to focus on Lombard works dating from the Renaissance and before , generally leaving later periods to the examination of local historians . The primary differentiating factors in this study , then , are both the range of sources consulted and the types of questions asked . By examining maps and views , tax records and agrarian practices , legal documents and family histories , architectural drawings , site configurations , treatises , and social regulations , a definition of landscape emerges that broadens the scopeand hopefully the depthof knowledge to be gleaned from villa histories . Through this panoramic investigation , I hope to add to the growing scholarship on villa cultures , illuminating the significance of developments in the provinces of the northern peninsula . Eighteenth-century Lombardy was far from peripheral . It sat at a crossroads of Continental cultural exchange , a crucial territory in the economic and political success of an entire dynastic empire .

Schafft and Alecia Youngblood Jackson <p> The year 2008 marked the first time in human history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than rural places ( United Nations Population Fund 2007 ) . In the United States as well as across the globe , the history of development has been largely one of urbanization , rural outmigration , and the subsumption of spatial peripheries into the social , cultural , economic , and political spheres of the urban core ( Krannich 2008 ; Lipton 1977 ; McGranahan 2003 ; White 1998 ) . This long , steady process has been deeply etched into the history of rural education , and in the United States and elsewhere it has to varying degrees been directly abetted by rural education ( Corbett 2007 ; Theobald 1997 ; Woodrum 2004 ) . <p> Well over one hundred years ago , school reformers in the United States began to talk about what came to be known as the " rural school problem " ( Kannapel and DeYoung 1999 ; Tyack 1972 ) . Rural schools , these reformers argued , were too inefficient for the demands of a rapidly changing , urbanizing , and globalizing society . At the heart of the " efficiency " problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , were simply ill equipped to run their own schools and prepare students to be economically competitive and productive in a modernizing world . As Elwood Cubberley ( himself an urban educational reformer ) wrote nearly one hundred years ago , " Managed as it has been by rural people , themselves lacking in educational insight , penurious , and with no comprehensive grasp of their own problems , the rural school , except in a few places , has practically stood still " ( 1922 , 102 ) . <p> The solution , reformers like Cubberley concluded , was to make rural schools look more like urban schools : larger , bureaucratized , run by educational professionals rather than locals , and informed by the latest pedagogical knowledge . This legacy is now manifested for urban and rural schools alike in the form of school consolidation , the standardization of curricula and assessment , and the increased reliance on business models of school management ( Engels 2000 ; Jo 2005 ; Lyson 2002 ; Tyack and Cuban 2001 ) . As Gruenewald and Smith ( 2008 , xiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption about the purpose of schooling is to prepare the next generation to compete and succeed in the global economy . " It is for these reasons that Corbett has argued that in rural areas schooling may be considered the " quintessential institution of disembedding " ( 2007 , 251 ) , as public education serves the economic imperative of capitalism by severing attachment to place and producing mobile , adaptable youth flexibly responsive to changing labor market conditions . <p> Simultaneously , increased political , economic , and cultural globalization has reshaped the global-local interface ( Drainville 2004 ; Swyngedouw 1997 ) and , consequently , the identity of rural people and places ( Bonanno and Constance 2003 , 241 ) . Rural people and places have likely never had the " closed " identities suggested by the community-based traditions , political and cultural conservatism , and generational discourses of sameness often described by rural community members ( Bell 1992 ; Woods 2005 ) . But as we enter the twenty-first century , the face of rural communities has nevertheless been radically transformed by the economic effects of multinational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information technology , and educational reforms such as No Child Left Behind that privilege standardized curricula and " high-stakes " accountability for test scores over accountability to the contexts of local people and places . These changes have presented new opportunities for rural people , as well as new challenges . <p> What does this mean for rural education ? And what does this imply for the relationship between rural schools and the communities they serve ? Historically , rural schools have served important roles as centers of social activity and cultural meaning , helping to maintain local traditions and particular identities of rural communities . They are sites of civic interaction and shared intergenerational identity and experience ( Elder and Conger 2000 ; Lyson 2002 ; Peshkin 1978 ) . Yet rural schools also paradoxically represent a direct challenge to local ( rural ) identity and community survival when embodying urban values and serving national-level economic agendas that largely dismiss the " inefficiencies " of rural placesand even the connection to place in general ( Corbett 2007 ; DeYoung and Howley 1990 ; Edmondson 2001 ) . This edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzes the multiple , competing discourses that vie for the identity of placeand therefore the institution of schoolingby exploring the practices that offer problems and possibilities for the futures of rural community members as well as the educational systems that serve them . <p> Organization of This Book <p> Our purpose in writing this book was to gather together in one volume a diverse set of voices and perspectives , including those representing educational theory and policy and educational leadership , but also scholars with backgrounds in sociology and rural sociology , demography , political science , and community development . While much contemporary educational research takes it as a given that the walls of the classroom or the school building largely describe the limits of the analytic focus , the work in this volume instead foregrounds the interrelationship between school and community , and how that interrelationship is shaped by the global-local context in which it is embedded . We believe that closely examining issues at the school-community interface demands an inherently multidisciplinary approach , one we have tried to model within the pages of this volume . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on qualitative methods ( i.e. , interviews , observations , and documents analyses ) to examine school-community issues . We believe that one of the strengths of this edited collection is a focus on naturalistic inquiry " in the field " of rural places . Qualitative designs such as ethnography , case studies , phenomenology , narrative inquiry , and mixed methods are represented in the text . As such , many of the chapters in this volume build on the sort of critical scholarship instituted in educational research by the pioneering sociological work of Paul Willis ( 1977 ) , who initiated the theoretically informed analysis of the micro-dynamics of life in and out of school in an urban British community . Several chapters draw explicitly or implicitly on the tradition of critical scholarship and resistance that Williss work established . While we acknowledge the contributions of objective , quantitative research in describing large trends and explaining or comparing certain variables that make up rural life , the authors in this collection take seriously the experiences and perspectives of rural people ; they emphasize rural peoples views and voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping a eye toward the global contexts in which rurality is constructed , experienced , and critiqued . <p> Finally , while the contributors to this volume focus primarily on rural school and community relations in the United States , also included are perspectives from Canada , sub-Saharan Africa , and Australia , among others , to introduce an international comparative focus , and to suggest some of the ways that global economic , social , and cultural change have reshaped the rural school-community relationship across multiple contexts . <p> Spaces of Identity <p> The volume begins with part 1 , " Spaces of Identity . " The chapters in this section explore how rurality itself comes to be constituted as a discursive space , how rural and community identities are produced and reproduced , and how relations of power at local and supra-local levels shape how rural identity is constructed , negotiated , and challenged . Within these chapters , close critiques of these constructions of place-bound identities consider ways that rural education might provide opportunities for rural students to redefine place as something other than local geography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to encourage them to imagine worlds beyond their own . <p> In the opening chapter , Theobald and Wood employ a historical analysis to examine the construction of rural identity through popular and mass media , looking in particular at the ways negative stereotypes of rural identity are formed , and how cultural messages reinforce the associations between rurality , backwardness , and deficiency . Though they argue that anti-rural biases have roots that stretch at least as far back as seventeenth-century Europe , these stereotypes and negative associations are only strengthened by the proliferation of mass media and the globalized production and distribution of goods and services . " Though some may possess the ability to dismiss these messages , " they argue , " the very act of dismissing them becomes a part of the identity an individual builds . . . . Since the United States is synonymous with progress , and progress is culturally defined as ever more urban growth and development , rural youth see themselves as nonparticipants in the American experience , at least until they leave their home and move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion in chapter 2 , examining the stigmas associated with the intersection of rurality and class . They argue that globalization " undermines the local commons from which local community is developed , creating conditions that make the social exclusion of already marginalized groups just that much more likely . " Far from deficiency , Howley and Howley argue that those generally identified as " the rural poor " are instead characterized by resiliency and remarkable productivity in their capacity to identify resources and manage their existence ( see also Corbett , this volume ) . And yet the " othering " that rural people , and especially rural poor people , experience obscures this resiliency . Rural educators are positioned to help their students , and by extension the broader community , imagine different possibilities , " but they must do so on very different terms than those prized by the institution of U.S. schooling and the global political economy that increasingly sponsors it . " <p> The first two chapters are communitarian in their orientation insofar as they emphasize the social and educational potential of fostering and ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension over rural community identity is framed principally at the interstices of the local and the globalthe ways in which local ( rural ) actors negotiate individual and community identity in the face of economic policies , educational reforms , and cultural discourse that ignores , dismisses , or denigrates local and rural experience . The following two chapters in this section , however , complicate the discussion by regarding the tension over identity construction within community , examining how individual and institutional actors work to define the boundaries of local community and identity as a way of determining who is included and who is excluded . <p> Groenke and Nespors chapter explores how the use of racist language is employed by rural youth as a mechanism for establishing the boundaries of local identity " from symbolically excluding outsiders and newcomers to the area , to subverting school administrators attempts to integrate the school discursively into the larger cosmopolitan school district by instituting a speech code , to policing intra-group identity among peers . " They argue that " rural spaces and identities of persons living in rural spaces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfold not only between local and global forces ( the rural community and cultural and economic forces originating outside it ) , but among different factions within rural communities who may appropriate global tools or imagery as readily as they embrace more familiar and traditional local practices . " The authors conclude by suggesting that administrators can not condone or ignore the use of racist language , but must also be aware of how actions on their part may inadvertently galvanize oppositional identities that draw directly on racist categories . <p> In chapter 4 , Jackson , using a Foucauldian analysis of discourse , similarly critiques the ways that power and identity are constituted and locally negotiated . The analysis of power and discourse in the rural town of Garner is meant to reveal how the institution of schooling , which may be a site of powerful local control and autonomy , can also exist as a structure of exclusion . Jacksons main thesis is that rural schools can not always escape the power effects of their own resistance to globalizing trends . While rural places may yearn to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people in the community and schools . The desire for control can lead to power effects that can be damaging to the ways students learn to value themselves and their communities . What is important about this type of discursive analysis is its emphasis not only on knowledge about rural schooling itself , but also on how that knowledge was formed , and how that knowledge functions within discourse to open up or limit the lives of people . In this way , meanings of " community " can be critiqued and reimagined . Such an analysis also moves the focus from individuals ( such as students who " fail " within certain places ) to a rigorous tracing of how problems become possible within discourse . <p> Placing Education <p> Part 2 , " Placing Education , " builds on the ideas in part 1 , offering a collection of chapters that analyzes the purpose of education in rural placesand its impact on communitywithin the tensions and conditions of a changing nation and world . Contributors in this section grapple with questions such as : What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of education ? What are the messages inherent in formal , standardized schooling that are transmitted to rural students ? and , What does it mean to " be " a teacher in such shifting times and unstable places ? <p> Schafft , Killeen , and Morrisseys chapter analyzes the tensions of place and the purpose of education in a shifting world , using a case study of a set of rural communities in upstate New York to examine the interconnections among rural economic change , increases in rural poverty , and the added challenges imposed on rural students and schools by the federal No Child Left Behind legislation ( NCLB ) . They argue that across the United States many rural communities , especially those historically based around agricultural or manufacturing economies , have experienced the economic brunt of neoliberal economic policies encouraging free trade and government deregulation . This has led to the concentration of agriculture and industrial shutdowns as manufacturing is resited overseas where labor is cheaper and environmental regulations laxer . They argue that NCLB also derives from a market-driven logic fully consistent with neoliberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of accountability measures . In upstate New York , as in many other declining rural areas in the United States , accountability measures may operate as a " double jeopardy , " penalizing schools not necessarily for underperformance of students as a consequence of inadequate teaching and administration , but , ironically , for student underperformance directly related to deepening local poverty conditions and the residential instability and academic dislocation that so often results . <p> Michael Corbetts work in chapter 6 broadly addresses the clash between the generalizing discourse of formal education ( especially its tendencies toward standardization of both curricula and assessment , and its translation of the specificity of locality into a placeless global ) and the particularizing discourse of locality and community . As Corbett has written elsewhere ( 2007 , 48 ) , " These two competing spaces stand in resistance to one another ; each creates its own criteria of intelligence and legitimate ( real ) work and each sets up its own as the people who have the natural gifts to do the work that is done by people like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular habitat . " <p> Corbetts many years of teaching and extensive ethnographic research in a Nova Scotia coastal fishing community raise important questions about these two " competing spaces " : the multiple , informal institutions of community deeply embedded in local history and culture on the one hand , and the institution of the school on the other hand , an instrument of the state and a purveyor of formal knowledge fundamentally constituting " a story about somewhere else . " What does formal schooling have to say , implicitly or explicitly , about local experience ? In this chapter Corbett reflects on his teaching experiences in a Nova Scotia elementary school and how these two competing spacesand the tensions and ambivalences they createhelp to shape the identities and future trajectories of rural people and the communities in which they live in . <p> The community-global dynamic and its impact on rural education is further explored in chapter 7 by Giroux , Jah , and Eloundou-Enyegue as they look at rural education in the context of sub-Saharan Africa . Their chapter examines trends in rural-urban inequalities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the process of globalization has often been optimistically described as an equalizing force , facilitating the flow of ideas , information , communication , and opportunities across divergent spaces ; compressing space ; and reducing inequality , this process has been uneven at best . In the African context , inequalities between countries have decreased overall , but inequalities within countriesand in particular between rural and urban areashave increased , especially as the process of urbanization in developing countries continues . Because of this they investigate the extent to which rural communities experience economic marginalization as a consequence of globalization , and if so , whether this is primarily due to differences in human capital attributes . Their findings suggest that in the case of Cameroon , while rural-urban differences in educational attainment have decreased , human capital attributes appear to have less effect on outcomes than before . <p> Similar to chapter 7 , in chapter 8 Edmondson and Butler look at the role of education in the context of economically declining postindustrial rural communities in Pennsylvania . Like Corbett , these contributors inquire into what it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in which local economic opportunities have been markedly limited by rural economic change . The authors discuss prevailing ideological discoursesconservative , neoconservative , neoliberal , and liberalhow these discourses translate into coherent teaching practice , and what this implies for rural people , schools , and communities . They argue that none of these discourses provides direction for resolving the problems faced by rural communities , problems that require active local engagement and democratic deliberation . <p> Teaching Communities <p> After a consideration of issues of identity , place , and education , the book concludes with part 3 , " Teaching Communities , " a section that includes critical yet hopeful accounts of programs and partnerships that offer support for different ways of being " rural " in educational communities . Manuscripts argue for approaches such as indigenous education , culturally based pedagogies , interactive distance learning , and critical pedagogies for English Language Learners and special education students . The authors in this section advocate for rural education that may potentially shift the relationships among identity , place , and community in positive , productive ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in popular culture " globalization " is a relatively recent notion , for indigenous tribes and communities globalization has been a reality for at least five hundred years , beginning with European contact and colonization . Despite the threats posed by disease , poverty , and concerted efforts to eradicate their cultures and languages , Native communities not only continue to persist ( Schafft , Faircloth , and Thompson 2006 ) , but use institutions like the tribal colleges to preserve traditional language and culture . They argue that tribal colleges do this both " through locally derived curricula , programming , and instructional practices that make tribal colleges spaces within which both Native and non-Native students can thrive intellectually and culturally , " and also by taking specifically global approaches to higher education , developing multiple worldwide partnerships across educational institutions serving Native persons . <p> A broader discussion of higher education access for youth is the focus of chapter 10 . Like the chapters by Corbett and by Edmondson and Butler , McDonough and Gildersleeve similarly address the disconnects between formal education and the lived experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marked by their closeness to community , this does not extend to higher education , which has historically been unresponsive to rural contexts and the needs of rural students . While rural schools typically have higher graduation rates than urban schools , college enrollment of students from rural areas lags behind the national average , and especially behind rates of enrollment for urban students . Using an earlier published study of rural northern California , the authors argue that these graduation rates can at least be partially explained by the cultural disconnect between higher education and the lived experience and cultural contexts of rural students . Using Pierre Bourdieus concept of habitus , they argue that rural areas like the Northstate area of California embody social and cultural practices that may mitigate against college attendance , such as attachment to community and locality as well as the prevalence of labor markets that historically have not required college degrees for gainful employment ( though this is changing ) . The authors argue that to increase educational opportunities for rural students , institutions of higher education need to more fully engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper understanding of and appreciation for rural heritage , traditions , and the lived experiences of rural students . <p> Australia poses unique challenges for engaging rural students and building connections within and across localities given the sparsely settled population across the vast continent . In chapter 11 , Crump and Twyford describe how these challenges are being met through a system of interactive distance e-learning that expands the reach of educational services for school-aged and adult learners . They describe how this system builds connections both to and between rural and isolated Australian communities via broadband Internet technology , " reducing the tyranny of distance , as well as reaffirming the sense of place that helps bind and hold rural communities together . " <p> The next two chapters focus on programs and partnerships that support particular rural student populations . In the United States , one of the more notable demographic trends in rural areas has been the in-migration of international immigrants seeking employment ( often in agriculture or in meat processing plants ) or affordable , safe places to live . In certain cases in-migration , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ethnic composition of a community and place new strains on the resources of small schools required to accommodate new English Language Learner ( ELL ) populations . In their chapter , Bustamante , Brown , and Irby note that rural ELL teachers " often find themselves on the front line of changing demographics " within rural communities . They describe a program designed to enable local educators and administrators to improve ELL reading instruction while simultaneously acting as agents of change in their schools and communities . <p> Butera and Costello also focus on a specific set of students in their discussion of special education in the rural context , where the proportion of **28;1809;TOOLONG students is nearly twice the national average ( NCES 2007 ) . This is significant given that most preparation programs for special educators focus on urban contexts . These programs are therefore not well-placed to train educators to identify the particular assets of rural communities that may aid in the provision of special education . Butera and Costello describe a professional development course emphasizing parent partnerships and focusing on how biography and place affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education and its transformation into a standardized technology for content delivery has undermined the school-community connection . The program they describe provides an important opportunity to " deprofessionalize " the relationship between educator and parent , and in so doing to diminish the distance between school and community . <p> The volume concludes with a discussion by Schafft regarding how educational accountability has over time aligned directly with the economic imperatives of the state , assuming market models and fundamentally weakening the relationship between school and community . This has led , Schafft argues , to a shifting of educational allegiances within schools away from a broader accountability to community and society , in favor of accountability to sets of abstracted institutional and bureaucratic mandates , raising troubling questions about not only the nature of accountability , but the nature of education itself . Schafft argues , however , that community engagement and educational improvement are not only complementary but fundamentally interconnected priorities , and represent critical components of a necessary education for the twenty-first century and the challenges that lie ahead . <p> Conclusion : Looking Back , Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary critiques of the ways that rural places , their people , and their schools have experienced cultural hybridity in the wake of capitalism , globalization , immigration , economic shifts , NCLB , violence , war , and the proliferation of media and technology . The contributors have explored these competing interests and have analyzed the problems and possibilities of rural people having to rethink their entire ways of living , being , and educating their children . We hope that the analyses in this collection suggest the closely entwined fates of rural schools and communities as well as the multiple ways in which place matters . Place emerges not as a fixed , bounded , authentic site but as an articulation of social relations and cultural and political practices that are paradoxical , provisional , and constantly in the process of becoming .

What we do n't  know is how to deal with the messy moral and political quandaries caused by the violent actions of victims . When the line between guilt and innocence wavers , when we are not sure who is responsible for what , and when we are overwhelmed by compassion or pity for the victim who victimizes , we can become unsettled by the ambiguity of events and our resulting ambivalence . To avoid the discomfort and the dogged work of moral judgment and political action that the situation demands , we might respond that everyone is a victimthat no one is responsibleand that any one of us would have acted the same way under such circumstances . We may then wash our hands of the mess and leave it to the law . <p> The hard questions of this book arise out of such ambivalence . Many have commented on an increasing concerneven obsessionwith victims in contemporary Western society , or perhaps globally.1 It could be traced to Freuds writings , to the postwar years in Europe , when the returning soldiers trauma came to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish victim as the standard for victimhood , and to feminisms interventions in the legal systems response to rape . Tracing this history would constitute a study in its own right . I am more interested in exploring its effects in a number of divergent realms . <p> Expressions of the ambivalence and moral anxiety aroused by the victim who turns to violence are not difficult to find . In a political philosophy course I taught to undergraduates at a Canadian university in 2008 , such ambivalence quickly became apparent when we read Ishmael Beahs A Long Way Gone : Memoirs of a Boy Soldier . This autobiographical account relates the harrowing tale of Beahs life as a child soldier in Sierra Leones brutal civil war , leading up to the dramatic events that preceded his rehabilitation and new life in the United States . Abducted at the age of twelve and forced to kill under the influence of drugs and ideology , Beahs predicament provides an excruciating moral and political paradox for anyone concerned with the condition and status of the victim of violence in these times . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Beahs status as a " **25;1839;TOOLONG , " asking them to discuss the ambiguity of his condition and how we should respond to it . Only two out of many more than one hundred students consideredreluctantly and apologeticallyBeahs responsibility for acts of murder and torture . Overwhelmingly , despite three months of discussions considering the moral and political challenges of dealing with victims who turn to violence , the students were unable or unwilling to negotiate competing claims for a compassionate , merciful response and the demand for moral judgment and accountability in the case of Ishmael Beah . He was quite rightly acknowledged as a victim who was forced to kill by circumstances , but this acknowledgment created a blind spot when it came to his victims . In theory the students could grant Beahs status as both victim and perpetrator , but in practice it seemed impossible for them to respond to him as a victim while simultaneously requiring that he be accountable as a perpetrator in order to respond to the suffering of his victims . <p> Beyond my classroom , we do n't  have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the condition and status of victimhood . Taking the cultural pulse on the question of victimhood is not difficult , starting with the Oprah Winfrey show , which Eva Illouz calls " a popular cultural form that makes sense of suffering at a time when psychic pain has become a permanent feature of our politics . " 2 Oprahs guests , as well as her audience , often identify asor withvictims whose suffering invites the emotional catharsis of the talking cure . Contemporary films corroborate the Oprah effect . In Paul Haggiss film Crash ( 2004 ) , which depicts the state of racism in Los Angeles , we are invited to empathize with every perpetrator of a racist or sexist act of violence . The viewer is tempted to absolve even the obnoxious white police officer who molests a black woman while on duty , when we discover his poignant tenderness toward an ailing father , and his final act of bravadopulling the same woman he previously molested out of a burning car at the scene of a near-fatal accident . The recent vampire film by Swedish director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , elicits compassion for a vampire who must kill to sustain herself . Indeed , her victims solicit less pity than does the vampire . Who is the victim ? The vampire or the individual whose blood keeps her alive ? This may not be newMary Shelleys Frankenstein gave us insight into the monsters own heartachebut the extent to which this ambivalence is exerting itself in the realm of politics and ethics , encouraging moral relativism and a reticence to judge , is something new , and troubling . <p> Consider Slavoj iPeks concern over the " humanization " of soldiers , a current cultural phenomenon he believes is apparent in films but also in the reality of daily life in Israel . The Hurt Locker , for example , is a recent film depicting the ordeal of soldiers who risk death while dismantling terrorist bombs meant for civilians . " Can there be anything more sympathetic to our liberal sensibilities ? " iPek asks . For these squads appear to be just like the U.S. Armya humanitarian force in the war against terror , patiently dismantling the weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect is replicated in films like Lebanon and Waltz with Bashir , which narrate events from the perspective of Israeli soldiers , highlighting " the perpetrators traumatic experience . " iPek concludes , " Such a humanization thus serves to obfuscate the key point : the need for a ruthless analysis of what we are doing in our political-military activity and what is at stake . Our political-military struggles are not an opaque history that brutally disrupts our intimate personal livesthey are something in which we fully participate . " 3 <p> In each of these examples , a certain " regard " for the perpetrator waylays judgment , whether compassion , pity , empathy , tolerance , or even veneration . We are invited into the emotional or psychic existence of the perpetratorto identify with her sufferingand no longer feel that it is our place to judge the rightness or wrongness of her actions ; we substitute pity for " ruthless analysis , " or a false empathy for accepting our own responsibility . It would be simplistic to criticize this ambivalence as unequivocally misguided or dangerous , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly and rightly aware of the human vulnerability and fragility of the perpetrator . Or at least of some perpetrators . There are the terrorists , whom we perceive to be monstrous in their wrongdoing , and then there are the normal people we all know , who commit wrong because somewhere along the way they were misinformed , badly raised , or victimized by abusive and neglectful adults . We could add the soldier , who may occupy a category of his or her ownthose who are forced to do the dirty work for the rest of us , their deeds forgotten in our gratefulness for their sacrifice and our pity for their struggles . That these films reveal this vulnerability and make us doubt our perhaps typical responses to perpetrators is to their credit , but it places us smack in the middle of a difficult quandary : how do we make moral judgments against those whose circumstances solicit overwhelming compassion ? Once we see the soft , frail underbelly of the perpetratorskillers , genocidaires , racists , misogynists , rapists , warmongers , even a lonely young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is precisely our familiarity with others vulnerability that allows us to make judgmentsmerciful judgments that require the ruthless analysis of which iPek speaks , but also respect for anothers agency and compassion for her predicament . <p> Cultural commentators have dealt with the dangers of noting this fragility impatiently and contentiouslybut not without humorin recent years . Charles Sykes argued in the early 1990s that America has become " a nation of victims . " From the cyclist who claims to be victimized by " motorism " to the feminist who argues she is victimized by Western ideals of beauty , " this squalling howl of grievance , " Sykes suggests , has " become a national chorus . " The consequences are significant : we do n't  need to accept responsibility for our actions because there is always someone else to blame ; we actively compete for victimhood status ; we experience " compassion fatigue " and learn to ignore the appeals of " real " victims whose voices are drowned out by the ever growing list of " certifiable " victims ; we become hypersensitive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social advantage . These are the problematic results of " victimism , " a discourse that Sykes argues is reshaping Americas employment practices , criminal justice system , and education policies . He is particularly wary of the manifestations of victimism in academia , where political correctness is constantly raising the stakes . From handbooks filled with words and phrases that should be shunned in order to avoid giving offense ( Sykes mentions " disabled , " " he , " and " black mood " ) , to the grumbling of students who are forced to read the work of " dead white males " with whom they do not identify , the intellectual landscape of academia has been transformed . " American life is increasingly characterized by the plaintive insistence , I am a victim , " Sykes concludes . It is a remarkable egalitarian victimization that expresses itself in the mantra " I am not responsible ; its not my fault . " 4 <p> Sykess argument is meant to inflame , but he has a point , and it is significant that he made it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf ears . The examples he uses are often superficial and extreme , leaving him open to criticism from scholars such as Alyson Cole , who dismisses him as one more right-wing proponent of " anti-victimism " defined as a campaign especially targeting feminists and antiracists that associates victimization with " weakness , passivity , dependency , and effeminacy . " While it seems as though contemporary American society is increasingly concerned with and responsive to suffering , from new laws and public funding to the therapy industry and the victims rights movement , Cole insists that current political discourse is in fact dominated by claims that are not sympathetic to victims but against them . Indeed , she goes so far as to say that victimhood is " vilified , " especially by those , like Sykes , who turn " victim " into an epithet , dismissing , ridiculing , condemning , shaming those who claim victim status.5 <p> Cole does not limit her critique to the politically conservative , however . She claims that those on the left who wish to dissociate themselves from victim politics also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . This is especially obvious , according to Cole , in the current " anti-feminist backlash , " particularly visible in the " crusade " against identity politics.6 As she sees it , this crusade mistakenly criticizes " almost any form of collectivism " as inherently victimist , since it encourages dependency on a group and nurtures an ideological basis for emancipatory action . Cole refers to Wendy Brown as a representative of the Left who has contributed to the anti-victimist distaste for identity politics . Her conservative counterpart is Shelby Steele , well known for his description of the melancholic black man who can not " disengage from the past of slavery and discrimination " and refuses to assume responsibility for his own condition.7 <p> Sykes argues that we have arrived at this point because naming and identifying victims has taken the place of public discourse and conscience . In other words , it has become a substitute for politics and good moral judgment . In the academy , especially , we are failing to judge , and to perform the political acts that judgments should inform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism flies in the face of concepts and practices we have come to embrace , particularly in the academic discourses of emancipation : empowerment , recognition , responsibility for the " other . " But it is time we ask : empowerment and recognition for the victim at what cost ? The " immense powers " ascribed to victims can not remain unexamined ; we are reaping what we sowed when we decided that the rights of victims and the desire to empower them should take precedence over all other moral and political considerations . Our response to suffering may not cure it . <p> This project was initially conceived on a double plane , taking issue with certain emancipatory discourses prevalent in the Western academy that venerate the status of " otherness " while simultaneously becoming interested in the victim of political conflict and the aftermath of war , colonization , occupation , or genocide . Despite some opposition , I hold to the idea that this starting point is significant not only for developing my particular argument but for the larger picture as well . A product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the seductive discourse of otherness , I became more and more disillusioned by the politics this discourse engendered , particularly through my experience teaching courses in womens studies programs ( more on this in chapter 1 ) . I maintain that the identity politics we find today on North American campuses , and in society in general , is different only in its scale and effects from the politics that plays out in political arenas elsewhere . This does not rule out other vast differences that contribute to political conflict , like economic disparity , corrupt governments , and , increasingly , environmental destruction and scarcity of resources , but these factors are beyond the scope of my concerns here . <p> It is urgent that we consider the limits of the discourse of the other and its assumed association with victimhood , for the discrete borders of these terms break down when we consider the violence of the Palestinian suicide bomber , or of the Hutu killing his or her Tutsi neighbor .

While a critique of identity politics and its production of the binary logic of victimhood is still relevant , indeed urgent , it is not my only concern here . The work of Jacques Derrida and his contemporariesproponents of a phenomenological and poststructuralist approach to philosophyappeals to me for its attention to unsettling essentialist claims .

Despite Derridas stance against capital punishment , for example , his **25;1866;TOOLONG formulathe calculable/incalculable , **31;1893;TOOLONG ambiguous one side of the dialectic : calculative decisions are necessary in matters of morals , law , and politics , but they can be dangerous or damaging without the incalculable , the unconditional , which is alleged to give rise to these decisions.9 This point is purposely left obscure , as anything " calculable " is considered a plan , normative programming , or technology , all of which are condemned as problematic because they can not account for difference . There is no middle ground herea serious irony , given that Derridas work is generally preoccupied with middle grounds ; one either accepts the terms deconstruction sets out ( that politics is undecidable ) or falls in with the misguided folks who promote a normative approach.10 <p> Moral judgment has become an unpopular concept and practice since the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that the French thinkers associated with the poststructuralist tradition have been reluctant to engage in moral discourse . Morality has become the undisputed jurisdiction of the political Right , associated with family values and prominent in conservative discourse . On the left , morality itself is believed to contain a certain conservative element , May suggests , one that denies difference . Thus , for example , the Left must defend multiculturalism on the grounds that humans possess no common values . " The universalist claims put forward by morality , it is said , fail to recognize diversity that characterizes different peoples moral lives . The argument runs roughly like this : since there are no universal moral values , no set of values can claim ultimate superiority over any other ; therefore , people should be exposed to a diversity of moral views . " 11 Foucault provides a good example of this avoidance of moral discourse . He makes a case against " universal necessities in human existence " and against " speaking for others " ( a sacrosanct policy in feminist discourse ) .12 No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned , and sexed subjects throughout his work ( Herculine Barbin and Pierre RiviFre especially ) . Emmanuel Levinass work is said to provide no moral theory but to promote an " ethical relation to the other " as first philosophy . Morals are passT , replaced by responsibility . As I argue later , however , this is a responsibility for the other without judgment , an abstract ethical relation that leaves no room for grappling with moral dilemmas or for the agency and responsibility of the victimized other . <p> It is curious , then , that these philosophers speak in the name of a politics that is purported to be ethical , and yet we are left with theoriesbeautiful and seductive , perhapsthat are of limited use when it comes to political practice and moral judgment . Their work has had a tremendous impact on the ethicopolitical , a term that captures what is central to both ethics and politics : the demand for deliberation and urgent action in answer to the question " what should I do ? " 13 In privileging responsibility , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes about ones relation to the other and ones infinite responsibility to that other ; questions about right or wrong actions are avoided . As in discussions of " the political " ( rather than " politics " ) , " the ethical " is abstracted from any reality that might require a moral act . Hence the conclusion of the first chapter of this book : that Levinas leads us to a benevolent but empty regard for an abstract other . <p> My initial enthusiasm about the usefulness of the poststructuralist tradition for political action has waned as I have become more exposed to the actual details of political work , to the energy and persistence of political actors , and to the perplexed expressions of those practitioners with whom I attempt to discuss the political claims of poststructuralism . I am not referring to the perplexity of the uneducated in the face of difficult intellectual ideas but to the skepticism of the political practitioner in the face of the often presumptuous , untested hypotheses of the armchair philosopher . Our interest and intervention in political events can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book does not engage with the work of these thinkers in a sustained manner , I take their work and the tradition of which they are a part as my point of departure . Since my initial attraction to Derridas insistence on the undecidability of politics , preceded by Maurice Merleau-Ponty , who rigorously defends the contingency of politics , and Simone de Beauvoir , whose marvelous description of the ambiguity of ethics is as relevant today as ever , I have wrestled with how to negotiate what is for many the greatest challenge in the politics of the poststructuralist tradition : how to reconcile contingency with the desire for practical solutions . Derrida demonstrates , perhaps better than most , the impossibility of this reconciliation , and therefore often leaves his readers in the frustrated state of wanting moremore reassurance , security , universality , and normativity . It is n't reassurance or security I seek , however , but relevance and utility , a pragmatic approach to moral and political dilemmas that needs no " unconditional " reference point.15 <p> If our current political practice , arising out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on identity claims , and on justice as vengeance , it is urgent that we develop alternative political paradigms . Despite my reservations about the usefulness of poststructuralist political thought , it has provided us with a rich terrain for discussing the meaning of politics . " The political " may be an abstraction from political events and " politics " as we know itgoverning institutions , deliberative democracy , the structures that enable public lifebut it has also made us think deeply about what it means to speak of political thought and action . These thinkers have given flesh to any dry understanding of politics in its institutional and organizational forms . Politics is agonistic , contingent , full of conflict but also of solidarity , respect , and friendship , the very stuff of life among human beings who must get along together despite our many differences and ways of understanding the world . <p> We find in Hannah Arendt the same warning against following prescribed norms or rules without the turn toward an " unconditional " that Derrida and Levinas insist must break in on the conditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no " outside , " no " beyond " or transcendent element in Arendts historical analysis , no anxiety about " sameness , " and yet she is of the same generation of scholars , born in proximity to totalitarianism . While Arendt remains skeptical about the effects of political solidarity , her emphasis on action , agency , and responsibility always occurs in the context of a pluralistic community of thinking individuals . And her analyses are always pragmatic . <p> Arendts view of politics has informed this project deeply . In The Human Condition she observes that " action is the political activity par excellence . " It is natality , then , and not mortality that is central to politics ; each new act is a new beginning , unpredictable , unforeseeable . This means that we can expect the unexpected from one another ; we can " perform what is infinitely improbable . " 16 It is a daunting freedom , but one we would never want to do without , for otherwise we would be destined to repeat our errors . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as collective moral judgment and action against injustice . I assume politics to mean the activities and relations in which humans engage in order to live ( and , ideally , flourish ) among one another . I am more interested in what occurs at the level of community life , however , than in affairs of state or global governance . Politics is perhaps most of the time the clash between these two levels.17 It is my contention that we too often neglect this sphere of activity and relations , believing ourselves isolated , powerless individuals . In this respect , Arendt can inspire . <p> Most of the discussions in this book concern victims of political violence who have been harmed personally by acts of war , genocide , rape , ethnic discrimination , occupation , the murder of loved ones , or economic devastation . What constitutes " harm , " of course , is open to interpretation , as is suffering . The violent event that cripples one victim for life may not cripple another , as personal resources vary among individuals and alter perceptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultural differences , politics , and law can all influence the meaning of victimhood . For the purposes of this book , I define a victim as one who has been intentionally harmed by another , either physically or psychologically , whether directly or indirectly through the suffering of a loved one . All of the examples I discuss involve victims who have experienced significant harm , that is , the infliction of unnecessary suffering without their consent . <p> Exposing and analyzing the violence of the victim , rather than of the perpetrator , is immediately subject to the criticism that one is playing into the hands of the enemy . If we focus on the violence of women against men , we are accused of failing to address the much graver problem of male violence against women . If we address what is referred to as " reverse discrimination , " we are criticized for not first dealing with the more pernicious phenomenon of discrimination , whether it be misogyny , white racism , or Western imperialism . Arendt was vilified for pointing out that Jewish leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialism . Although her comments were only a brief part of her coverage of the trial of Adolf Eichmann , the Nazi war criminal convicted of war crimes against humanity , she was criticized and ostracized by the Jewish community for betraying her own people . But these criticisms only reinforce the pure innocence of the victim and the pure guilt of the perpetrator . Much of the time , the distinction is not so unambiguous . We certainly need to address state-sponsored and other forms of violence that clearly have power and resources at their disposal . I leave that work to others , with the caveat that victims often become the worst perpetrators of all . It is at our peril that we fail to understand , prevent , or mitigate the violence of victimhood . <p> Deconstructing the binary victim/perpetrator opposition is hardly sufficient for analyzing the current discourses on victimhood and their political effects , not to mention for understanding political conflicts that are in some way premised on an acceptance of this opposition . We must avoid at all costs a critical analysis of victimhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that claims we are all victims to some extent or other , all wounded and in need of redemptive outlets like resentment . Even if this were true in some fundamental sense , we are victims to different degrees . Some victims need our attention more urgently than others . Some victims need to have their psychological needs addressed before any consideration of punishment or demand for accountability . In other words , we must add to the critique of the victim/perpetrator dualism the concept and practice of merciful judgment . <p> I have divided this book into seven chapters , all of which build on a number of central arguments but address different issues . This work is unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries , which some readers will find liberating and others unsatisfying . Nor do I impose order along a theory and practice divide , choosing instead to shift back and forth between ideas and the events that shape them . <p> In chapter 1 I explore an ideology prominent in the " emancipatory " discourses of the North American academy . Scholarly interest in " the other " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiracist scholars concerned with the legacy of colonialism , imperialism , and patriarchy has had an enormous impact on how we view the condition and status of the victim . The " post " discoursespostmodernism , poststructuralism , postcolonialismare in large part responsible for rightly drawing attention to " the wretched of the earth " as well as problematically venerating " the other , " a veneration that ultimately robs the subaltern ( the native , woman , " those who have no part " ) 18 of moral agency and responsibility . While there are a number of important intellectual and political sources of this veneration , I trace it to a tradition in what has come to be known broadly as continental philosophy , which has greatly influenced and been influenced by contemporary feminist scholarship . This veneration of the other has resulted from readingsor misreadingsof the work of Emmanuel Levinas and Frantz Fanon , among others , rendering the other a pure victim , beyond moral and epistemic reproacha good other . Its undesirable effects include the abdication of politics for an impotent ethics ; a reticence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures other than ones own , both cultures rendered essentialist and immutable in their incommensurability ; and an impoverished sense of justicemotivated by guilt or ressentiment , synonymous with retribution . <p> We are left with a bleak picture of political practice as policing and a moral judgment premised only on accepted ideological principles.19 A community of victims stand in judgment over those deemed responsible for their subordination . Justice becomes a matter of balancing the scales of suffering by making the perpetrator suffer as the victim has . Responsibility belongs solely to the perpetrator group . Yet no one has been able to establish why the view " from the margins " equips the victimized with a superior moral sensibility and power of judgment that others ostensibly lack on the grounds of their privilege . <p> In chapter 1 , then , we witness the antagonistic dynamic between essentialized categories of privileged and oppressedcharacterized by an incommensurable , nonreciprocal , morally unequal relationshipthat theorists of difference promote . Ironically , it is a mirror image of the antagonism , essentialism , and moral reproach inherent in the circumstances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . This irony is the point of departure in chapter 2 , which elaborates a theme prevalent in Mahmood Mamdanis analysis of the Rwandan genocide . Rather than privilege the view from the margins , Mamdani warns of the dangers of assuming the " worldview " of the victim , constructed as it is on the very hierarchical system politicized by the perpetrator . While a similar binary logic of victim versus perpetrator is evident in the identity politics of the West , the stakes are much higher in the context of violent conflict purported to be " ethnopolitical . " In the case of an intractable conflict like the ongoing crisis in Israel and Palestinecharacterized by a severely asymmetrical power imbalance but also by the utmost conviction on both sides of a superior claim to victimhood and thus to truth , history , land , and a future statethe stakes are higher yet . <p> The focus of this second chapter is the troubling extent to which we often justify the violence of the victimized as a legitimate course of action , whether in the name of empowerment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in analyses of Palestinian suicide bombing that justify killing on the basis of despair and misery , as well as in the American and Israeli governments reliance on a paradigm of security to legitimize a brutal military occupation . Here we witness the moral capital of the victim writ large , each side of the struggle firm in its conviction that it fights a just war . The Palestinians fight to end an occupation of more than sixty years , with its systematized , normalized inequality and disenfranchisement , impassioned by the collective memory of expulsion . The Israelis fight a war against terror and anti-Semitism , impassioned by the collective memory of genocide and persecution . The asymmetry of political power and economic well-being is often ignored by supporters of the Israeli government and used to add moral currency to the Palestinians position by those who act in solidarity with them . <p> Relying on the work of Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt to understand the nature of political violence , particularly in its emancipatory form , I conclude in this chapter that the violence of the victim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as inevitable as we are led to believe . The unrelenting nature of violence and counterviolence , and the willful blindness to the binary logic of victim versus perpetrator , means that dissenting voices and the actions of those who do not comply are usually ignored . As in chapter 1 , the view of politics here is bleak ; " never again " is the mantra of a politics of death and destruction propelled by fearor rather of a failure of politics , and a corresponding failure to take responsibility and exercise moral agency . The solutions can be found , I argue , in the work of countless individuals and groups who are not permitted the political tools necessary to make the leaps required for a viable future for all Palestinians and Israelis . Since it is the ideological framing of the conflict that blinds us to these solutions , it is our responsibility , as bystanders , to engage in conceptual reframing , not to impose peace plans or political solutions ourselves but to stop preventing Israelis and Palestinians from creating them . <p> The third chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to provide a phenomenology of victimhood based on the narratives and analyses of Jean AmTry , Susan Brison , Frantz Fanon , and others who have explored the condition of victimhood and the process of recuperating a sense of self after a traumatic experience . I discuss these writers in the context of a contemporary discourse on trauma in the fields of psychology , psychoanalysis , feminism , anticolonialism , and military psychiatry . An overview of the " birth of trauma " demonstrates that we have moved from recognizing injury to naturalizing it , and to a universalization of pain and suffering that trivializes the meaning of trauma , rendering indistinguishable the experiences of those who survive genocide , rape , or sexual harassment . Historicizing the experience of victimhood makes it impossible to essentialize the condition of the victimthat victims respond in diverse ways to acts of violence and violation should not be neglectedbut I point to a number of features that broadly constitute what it means to be victimized . <p> Despite the focus in chapter 3 on the psychic pain and suffering victims experiencethe alienated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shattered selfI argue that our empathic regard must not preclude judgment or the acknowledgment of responsibility for wrongdoing when we consider the violence that victims themselves perpetuate . While Fanon stresses the agency of the colonized subject in the work of reversing the alienation he suffers , AmTry dwells in a kind of melancholia , valorizing what Nietzsche calls ressentimentresentment against those who tortured him in a Nazi camp and against the German people who enabled the Nazi regime to carry out genocide . <p> How do we arrest the evolution of grief into grievance before further violence occurs in the name of victimhood ? Brison provides an answer , demonstrating that victims can eventually forget their victimization , to some extent , through the long and painful process of narration . Raped and nearly beaten to death , Brison describes the pain of displacement and exile from her own body as well as from the human community , but she recognizes that although the self can be destroyed by others , it is also created and sustained by them . The devastating loss of security her attacker caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ones life is never possiblewe can not escape our vulnerabilityand by narrating the event into her past . The contrast between the reflections of AmTry and Brison , however , points to the power of unconscious desires and motivations that render survival an individual matter . We are not all equal in our capacity to struggle and overcome . <p> The first three chapters throw into question the association of the victim with pure innocence and political incapacity or passivity , in effect accomplishing a deconstruction of the victim . They also demonstrate that this critical labor is not enough . We must do more than point out that victims and perpetrators are complex , the lines dividing them often blurry , or we are left with a perfect alibi for inaction . In chapter 4 I turn to Hannah Arendt for guidance in thinking through the provocative issue of responsibility and judgment with respect to the victim . Arendt was vilified and ostracized by her own friends , and by the Jewish community in general , for ostensibly " blaming the victim " in her controversial coverage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on collective historical responsibility , as well as individual moral responsibility for the future , victims notwithstanding , neither blames victims for their own misfortunes nor detracts from the necessary judgment against the worst atrocities humans can commit . Rather , I argue , it enables us to conceive of a political future in which the seemingly inevitable transformation of victim into victimizer might be suspended . <p> With Arendts help , we discover that moral judgments help us to create a world in which we want to live . Morality is not about following a moral code but about choosing with whom we want to live in proximity , and what kind of life we will share in our communities . We judge our own behavior in order to live with ourselves ; we judge others in order to live among our fellow human beings and cultivate community in relative safety and trust . Accounting for our actions , acknowledging our freedom to make decisions and to act , and taking responsibility for this freedom are all inextricably linked to judgment . It is this careful discernment , derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from respect for others , that distinguishes judgment from the veneration described in the first chapter . <p> Chapter 5 plunges us into what I consider the toughest moral problem of this study : responding to the child soldier who is forced to kill or be killed . The suffering experienced by the tens of thousands of children in the world who currently live and kill within armed military groups can not help but evoke an intense emotional response . We consider children , more than any other group in society , purely innocent . This is evident in the public response to several popular autobiographical accounts of " rehabilitated " child soldiers . And yet these children are capable of horrific acts of violence , prized by warlords for their fearlessness , conditioned to brutality . Here we reach the limits of personal responsibility , for some victims are purely innocent , although they must bear the burden of responsibility for their own responses to victimhood and for their own survival . <p> We must acknowledge , respect , and encourage childrens moral agency , like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and violence seducesand " narcotizes " its participants , effectively immunizing them from accountability . Without this understanding , not only will international attempts to prevent child soldiering be ineffective but we will perpetuate the very victim/perpetrator binary logic that invited and forced children to kill in the first place . If we do not acknowledge that children and young adults often wish to fight , in the name of revenge , empowerment , or sheer survival , then we forfeit the possibility of formulating preventive strategies . But the tragedy of the child soldier also demonstrates the need for mercy and the limits of the law in its demand for responsibility , accountability , and punishment . It exposes a small blind spot in Arendts work on judgment , demanding a more prominent place for empathy and compassion than her stress on thinking and willing allows . <p> The excruciating predicament of the child soldier thus exacerbates a tension , exposed in the preceding chapters , between compassion and judgment . In chapter 6 I address this tension as it appears in a burgeoning " global justice industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dealing with past atrocities and assumes that justice means retributionan ideal of balance and reciprocity . The predominant paradigm of this industry is " transitional justice , " a global approach that many have criticized for its emphasis on criminal prosecution and a strictly legal understanding of justice that often comes at the price of peace . This paradigm has led to the expenditure of vast amounts of energy and resourcesincluding millions of dollarsin the work of distinguishing victims from perpetrators in order to punish the latter and empower the former , especially through the International Criminal Court.20 <p> Our response to atrocity can not be limited to justice mechanisms . Death is irreversible ; after genocide and war , the scales of justice can not be balanced . Measures that are believed to foster reconciliation are offered as an alternative to the institutional , juridical approach to dealing with the past , motivated by forgiveness or a desire to judge wrongdoers with mercy . Notwithstanding the potential for political manipulation , forgiveness and mercy are useful in fleshing out the role of compassion in responding to victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness is the will to forget , to the extent that we can release one another from the full consequences , sometimes tragic , of our actions for the sake of a more peaceful future . This approach is relevant also to a merciful judgment that acknowledges the wrongness of actions but also the circumstances in which they are carried out . <p> Compassion can appear to contradict the demands for moral judgment . Readers of Ishmael Beahs autobiographical narrative are swept up in the force of their compassion for Beah , the boy forced to kill , and often spare little compassion for his victims , who remain nameless and faceless . Likewise , a sympathetic response to the despairing Palestinian refugee who straps a bomb to her chest and kills the innocent may blind one to the anguish of her injured victims and the dead victims loved ones . This is not compassion , I argue , but a pitiful regard that paralyzes thinking , excuses our unwillingness to judge , and robs the victim of agency . It is a regard that ignores the circumstances of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent . Compassion in our response to the agents of atrocity must respect their agency . This is mercy as Martha Nussbaum defines it ( relying on Seneca ) : mercy is not acquittal but a " gentle " judgment that yields before the difficulty of life . <p> In the final chapter I consider what it means to lay down ones arms , articulating what a moral and political life that departs from security logic might look like . Responses to atrocity often miss the opportunity to develop civil societys potential to engage in nonviolent politics , preoccupied as they are with legal judgment and social repair . Current political theorizing exhibits a similar tendency , failing to point out the potential of a political vision centered on principles of nonviolence and a culture of peace rather than a culture governed by the logic of militarization and security . Vulnerability is the human condition , but a politics that attempts to eliminate it only builds walls and weapon stocks , not community life .

As our eyes grow accustomed to the interior space , seven colossal statues emerge from the shadowy walls . They serve as columns to support the entablature , and , above that , a dome and fenestrated lantern . We examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Michelangelo : high prominent forehead , beady little eyes , broken nose , scraggly beard , and cropped hair . Cast in lead , the Florentine master carries the tools of his trade and stands proudly on an elaborately carved pedestal that depicts artists formed from his alter ego , Saturnine characters gone badanxious , tedious , envious , desperate typeswho warn the visitor against any similar folly . Continuing along the wall of the edifice , we next encounter a statue of Gaudenzio Ferrari , a sixteenth-century Piedmont painter of the finest kind who worked extensively in Milan . His Jovian aspect forms a pleasant contrast to the greedy , tyrannical counterparts engraved on his pedestal . The third statue , made of iron , represents Polidoro da Caravaggio . And so we proceed around the perimeter of the circle , identifying the other statues , one by one , as Leonardo , Raphael , Andrea Mantegna , and Titian , each cast in a different metal and mounted on a decorated pedestal displaying the dark flip side of each artistic temperament . Where are we ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple of Painting conceived by Giovan Paolo Lomazzo in 1590 . These eminent masters are the gods he chose to govern this art . <p> The circular wall behind the seven statues is divided into five equal tiers signifying the theoretical parts of painting . Proportion sits at the base , supporting movement , color , light , and perspective , in that order . Above the frieze and cornice soars the dome . Its two levels represent the practical parts of painting : composition and form . We pause a moment to take this all in . Visually , the artists occupy the space vertically , while the parts of painting divide it horizontally . Seven governing artists or styles intersect with seven parts of painting . Based on his planetary disposition , each artist has his own way of handling proportion , movement , color , light , and all the other parts of painting . Thus each part has seven different manners or styles . The Saturnine proportions used by Michelangelo , for instance , differ from the Jovian ones of Gaudenzio Ferrari , and even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polidoro da Caravaggios Martian colors are not those of Leonardo or Titian . The intersection of style with pictorial elements finds form in the art of these seven masters . All of painting is exemplified by their irreducible styles . Our first impression of the Temple is of a harmonious , well-built monument , airy and luminous , uncluttered by decoration , and focused on highlighting its seven noble inhabitants . For the design , Lomazzo acknowledges having been inspired by Giulio Camillo in LIdea del theatro . He praises the famous theater and admitsin a moment of rare modesty " compared to that construction , mine is much humbler and cruder . " <p> Camillos theater was indeed a grand affair . It pretended to contain nothing less than the entire universe . Adapting a Vitruvian plan , Camillo described a vast auditorium divided by seven aisles , each devoted to one of the seven planetary gods . Each aisle had seven rows that rose progressively higher , representing everything from the supercelestial world , located at floor level , to the elemental world , with human activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle , a door painted with a significant memory image recalled to the viewer a specific location in the universe . From the stage , one surveyed the marvelous spectacle of forty-nine mnemonic paintings that encompassed every color and facet of creation , revealing , through an underlying order , hidden correspondences among the far distant corners of the cosmos . The memory theater enabled the human mind to grasp the universe . But that was not all . It had its hermetic secrets as well . For the mnemonic images also functioned as talismans , attracting astral forces down into the theater . And as they energized the memory , these powers unified it with the higher images or First Causes , thereby intimately associating the viewer with the divine . <p> Lomazzo never saw the actual wooden theaters Camillo had built in Venice and Paris during the early 1530s . The Venetian version was said to have been large enough to accommodate two people at the same time . In addition , it held thousands of pages from Cicero , Virgil , Boccaccio , and Petrarch , filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever fail him . The invention of this theater made Camillo a renowned celebrity . Yet however admired by the king of France , the great man returned to Italy in 1543 without a pension . The Marchese del Vasto , governor of Milan , seized the opportunity to have such a brilliant mind at court . Enjoying the governors personal favor , Camillo thrived in the Lombard capital , impressing aristocrats and intellectuals alike , until his sudden death in 1544 . Published posthumously in 1550 , his LIdea del theatro ( based on the lectures delivered to Del Vasto over the course of five mornings ) initiates the reader into the essential mysteries of the theater . So when Lomazzo compares his Temple to Camillos construction , it is no fortuitous choice but an allusion to a well-known monument , alive in the literary imagination of the Milanese public and one they had adopted as their own . <p> Precisely how are the two structures similar ? And to what extent did Lomazzo intend to carry out the comparison ? Though " humbler " in scope , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating influence of the seven planetary gods . It too operates as a kind of mnemonic machine , inviting the apprentice to enter and actually experience the architectural environment , which unfolds before him the marvels of the pictorial universe . His attention is drawn to the impressive metallic sculptures , richly figurated pedestals , and horizontal divisions of the walls that designate the major elements of his art and , like memory images , provide the key to unlocking immense stores of knowledge and penetrating its deepest secrets . Apart from the structural resemblance , the Temple also shares the theaters metaphysical aspirations . Universal lighting from above indicates a divine presence that filters down the walls , through the parts of painting , into the seven chosen masters of the Temple . The Neoplatonic belief in a descending cosmic influence implies a harmonious correspondence between every link in the chain . This means , from an aesthetic point of view , that harmony is necessary among all the parts in order for painting to receive beauty or grace from above , ultimately resulting in the coherent expressive styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , the statues nonetheless possess a certain aura , derived from traces of the divine , channeled into them by the flow of planetary influence that relates and unifies all of painting according to these seven styles . <p> Unlike the theater , the Temple places particular emphasis on the manners of the different planetary temperaments . Saturnine temperaments like Michelangelos generate a style that expresses " profound contemplation , intelligence , gravity , judgment , " while Venusian personalities like Raphaels emanate " sweetness , loveliness , kindness , desire , " or Martian types , " spiritual strength , the passion of animosity , the power to act , and the immutable vehemence of the soul . " Through these means , Lomazzo offers a psychological explanation for the variations in stylistic expression , opening the door to the possibility of multiple styles , and ultimately , individual expression . For this reason , the Temple of Painting is more than a mere mnemonic device . It not only displays the whole range of artistic styles but also encourages the noviceusing discernment ( or discrezione ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an afterthought , Lomazzo adds the artists discernment as an eighth part of painting and locates it on the floor of the Temple as the foundation of all . In so doing , he obliges the debutant painter who enters the sacred edifice to exercise a certain self-reflection that will enable him to discover his individual style and eventually define a place in the universal order . <p> In 1584 , Lomazzo published a massive encyclopedic treatise on painting entitled Trattato dellarte della pittura , scoltura et architettura ( which Julius von Schlosser would later call the Bible of Mannerism ) . The seven chapters of this work were each devoted to one of the seven parts of painting . Idea of the Temple of Painting , appearing six years later , was meant to serve as its introduction orin the authors wordsits " abstract and summary . " In fact , the two treatises were conceived at the same time . Earlier versions of Idea of the Temple of Painting originally formed sections of the Trattato , but these pages were subsequently edited out , revised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The invention of the Temple of Painting conceit was the reason for the distinct , new work . It condensed all the amassed knowledge about paintingthe contents of the Trattatointo a single charged image accompanied by a text that provided , like Camillos LIdea del theatro , the basic operating instructions . Moreover , it theorized the knowledge about painting , giving it a metaphysical dimension that justified its place in the world . Together , these two treatises contain all of Lomazzos essential ideas about art and all his formal writing on the subject . An unpublished manuscript known as the Libro de sogni ( ca. 1563 ) offers some interesting youthful impressions ; Della forma delle muse ( 1591 ) may be considered an addendum to the Trattato . Otherwise , a collection of poems , Rime ad imitazione dei grotteschi ( 1587 ) , reveals his personal preferences among local and contemporary artists , as does the Rabisch ( 1589 ) . <p> Lomazzos greatest contribution to the history of art is his special treatment of expression and , in its more developed form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan , introduced Lomazzo to the possibilities of portraying emotion and movement in art ( moto ) , his firsthand experience of Michelangelos Last Judgment made him truly conscious of how forcefully the artists personal expression could be conveyed through human figures represented in motion . In the Trattato , Lomazzo describes movement as the " part the most difficult to attain in all art , and also the most important and necessary to know , " exhaustively cataloguing the gestures , facial expressions , complexions , postures , and comportments appropriate to every emotion that might serve the practicing artist . Based on the privileged role movement plays in communicating the artists personal temperament , Idea of the Temple of Painting justifies an infinite variety of individual styles by sublimating the representation of emotion into the expression of the painting as a whole . <p> It is precisely this shift from representation to self-expression that makes the present treatise so important : it illustrates a transfer in interest toward the artist himself . By the mid-sixteenth century , the painted subject becomes increasingly a pretext for self-representation and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lomazzos theory supports such a shift . He clearly favored a fantastic , invented imagery to a purely mimetic onewhat we will describe as a preference for artificial resemblance over the direct imitation of reality . In the absence of models , the artist is forced to rely entirely on his own discernment or visual judgment . Nowhere is this more necessary than in the difficult portrayal of movement and emotion . And nowhere , consequently , is the expression of his individual temperament more evident . In painting , the figural action not only tells the story but best expresses the artists personal style , setting the mode ( as in music ) with which all the other elements comply . The depiction of emotion , moreover , fascinates the spectator like no other part of painting : it moves him to experience and imitate what he sees . It is here that Lomazzos contribution has been truly felt , not only in the systematic study of emotions but also in the employment of theory to justify self-expression . His continuing legacy in the seventeenth century attests to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not exclusively in hindsight that the outstanding merits of Idea of the Temple of Painting have been recognized . Lomazzo himself was fully aware of its importance and considered it the crowning achievement of his life . He saw to its publication just before the onset of a long illness that ended in his death on January 27 , 1592 . Fearing censure while Milan remained under the religious control of Archbishop Charles Borromeo , Lomazzo judiciously delayed its printing . He meant for the book to survive . More than another manual of precepts for artists , this final treatise addresses the purpose of art and its role in the world order . Such investigations naturally brought the authors Christianized Neoplatonic views to bear on the matter , as well as his more clandestine beliefs in the magical writings of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim . This rare philosophical position is what defines his aesthetics and gives it , especially in this treatise , its unique voice and boldly original form .

He challenges the popular assumption that this was simply an age of war during which ideas of peace exercised very little impact on society and government . He offers a close reading of English writers on peace , integrating this analysis with careful attention to the political context , particularly during times of war , when calls for peace were more vocal . Lowe traces the concept of peace from its early Christian usage up to the sixteenth century . He focuses on the long period of foreign wars ( 13491560 ) , often punctuated by domestic unrest , when theories of peace were increasingly discussed within the larger context of war and policymaking .
