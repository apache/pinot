@@23739605 @3739605/ <h> Download Orders <p> Free Order Desk accounts can automatically download orders once per day . Pro accounts will have the option to increase the download frequency . To change the frequency that orders are downloaded , select the option you want from the Check For New Orders list . <p> If you 'd prefer , you can also manually import orders . This option is on the right side of the settings page under Manually Import Orders . <p> When doing a manual import , Order Desk will download the 50 latest orders that are in open status . Orders that have already been imported will be ignored . Orders that are not paid and not in open status will not be downloaded . <p> Tip : If you run very high volume , please contact Order Desk support about raising this level for your store so you do n't miss any orders . <p> Choose the folder where newly downloaded orders should be placed . New folders can be created from your Store Settings page . <h> Sync Shipment Information <p> Order Desk can tell Etsy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also trigger an email to the customer from Etsy . To enable this , select Enabled for Sync Tracking Numbers . <p> If you add more than one tracking number to an order , the second number will not be synced to Etsy . <h> Etsy and Listing IDs <p> Update : In February 2017 , Etsy released a new feature allowing merchants to create unique SKUs for their items and variations . Order Desk is already set up to bring in these new SKUs . Listing IDs will still work the same way if used instead of SKUs , but if a SKU is found , Order Desk will use this instead of the Listing I 'd . <p> Etsy does not have a field for a SKU value , so we use their Listing I 'd as the SKU for any downloaded order items . The Listing I 'd is a unique number that can be found in the URL of your Etsy item . <p> For more information on Etsy Listing IDs , visit their help guide on the topic . <h> How to Create SKUs for Variations <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can enable the Append Variation Values to Item Code feature . <p> This will add the alphanumeric value of each variation to your listing I 'd to give you a unique SKU for each individual product combination . As an example , if you sell a product on Etsy with a Listing I 'd of 123456 , and it has two variations : size ( Small or Large ) and color ( Black or White ) , the item codes would come into Order Desk as : <p> Tip : Codes are case sensitive and alphanumeric , Pay attention to upper and lower case letters , and any symbols such as " ( eg. 13 " ) would be removed . The code for item 444555 with the variations LArge and 10 x 12 " would be 444555-LArge-10x12 . <h> How to Use Etsy 's Variation Field as the Item Code <p> Within Etsy there is an option to add a SKU using the variation field on a listing . Order Desk can pull this SKU in and use it for the Item Code instead of using the Etsy Listing I 'd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Variations section , click on Add a variation and choose Add a new property from the dropdown . <p> Write " SKU " into the Property Name field and click Continue . Enter your SKU into the Add an option field and click Add . <p> Your SKU will show up in the overview section of your item : <p> Back in Order Desk , enable the Use SKU Variation as Item Code option . <p> Tip : SKUs with the variations appended ( like 123456-Small-Black ) can not be created for variation items using the same SKU . Because of this , only use this option on products that do not have variations . <h> Sync Inventory Details <p> Because we have to use the Listing I 'd as the SKU for any downloaded order items from Etsy , syncing inventory details for items sold in multiple carts requires a workaround within Order Desk . This workaround will replace the Listing I 'd from Etsy with the actual product SKU used in other carts in order to sync the inventory details between items . <p> To do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left sidebar . <p> If you already have your items added , click an item name to edit it . If you do n't already have your items added , click on +Add New Item in the upper right corner of the screen to add individual items ( or import a . csv file of your Etsy items . ) <p> Fill out the necessary product info , if you have n't already , making sure to put the Etsy Listing I 'd in the Code/SKU field , and then click on Add a Metadata Field . <p> In the Metadata section , put codereplace in the Name field and the actual product SKU in the Value field : <p> Using codereplace will tell Order Desk that the item coming in from Etsy with a Listing I 'd should be synced with the inventory details of the item with the SKU. 
@@23739606 @3739606/ <h> Overview <p> Update : In June 2017 , we released a new feature where multiple FBA regions can be connected to the same Order Desk store . Previously , a separate store was needed for each separate region . Now each region acts as a separate integration in the same store . If you had previously set up multiple FBA regions on multiple Order Desk stores , in most cases , you can now move all of your FBA connections to your primary Order Desk store and adjust your rules to submit your orders to the appropriate integration . This guide will give instructions for how to set up these rules . <p> Order Desk supports all international Fulfillment by Amazon ( FBA ) endpoints . This guide will show you how to submit your orders to FBA automatically , taking into consideration the shipping address on different orders and the FBA region necessary for fulfilling each order . <p> When orders are fulfilled by FBA , the tracking info will be sent from FBA to Order Desk and can be sent back to the original shopping cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Submit Orders to FBA Manually <p> To submit an order to FBA manually , go into the order and select the correct region before clicking on the FBA integration button that corresponds with the shipping address on the order : <h> Submit All Orders to FBA Automatically <p> If your store will only be downloading orders for one region and you are n't using any other fulfillment service , you can set up your Order Desk store to automatically submit your orders to FBA . To do this , navigate to the Amazon FBA integration settings under the Integrations menu in the left sidebar : <p> Select the Automatically Send Imported Orders to Amazon FBA option : <p> Now , whenever an order is downloaded from your shopping cart integration(s) , it will automatically be sent to FBA for fulfillment . <p> For the first couple of weeks , watch your orders for any errors as they go through this process . When first setting up an Order Desk store , it is n't uncommon to encounter errors sent back from an integrated service like FBA . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted to get everything running through the Order Desk app properly . <p> The two most common FBA errors are 1 ) the shipping address is for the wrong FBA region and 2 ) FBA rejects the order because items ( SKUs ) in the order are skipped " that is , the SKUs either are n't even on the items in the order or they 're not SKUs that FBA recognizes . For more information on specific FBA errors and how to fix them , please see this guide . <p> Please use caution when enabling the automatic submit option . Be sure that any old , completed orders have already been imported to Order Desk before this setting is enabled . If an old order is imported with an order number that is different from what was initially fulfilled by FBA " even if the difference is whether or not the # is in the number ( #1001 vs 1001 ) " it will automatically be submitted to FBA and fulfilled again . It is recommended you wait to enable this feature until after your Order Desk store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending archived orders to FBA . If in doubt when importing old orders , disable this feature temporarily . <h> Submit Only Certain Orders to FBA <p> For some merchants , not all orders will be sent to FBA , but setting up Order Desk to submit the appropriate orders to FBA automatically is still possible using the Rule Builder . <p> To do this , because you do n't want every order submitted to FBA , you 'll first want to be sure the Automatically Send Imported Orders to Amazon FBA setting from the last step is not enabled . <p> If orders need to be split and sent to separate vendors , including FBA , please refer to the Splitting Orders guide or , for Shopify and BigCommerce orders specifically , see the Vendor Splitting guide . Once split , use the Rule Builder to submit only the orders meant for FBA to the FBA integration . <p> Tip : Because each store is unique , the requirements and conditions for splitting orders will be different for every store and the rules set up should be customized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help explain how to use conditions in the Rule Builder to submit your orders to FBA . For more information on the Order Desk Rule Builder , please see this guide . If you need help figuring out how to best submit only certain orders to FBA , contact Order Desk support and provide as much information as possible , including the conditions necessary , that determine which of your orders are going to FBA . <p> As an example , if all orders from one shopping cart are being submitted to one specific FBA region , but orders from other sources or shopping carts might not be , a rule can be created that will send only those specific orders to FBA automatically . <p> like this ( with the shipping country being an optional condition depending on the specific store ) : <p> The Rule Builder is versatile and has many options for setting the condition on orders to be submitted to FBA , where the most common condition is to use the same inventory location that is used to split orders . However , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder to find one that works for your needs . <h> Submit Orders to Multiple FBA Regions <p> If your products are available to purchase in or ship to multiple international regions , you will need an FBA account for each of those regions . As an example , if an order has an American address but is being submitted to FBA Italy , FBA will not accept the order because that warehouse region does n't ship to America . The order will need to be submitted to the FBA NA ( North American ) region . <p> Using the Rule Builder , you can submit your orders by matching the shipping country on the order with the correct FBA region integration : <p> When Order is Imported ( event ) If Shipping Country like US ( condition ) Submit Order to Amazon FBA NA ( action ) <p> Tip : Amazon FBA EU has a different set of countries that they ship to depending on which export plan you are set up to use with them . Check your FBA account settings at Amazon if you are having trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Different Stores to Submit to Other Regions <p> In some cases you may still need or want to use separate Order Desk stores for your separate FBA regions . If so , follow these steps to learn how to copy orders to other Order Desk stores and submit them to the appropriate FBA region . <p> 1 <h> Submit Orders Through Primary Store to FBA <p> For orders that need to be submitted to the FBA region connected to your primary Order Desk store ( the store that is also connected to the shopping cart where the orders are coming from ) , create a rule that says : <p> When Order is Imported ( event ) If Shipping Country like X ( condition , where X is the shipping country code that matches the FBA region connected to the primary store ) Submit Order to Amazon FBA ( action , where the FBA region matches the shipping country code from the condition ) <p> like this : <p> 2 <h> Copy Remaining Orders to Secondary Stores <p> For any other orders being shipped to other FBA regions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desk stores where your FBA integrations are enabled . To do this , create a rule that says : <p> When Order is Imported ( event ) If Shipping Country like X ( condition , where X is the shipping country code ) Copy to Store ( action , select store with FBA region that matches the shipping country code ) <p> like this : <p> You may also want to include a second action in this rule to move the order to a different folder in the primary store , such as Prepared or a custom folder , to hold copied orders waiting for fulfillment . <p> 3 <h> Submit Copied Orders to FBA <p> In the store you are copying these orders to , set up a rule that says " When Order Copied from Another Store " ( event ) " Submit to Amazon FBA " ( action , select the appropriate FBA region from the dropdown ) , like this : <p> Create as many rules and extra stores as needed to cover each of the FBA regions your store uses . <p> Tip : Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , however they will typically only ship media items . If any other items are included in the order , they wo n't accept the order . In most cases , however , each FBA region will only accept orders with shipping addresses that match their region . If you are getting errors from FBA due to international orders and export , please contact Amazon for help . <h> FAQ <h> Can I send Shopify orders to FBA in international regions ? <p> Yes . Order Desk supports every international FBA endpoint . If you have an account with FBA , Order Desk can submit your Shopify orders to it as long as the FBA warehouse is in the same region as the shipping address on the order and it adheres to the account settings you have directly with Amazon . <h> Can I connect multiple FBA regions to the same Order Desk account ? <p> Yes . Previously , Order Desk required a separate store for each separate FBA region . This has now been updated so all FBA regions can be connected to the same Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't FBA accept my international order ? <p> If the shipping country on the order does not match the FBA region the order is being submitted to , FBA will reject the order . Make sure the order is being submitted to the proper FBA region . Please read the Submit to Different FBA Regions section of this guide for detailed instructions . <h> Why wo n't my Canadian order submit to my North American FBA account ? <p> Some older FBA accounts for the North American region do not include all of North America . If you have one of these accounts , you will need a separate FBA account for each region . If you already have the original FBA integration enabled and set up for the US , you can enable the FBA NA integration in Order Desk to log into and connect your Canadian FBA account , or vice versa . This also applies to Mexico . <p> If you have three separate FBA accounts for the North American regions , you will need to have multiple Order Desk stores to connect to all three FBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Different Stores section of this guide for instructions . <h> Can I submit only orders to FBA that have inventory in stock and the rest of my orders to another fulfillment service ? <p> Yes . To do this , select Fill or Kill in the FBA integration settings here in Order Desk ( this can be found in the Fulfillment Policy dropdown under the Advanced Settings section . ) Any orders sent to FBA with items that are n't in stock will be rejected . You can then set up a rule to submit those rejected orders to another fulfillment service or to take another action on the order at that point :

If they do n't match , you can map them to each other in Order Desk in one of two ways . You can match the codes to each other in your Amazon FBA settings or you can use a metadata field called codereplace in your inventory items . <h> Product Code Match <p> To match product codes from Shopify to Amazon FBA , navigate to your FBA settings by clicking on Amazon FBA under Integrations in the left sidebar . <p> Scroll down to the Product Code Match box . You can match the SKUs here , where the first SKU is your Shopify SKU and the second is your FBA SKU : <p> Set one match per line . <h> Product Bundles <p> If you have any bundled products that you are selling in Shopify , you can use Product Code Match to match the SKU for the bundle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if you are selling a hat and scarf bundle in Shopify , where the SKU for that bundled product is HS-3333 and the SKUs that FBA has for the separate items are H-5555 ( for the hat ) and S-9999 ( for the scarf ) , then you can match them in the Product Code Match section of your FBA settings as : <p> HS-3333 = H-5555 , S-9999 Shopify SKU = FBA SKU , FBA SKU <p> This also works for mutli-packs of the same product , such as two of the same hat , bundled together as HH-2 : <h> Code Replace <p> Alternatively , if you want to bring in all of your inventory from Shopify to Order Desk , you can go into each inventory item and add a metadata field called codereplace where the value is your FBA SKU for the same item .

This can be useful if you have employees or vendors who may need access to order information in your store . Because you may not want your store users to see all of the sensitive details available in your account , there are a few options for creating custom views for them . <h> Adding Store Users <p> To add a new store user , click on Store Users under Settings in the left sidebar . <p> Under Add Store User , enter the email address of the person you want to have access to your store and click Continue . <p> Add the First Name and Last Name of your store user and ensure their email address is accurate , as this will be their login for your store .

To do this , you 'll first need to name the Custom User Class for each store user necessary . In this example , we 'll name the Custom User Class " vendor " , although this can be anything you want as long as you are consistent with it in your CSS . <p> To add custom CSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click on the Custom CSS tab : <p> We can now edit the views of users where " vendor " is added to the custom user class in their permissions .

@@23739624 @3739624/ <h> 2 . Getting Started : Orders and Inventory 27494 @qwx227494 <h> Add Orders <p> Whether or not you have enabled any integrations , to get started with Order Desk , you 'll need some orders . <p> If you already have orders through one of the carts we are integrated with , enable the integration to begin downloading orders . If you are n't ready to download your orders , you can manually pull in some orders with most integrations : <p> Or , if you do n't have orders or have n't enabled any integrations yet , you can manually create real or test orders to begin exploring Order Desk . To manually create an order , click on Add New Order under the Tools menu in the left sidebar : <p> Fill out as many of the order details as you 'd like . You can always edit or add information to an order later . <h> Add Inventory Items <p> Adding inventory items to Order Desk is beneficial for record keeping purposes , and , in some cases , such as with print on demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to automate the submission process . <p> Tip : When adding inventory items to Order Desk , any SKU added will replace another item with the exact same SKU if it is already stored in Order Desk . This is a great way to make updates to products you already have stored here ( stock counts , cost , metadata information , etc. ) , however if you have any separate items that share the same SKU , they will overwrite each other and only the most recently added item will be stored . <p> There are a few ways to add inventory items to Order Desk . <p> 1 <p> First , you can manually add them by going to Inventory Items under the Tools menu in the left sidebar : <p> From here , click on Add New Item in the upper right corner and fill out the item details . <p> As you can see from the screenshot , you can also add new print on demand items manually by clicking on Add Print on Demand . Print on demand products will need to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the print file and the printer 's product code for the item being printed on . For more information on manually adding this information , read through this section of our print on demand fulfillment guide . <p> 2 <p> Another way to add your products to Order Desk is to import them from a spreadsheet . This is a quick way to import all of your products at once , however it does take a little set up to create the import template . The import template needs to match the field names from your spreadsheet to the field names used in Order Desk . For detailed instructions on how to import your inventory , please read our import data guide . <p> 3 <p> One useful way to import products is through the orders themselves . If you go to your Store Settings page and look under Inventory Settings , you can enable the bottom two settings ( both need to be enabled for this to work ) , Automatically Update Stock Count When Orders Added and Automatically Create New Inventory Items : <p> With these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new order , any products in the order will automatically be added to your Inventory Items here in Order Desk . <p> 4 <p> The last way to import your items is through one of our integrations . Not all integrations have this feature , but check your integration settings page for an inventory import button , like this one in the Shopify settings : <p> For a more thorough overview of the Inventory Items page and working with your inventory once it has already been added to Order Desk , please refer to our Inventory Items guide . <p> Tip : Some integrations have limitations on what or how much can be imported . For instance , Amazon FBA will only import the item SKU and quantity - leaving you with a lot of products called " No Name " . We can only bring in the information supplied to us by the integrated service , which is why you may see differences from integration to integration . <h> Submit Orders <h> Submitting Orders Through An Integration <p> You can set up rules ( which we 'll discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain integrations to automatically submit orders , but initially we recommend that you submit orders manually to get a sense for how the fulfillment process works in Order Desk . This also gives you the opportunity to correct any mistakes as you catch them , something that can be a little harder to do when everything is running automatically . After you are familiar with the flow of orders through Order Desk , have corrected any mistakes that cause errors , and you can trust that your integrations are set up properly by watching your orders pass through the app for a few days , it would be a good time to begin automating the process for your store . Before doing that , let 's look at how to submit orders manually . <p> To submit an order manually to an integration , open up the order and look under the order details for a little button with the name of the fulfillment service you are sending it to . Click the button to submit : <p> It 's that easy ! <p> However , there may be issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit , the order queues up to go through to your fulfillment service . If you check back ( or refresh the page ) after a couple minutes , scroll down and look at the order history section at the bottom of the page to see if the order submitted or not . <p> In most cases orders submit without any issues , but occasionally an order is rejected because something is wrong in the order per the fulfillment service 's requirements for submission . When this happens , an error message is passed through to Order Desk from the fulfillment service that gives the reason the order was rejected . <p> Some common errors include the address format being wrong , the shipping country being unavailable for that fulfillment service , the shipping method not matching what the fulfillment service is expecting or the print file missing for print on demand items . <p> Based on the error message , fix the problem with the order and re-submit it . If the error message does n't make sense , you can reach out to Order Desk Support or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , we may ask you to contact them , as we are n't familiar with every error message we see from different services , but we 'll be happy to take a look at your order to help you figure out the problem . <h> Dropshipping Orders to a Third Party Fulfillment Service <p> If you need to submit orders to a third party service that is n't currently integrated with Order Desk , you can do this too ! Typically the way Order Desk customers submit orders to third parties is to send them a dropship email with the order details . For more information on how to set up these emails , please review this guide on creating email templates . <p> It is n't necessary to create a rule yet to automate the process . If the email template has already been created , you can submit an order from the order details page by clicking on the email button and selecting the email template meant for your fulfillment service : <p> Another way to submit an order to a third party service is to export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , requiring an export template to be created and sent through email or FTP . For more information on how to do this , please review these guides on Exporting Orders for Fulfillment and Building Export Templates .

You 'll see the Product Name , the Code/SKU , an image and the current stock : <p> This same item is stored as an inventory item here in Order Desk and has some extra details ( variations and metadata ) in it : <p> When the item in the order is synced with the item stored in Order Desk , the extra details are pulled into the order details : <p> With this information pulled into the order , the item can be submitted for fulfillment with any necessary information your fulfillment service may require , and these details can be included as data in exports , emails and receipts or packing slips . <p> Tip : Items are stored and synced within Order Desk by the Code/SKU . A SKU can only be used on one item . When a new item with the same SKU is added to Order Desk , it will overwrite the older item . <h> Inventory Syncing <p> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sync their current stock numbers to your inventory list . You can then use this list to sync that information back to your shopping cart , keeping an accurate count of your inventory directly from your warehouse , through Order Desk and to your shopping cart . <p> To see if Inventory Sync is available for your integration(s) , go to the settings page for each of your integrations under Manage Integrations in the left sidebar : <p> Enable these settings for your fulfillment service or warehouse if you want them to be the source of your stock counts . If you want Order Desk to be the source of your stock counts , keep any fulfillment service Inventory Sync settings disabled and enable any shopping cart Inventory Sync settings . <p> Tip : Due to the differences in data that is available from separate apps and services , Inventory Sync is not available for every integration . Where available , it requires an Order Desk Pro account to enable . <h> Minimum/Maximum Safety Levels <p> There is a special field called adjustmentpercentage that you can add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain percentage of what stock is actually available . As an example , if you set the adjustmentpercentage to 50% and your actual stock is 70 items , your cart will be told there are 35 items . <p> Another option is to set a minimum or maximum number of items available in your cart , regardless of the actual stock levels . To do this , you can add special min and max fields to an item 's metadata that will be used to tell the cart your desired safety stock levels . <p> For minimum , if you add min to the metadata of your item , enter the inventory level you want to act as a safety level of 0 . That is , if you enter min = 3 , then 3 will sync as 0 items available in your shopping cart . <p> For this example , when the inventory for Unstuffed Fly Plush reaches a level of 3 , the shopping cart will say 0 items are available . <p> For maximum , if you add max to the metadata of your item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum number of items available in the cart , even if the actual inventory count is higher . If your stock is 20 , but max is set to 10 , Order Desk will push 10 to your cart . <h> Skipping Sync For Some Items <p> If you have Sync Inventory enabled for any fulfillment or warehouse sources ( such as Amazon FBA or 3PL Central ) but there are certain items you do n't want synced with everything else , you can add skippull with a value of 1 to the inventory item record as a metadata field : <p> Similarly , if you have Sync Inventory enabled for any carts ( such as Shopify or BigCommerce ) , and you would like to prevent the inventory counts of certain items from being pushed to that destination , you can add a special metadata value of skippush with a value of 1 to the inventory item record : <h> Bundled Products <p> To explain how this works , we 'll use an example of a bundle made of two individual items , a journal and a fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JL-123 and the fountain pen has the SKU FP-456 : <p> To bundle these products in Order Desk , create a new inventory item with a unique name and SKU for your bundle . In this example , Journal Pen Bundle will have the SKU JPB-789 : <p> Then , in the Bundled item , add a metadata field called codereplace and add the SKUs of each of the individual items that make up the bundle : <p> Now , when an order comes in for JPH-789 , the bundled item , Order Desk will automatically split it out into the individual items , JL-123 and FP-456 : <p> When codereplace is used , the code/SKU of the inventory item will be replaced with the value(s) added to the metadata instead . The original item in an order will be deleted and replaced with the products found from the replaced SKUs , including any details stored in those particular inventory items . <p> Alternatively , if you sell a bundle made out of multiple quantities of the same item , you can use the special quantitymultiplier field in the metadata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundle to multiply the quantity by that value . In our case , we 'll be selling Bookmark ( with the SKU BK-008 ) in a bundle of 8 : <p> When this bundle is ordered , Order Desk will divide the price by that number in an attempt to keep the price per item consistent . If someone orders 1 Bookmark bundle for $8 , and the multi-pack expands it to 8 items , each item will have a price of $1.00 . Please note , however , that rounding could cause some slight inaccuracies in the price for each . The same product in a 3-pack for $8 would come out to $2.66 each . <p> If you want to be able to sell just 1 bookmark instead of 8 of them , set up a new inventory item for the single bookmark and use codereplace in the metadata of the new item with the value BK-008 . This way , you can sell multiple products and bundles in your cart , but if they 're made from the same item , they 'll all resolve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whether ordered as a bundle or a single bookmark : <p> all of the items ( bundled or not ) will resolve to the same SKU : <h> Bundled Print on Demand Products <p> Print on Demand products are set up similarly when bundled , using codereplace in the metadata of the items . Because these items require unique metadata ( a printsku and printurl ) , when bundled , a top level item ( the bundle ) needs to include the SKUs of each of the printed items within the bundle , and each of the individual items will need to store the metadata or variations necessary for fulfillment . <p> Let 's use a bundle of four hand towels with different flower prints as our example : <p> Each of these towel items in Order Desk will have their printsku and printurls added to the metadata , for instance with the Frangipani Towel : <p> To bundle these four towels together , create one top level item and use codereplace , adding the SKU of each individual item to the value , separated by commas : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundle ( SKU : FTBundle-5555 ) , but in Order Desk , the bundle will be split into the four separate towels , each with their print details already saved to the individual items , and the order can automatically be submitted to your printer . <h> Bundle Inventory Syncing ( Shopify Only ) <p> Shopify users can push the quantity of a bundle to their store .

@@23739629 @3739629/ <h> Amazon Marketplace 27494 @qwx227494 <h> Overview <p> With Order Desk , you can connect to any Amazon Marketplace region to import your Amazon and Amazon Handmade orders . Tracking information will be sent back to Amazon as orders are fulfilled . <p> Previously , a separate Order Desk store was required to connect to each separate Amazon region , but in June 2017 , an update was made to treat each region as a separate integration , allowing you to connect to multiple regions from the same Order Desk store . <p> This guide will go over the settings in the Amazon Marketplace integrations . For more information on the Fulfillment by Amazon ( FBA ) integrations , please see this guide , and for instructions on how to submit orders to FBA , see this guide . <p> Tip : Many merchants are unsure about the difference between the Amazon Marketplace and Fulfillment by Amazon ( FBA ) integrations . To clarify , while both are often referred to as Amazon Seller Accounts or Amazon MWS , Amazon Marketplace is the integration that let 's you import your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the integration you need if you intend to send your orders to Amazon for fulfillment . <p> If you have Amazon orders that were fulfilled by FBA directly through Amazon ( AFN ) , you 'll need to enable the Marketplace Integration to bring these in , as the FBA integration is specifically for submitting orders to Amazon . <h> Integration Setup <p> To enable Amazon Marketplace , look in the lefthand sidebar and click on Manage Integrations under the Integrations menu : <p> Under the Shopping Carts tab , click to enable any of the Amazon Marketplace regions you need to connect to your Order Desk store : <p> All five regions are available and can be found under the Shopping Carts tab : Amazon North America , Amazon Europe , Amazon Japan , Amazon China and Amazon India . <p> Tip : If you have an older Amazon North America account that requires a separate login for Canada and the US , you will need to connect them using two integrations : our original Amazon Marketplace integration and Amazon Marketplace NA . If you already have the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NA integration to connect to the other account . If you are signing up after June 2017 or do not already have the original Marketplace integration enabled on your account , please contact Order Desk support and we will be happy to enable this for you . <h> Login and Register <p> Once enabled , you will need to follow a few steps to complete the connection between Order Desk and Amazon Marketplace . This guide will use Amazon NA as an example , but the steps are the same for each region . <h> Step 1 : Login to Amazon <p> Select the primary country for the region you are enabling from the dropdown and click Login to Seller Account . This will open Amazon in a new window to allow you to go through the next few steps . Keep Order Desk open in your current window as you 'll need to copy some information back over from Amazon . <h> Step 2 : Register <p> On the MWS registration page , you 'll have some options from Amazon . Find the option that let 's you access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click any options for developers . <p> On the following page , accept the Amazon MWS License Agreement and click through to the next page . <p> Tip : Amazon has certain requirements for which of their accounts can use MWS . If you are unable to find the right settings while registering or Amazon is n't allowing access , please be sure your account fits their requirements . For more information , read Amazon 's page on MWS . <h> Step 3 : Enter Account Identifiers <p> In Amazon , you 'll have some account information that needs to be copied over to Order Desk to complete the connection between services . Look for your Seller I 'd , Primary Marketplace I 'd , AWS Access Key I 'd and Secret Key . <p> You will also need your Merchant Token which can be found in your regular Seller Central dashboard under Settings / Account Info / Business Information . <p> Paste each of these into the appropriate fields in Order Desk : <p> Last , select your Default Marketplace , if applicable , for regions with more than one country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with in the region you 're connecting to . <h> Select Marketplaces <p> Select the relevant marketplaces for your account to tell Amazon from which specific marketplaces to download your orders . <p> Generally , most merchants will select Amazon.com for North America , but if you also have country specific marketplaces or are connecting to a region other than North America , be sure to include the appropriate marketplaces for your account : <h> Settings <p> Under the Settings section , you can choose how you want to set up your Amazon integration . <h> Automatically Check <p> For Order Desk Pro accounts , you will be able to select how often you want to bring in your Amazon orders in the Automatically Check section : <p> Free Order Desk stores will only be able to check for new orders once per day . <h> Folder for New Orders <p> Choose the folder where you want all new Amazon orders to be placed as they are downloaded : <h> Sync Tracking Numbers <p> As shipments are added to your orders , if Sync Tracking Numbers is enabled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your customers . <h> Sync Inventory <p> Order Desk Pro stores can enable Sync Inventory if they want to send their inventory counts to Amazon Marketplace . <p> This will report the inventory that you have available in Order Desk to Amazon . Any SKUs which Amazon does n't recognize will be ignored . For more information on how inventory syncing works , please read this guide . <h> Download Shipped Orders <p> If you have orders in Amazon that have already shipped but you want to download them to Order Desk for your records , select the Download Shipped Orders option : <p> Be sure that you are n't automatically submitting every order to a fulfillment service if this is selected , as these orders can inadvertently be resubmitted for fulfillment . <h> Download FBA Orders <p> If you send Amazon Fulfilled Orders ( AFN ) to FBA directly from Amazon , but you still want to download those orders to Order Desk for your records , select the Download FBA Orders option : <p> If you would like to download FBA orders and also have the tracking numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corresponding FBA integration enabled on Order Desk as well . <p> Tip : For shipped and FBA orders being downloaded , be sure that you are n't automatically sending every order to one of your fulfillment services , as you can accidentally fulfill completed orders a second time . <p> You can use the Order Desk Rule Builder or integration specific settings , where applicable , to filter your orders and ensure any shipped or AFN orders are n't sent for fulfillment after being downloaded to Order Desk . <p> As an example , use a rule to move AFN orders to the Closed folder , where the condition in the rule says : If Order Metadata Field = **27;34;TOOLONG : <p> Any other rules sending orders for fulfillment will need to exclude the Closed folder . Given the customizable nature of the rule builder , there are many different ways possible to set up rules to prevent these orders from being sent for fulfillment . If you need help with this , please contact Order Desk support . <h> Import Orders <p> If you would like to import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to never download new orders , you can manually import your orders by entering the date in the Import Orders field and clicking Check . This will bring in all orders that fit your saved settings , if they have n't already been downloaded to Order Desk , from that date forward . <p> You may need to run the check a few times if you have a large number of orders . The date will gradually move forward until it reaches the present and all orders have been found and imported . <h> Feed Log <p> If you are interested in seeing the list of feeds that have been submitted to Amazon , you can click on the Get Submitted Feed Log button down at the bottom of the integration settings page : <p> You can click through to see the results of each feed submission , which can be helpful for debugging . This information can also be retrieved from the MWS Scratchpad . <h> Working with Multiple Amazon Marketplace Regions <p> If you are enabling multiple Amazon Marketplace integrations for separate regions , you may need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where these orders are being sent . This will be a completely custom setup for each store based on your specific requirements , but we 'll provide some general guidance here to get you started . <p> If , after reading through these guides , you are n't certain about or comfortable with setting up your store , please contact Order Desk support , and we will be happy to assist you . Before contacting us , it helps to already have all of your integrations enabled . Also please provide as much detail as you can about how your orders will be fulfilled so we can help create the rules you need . <h> Single Fulfillment Service <p> If all orders are being sent to one fulfillment service , regardless of where the orders are coming from , you can either use the integration 's settings to automatically submit all orders to that service , if applicable : <p> Or create a rule that says to submit orders to that fulfillment service as they are imported to Order Desk : <h> Multiple Fulfillment Services <p> If your orders will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more set up , depending on where they are going and how you determine which orders go to separate places . <p> It may be that you 'll just need to set up rules by shipping country to send to separate fulfillment services . If that is the case , you can follow the instructions in our Submitting Orders to Amazon FBA Worldwide guide to see how those rules will look . If you are n't sending your orders to FBA but you are still separating them by shipping country , your rules might actually still look very similar , so it 's recommended that you read through the guide to look at the rule structure , and then contact Order Desk support if you still need help with the setup . <p> Some integrations , such as ShipStation , will have settings where they pull orders from a specific folder . Double check your integration settings to see if this is the case . If so , you will need to set up a rule to move orders to that folder and let the integration take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help with setup , we will be happy to work with you . Please enable all of your integrations and provide us with as much detail as possible about where your orders are coming from and how you decide where they are to be submitted . With these details , we can more quickly help you get your store running automatically . <h> FAQ <h> Do you support Amazon Handmade ? <p> Yes . Amazon Handmade orders will be imported by the regular Amazon Marketplace integration for the region you sell in . One important limitation to be aware of is that we are not able to bring in notes with the order details from Amazon Handmade , including personalizations . These will need to be gotten directly from Amazon and manually added to orders in Order Desk . <p> If you are working with Print on Demand products , please refer to our Print on Demand Fulfillment guide for a thorough overview of how to use Order Desk with your print on demand store . <h> How do I download my FBA orders ? <p> Despite how it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBA integration . You will need to enable the Amazon Marketplace integration to import orders already fulfilled by Amazon ( AFN ) by FBA . Any orders coming from Amazon will be imported through the Marketplace integration , which is an order source .

Please read this section of this guide for more details . <h> My Amazon integration wo n't connect to Order Desk due to an error about MWS . How can I fix this ? <p> If you 're unable to make the connection between Amazon and Order Desk , or you previously made the connection and are now getting the error : Connection to Amazon FBA failed : Connection Error : The seller does not have an eligible Amazon account to call Amazon MWS . For more information about eligible accounts , see the Amazon MWS documentation , this means that Amazon prevented or disabled your connection due to your MWS eligibility .

This template is necessary because Order Desk needs to know what information should be included in the exported file , including how each field should be named . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " code " , you may need to call it " SKU " , " Item Code " or some other specific name . Setting up a template to your specifications ensures the data that is exported as a file will be laid out precisely how you need it , with each field matched to fit your requirements . <p> This guide will go over the details of setting up and using Export Templates in Order Desk . <h> Template Details <p> In the Template Details section , you will set up a few details specific to the export template you are creating , including : <p> The name of the template , so you can easily select it from a list of templates , if necessary <p> The name of the file that will be exported <p> The delimiter type of the file that will be exported , so it can be opened in and read by other apps or software <p> Any custom parameters for extra customization of the exported file , such as removing the title line , etc . <p> We 'll go over each option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Name and File Name <p> Give each template you create a unique and easily identifiable Name , as you may need to select it from a list of templates later , depending on how many you make over time .

If you need to export a txt file instead of a csv file , update the File Name to use the . txt extension instead . <h> One Line Per - Order/Item <p> If any product fields are added to an export template , the file will need to be exported with One Line Per Item . This allows for each product in an order with multiple items to be expanded out on separate lines .

If Download CSV is selected as the only option in the Template Actions section , the exported file will not be delivered . <h> Add Fields <p> The Add Fields section is the main part of the export template . This is where each of the columns ( or fields ) of the template will be set up , determining what information from the orders will be exported in the file . <p> To add a field to the export template , click on the field over on the right side of the page under Available Fields : <p> Then drag and drop the fields to rearrange them into the order you want the exported file to display the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you need the Code field to say " SKU " or the Item Name to say " PRODUCT " on the exported file , you 'll need to edit the Order Desk name for each : <p> The value field can typically be left alone except when combining data or customizing metadata , variations or checkout data information . As an example , if you need the Shipping First Name and Shipping Last Name to be in the same column , you can change shippingfirstname to shippingfirstname shippinglastname and rename the title to " Shipping Name " : <p> If you want to add metadata or variation fields to the template , select the appropriate field from the Available Fields , rename the title and adjust the value to match your variation or metadata . For example , you might have two variations , Size and Color , displayed like this on your product : <p> Choose Single Variation from the Available Fields for as many variations as you want to export , in this case , one for Size and one for Color . The title will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then adjust the " ? " in the value field to match your variation exactly ; this is how Order Desk knows which variation to include in the export template . Since the Size variation is " Size ( Inch ) " , replace the ? with " Size ( Inch ) " : variationlistSize ( Inch ) ( just adding " Size " wo n't pull in the variation data since the name is actually " Size ( Inch ) " ) , and for Color it will be variationlistColor : <p> This is similar for Metadata and Checkout Data fields . The name or title of the field can be whatever you want it to be , but the value needs to match your exact data , for example : metadatashopifyvendor , checkoutdatagiftmessage or checkoutdataGift Message , depending on how the field is written out in the order itself . <h> Product Fields <p> The Product Fields section under Available Fields is for including the specific details about any items in the order . If any of these fields are added to your export template , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Per Item . Because these details are about the item(s) in the order , when an order has more than one item in it , there will need to be multiple lines in the exported file to display these fields for each item . <h> Field Filters <p> For an overview of and instructions on how to work with the field filters in an export template , please refer to the Export Template Field Filters guide . <h> Importing Templates from Other Stores <p> For instructions on how to copy export templates between stores , please refer to this guide . <h> Exporting Data from Order Desk <p> To use an export template for exporting data from Order Desk , you have a few options . Refer back to the Template Actions section of this guide for directions on how to set up your template to export as a download , sent to an email address and/or sent through an FTP connection . This determines the way the template will be delivered to you or to a third party when processed . <p> There are three main ways to export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can directly select the orders you need to export and click on Export Checked . From the dropdown list , choose the export template you created to process the export for those orders . <p> 2 <p> You can also export an entire folder by opening the folder and clicking directly on Export All Pages and choosing the export template you created . <p> 3 <p> Last , you can set up the template to be automatically processed . For instructions on how to do this , refer back to the Automatic Processing section of this guide . <p> Tip : If an export includes more than 2,000 records , it will be queued and completed by background services to prevent a timeout that would keep you waiting . When the full export is complete , the file will be processed as normal , unless set to download , in which case it will be emailed to the Order Desk Store Admin email on file .

@@23739636 @3739636/ 27494 @qwx227494 <h> Overview <p> With Order Desk , you have the ability to create unique email templates for your customers , your vendors , your staff , yourself or anyone who needs to be notified regarding orders . These emails can be sent out automatically based on certain events and conditions with your orders . Each email template can be customized to show the information you want pulled from the order and can be designed to fit your brand . <p> Some examples of email templates commonly set up are for shipment notifications , dropship notifications for a vendor , order notifications for a store admin , order confirmations for a customer , potential fraud notifications for a store admin , order summaries , and thank you emails for a customer . If you have a need to send an email to someone based on the information in an order , you can set up a template to make it happen . <p> This guide will go over how to create and edit email templates , as well as how to set them up to be sent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look under the Settings menu in the left sidebar and click on Templates . <p> To create your first email template , under the Email Templates section , click on Add New Email Template . <p> After clicking to add a new template , the default Shipment Notification template will open up on the screen : <p> From here , you can either use this template as is , delete it and replace it with another template , or edit it to include the information you want . <h> Existing Sample Templates <p> We have a few existing sample templates already . Feel free to copy and paste any of these to use as your email templates or to edit them to customize your own template design . <p> These sample templates can be copied from here . Please note that because receipt templates handle multiple orders and email templates are only meant to pull data from one order at a time , the code for each uses a slightly different syntax . Pulling code from a receipt template and pasting it into an email template , or vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data is called . <h> Edit Email Templates <p> Once you 've created the default Shipment Notification template , if you want to edit or replace the body of the template , you 'll need at least some knowledge of HTML . <p> Tip : Copying and pasting email templates from other apps or websites will not work . Each Order Desk email template is unique to the code and field names used in Order Desk . If you are n't familiar with code and need to completely overhaul one of the sample templates , we recommend working with a designer or developer . <p> There are three sections to the template page : <p> 1 <p> The template fields and email overrides at the top : <p> Each of these fields is listed below with a description of their purpose . <p> Template Name : name your template something easy to remember and to identity it by so when you have to select it from a list of templates in the Rule Builder or from the email dropdown , you 'll know which is which . <p> Email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is sent to your recipients . <p> From Name Override : put in the name of the person or store you want this email to come from if you do n't want it to be from the name of your Odrer Desk store . <p> From Email Override : put in the email address you want this template to come from if you do n't want it to use your customer facing store email that is set in your Store Settings . <p> Email Delivery Override : add the email address this template is intended for if different from the customer 's email address . If no address is added here , this template will be sent to the customer . <p> Attachment Field Names : if any URLs have been added to your order metadata or checkout data fields , you can add the field names for that data here and they 'll be included as attachments to your email . For example , you can create a pdf from an order receipt and attach it to the email . <p> 2 <p> The code itself : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to be edited if you want to change the order data pulled into the template or the message displayed in the email . For a list of field names and a few examples of code that can be added to the templates , scroll down to the next section . <p> 3 <p> The Send Preview Email at the bottom : <p> When working on your edits , you can send yourself a preview email using an actual order from your store . This is a good way to check that your code is working as expected and see what your intended recipients will receive . <p> To send a preview of your email template , you can put in your email address and an order number : <p> If the code is formatted properly , when you click Send Email , you 'll immediately see a green SENT message , and the email template will be sent to the address in the Send To Email field : <p> If any part of the code is n't formatted correctly ( loops are n't properly closed , etc. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the email will not be sent . When this happens , refresh the page and check your code for any errors before trying to send the preview again . <h> Common Field Names and Code Examples <p> storename - this will pull in your Order Desk store name anywhere it is used in the template sourceid - this is the Order I 'd ( also known as the Order Number ) item.name - the product name item.code - the product SKU item.quantity - the quantity ordered of an individual product item.price - price of the product <p> Be sure to use a secure image that is stored on a site with an SSL certificate ( where the URL uses https instead of http ) . If you need assistance creating a secure link , ask Order Desk support for assistance . <h> Adding Inventory Cost of Items <p> To add the inventory cost of your items to an email template , use this code : <p> ( item.quantity * **27;63;TOOLONG ) moneyformat <h> Adding Internal Order Notes <p> To add your internal order notes , use this code : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Manually Send Email Templates <p> Once at least one email template has been created in your Order Desk store , you can go into any order and click on the email icon to send an email . The order details will also need to have the customer 's email address included ( even if the email template you are sending has an email delivery override ) for this option to be available . <p> If you only have one template , you will get a popup screen of that template and the option to edit and send it : <p> If you have more than one template , the email icon will be a dropdown to choose the template you want to send . Choosing the template will pop up the same dialog box with the option to edit and send the email . <h> Create Rules to Automatically Send Email Templates <p> Instead of sending emails manually , it is more efficient to create rules that will automatically send your email templates when certain events happen to orders ( when they are imported , confirmed , shipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment notification email with tracking details to your customers , please read through this guide for complete instructions . <p> If you want to send a dropship email to a vendor , please read through this guide for complete instructions . Otherwise , continue reading this guide for general instructions on setting up rules to send out email templates . <p> With at least one template created in your Order Desk store , you can now set up a rule to send it . Look under the Settings menu in the left sidebar and click on Rule Builder . <p> In the Rule Builder , you 'll first choose an event that needs to happen to trigger your email going out . This can be anything from when Order is Imported ( good for notifying customers , vendors or people on your team about the new order ) , when Shipment is Added ( good for notifying customers of their tracking details ) , or when Folder is Changed ( perhaps you want to send out an email based on which folder an order is moved into ) , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continue to build the rest of the rule . <p> You may need to set up conditions depending on the event chosen or if only certain orders will need to trigger emails . Conditions let you specify the exact information in or about an order so your email wo n't go to every order that fits your event . For instance , if your event is when Folder is Changed , you 'll want to set up a condition to specify which folder the order moved into , otherwise any order that is moved into a new folder could trigger the email . <p> In this example , we 'll add the condition that the Folder I 'd is 21879 . The I 'd can be found in the URL for the folder . <p> You can add more than one condition as well . Perhaps you have orders coming in from Etsy , Shopify and Amazon Marketplace , but you only want orders in this specific folder that came from Etsy to receive the email . Set up an additional condition specifying Etsy as the order source for this : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to send the email template . In most cases , you 'll choose the action Send Email to Customer even if you 're not sending the email to the customer . Remember , if the email is meant for someone other than the customer , you should have added that email address to the Email Delivery Override section in the template . If no email address is set there in the template , the email will go to the customer 's email address . <p> The exception to this is if you choose Send Email to Admin instead for your action . In this case , unless the Email Delivery Override in the template has been set to another email address , the email will go to the admin 's email address set in your Store Settings . <p> Additional actions can also be added to the rule . <p> Name and save your rule . Now any time this particular event happens , this rule will look at the conditions you 've applied , if any , make sure they match the orders , and send the email template when they do . 
@@23739637 @3739637/ 27494 @qwx227494 <p> Order Desk can submit your orders to MWW and then check for shipment notifications when those orders have shipped . This guide will explain our MWW integration and give an overview of the different settings and their uses within it . <p> These settings can be accessed by clicking on MWW from the Integrations menu in the left sidebar once the MWW integration has been enabled in your account . <p> Tip : Print on demand integrations require an Order Desk Pro account . <h> Integration Setup <p> To begin , connect your MWW account to Order Desk by clicking on Manage Integrations under the Integrations menu in the left sidebar . <p> Select MWW from the Print on Demand section and click Enable . <p> Enter the MWW Username and Password and click Connect . These will be separate from your MWW login credentials and are provided to you directly by your MWW sales representative . <h> Shipment Settings <p> Select the Ship Type . These are settings specific to MWW and in most cases it should be set to Mail to Home unless MWW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or FedEx Shipping Account you want MWW to use for shipment , enter the account number . <p> If you have a Stamps.com account you want to use , please give that account number directly to MWW so that they can load it into your account on their end . <h> Folder Settings <p> Select the folders where you want your MWW orders to be placed after Import , Shipment and if Canceled . <p> You can choose from the default Order Desk folders , or you can create custom folders first . This can be done from the Store Settings page by clicking on Store Settings under the Settings menu in the left sidebar . Click on Folders then Add Folder to create a new folder . <p> Any new folders that have been created will appear in these dropdown sections of the MWW settings . <h> Store Information <p> This is the default address used as the return address on your packages . If you would like to change this on an order by order basis , use the Order Desk Rule Builder to set a different return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can enable test mode from the MWW settings page . <p> By default , orders will be in live or test mode based on this setting . If the store is live , a test order can still be sent to MWW using OrderType in the metadata of the order . This will be discussed in more detail in the Preparing Orders section below . <h> Product Code Match <p> The Product Code Match feature allows you to tell Order Desk when certain SKUs need to be changed before orders are sent for fulfillment . With MWW specifically , this match allows you to have products that are sent to multiple print on demand vendors . Their product SKUs ( printsku in your item metadata ) will be different from each other , so you will need to match the SKU in this field . <p> As an example , if you have a product that you send to a different printer where the printsku is DT6000 , but you want to occasionally send this product to MWW , you 'll have to match that DT6000 to MWW 's code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To do this , add the first code to the Product Code Match field , then = , then add MWW 's code last . <p> Now , when you have an order for the item set up to go to the first printer , you can also send it to MWW because the Product Code Match will tell MWW their code for the item when the order is submitted to them . <h> Product Code Skip <p> The Product Code Skip feature allows you to tell Order Desk if there are any SKUs you do not want to be submitted to MWW . Enter your SKUs , separated by comma or line break , and they will not be sent for fulfillment . If no part of the order can be submitted to MWW , it will be skipped . <h> Inventory Location Match <p> The Inventory Location Match field allows you to match the inventory location you have set for items meant for MWW if it is different from " MWW " . For instance , if you have set your inventory location on your items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Match field so Order Desk knows that any items with manualWW as the location are meant for MWW . <p> Tip : It is better to split orders properly than use this field , but if you do choose to use this , please be careful that your inventory location matches this field exactly as any orders that do n't match will not be submitted to MWW . <h> Shipping Class Match <p> If you plan to offer more shipping methods than the default settings you 've already added to MWW in the Shipment Settings section , you can do so by matching the names of the shipping class in your store to the name MWW calls it . This can be done in the Shipping Class Match section of your MWW settings page . <p> Click on --Select Carrier Class-- next to MWW Classes to choose the shipping class name that MWW uses . <p> In the Shopping Cart Name field , type in the name of the class you use in your shopping cart that matches the MWW class and click Add . <p> You can add as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column on the right will show the matches you have made . <p> In this example , what the shopping cart calls " UPS Ground " , MWW refers to as " UPS Ground Residential " . With this match in place , Order Desk would be able to translate any orders coming in with UPS Ground as the shipping method into UPS Ground Residential so MWW will know what shipping method to use for those orders . <h> Preparing Orders <p> Because MWW has some unique requirements , information about each print needs to be stored in the order item 's metadata here in Order Desk before it can be submitted to MWW . <p> Every print on demand item should be stored in your Order Desk inventory , which can be found by clicking on Inventory Items under the Tools menu in the left sidebar . <p> Each item should have a printsku ( MWW 's code for the product being printed ) and a printurl ( a link to your artwork file so MWW can use it to print on their item ) stored in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the following fields can ( or should ) be added to the item metadata : <p> Field Name <p> Value <p> Required <p> inventorylocation <p> MWW <p> recommended <p> printsku <p> MWW Part Number <p> required <p> printurl <p> Your Print URL <p> required <p> mwwitemsscc <p> Not Usually Used <p> optional <p> printnecktapecolor <p> If Required <p> optional <p> printthreadcolor <p> If Required <p> optional <p> Tip : Setting the inventory 's Location is recommended so that orders can be split as necessary when not all items in an order are going to MWW . <p> A typical inventory item set up to be submitted to MWW will look like this : <p> The following fields can be set on the order level either in checkout data or metadata . <p> Field Name <p> Description <p> OrderType <p> new , test , redo , or reorder . By default it will be new or test based on your live mode setting on the Order Desk setup page . <p> ShippingAccount <p> If you have a custom shipping account number for a particular order <p> ShippingMethod <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This must match the MWW shipment code <p> ShippingLabel <p> Link to a PDF file with shipping label .

OrderGroup is also accepted here . <p> ProjectShipDate <p> Reference date when you want these order be shipped by . Actual ship date are determined by the SLA . <p> RetailerPO <p> Retailer PO# if required <p> Tip : We do not recommend using redo because we wo n't be able to get details about the shipment after the order has shipped . <p> Please review our Print on Demand Fulfillment guide for a thorough walkthrough on how to use our on-demand print services , including MWW . You can always contact Order Desk support for assistance with getting started . <h> Resubmitting Orders <p> If you need to resubmit an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be changed so MWW does n't reject a duplicate order . To do this , open up the order details page and hover your cursor underneath the Order Details on the left . Click on Edit Order Details : <p> Edit the Source ID# for the order . We suggest putting a -X on the end of the order number so the new order number is similar to the original with an easy to understand edit . <p> Once the order number is changed , you can now resubmit the order to MWW.

You will still be able to download , move or submit orders manually , and you can enable the automatic settings later , when you 're ready and confident that you have properly set up your Order Desk account . <p> To enable and set up an integration , look at the left sidebar of your screen in the Order Desk app , and click on Manage Integrations under the Integrations menu , near the bottom . <p> From the Manage Integrations page , select the integrations you want to enable and enter your credentials for each one to make the connection : <p> For more information on our different integrations and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide for most of our integrations , such as Shopify , Etsy , ShipStation and MWW , to name a few , but you can search our help site for others . We are always working on updating and creating new guides to be more thorough , so keep checking back , or contact Order Desk Support for any questions you ca n't find answered in a guide . <p> Tip : Print on demand integrations require an Order Desk Pro account before they can be enabled . If you want to explore the platform before committing to a pro account , you can skip this step for now . <h> Working with Folders <p> Every Order Desk store comes with a few pre-made Folders : <p> New orders will always be downloaded into the New folder by default . This can be changed with rules , which we 'll go over in the last guide of this series , or with settings in some integrations . <p> Some people find that these default folders are adequate for their needs , however most people will choose or need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can store files , so in Order Desk , if you need a simple or complex storage system for your orders , especially as they move through the submission process , you 'll want to consider creating new folders to fit your store 's needs . <p> To create a new folder , go to your Store Settings : <p> Click on Folders and then Add Folder : <p> Folders are good for storing orders that have already been submitted to vendors but have not yet been fulfilled . If you work with more than one vendor , especially third party vendors we are n't integrated with , having a folder for each one called " At Colorado Timberline " or " At Vendor x " can be very useful for keeping your orders organized while they 're still in the process of being fulfilled . <p> Another good case for having custom folders is if you need to filter your orders , be that to flag them for review , assign them to someone else on your team , work on them before they are ready to move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other unique scenario that would be a good reason to set certain orders aside before submitting them for fulfillment . <p> Once you create the folders that you need , you can adjust them as you become more familiar with Order Desk and decide on how you want to use the app to best process and fulfill your orders . 
@@23739647 @3739647/ <h> API <h> Reference <h> On Demand Print Fulfillment <p> Order Desk has built integrations with a number of services for on-demand print fulfillment services . We currently integratate with MWW , SSI , Case Marvel , Marvelpress , Colorado Timberline , Dubow , and Printful . If you have a print service that youd like to see supported , please contact us . <p> In order to send your orders for fulfillment , you need to make sure that Order Desk knows all the details about how to print your product . This usually means that you need 1 ) the printing company product code for the item being printed and 2 ) the url for the artwork that should be printed . These details can be added to an order manually or can be automated . In this guide well show you first how to place a manual order and then how to manage your print details via spreadsheet and how to add those- details automatically to your- new orders . Finally well show you to split your orders and automatically submit them for fulfillment . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll need to do a few things . <p> 1 ) Connect to your service provider . Get a username/password or API key from your on-demand printing- service , enable the integration and make the connection . Please note that our on-demand printing- services are not available on the free Order Desk plan so you 'll need to upgrade to Order Desk Pro before enabling these integrations . <p> 2 ) Gather the product codes for the products youd like to print . Your contact at the on-demand printing- service can provide these codes for you . <p> 3 ) Prepare your printable images . These images should be set to the format specified by your on-demand printing- service . Once the files are ready , upload them to your website . They should n't be linked anywhere , but should be available in a folder like http : **26;92;TOOLONG . If you do n't  have a website or cant upload files to your website , you can use Dropbox to store your files . You 'll right click on the file and click " Copy Dropbox Link " to get the publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced users or those with lots of images is to create a bucket at Amazon S3 and upload your files there . Just be sure that the bucket and- files- are publicly available . <p> Now that your account is connected- and- you have gathered your product codes and images , you are ready to submit your first order . <h> Placing a Manual Order <p> To create an order manually , - go to Tools &gt;- Add New Order- and enter your shipping details . Enter your- products name ( like Kitty Pillow ) and click Save New Order . Youll be redirected to the detail page for the new order you just created . Now its time to load in the specific details about your printable product . Click the name of the order item to open up the item details for editing . You need to add two variations to the product . The name of the first variation is printsku and the value will be the on-demand printing companys product code for this product . The name of the second variation is printurl1 and the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your image . Once you 've entered these details , click Save Changes . Your fields should look like this . <p> Now that your print details are included with the product , you can send the order for printing. - Underneath the list of order items you 'll see a button to export the order for fulfillment to your on-demand printing company . Clicking the button will queue up the order for export . You can either wait a minute and reload the page to see the results or you can click on the View Appointments link under- the Tools menu and run the " Submit " option- right away . If the order was successfully submitted , it will be- moved out of the New folder . If there was an error , go down to the Order History section on the detail page to find out what went wrong . <p> Well keep checking the order periodically for shipment notification and when we receive the tracking number , well add it to the order and move the order to the Closed- folder . <h> Automating the Print Details Process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to automate the process for getting the- print- details into your- orders . You will be- creating inventory items within Order Desk . These inventory items wont keep track of stock count , but will hold the details for each unique item . Under the Tools menu click Inventory Items and add a new item by clicking the button in the upper right corner . Enter your item name and the unique item code . This item code is the SKU that you will use in your shopping cart ( Etsy users click here for SKU details ) . In the metadata section , add an entry for printsku and printurl1 . The values , of course will be the printable products code and the full url . Its also recommended that you put the on-demand printing companys name in the Location field ( MWW , SSI , etc . ) . Repeat this process for each unique combination of print files and print codes . <p> Now that you have some inventory items , when new orders are created the details of each item in the order will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventory item list . There is a setting to enable this feature on the store settings page , but when you enable a Print On Demand- integration this setting will be turned on by default . So its probably already enabled for you . <p> If you ever make a change to an inventory item after an order has been downloaded , you can click the " Sync Item Details With Inventory " button on the order detail page ( bottom right ) . <p> Once the spreadsheet is filled out ( or you at least have a few lines completed ) , export it as CSV file ( comma-separated values ) . Then go to Tools &gt; Import Data and create an import template for Inventory Items . On the next screen we will build an import template that you can use periodically to update your inventory item list . For the first field , select " Item Name " . For the second , select " Code/SKU . " For the third field , select " Item Metadata " and replace the ? with " printsku " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fourth field- is the same as the third except it should read " metadataprinturl1 " and the fifth field should be matched to Location- ( the five fields should look like this ) . Save this template . <p> Please note the email address at the top of the page you can email a CSV file to this address- and it will be automatically processed against this template . Click the " Back to Import Template List " button and you can see your template ready to accept data . Select your file and click Upload and all inventory items will be uploaded . It is no problem to re-upload items that have already been uploaded. - Listings with a matching code will simply be updated . <h> Automate the Printing Submission Process <p> This step is a little involved . If you need any assistance , please ask us for help and well be more than happy to assist . Also : do n't  worry about this step until everything else is humming along just fine . Do n't  read this step- and give up on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to your incoming orders automatically , you can tell Order Desk to automatically submit your orders for fulfillment . If you sell other kinds of products that do n't  get sent for on-demand printing , then we will need to split your orders . <p> If all your orders will be sent for on-demand printing to one supplier , then this process is fairly straight-forward . Go to the Rule Builder and add a rule for " On Order Import , " then add an action to submit to your on-demand printing service . Give the rule a nice , clear name and save . <p> If you only need to submit some of your orders- or- products- for on-demand print fulfillment , you 'll need to set up an order splitting rule . This will split any on-demand products out of an order and create a new order from just those products . This makes the fulfillment process much simpler and easier to manage . There are two rules that well set up for this split . The first does the split and the second submits the split order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule " On Order Import " and the action is " Split Order . " In the box under the Split Order action you 'll enter a string to tell Order Desk what kind of split you want to do . We are going to split on inventory location . If you entered MWW for your- inventory location ( when setting up the inventory items ) you would enter this for your split string : " **32;120;TOOLONG " ( without the quotes ) . - Its a complicated string , but the main thing that you need to know is that your inventory location name should be at the beginning and end of the string , replacing the MWW text . <p> Rule #2 : The Submit Create a second rule " On Order Split " with the action " Submit to Your Fulfillment Service . " Add a condition and in the first dropdown select " Order Metadata " . The comparison dropdown should be " like " and the value should be " MWW " or whatever your inventory location name is . This way , well only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . If an order only had matching items and did n't  need to be split , it will still match . <h> Conclusion <p> After finishing your setup , you should test everything and make sure its working fine . And you should always keep an eye on your orders to make sure they are submitting with no problems . If you complete this setup by yourself , you may want to drop us a line and ask us to make sure that everything is set up correctly . Wed be happy to take a look at your account . <h> Printing Thermal Labels <p> Printing labels on a label printer can be tricky because data needs to be sent in raw format instead of printing like a traditional printer . In order to facilitate reliable printing to your label printer we use a service called PrintNode which involves installing a small app on your computer . The label is sent to the PrintNode server which then pushes it to your computer and automatically prints the label from your label printer . PrintNode is a paid service but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want to print labels . <h> Get Started <p> If you are connecting a mac , its important that you setup your computer for RAW printing . PrintNode offers a helpful guide for getting this setup . You should do this before installing the PrintNode application . <p> Enable the PrintNode integration from the Other tab on the integration page . Confirm your name and email and click the " Setup Account Now " button . Well provision your PrintNode account and assign you a password . On the next page , download the Windows or Mac OSX app and install . When prompted , paste the provided login details into the PrintNode app . After the app has connected to the service , click the " Connect Now " button within Order Desk and well display your available printers . Select your printer and you 'll be all set . <p> Within EasyPost , make sure to set your domestic label format to EPL2 so the prints will be created in the proper format . You may want to continue to print international shipments in PDF format for proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or need any assistance , please contact Order Desk for support . <h> Building Export Templates <p> You can use Order Desks Export Template feature to build your own customized CSV file in just the format you need . <h> Custom Parameters <p> Sometimes your templates need some extra customization . You may enter any of these parameters as needed . Each parameter should be separated by a space . <p> NO-TITLE-LINE skip the title line <p> CRLF use Windows line endings ( rn ) , default is Unix ( n ) <p> NO-BOM skip the UTF-8 encoding characters placed at the front of the document <p> ISO-8859-1 convert the character encoding from UTF-8 to- ISO-8859-1 <p> NO-WEEKEND do not run the report on Saturday or Sunday , local store time <p> FORCE-QUOTES put quotes around all fields regardless of whether they are actually required <h> Large Exports <p> If your export includes more than 2,000 records , it will be queued and completed by background services . This will allow us to export- very large datasets without timing out the system and keeping you waiting . When the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as normal . The only exception is that if you had requested the file to be downloaded , it will be emailed to the store admin email address as set on the Store Settings &gt; Email page. - Additionally , if your export has more than 2,000 records any export rules will not be performed on the orders in the export . <p> If you do n't  receive your file via email , please ask Order Desk support for assistance in receiving the file . It may have been too big to send via email . <h> Split Fulfillment <h> Step 1 : Add Inventory Items <p> The first thing you will want to do is to add your products to the Order Desk- inventory . The easiest way to do this is to- create a CSV spreadsheet file and- import the products . It is important that you enter a value for the location field to indicate which kind of fulfillment you want . We will reference this value later so be consistent with your naming . <h> Step 2 : Setup Sync Rule <p> Setup a rule to- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads the location into the inventorylocation field in your item metadata . Your rule should fire " On Order Import " and the action should be " Sync Order Items With Inventory Details . " This rule should be first in the list so it gets processed before anything else . Note that existing orders wont have the extra data- added to them so if you want to populate the data on existing orders you might want to execute a test rule on an entire folder . <h> Setting Up Integrations <p> If you are exporting some products to an export like Shipwire or 3PL Central , you 'll want to go to the settings page for the integration in question and put the applicable inventory locations- into the " Inventory Location Match " field . If you want to send- multiple location types , put a comma between the location names. - If there are no applicable products , the order will not be submitted . <h> Setting Up Export Templates <p> If you are exporting some products to a CSV file , you 'll do the same thing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template . Just make sure that your export type is " One Line Per Item " or the match fields will be ignored . <h> Setting Up Email Templates <p> If you only want to send an email with- products in a certain location , youd adjust your email template so that it filters out anything that is n't in your target inventory location . Find the line that begins the product loop and adjust it so that it looks like this : <p> % for item in orderitems if **31;154;TOOLONG == " dropship1 " % <p> Tip #2 : - Youll want to make sure that your order has applicable items in it before sending the email , otherwise you 'd be sending an email with no products . Setup a condition on your rule that has " If Item Metadata " = " **26;187;TOOLONG " and then the email wont send if there are n't  any products with a location of " dropship1 " in the the inventory location field . <h> Sending Tracking Details to Customers <p> Order Desk can be configured to automatically send tracking information to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of this feature well be creating an email template , then setting up a rule to use the new template . <h> Creating Email Template <p> Click " Templates " under the Settings menu and create a new Email template . The- template defaults are fine , but if you 'd like to customize the email a bit or include your logo you can do so . After saving your new template , you can test it out by browsing to any order that has some added tracking information and pressing the email button under the list of products . This will bring up a modal window that shows your email preview . Enter your email address as the email override and press send . <h> Setting Up A Rule <p> Now that our template is created , click " Rule Builder " under the Settings menu . Under the " Add New Rule " section , select " Shipment is Added " and click Continue . Then select " Send Email To Customer " as the action and select the new template you created in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Add Rule button . All done ! <h> Sending One Email For Multiple Packages <p> If you often have multiple packages for each order , this method would result in multiple emails to your customer . To get around this , you can select " Queue Shipment Email To Customer " and instead of sending the email immediately , the emails are queued and you will have up to 6 hours to finish sending all your packages before all emails are sent . <h> Inventory Items <p> Your stores inventory can be stored in Order Desk . Click on Inventory Items to see your existing inventory . If nothing is there , you can enter items manually . If you have a spreadsheet , you can import a CSV file . <p> On the Store Settings page , you can set whether the items in- imported orders should be added to the inventory automatically and additionally whether those imported items should be decremented from existing stock . You can also set whether inventory item details should be automatically synced to the order item . <p> When creating new orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to auto-select from a dropdown populated by the contents of these items . <p> Some fulfillment services can sync their current stock numbers to your inventory list . You can then use this list to sync that information back to your shopping cart . Shipwire to BigCommerce is a great example of this . <h> Storing Item Details <p> Inventory items can also be used to store details about an order item . This is often used when setting up products for print on demand fulfillment . You can set variations or metadata that can be synced to the order item on import . If you would like to automatically sync these details , please check the auto-sync feature on the Store Settings page . There 's also a link at the bottom of the order details page to re-sync item- details manually . <h> Change Product Codes and Multi-packs <p> If you sell your product in a multi-pack format with special codes , you can create an inventory item with a couple of special metadata fields . The field- quantitymultipler will multiply the current quantity by whatever value you enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well in an attempt to keep the price the same . If someone orders 1 item for $100 and the multi-pack expands it to 4 , each item will now have a price of $25 . Be aware that rounding could cause some slight inaccuracies . The same product in a 3-pack comes out to $33.33 each . <p> If you enter a metadata field called- codereplace the code/sku field will be replaced with this value . So if your inventory item product code is 1234 and your codereplace field is 1235 , we will switch the code to 1235 and attempt to update details from any product we find with 1235 as the product code . These two special fields can be layered so widgetX4 can multiply the quantity by 4 and change the product code to widget . <p> If you enter product1 , product2 in the codereplace field , the original item will be deleted and we will create two products with those same details with codes of product1 and product2 . Then if those codes have inventory items , well sync those details into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product like " clothing-pack " become " shirt " and " shorts " . <h> Import Data <p> If you have data coming from an external source , this can easily be imported to Order Desk . The Order Desk data import tool supports Orders , Shipments ( package tracking information ) , and Inventory Items . To use this tool , you 'll first create a saved import template with a sample file . <h> Setup Instructions <p> Click on Import Data under the Tools menu . Then click " Add New Import Template " to begin . At the next screen , enter a reference name , select the type of import this will be ( order , shipment , inventory item ) and upload your sample file . <p> After saving your new import template you can now- configure the fields to match your import . If you are uploading orders , you can select one column which , if the same as the previous column , will add the items in the column to the previous line . This allows you to add multiple line- items- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always set certain data if the import does n't  overwrite it . So you can always set the shipping.country to " US " or the sourcename to " FoxyCart " . Put one mapping on each line in this format " name = value " . <p> The most important part of the setup process is the field matching . Each column is shown in the table with the contents of the first row , the field to which you want to match it , and sample- data from the first few rows to help you identify the contents. - Once the field mapping is complete , you can go back to the list of import templates and you 'll see your new template available . <h> Usage <p> To import data , simply select your template , attach your- file , and press Upload . Files must be in a CSV format and can be either tab or comma delimited . If you want to preview the data before processing it , you can check the preview box and your data will be shown to you rather than imported into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data by emailing it to a special email address . Send your files as attachments to the email address specified on the import setup page . <p> Regarding file size , the limitation has more to do with rows than file size . Do n't  upload files that are larger than 2MB and- do n't  try to import more than a few thousand records at a time as your request may time out . <h> Splitting Orders <p> Order Desk allows you to split the products inside of orders into multiple orders for specialized handling . You can either split an order manually or setup a rule to do it automatically . When orders are split , the tax , shipping , handling , and discounts are split proportionally between the new and original order . <h> Manually Splitting an Order <p> You can manually split an order on the order detail page . Select the items you want to split to the new order and press the " Split Order " button . After the split takes place , you will be redirected to the new order . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SKUs that you want to automatically split out to their own order , you can build a rule . You can also specify a rule title that gets set as order metadata . This allows you to automatically do something special with the new order . Create a new rule for " Order Import " and select " Split Order " as the action . In the settings box , you will put all the product codes that you want split out to the new order and separate them by comma . For example , let 's say that your store allows dropshipping from a single third party for the codes sku1 , sku2 , and sku3 . To separate these skus into their own order you would enter them ( separated by comma ) into the settings box . If you want to enter an order metadata title for the new order , you would precede the list by the title and a pipe sign ( ) . So your full settings box string would be : <p> Titlesku1 , sku2 , sku3 <p> Then if an order comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sku1 and sku2 products will be split to their own single order and sku4 will be left in the original order . You can then run an action on " Order Split " and check the order metadata " splittitleTitle " to make sure that the split came from this action to send an email or move to a specific folder . <p> If you have multiple groups of product codes ( multiple dropshippers ) you can run the split action multiple times with different settings . <h> Other Splitting Options <p> You can also split by other fields than the products sku . The following codes are available : <p> CATEGORYCODE split by the products category code <p> DELIVERYTYPE split by the products delivery type <p> ITEMID split each item into its own order <p> VARIATION=x split each item by a particular item variation <p> METADATA=x split each item by a particular items metadata value <p> To use any of these alternate splitting options , enter the option above with a pipe ( ) immediately following- in the split configuration box . So , for example , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CATEGORYCODE " when setting up the rule . <h> Variation Splitting <p> If you are doing variation splitting , you would put the name of the variation you are targeting after the = in the title and the variation values to be split after the pipe . So , for example , if you have a variation named distributor and you want the acme and smith values- to be split out to their orders , you would setup the split like this : <p> **25;215;TOOLONG , smith <h> Metadata- Splitting <p> Metadata splitting is just like variation splitting but is often used for splitting orders based on the inventory location ( for handling different types of inventory ) . If you load in your inventory with locations , you can then run the " Sync Order Items With Inventory Details " action as soon as the order is imported . Then you could set up a split like this : <p> LONG ... <p> This example would split out a new order with only the items in warehouse1 or warehouse2 . If you have a few different metadata splits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ METADATA= text with another string so you can target this particular split a little easier . Examples : <p> LONG ... <p> **42;242;TOOLONG <p> LONG ... <h> Sending Email From Order Desk <p> Order Desk uses email in a variety of ways . Store owners can email their customers or themselves and the system will sometimes email a store admin an alert regarding order status . <h> Built-In Email <p> Order Desk can send your mail for you with our- high-throughput transactional email service . In order to ensure high deliverability rates , we will add a Sender- header to the email so that the email will appear to come from your domain . This will cause some email programs to add " on Behalf of orderdesk.me " or " via orderdesk.me " to the From name . <h> Custom SMTP <p> If you prefer to deliver the message from your domain , you can enter your own SMTP credentials and we will deliver the email via your SMTP server . You can also enter custom headers . Separate headers with a semi-colon . Example : <p> X-CUSTOM-NAME : Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ready access to an SMTP account , SendGrid , MailGun , and SparkPost all offer free tier email sending and will provide SMTP credentials for you . <h> Store Settings <p> Users who have " Manage Settings " permissions for their store can manage general settings for Order Desk . To do so , can click Settings &gt; Store Settings . <h> Store Name and Email <p> Your store name is what will be used in email communication with your customers and in templates throughout the site . The store email is the email address that will be used as the return address when emails are sent to your client . The admin email address is the address that Order Desk will use to send admin notices from time to time . <h> Location Settings <p> Be sure to set your timezone correctly so that your orders will be displayed at the proper time . The locale setting will determine whether your currency is displayed in $ or- - , etc . If you want your customer and shipping country codes to be converted to full names on import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Email Settings <h> Display Settings <p> To set your date format , enter the PHP date code . See- http : **37;286;TOOLONG for the date code reference . The orders per page setting allows you to change how many orders are displayed at once . 50 is a good setting . If you make this number very high , it will slow down the system . Its helpful to change this number for a short time if you need to move a lot of orders at once , but in general it should be a relatively small number . <h> Security Settings <p> If any of these options are selected , the system can warn you about orders that you may want to take a look at . If orders need attention , you 'll see a red flag on the order view to alert you .

To do so , click the name of the item to open up the item details for editing . <p> You will need to add two variations to the product : <p> The name of the first variation is printsku and the value will be the on-demand printing company 's product code for this product . <p> The name of the second variation is printurl1 ( printurl also works ) and the value for this field will be the full website address for the image to be printed on the product . <p> After adding these details , click Save Product . <p> Now that your print details are included with the product , you can send the order for printing . Underneath the list of order items you 'll see a button to export the order for fulfillment to your on-demand printing company , like this button for MWW : <p> Clicking the button will queue up the order for export . You can either wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can click on the View Appointments link under the Tools menu in the left sidebar <p> and click the Submit option right away . If the order was successfully submitted , it will be moved out of the New folder . <p> If there was an error , you can scroll down to the bottom of the Order History section on the detail page to find out what went wrong . <p> We will check the order periodically for shipment notification . When we receive the tracking number , it will be added to the order and the order will be moved to the Closed folder . <h> Automating the Print Details Process <p> Now that you have successfully submitted a manual order , the next step is to automate the process for getting your print details into your orders . To do this , you will need to create inventory items within Order Desk . These inventory items wo n't keep track of stock count , but will hold the details for each unique item . <p> Click Inventory Items under the Tools menu in the left sidebar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top right corner of the page . <p> Enter your item details on this page and click Add Item . <p> Things to note : the Item SKU is your SKU for the product . This is the SKU that you use in the cart where you sell the product . <p> The Part Number ( printsku ) is the number you get from your printer for the product that will be printed . <p> The Print URL ( printurl ) is the printable image file that will be sent to your printer . <p> Tip : If you sell the same product at Etsy as other carts , you can add the SKU and the Listing I 'd here , and Order Desk will automatically make two duplicate products , one for Etsy and one for your other carts using your SKU . For more information on Etsy Listing IDs , please read this guide . <p> Repeat this process for each print on demand product . <p> Optional : If you prefer , you can add your print on demand items by clicking Add New Item instead . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields that might be required . <p> When adding products this way , the printsku and printurl fields need to be added to the metadata section . The item will also need a Name , a Code/SKU and the Location ( the name of the print vendor ) . <p> Once your inventory items are added , when new orders are created or downloaded , the details of each item in the order will be synced with the print details being stored in Order Desk so they are ready to be submitted to the printer . <p> If the printurl and printsku are n't automatically showing up in the metadata of the order items , which can be seen by clicking on the down arrow in the order : <p> Then check your Store Settings to make sure this setting is enabled . Click on Store Settings under the Settings Menu in the left sidebar . <p> This setting is enabled by default when print on demand integrations are added to an Order Desk account . <p> Tip : If you ever make a change to a saved inventory item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sync Item Details With Inventory button on the lower right side of the order detail page to update the metadata with the latest details . <h> Automate the Inventory Item Update Process <p> You can store your list of product names , codes , and URLs in a spreadsheet and import them periodically into Order Desk . To do this , create a spreadsheet with the following columns : <p> Once the spreadsheet is filled out , export it as CSV file ( comma-separated values ) . You will need to first create an import template for inventory items before you can upload the entire spreadsheet to Order Desk . To create the import template , you only need the first few lines of your spreadsheet filled out . You can complete the spreadsheet at a later time , if you prefer . <p> To create an import template , click on Import Data under the Tools menu in the left sidebar . <p> To build the template , choose a Name for it , select Inventory Items for Import Type and Comma for Delimiter , and then upload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , match your column names with Order Desk field names . These would be : <p> Product Name = Item Name <p> My Product SKU = Code/SKU <p> Print Code = Item Metadata <p> Print URL = Item Metadata <p> Print Company = Location <p> For Print Code and Print URL , replace the ? in metadata ? with printsku and printurl , so they specifically are : <p> metadataprintsku for Print Code <p> metadataprinturl for Print URL <p> Save your template . <p> To import your inventory items to Order Desk using your new import template , you have two options . <p> First , the custom email address at the top of the template can be used to email a . csv file to . It will automatically be processed against the template , and your items will be imported into Order Desk . <p> Second , if you go back to your Import Data page , you can now upload your completed . csv spreadsheet to the template you have just created . Choose your . csv file , click Upload and all of the items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tip : Items can be re-uploaded to Order Desk . Any listings with a matching item code will be updated with new changes . <h> Automate the Printing Submission Process <p> This step is a little involved . If you need any assistance , please contact Order Desk support , and we will be more than happy to assist . Also , do n't worry about this step until everything else is humming along nicely . Do n't read this step and give up on the whole process ! <p> Now that your printing details are being added to your incoming orders automatically , you can tell Order Desk to automatically submit your orders for fulfillment . If you sell other kinds of products that do n't get sent for on-demand printing , then we will need to split your orders . <p> If all of your orders will be fulfilled by one print on demand vendor , follow these steps to create a rule that will automatically submit orders for fulfillment . If you have more than one vendor , skip to the next section for instructions . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your account to automatically submit orders to one vendor , click on Rule Builder under Settings in the left sidebar . <p> Add a new rule for when Order is Imported , and click Continue . <p> On the next screen , click on the Select Action dropdown and choose the option to submit to your on-demand printing service . Give the rule a reference name that is easy to identify , such as " Submit orders to ( printer 's name ) " and click Add Rule . <p> Now when an order comes in , it will automatically be submitted to your print on demand provider with the print details you have already added to your inventory items in Order Desk . <h> Instructions for submitting orders to more than one vendor <p> If you only need to submit some of your orders or products for on-demand print fulfillment , you 'll need to set up an order splitting rule . This will split any on-demand products out of an order and create a new order for just those products so they can be submitted to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original order . This makes the fulfillment process much simpler and easier to manage . If you are using Shopify or BigCommerce you can setup native vendor splitting . Otherwise , read on for setting up location-based splitting . <p> There are two rules that will need to be set up for this split . The first rule will create the split , and the second rule will submit the split order for fulfillment . <p> Rule 1 : The SplitClick on Rule Builder under Settings in the left sidebar . <p> Add a new rule for when Order is Imported , and click Continue . <p> On the next screen , click on the Select Action dropdown and choose Split Order . In the box under Split Order , you 'll need to add the name of your print on demand vendor based on the name you put as the Location for your inventory items . For this example , we 'll use MWW , but replace MWW with your Location if something different . Add : <p> **32;353;TOOLONG <p> to the box to tell Order Desk what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule . <p> Rule #2 : The Submit Now create a second rule , this time where the event is Order is Split and click Continue . <p> On the next screen , click Add a Condition . In the Select Field dropdown , choose If Order Metadata Field , change the = to " like " and the value should be splittitleYour Fulfillment Service , MWW in our example . In the Select Action dropdown , choose Submit to Your Fulfillment Service . Give the rule a reference name that is easy to identify , such as " Submit to ( printer 's name ) " and click Add Rule . <p> This is how the rule should look : <p> With this rule enabled , Order Desk will only run this rule if the split order has matching items in it . If an order only had matching items and did n't need to be split , it will still match . All orders containing products to be sent to MWW ( or the location you 've added in the rules ) will be split if necessary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up vendor splitting with BigCommerce or Shopify , you will hook the submission rule up to the Order Imported action since those orders are imported without an actual split event . <h> Conclusion <p> After finishing your setup , it 's a good idea to test everything to make sure it is working as expected . We recommend closely watching your orders for the first couple of weeks to make sure they are submitting without any problems . After that , it 's best to continue to monitor them for any issues that might arise . <p> If you complete this setup by yourself , feel free to contact Order Desk support to take a look and make sure everything is set up correctly . We will be happy to take a look at your account . 
@@23739650 @3739650/ <h> Common FBA Submission Errors <h> Amazon FBA <p> This guide covers common errors when submitting orders to Amazon FBA . For errors that come from other fulfillment services or general errors that can occur with different integrations , please refer back to the main Common Errors guide . <p> When Amazon FBA wo n't accept an order , check two places for a little more information . First , scroll down to the Order History near the bottom of the page and read the error message . Second , click on the Amazon FBA Preview button , located just under the pricing information on the right side of the order page : <p> What it means : This error usually means that the shipping address on the order does not match the FBA region the order is being submitted to . As an example , if your FBA region is the UK and the shipping address is in the US , FBA will not accept the order because each region ships only within the same region , with few exceptions . <p> What caused it : The shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or your FBA account settings . <p> How to fix it : Copy the order to another Order Desk account where the proper FBA region is connected . It can then be submitted and fulfilled by a warehouse in the right region . Each Order Desk account can only integrate with one FBA region , so a separate account will be needed if you work with more than one FBA region . For more information on copying orders to a different store , please see this guide . <p> Alternatively , if the shipping address on the order matches the FBA region and the error is more specific , such as : <p> Value FRA for parameter CountryCode is invalid . Reason : InvalidValue . <p> then double check that the country code in the shipping address is correct , since a typo or error in the country code can also cause this type of message from FBA . In this specific case , FBA did n't recognize FRA as a valid country code . When the shipping address was changed to use FR instead , FBA accepted and fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship internationally if you have export enabled with them , however they will typically only ship media items . If any other items are included in the order , they wo n't accept the order . Contact FBA for more details about what international shipping might be available for the regions you use . <p> Tip : If you believe everything is set up properly to ship internationally and FBA is still not accepting the order , please contact Amazon FBA for support . Order Desk can not make FBA accept an order , we can only help troubleshoot possible causes FBA wo n't accept it and suggest possible fixes . <p> What it means : FBA does n't see any items in the order . Click the Amazon FBA Preview button for more info , specifically : " No items found to send . " <p> What caused it : Some or all of the items in the order do not have a SKU . Even if the product names are included in the order , without a SKU , FBA wo n't know what items they are supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included , they send the error that no items were found . <p> How to fix it : Click on the Item Name and add the SKU . Then resubmit the order to FBA : <p> FYI : It is good practice to use SKUs , or item codes , for your products . With most shopping carts , you can create your own SKUs and use them for internal record keeping purposes or for sharing details with other parties . Sometimes you 'll need to use a SKU that has already been created or that is unique to the platform you are using . <p> Order Desk tracks items based on their SKU , and this is often how other parties , such as your fulfillment warehouse , will know what item they need to ship to your customer . Without a SKU , especially if you work with other services to fulfill your orders or track your inventory , you will come across potential errors . <p> What it means : This error could mean exactly what it says - that the SKU is incorrect . Click the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , it might actually mean that FBA does n't have any inventory in stock for that SKU , which is why the SKU is considered invalid . The FBA Preview can give you more insight into why FBA is rejecting the order . <p> What caused it : FBA either does n't recognize the SKU or they do n't have any inventory in stock for that particular SKU . <p> How to fix it : Double check that your SKU is correct . If it is n't correct , click on the Item Name and edit the SKU , then resubmit to FBA . If it is correct and the inventory is out of stock or another message is displayed on the preview , contact FBA to address the issue . <p> FYI : In some cases , you may have a different SKU in your shopping cart than what FBA has for the item . If this is your situation , you have a couple options for automatically switching the SKUs as orders are downloaded to Order Desk . Please refer to this guide on matching Shopify to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than Shopify as well . ) <p> 4 <h> This delivery option is not available for this address . Please adjust and try again . <p> What it means : Click the Amazon FBA Preview button for more information . Typically it will say DeliverySLAUnavailable for one or two of the three FBA shipping methods ( Standard , Priority , Expedited ) : <p> This means that FBA is unable to ship to the address in the order using the shipping methods listed . <p> What caused it : This can either be caused by the order using a shipping method that FBA does n't support for the shipping address or there is an error with the address itself . <p> How to fix it : Check that the address is accurate . If it is , change the shipping method and resubmit the order to FBA . If neither of these resolve the issue , contact FBA for more help . <p> What it means : This error , or anything similar to it with a long string of technical text , is sometimes just a temporary error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , click the Amazon FBA Preview button for more information from FBA . When it does n't resubmit , it tends to be an error with the shipping method and/or shipping address . <p> What caused it : Sometimes there is an interruption in the connection between services which can occasionally cause an error like this to happen when an order is being submitted . If it turns out to be the shipping method or address error instead , it will likely mean that either FBA wo n't use the shipping method on the order for the shipping address or the shipping address has a country or state/province code that FBA does n't like or recognize . <p> How to fix it : Wait a couple of minutes and resubmit the order . If it was temporary , the order should submit the second time without any issues . If the order does n't submit the second time , click the Amazon FBA Preview button for more information . <p> If the preview info from FBA comes back with shipping methods listed , check to make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information in FBA 's preview . Change the shipping method on the order if there is a conflict and resubmit . <p> If neither of the above happen , check that the shipping address does n't have anything abnormal in it , such as a international province code that seems unnecessary . <p> If the preview gives a different message or you are unable to figure it out , contact Order Desk or Amazon FBA for assistance . We are happy to take a look to see if we notice anything that is off about the order , but will typically still advise speaking to FBA for specifics as this is their error message . <p> 6 <h> Value for parameter SellerId is invalid . Reason : InvalidValue . <p> What it means : Click on the Amazon FBA Preview button for more information .

As an example , if you need to replace a SKU , the Field Name to Target should be " code " , then put the SKU from your order(s) first followed by = and the SKU you need to replace it with , one per line : <p> When you export using this filter , where the SKU is hoth4595 in an order : <p> The SKU will have been replaced in the exported file based on the filter , as seen here : <p> For another example , if the shipping method on the order is " Standard Carrier " : <p> But the exported file needs to specify what that method is , using the Search &amp; Replace filter is a quick way to edit those details in the export without changing the order itself . <p> With this filter , your export will reflect the replacement value : <h> Date Format <p> Date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your orders . <p> Where the orders in this example have the default date format ( Y-m-d H:i:s ) : <p> This example filter , set to d-F-Y , changes the date format in the exported file : <p> Tip : Order Desk uses PHP for the date formats . For a reference on what can be used to change the format of dates within Order Desk , see this page . <h> Skip Line <p> Skip Line allows you to remove lines from the export file . This let 's you exclude specific lines from a field that you otherwise want added to your export template . For instance , if you want to export all of your Closed orders but leave out a specific SKU , you can target the code field name and enter the SKU you want left out in the value box . <p> This could also be useful if you want to exclude a shipping country on an export : <p> Or a specific type of item based on the product name : <p> As an example , let 's say you want to export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific folder . " Folder Name " must be a field added to the export template in order to skip one of your folders in the exported file . To skip all the orders in one folder , target the foldername field , select Skip Line and add the name of the folder you want to skip as the value . In this example , we 'll be skipping the folder named " Skip " : <p> When exporting this group of orders , notice the two orders in the Skip folder : <p> The orders in the Skip folder will not be included in the exported file :

These errors can be ambiguous and difficult to understand , making it hard to know what to fix for everything to work as expected . <p> If you have an order that does n't seem to be submitting , you can find the error message by scrolling down to the Order History section near the bottom of the order page : <p> This guide will go over some of the common errors that show up in Order Desk , what they mean and how to fix them . When in doubt , contact your fulfillment service or the integration throwing the error for help regarding the meaning of the error and contact Order Desk Support for help with fixing the error or resubmitting an order . <p> Please keep in mind that Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart and your fulfillment service . When you receive an error message , especially with an order that did n't submit for fulfillment , this is typically a message that Order Desk is relaying to you directly from the the integrated service - not an error with or from Order Desk itself . If an error does n't make sense and you believe that everything is accurate about the order , contact the company the error is coming from to find out more . <p> Tip : We will update this guide as we see new errors and learn their meaning . If you have an error you do n't see on here and need more help , contact Order Desk support , though we may have you contact the integrated service for more clarification on the specific issue . <h> Common Fulfillment by Amazon ( FBA ) Errors <p> For a list of common FBA errors , please click through to the expanded guide here . <h> Common Dubow Textile Errors <h> Order Could Not Be Submitted to Dubow Textiles : A ProductName was given without a Mill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely one of the variations on an item in the order is n't matched to Dubow 's name for the variation . <p> What caused it : When the variation on the item does n't match Dubow 's name for that variation ( for instance , the color is written down slightly different , i.e. : grey vs gray ) , Dubow wo n't recognize the item and wo n't accept the order . <p> How to fix it : Double check that the variations match Dubow 's variation names exactly . If they do n't , edit the item(s) in the order and resubmit . <p> 2 <h> Order Could Not Be Submitted to Dubow Textiles : Customer does not have rights to DesignID <p> What it means : Dubow does n't recognize the DesignID on the order . <p> What caused it : This error can actually be caused by a temporary glitch . If you get this error , wait a few seconds then try to re-submit the order . <p> How to fix it : If resubmitting the order does n't resolve the problem , contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd they provided . <h> Common WooCommerce Errors <h> WooCommerce Set Order Status Failed : Missing parameter data <p> What it means : Something is blocking the way Order Desk and WooCommerce communicate with each other , preventing necessary data from passing through the API . <p> What caused it : This error typically means one of two things : either there is a plugin being used in the WooCommerce store that is interfering with the way data is pushed and pulled through the API , or a firewall is blocking the way Order Desk needs to communicate with the cart . In both cases , this is an issue on the WooCommerce side that needs to be addressed and can not be fixed from within Order Desk . <p> How to fix it : This requires checking in WooCommerce for any analytics or security plugins that may be interfering with connection or checking that there is n't a firewall blocking Order Desk . Please refer to this doc for the most current Order Desk IP addresses that should be whitelisted in the case of a firewall issue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either your host or a professional developer , and is out of the realm of support Order Desk is able to provide . <h> Order Not Submitted to MWW Because All Order Items Were Skipped <p> What it means : MWW does n't know enough about the items in the order to be able to fulfill the order . <p> What caused it : For MWW to fulfill an order , they need two important details for each item in the order : the printsku and the printurl . If either of these are missing , they will not be able to accept the order . The printsku is theirSKU ( or product code ) for the product that was ordered , and the printurl is your print file for that item using their template for the product . Sending them your own product name or SKU will not be enough information for them to know what you need printed . <p> How to fix it : The quickest way to fix this is to click on the Item Name in the order and add two variations , one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Value field for these variations , add MWW 's SKU and a direct link ( the URL ) to your print file : <p> FYI : If you need more information on how to set up your Order Desk account and submit orders to MWW , this Print on Demand Fulfillment guide provides a thorough walkthrough and explanation of all the steps necessary to eventually make this automatic , so you wo n't need to add variations to each order item before submitting to MWW . <p> 2 <h> Order Could Not Be Submitted to MWW : There was an error submitting order information to MWW : String or binary data would be truncated . The statement has been terminated . <p> What it means : The order ca n't pass through to MWW because one or more of the fields is wrong . <p> What caused it : Take a look at the item(s) in the order , specifically at the print details . The printsku should be MWW 's product code for the item and the printurl should be the link to your artwork file . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the url are switched , where printsku has the link to the artwork file and printurl has MWW 's product code . It 's very easy to miss this mistake , but very easy to fix it as well ! <p> How to fix it : There are a few ways to fix this , depending on where the print details are saved . If they are variations on the item , go into the item in the order and swap the variation field names for printsku and printurl , then resubmit the order . If , however , the inventory item in Order Desk is saved with the wrong metadata fields , make sure to go into that inventory item and swap them and re-save it . You will still need to go into the order item and edit that as well . Since the metadata is saved to the order , you can add variations for printsku and printurl instead , which will override the metadata fields , and then submit the order to MWW . <p> What it means : Once an order has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it wo n't be able to be submitted again . <p> What caused it : The fulfillment service will see the exact same order number as an order they have already fulfilled or that was canceled , and they ca n't re-process the same order . <p> How to fix it : The quickest way to fix this is to change the order number and resubmit the order . To do this , click on the Edit Order Details button and add a -x to the end of the order number : <p> Save your changes and manually resubmit the order to your fulfillment service . <p> 2 <h> Error : Order Item : Could not find part number " xxx " ! <p> What it means and how to fix it : With print on demand integrations , you may occasionally get an error that the order was n't submitted because a part number ca n't be found . If you check that the part number is accurate , try to resubmit the order to make sure it was n't a temporary glitch . <p> If you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that the print on demand provider needs to double check their own records to make sure the part number is in their system . In this event , please contact your printer to ensure they have added the accurate part number to their system and resubmit the order after you receive confirmation from them . <p> What it means and how to fix it : The Order I 'd might actually not be empty , but there is a problem with the Order Number that wo n't let the order submit . Check for any special characters ( such as " &amp; " ) in your Order Number and remove them . These characters can cause an error with the Order I 'd when it passes through the API to certain integrations . Once removed , try to resubmit the order . If you continue to get an error message , contact Order Desk Support for more help .

One important factor in this process is making sure the shipping method on the order , as it comes from your cart , matches the shipping methods used by your fulfillment service or warehouse . <p> Because every integration is slightly different , and shopping carts and fulfillment services often have their own unique nomenclature for certain shipping methods , Order Desk has a Shipping Class Match function on several shipping , fulfillment and print on demand integrations that will allow you to match the name of your cart 's shipping method to the correct shipping method with your fulfillment service if it uses a different name or you do n't already have a default shipping method set with them . <p> This guide will go over how to make sure your shipping methods are set up in Order Desk so orders can be submitted automatically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your orders . <h> Shipping Class Match <p> Shipping Class Match can be found on the integration settings page for each of the integrations that has it .

Setting up this match allows Order Desk to translate any orders coming in with " UPS Ground " as the shipping method into " UPS Ground Residential " when submitted to MWW so they know what shipping method you want used for the order .

Because Etsy does not have a SKU field , Order Desk uses the Listing I 'd field as your product sku . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order Desk to control your Etsy listing stock , you can add metadata of " etsyid " to that item . <p> For example , if you have an item with a SKU of hat123 , but an Etsy listing I 'd of 123456 , you can go to the hat123 listing and add etsyid = 123456 as metadata . Conversely , if you would like to convert any Etsy imports with the listing I 'd of 123456 to hat123 ( for automated fulfillment purposes ) you can create an inventory item with 123456 as the code and add a metadata field called codereplace- with a value of hat123 . <p> If you have both 123456 and hat123 inventory items in Order Desk , the stock in hat123 will take priority- since it has an etsyid metadata field . <p> If you enable the " Set Zero-Quantity Items as Sold Out at Etsy " feature within Order Desk , we will change 0-quantity items that are currently in Active status to Sold Out status . Well also change Sold Out items with a new quantity greater than 0 to Active status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an items quantity drops below 1 , we will not update Etsy since Etsy can not except a 0-quantity update . <h> Variation SKUs <p> If you use variations for your Etsy products , you can enable the- " Append Variation Values to Item Code " feature on the Etsy settings page . This will add the alphanumeric value of each variation to your listing I 'd to give you a unique SKU for each combination . So a- hat product with a size of large and a color of red- would turn into 123456-Large-Red when downloaded to Order Desk . <h> Syncing Shipment Information <p> Order Desk can tell Etsy when a tracking number is added to a shipment . This will also trigger an email to the customer . If you add more than one tracking number to an order , the second number will not be synced to Etsy . <h> Wufoo <p> Order Desks Wufoo integration allows you to take contact forms ( or order forms ) from Wufoo and import them as orders into Order Desk for order management and fulfillment . <h> Setup <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes . After connecting , Order Desk will connect to your account and find all your forms . <h> Building Order Templates <p> The Order Desk Wufoo integration is very flexible and allows you to build a JSON template that contains the order to be imported into Order Desk . You can build a unique template for each form that you want to process . Click the " Wufoo Import Templates " link in the sidebar and you 'll see a pre-built template with all of the Order Desk fields . You 'll simply need to build out the fields you want to edit with the field names from Wufoo . Please see the sample file at the end of this document for an example of a successful order template . <h> Testing <p> Once your template has been built , find the form you want to apply the template to in the Form Setup section . Select the template and save your settings . Now that this has been saved , select your form in the testing section and press test form . The system will pull the latest entry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display the results . This will give you the opportunity to review your work and make sure the order looks correct . <h> Sample Template <p> LONG ... <h> SmartTurn <p> Order Desk can interface with the SmartTurn order fulfillment software in use by some fulfillment houses . Your orders can be submitted to SmartTurn and tracking numbers will also be pulled back into Order Desk . <h> Setup <p> Enter your SmartTurn username and password to get started . Your username is usually your email address . After entering this information , you 'll also need to enter your owner code . If you want to enter a Priority Code for your orders , you may enter it here . You can also select whether to allow partial shipments or whether to automatically send orders to SmartTurn . <h> Setting The Carrier Name <p> By default , Order Desk does n't  send a carrier name to SmartTurn . If , however , you would like it to do so , please set a default carrier name on the SmartTurn settings page . Once that is set , Order Desk will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . If the field is blank , it will use the default carrier name . You 'll likely want to use the rule builder to edit the shipping method when the order is imported . To do this , create a new rule on order import and set the action to " Filter Shipping Method " . In the box , you 'll enter your old shipping method and the new one , separated by an = sign . You can enter one on each line . Example : <p> Free Shipping = FedEx Ground Expedited Shipping = USPS Priority <h> Customize Shipping- Instructions <p> If you would like to customize some details that are sent to SmartTurn- for a particular order , set checkout data on the order . ( There is a " Set Checkout Data " rule that will allow this to be automated . ) The following checkout data fields can be set : 
@@23739669 @3739669/ <h> Working with Timestamps 27494 @qwx227494 <p> If you want to take an action on an order after a certain amount of time has passed , you 'll first need to create a rule to apply a timestamp on the order . This guide will walk you through the steps to create actions triggered by a timestamp . <p> In our example , we 'll apply a shipment timestamp . With most things in Order Desk , however , keep in mind that it can be customized to meet your specific requirements . <p> Tip : Using a timestamp to trigger an action will require an Order Desk Pro account . <h> Add Timestamp to Orders <p> Click on Rule Builder under the Settingsmenu in the left sidebar . <p> We will be creating the rule that adds the timestamp , so first , under Add New Rule , select the event you want to trigger the timestamp being created . In our example , we 'll be selecting when Shipment is Added : <p> Click Continue . <p> To add the timestamp , select Set Order Metadata Timestamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our case we 'll be using " shippedtime " , though you should set this as something that makes sense for why you are creating a timestamp . <p> Add a Reference Name for your rule so you 'll be able to easily identify it later , and make sure it is enabled so it can begin to work . Save your rule by clicking Add Rule . <p> Now , with this rule set up , when shipment info is added to an order , a " shippedtime " timestamp can be seen in the Order Metadata : <h> Create Custom Event <p> The next step is to create a custom event that will check the timestamp on your orders and trigger the action you want to happen . Creating a custom event requires an Order Desk Pro account . <p> To create a custom event , click on Create Custom Event underneath the Add New Rule section of the Rule Builder . <p> Custom Events run on specific folders , so you will need to already have created the folder and figured out the workflow and movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Select the folder you want and fill out your custom event details here : <h> Apply Action to Orders <p> The last step is to create the rule that will apply the action you want to your orders . This rule will need to run your newly created custom event on the folder you 've chosen on the schedule you 've selected , check the timestamp on the orders , and apply the action you want . This action can be to send an email to the customer , tag the order a certain color , etc . <p> When creating this rule , your custom event will show up in the events dropdown : <p> After selecting that , click Continue . <p> You 'll need to add a condition to this rule to check your timestamp and tell Order Desk when you want to trigger your action . Select If Order Metadata Field , then fill out the operator and the rest of the condition details to match your needs and settings , using this screenshot as a reference for one way to do it : <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timestamps that are 5 days old . <p> Then select your action(s) . In our example , we are sending an email to the customer and moving the order to the closed folder . <p> Give your rule a name you 'll remember , make sure it is enabled and save . <p> Now your timestamp can be used to trigger certain actions . In this example , a timestamp is created when shipment is added to an order , and after 5 days an email will be sent to the customer and the order will be moved to the Closed Folder . <p> It 's best to check back in after some time has passed to make sure your rules are working as expected . If they are not working , contact Order Desk Support for help .

Print in landscape mode and turn off the headers and footers . ( Google Chrome makes this very easy . ) <h> Insurance <h> Testing <p> If you are sending automatic shipment emails to your customers , you may want to turn that off while you are testing . You can absolutely add multiple shipments ( labels ) to each order , but when testing , for some carriers the EasyPost testing server will only return the same carrier-specific tracking number so the second testing label for each order wont be saved . If you want to save multiples you can either delete the first shipment or append something to the tracking number so that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are getting an " Authentication Failed " message when trying to purchase a label in production , you likely need to be certified by FedEx. - Here 's the process after a meter number has been assigned : <p> 1 .

Be sure that you are using a permalink method like " Post Name " and not the- " Default " option . The WooCommerce REST API requires the use of pretty- permalinks in order to be accessible . <p> If- you have iThemes Security installed , make sure that the " Filter Suspicious Query String URLs " feature is disabled . <p> If you still cant connect , please contact Order Desk support for assistance . <h> Usage <p> Once you 've connected to your store , Order Desk can download recent orders .

This will also email the customer an update . <p> Enabling the " Mark Order- Completed " option will change the status of the order to Completed when a shipment is added . You can build a rule to do this if you wish , but this is a handy shortcut . <p> Order Desk Pro users can keep their WooCommerce inventory counts synced- as well . After enabling this feature , updates to the Order Desk inventory counts will attempt to update the product inventory levels at WooCommerce . <p> You can set an automatic order prefix if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like woo . <h> Changing Order Status at WooCommerce <p> If you want Order Desk to change the order status at WooCommerce you can set up an Order Desk rule . The- rule , for example , could- target " Shipment is Added " and then update WooCommerce Order Status . <h> Stamps.com Order Export <p> Order Desk has the ability to export an XML file that easily imports into Stamps.com . <h> Setup and Usage <p> To set up your Stamps.com profile , the first thing you need to do is to export at least one order into an xml file . Save this file in the folder where you will always look for it . The download folder or desktop is fine . Then open up the Stamps.com application , click on Batch , then click Manage Data Sources and Add Source . Select XML , then type " Order Desk " for your profile name . Then browse and select the file you just exported . Review the settings and save . Now you can click Import Orders at any time and update the batch list with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order Desk to move your orders to the Prepared folder after you export them to Stamps.com . <h> Importing Tracking Numbers to Order Desk <p> After printing your postage , you can easily import all of your tracking numbers back to Order Desk . Just click the export button- and save the file as a CSV file . ( Currently , there 's a bug in the stamps.com program and the XML export does not include tracking numbers ! ) Then click Tools &gt;- Add Shipments inside of Order Desk and upload the CSV file . <h> PayPal <p> The Order Desk PayPal integration can be used to refund your payments . If PayPal is your shopping cart , you can also configure the integration to download your orders from PayPal directly into Order Desk . <h> Setup <p> To set up your PayPal integration , you will need to generate some API keys inside of your PayPal account and paste them into the Order Desk integration . <h> Importing Orders <p> If you 've enabled the PayPal Order Import feature , you 'll be able to schedule imports of your orders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your PayPal orders faster , put the provided IPN url into the IPN settings page in PayPal . Whenever the IPN hits Order Desk it will schedule an import at the next appointment run ( usually within 5 minutes ) . <p> Order Desk downloads ALL transactions from PayPal ( except transfer transactions ) . The integration saves a lot of order metadata so you may want to set up some rules based on your particular order needs . <h> BigCommerce <p> Order Desk can connect to your Bigcommerce store and import orders . Order Desk can also send shipment notices back to Bigcommerce when your orders ship . <h> Setup <p> There are two ways to connect your store . The best way is to select the Order Desk app from within your Bigcommerce admin . When you confirm the installation , Order Desk will set up an account and store for you , or if already have an account , it will simply log you in and setup the connection to your store . By setting up from within Bigcommerce , you 'll be able to access Order Desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( You can also go to Order Desk directly if you prefer . ) <h> Usage <p> Once you 've connected to your store , Order Desk will start downloading orders from the last week . You can continue to download more orders at your convenience . <h> Settings <p> If you would like to download orders automatically , please set your download interval . Order Desk Pro users who signed up with the Oauth method ( rather than the legacy API method ) will have Instant Download automatically be enabled for their account . Free users are limited to a once per day automated check . You can , however , always check for new orders manually from the integrations settings page . <p> You can set a default folder for new orders . This is especially handy when you are downloading a large number of old archive orders . <p> You can choose which orders you want Order Desk to download . By default , Completed orders will include the following statuses:Shipped , Partially Shipped , Awaiting Pickup , Awaiting Shipment , Completed , Awaiting Fulfillment . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders will be downloaded as well ( these are orders where payment has not been completed ) . Only " Incomplete " orders will be skipped ( these are orders where the checkout was never completed ) . <p> If you select the " date updated " as your import method , Order Desk will update the status of your order in Order Desk . Otherwise , orders will only be imported when they are first added . The order metadata fields " **25;415;TOOLONG " and " bigcommercecurrentstatus " will be kept up to date . You can use these fields to setup rules and manage how the orders are treated . <p> If you want to Order Desk to report tracking numbers back to Bigcommerce , you can enable the Tracking Number Sync feature . Order Desk will try to send this data back , but it may not always work . If order products have been modified or more than one tracking number has been added to a shipment , full tracking information may not be able to be synced to Bigcommerce . <p> If your store uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included with the product . Otherwise , taxes should be recorded separately ( that 's the default setting ) . <p> If you are going to use Order Desks payment refunding integrations , you will need to map your current payment method name to the processor name you are planning to use . Your method name might be something like " Credit Card " , " Visa , Mastercard " , or " Payment Card " . Acceptable payment processor names are : <p> Stripe <p> Authorize.net <p> Virtual Merchant <p> Quantum Gateway <p> Network Merchants ( for NMI ) <p> Litle <p> eProcessing Network <p> Emerio Payments <p> BluePay <p> SecureNet <p> Its important that these names match up exactly so that Order Desk can enable the payment refunding services on appropriate orders . If you are using PayPal in addition to a credit card processor , as long as it is named PayPal , it should match up with no problem . <p> If you want to add a prefix to your orders , you may set this up here . Do n't  use only- a umber as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " US " are all acceptable prefix styles . <h> Vendor- Splitting <p> If your fulfillment process requires split fulfillment by different vendors , Order Desk can help this process by automatically splitting your orders as they come in to Order Desk. - When you enter the tracking number for one order , it will only full the items that were on that particular order and will leave the other items as unfilled . In order to use this functionality , you need to enable the Vendor Splitting option on the Bigcommerce settings page inside of Order Desk and you also need to put the name of the vendor in each products Bin Picking Number field at Bigcommerce . This field can be found- under the Other Details tab . If you are already using the bin picking number field , you can enter the vendor followed by a dash , then the existing bin picking number . Order Desk will use the code the left of the dash as the vendor and save the code to the right of the dash as your bin picking number . Orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if order 1005 comes in with items from two different vendors , it will be stored in Order Desk as 1005-1 and 1005-2 . <h> Special Notes <p> If you need detail about your customer ( like customer group ) or details about your products ( like UPC/image ) to be downloaded with your order , please let Order Desk support know so that we can enable this for your account . We require a manual activation on these features because they require extra API calls for each order/product . Usage can make- downloading orders take a bit longer .

If you want to run the import immediately , browse to the Tools &gt; View Appointments page and run the appropriate pending appointment . <h> Checking For Shipped Orders <p> Most of the shipping and fulfillment integrations can listen for shipments and report back . The system is setup to check the third party for updates to the shipped orders every 6 hours . After 50 tries ( about 12 days ) the system gives up . On the order detail page you can see how many times the order has been checked and restart the checking if it has expired . To check all pending orders immediately , you can run the shipping check appointment from the View Appointments page . <p> Create a rule to put the order in the Prepared folder when it is submitted to fulfillment and another rule to put it in Closed- when a shipment is added . <h> Customizing The Products Being Submitted <p> At the bottom of the setup page for your integration you can set some product code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes being submitted , you can use the Field Match functionality to change your product codes into others . For example , if your shopping cart had the SKU- " blueshirt6 " but your fulfillment company wanted it to be 87BL223X7m you could put this in a line in the product code match box : <p> blueshirt6 =- 87BL223X7m <p> You can even convert one code into multiple like this : <p> BUNDLECODE = PROD1CODE , PROD2CODE , PROD3CODE <p> You can skip certain products so that some product codes do n't  get submitted . Put each code to skip on its own line . <p> Some integrations support a gift message functionality . By setting a field name here , you will tell the integration to look for a checkout field with this name and if one is found , submit that value as the gift message . <h> Doing it Manually <p> Many fulfillment companies simply support receiving a CSV file . You can build a custom export according to the fulfillment houses specification and direct it to be emailed or sent via FTP when you run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking numbers automatically , but if you get that information back from the fulfillment company , you can easily edit it and paste it into the Tools &gt; Add Shipments page .

If the background is black , that indicates that the count being displayed is the number of orders found matching the current search . Clicking the folder in this case will keep the search parameters . <h> Orders and Rules <p> The default configuration has four basic states .

Some gateways support void requests and others support capturing payments from a previous authorization . Please refer to your specific integration docs for more details . <h> Issuing A Full or Partial Refund <p> If the transaction processing code matches your gateway , you 'll see a payment processing box under the order totals . The default amount shows the balance that is available for refunding at the processor . Enter the amount you want to refund ( partial refunds are okay ) and press Refund . If you only process a partial refund you can come back and do more later until the entire transaction has been refunded . <h> Voiding a Transaction <p> Some gateways support voiding a transaction . This takes place before a transaction has been settled and means that it wont show up at all on the customers credit card statement so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preferred method . You an always try voiding a transaction first and if that fails you can run a regular transaction . The void button gets automatically removed three days after the purchase . Most processors only accept full voids . <h> Capturing a Previously Authorized Transaction <p> If your original transaction was just an authorization , you can capture that authorization ( or part of the authorization ) . You cant capture more than was originally authorized . If your transactions will be coming in as authorizations and not captures , please set up your integration settings to expect this . <h> Setting Payment Details Manually <p> If you need to change the payment status manually this can be done by editing the order details and setting the payment status . More details are available by selecting the " Additional Details " link at the bottom of the window . <h> Rule Events <p> There are rule events that you can target for partial refund , full refund , payment capture , and void . <h> Posting Order Information To a Custom Script <p> One of the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order details to a third-party endpoint . This is very helpful if you are wanting to keep track of inventory or perform some custom function when something happens to an order ( when a shipment is added or its put in the Completed folder , for example ) . <h> Order Data Format <h> Testing <p> The easiest way to test this functionality and see the data returned is to setup a temporary request bin at- http : //requestb.in/ . Then setup a rule and use the testing mechanism to send some order data to this url . You can then inspect it to see exactly what you 'll be getting . To send immediately , after you perform the test , go to View Appointments and run the pending " Send Order To Website " action . If there 's an error , you 'll see the response returned . While testing , you may want to set your response status code to 400 so that you can continue to run the appointment over and over while making sure everything returns correctly . <h> Response <p> Order Desk expects your script to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your script returns a status code higher than 201 , then the post will be considered failed and will be retried up to five times over the course of a two hours . After that , you 'll have to manually retry it from the View Appointments page . <h> Security <p> Order Desk will pass in a " X-ORDER-DESK-STORE-ID " header with the I 'd of your store . You can use this to help avoid any spoofing . For extra security , set an API key ( Order Desk Pro only ) and another header will be set called " X-ORDER-DESK-HASH " . This will be an hmac encoded string of the order value being posted . here 's some sample PHP code to ensure that the posted order details came from Order Desk : <h> Setup <p> Enable the ShipStation integration from the Order Desk Integrations page ( its under the Shipping &amp; Fulfillment tab ) . Now login to your ShipStation account . Go to Settings and Create a New Store . Select " FoxyCart via Order Desk " from the list and enter the Store I 'd and Access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got it right . After that , continue setting up your store as you prefer . This is important : make sure that your " Awaiting Shipment " status is " paid " or " processing , paid " . - When completed , you can perform an import and your existing orders will be pulled from Order Desk . <p> When you add a shipment in ShipStation , a shipment will be added to the order in Order Desk . <h> Settings <p> ShipStation pulls orders from Order Desk , but if you need to have a specific order go to ShipStation you can temporarily set the import override time . After the order has been imported , remove this value so the box is blank . <p> If you only want ShipStation to pull orders from a specific folder , you can select that folder on this screen . <p> If you want ShipStation to move orders to a certain folder after they 've been imported , you can select that folder . This allows you to have an instant visual on which orders have been sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain folder after they 've been shipped , you can select that folder as well . <p> In most cases you will want to push to ShipStation based on the date that the order was placed . But in some situations you may want to send updated orders to ShipStation . If you change the import method to " When Orders Updated " , orders will be selected based on the last time a change was made to them . Keep in mind that if you do n't  change the import override time , ShipStation will request orders after the order date of the last order imported . <p> Select a " Sent to ShipStation " folder and a " Shipment Sent " folder to have a clear view of any orders which have n't yet been imported , those which are currently pending at ShipStation , and those which have been shipped .

This flexibility allows you to customize the order process to your business specific needs . <p> The rules engine works with three different concepts : events , actions , and conditionals . All rules are based around things that happen to an individual order . <h> Events <p> Events are simply times throughout the system that something happens . Examples of events are " When an Orders Folder is Changed " or " When a Shipment is Added To An Order . " <h> Actions <p> When the event is executed , the rules engine looks for actions that are connected to that event and run them . The rules engine has some actinoas that are natively built-in . Integrations can also create their own events and actions . <h> Conditionals <p> Before an action is called on an event , the rule checks to see if there were any conditionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only run if a series of conditions are met ( the total is &gt; $0 , the total order quantity is &lt; 10 , etc ) . If the conditional is returned false , the action will not be run . <h> What Are Rules ? <p> Very simply , each rule has three parts : an event , zero or more conditionals , and one or more actions . <h> Building Rules <p> To build a rule , first select an event that you want to target . Then you can add one or more conditionals . If you always want the rule to run , you do n't  have to add any conditionals . If you have multiple conditionals you can set the entire set to be either AND or OR .
