@@43167876 @3167876/ <h> Stories <h> The True Cost of Fashion <p> By Jessica Pruitt , Buffalo Exchange HQ <p> If you 're on a tight budget , you want to make sure you get the most wardrobe for your hard-earned wages . For many , that translates to a quick Forever 21 or H&amp;M trip . The true cost of fashion , however , goes far beyond the price you pay at the register . <h> Price per Wear <p> When it comes to shopping on a budget , it can be all too easy to default to fast fashion garments . Some pieces , however , are worth investing in . If you buy an $80 pair of jeans but you wear them every other day for six months , that 's less than a $1 per wear . If you buy a $30 dress and wear it once for an event , that 's $30 per wear . <p> This does n't mean you should give up your sense of fun and whimsy or turn shopping into a math equation . It just helps you figure out when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a deal . <p> Go ahead and invest in the perfect pair of jeans , leather ankle boots and your go-with-everything jacket . You do n't want these pieces to fall apart after a few wears and , if they 're truly classic styles , you may keep them forever . That wild pair of heels you 'll probably wear a couple times ? See if you can find a good deal second hand . <h> Paying for Garment Care <p> After racking up piles of dry cleaning bills or , worse , accidentally washing your $100 silk blouse in the machine , you might think twice about buying delicate fabrics . When you factor in garment care , the true cost of fashion purchases can go up . <p> If an item is 100% silk , wool or viscose , washing it in the ol ' machine will likely result in some pretty heavy shrinkage and fading . Before you buy , check the tag to see whether it 's dry clean only and be honest with yourself . If you really love it and you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then go for it ! <p> If you do purchase these items , keep in mind that manufacturers use dry clean only as a catch-all designation . Many cottons and polyesters can be washed on a cool , gentle cycle . And , if you 're willing to put in the time , some silks and wools can be washed by hand . <h> Environmental - Impact <p> Beyond your personal budget , clothing costs the environment as well . Manufacturing new garments requires a lot of water and contributes to pollution . It may be impossible to avoid buying new clothing entirely , but the more we can all recycle , the better ! <h> A Friendlier Option <p> This is where Buffalo Exchange comes in ! Recycling clothing by buying , selling and trading in our stores reduces pollution and keeps clothing out of landfills . Easy on the wallet and easy on the world ? Sounds like a no-brainer to us .

Customize this simple DIY to include a favorite team 's colors , or keep with autumnal or seasonal colors . This also makes for an excellent housewarming gift ! <p> You will need : Yarn , a small piece of cardboard , and scissors.Cost : About $5 ( again I have quite a collection of yarn ) Time : About an hour and a half <p> Step 1 : To create a loom , take the cardboard , and cut a 1/2-inch slit every 1/4 inch along the top and bottom.Step 2 : To string the loom , face the slit part of the loom vertically . Begin threading the string from the first slit directly down and then around the back and into the next slit . Carry the thread back up to the top of the loom and continue this up and down process until your loom is completely threaded.Step 3 : Begin weaving by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings of the loom , alternating directions with each new row . This is where you can make your weave your own by creating a color scheme or maybe even adding in a shape or design.Step 4 : Add some tassels by wrapping yarn around your palm about 10 times , depending on the desired thickness of the tassel . Take that loop of yarn and knot it onto the weave by looping one side of the tassel through the other . Once the tassel is adjusted to your liking , snip the bottom of the loop , and there is your fringe.Step 5 : To remove the weave from the loom , snip the strings that originally created the base of the weave and tie each string to the one next to it .

As a visual hoarder and self- proclaimed fashionista , I do these things all too often . Every now and then , however , the art geek in me screams to be appeased . I peruse an art book , a museum , a gallery . These things inspire me more than anything . The following looks were inspired by well- known painted masterpieces . <p> Starry Night by Van Gogh <p> The original : <p> A piece in oil paints , Starry Night is heavy in texture with deliberate brush strokes . Lyrical lines lend to the piece a sense of movement and the stark contrast between the rich dark hues of blue and green and the bright pale yellow of the moon make this a dynamic piece ; one instantly recognized by many . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazer that reminded me of the richness of this painting , and a pale yellow button up for a pop of dynamic color . Top it all off with a vintage embroidered tie with an ink splatter design to add some extra texture , black pants for darkness , and cuffed them at a cropped length for some extra whimsy . <p> Jackson Pollock <p> The original : <p> Pollock decided to stop naming his pieces when he felt too many people were reading too much into the meaning of their titles . A contemporary painter , Pollock was known for his large scale canvases also rich in texture , thanks to his drip painting technique . Most of his pieces were in black , white and grey , though some of them also included accents of primary color ; particularly blue and yellow . <p> The clothes : <p> Black , white and grey ink splattered skinny jeans to mimic overall look and feel , an ink splattered top in a large blousy cut , and red heels , with a blue and yellow necklace to add that pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original : <p> As an impressionist painter , Monet spent his last thirty years of his life depicting beautiful images of his own flower garden . The images were in a dreamy feminine color pallet consisting of blue-greens , purples and pale pinks . A series of impressionist style paintings , they are characterized by small , thin brush strokes , open composition , and lend the viewer a sense of passage of time . <p> The clothes : <p> The color pallet overall mimics that of the series , with a multitude of greens , purples and pink . The flowy , floral blouse reminds one of the texture and overall mood . The scarf adds depth and dimension to the outfit , and the pink jacket adds structure to the overall look . It 's feminine and dreamy , yet structured and professional . <p> Marilyn Monroe prints by Warhol <p> The original : <p> Warhol was the king of pop art .

Bright pink , orange , red , yellow and blue all seem to compete with one another , and are paired with black accessories to break up the lines . The length of the dress and the extreme plunge of the neck line add a flair of melodrama , which pair nicely with the sky high platform wedges . <p> Dancers in Pink by Degas <p> The original : <p> Degas painted many things , but most popular of his pieces , were the ones depicting ballerinas . He found beauty in the mundane , and therefore these beautiful dancers were often captured behind the scenes doing very ordinary things like lacing up their shoes , waiting in the wings of the stage , etc .

For as long as I can remember I have had a really hard time keeping plants alive . It 's not from a lack of trying , though , you guys " it 's because I care TOO much . I end up drowning them in love and way to much water . Our office in Atlanta is adorable and I did n't want to introduce fake plants into the mix unless they were amazing . After being inspired by faux-flora solutions on social media ( thanks , Tumblr ) , I decided to make some cacti . <p> First off , I used a thinner cardboard , because it was much easier to cut through . Mine came off the packaging from a build-it-yourself Swedish furniture superstore that shall remain nameless ( rhymes with Schmikea ) . I started by measuring the base of the container I chose . I decided to make the width of the cactus just a smidge smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cozy , but also still fit . After that I sketched the shape of the cactus on the cardboard with those measurements in mind . I personally love the tall ones with arms because they look like they 're waving , but you can make a tiny barrel cactus or even a prickly pear . Whatever floats your boat . I then sketched an almost identical cactus shape ( sans arms ) on more cardboard . These will eventually fit together like puzzle pieces to give your cactus dimension . <p> After cutting out both shapes , I painted them green and waited for them to dry .

While vintage band tees are no new trend , they remain sought-after pieces by devoted music fans and vintage T-shirt junkies . When we recently purchased a customer 's collection of 80s and 90s concert tees , our buyers carefully gauged their desirability and knew they would be quick sellers . <p> A variety of factors make vintage concert tees desirable . Authenticity , rarity , condition , and sentimental value can impact customer allure . Reprints of novelty band tees are easy to find and are readily available through hundreds of retailers , but genuine concert tees " the shirts once sold at major shows and tours " are far more limited . <p> Talented buyers can easily decipher an authentic concert tee from a reprint by knowing what to look for . A good place to start with any vintage tee is the tag . Labels such as Screen Stars , Springford , Fantasy , Sportswear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they went out of production by the mid-90s . Other companies like Hanes and Fruit of the Loom changed their label designs between the 80s and 90s , so certain designs can reveal when a T-shirt was produced . Tags that specify a 50/50 poly-cotton blend are more likely to be vintage as well , especially since the 100% cotton trend only recently gained traction . <p> 1990s Iron Maiden , 1990s Slayer , and 1980s Megadeth <p> After examining the tag , we look for clear copyright printing and date subscripts under the graphic . This indicates the year the tour took place and legitimizes the item as a genuine piece of memorabilia . High-resolution graphics and tour dates listed on the back of the shirt can also add value . It 's important to remember that a band 's popularity and approach to T-shirt design can impact the rarity of merchandise . For example , Iron Maiden often printed shirts that were customized for each country , state , and city they played . There is more variety among their T-shirts , but less of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Some prefer a shirt that 's clearly been rocked out in . They value the experience previous wearers of the shirt had before it came into their possession . Worn-thin material , natural distressing , DIY cutoff sleeves , and even light staining are all signifiers of a shirt long-loved , and these traits give authentic concert tees their nostalgic charm . Other collectors prefer less wear and aim to preserve their concert tees for as long as possible without wearing them . <p> 1980s The Cure , 1980s Siouxsie Sioux , and 1990s Slayer <p> Most customers of vintage band and concert tees are either rabid fans of the music , or appreciate the history and meaning behind the band tee as a fashion statement .

And right we were " it was lots of fun . <p> Afterwards , most of our bowling shirts found their way to Buffalo Exchange , including those of my teammate Hannah .

Up here in the PNW , we are mostly trying to avoid being cold &amp; combatting SAD ( seasonal affective disorder ) with retail therapy ( coffee in hand ) &amp; justifying all the cool coats &amp; sweaters we bought this winter . The kids in the University District rang in on a few staples that we think you 'll wear with anything and everything in 2013 . <p> 1 . A chunky scarf . This is a rad accessory , even if you do n't live where the climate is cold &amp; grey all the time . Let 's be real , you cool folk in LA still wear beanies with your Ray Bans &amp; sunny days . Same goes for the cowl . Neutral grey &amp; goes with everything you have . Chunky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular specimen , just perfection ! <p> 2 . A jersey dress . This slouchy , one-size-fits-all-types maxi is the dress to throw on heading out to class or to the Fremont market . It 's a blank slate to dress up or down &amp; layer over . It feels &amp; looks effortless &amp; clean . This one is American Apparel , made with their super-comf cotton blend . This works maxi or short or high-low , no sleeve , three-quarters sleeves , whatever . <p> 3 . Boots . You have no excuse not to own a pair . Leather or suede , slouchy or lace up , Justin or Frye , distressed or not , oxblood , gun metal grey or patterned Docs , thigh-highs or ankle booties , 6 inch heel or flat , we love them . Especially since we bought in these lovelies by Vera Wang . We love how they are bedazzled with jewels , but they have a little bit of cowboy in the heel &amp; buckles , &amp; a bit edgy with the textured leather . <p> 4 . A leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather jacket . You can pull one off , no matter what your style is . I am not just talking about a motorcycle jacket ( but we do like this Crooks &amp; Castles one ) . It can be feminine or punky , grungy or chic , to your taste . And faux leather literally comes in every color ; if you had your heart set on a pink one , they do exist . <p> 5 . An oversized sweater . We like the ones that have fitted arms , dropped shoulders , &amp; are a bit on the cropped side . Some of the best ones have a bigger knit , like this Ann Taylor , which has a couple cable twists in the front . But you ca n't go wrong with a boxy , cropped , boat-neck sweater , heavy or lightweight . <p> - We love these things &amp; hope you guys do too ! Here 's to hoping for many more amazing finds in 2013 !

Share your creativity with friends and party-goers rather than dying all-night in a mask . Need more convincing why masks are a bad idea for Halloween , let us share with you : <p> 1 . Safety first . <p> Masks are usually a one-size fits all deal ( I will have you know , that is a lie ) . Those eye holes will shift and obstruct your view throughout the night . You 're trying to have a GREAT time , one messy fall and Halloween 2013 could be ruined . Did we mention it 's like a hotbox under a mask ? You 're essentially suffocating yourself . <p> 2 . The gross out factor . <p> It is bad enough to get hair in your face ( long hair , do n't care ! ) , imagine having to wear an ill-fitting mask all-night and possibly into the wee hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your Halloween festivities are , it can be as equally sweaty under that mask . Also , you 're breathing HOT breath all-night . Even though it 's your breath that 's still disgusting . <p> 3 . Creep alert ! <p> How is a mask creepy ? No one knows who you are or what you 're staring at . Say you get lost or separated from your friends and another Halloween-goer is wearing the SAME mask ( because you already knew when you purchased that Scream mask that 15 other people did , too ) tags along with your friends . NO GOOD ! <p> 4 . Halloween should n't be hard work . <p> Between the battle of taking a mask off ( sweat , does n't fit right , etc. ) to the occasional face itch , it just seems like way to much work on Halloween . You should be having an awesome , carefree time . PARTY , PARTY FUN TIME ! <p> This Halloween try not being the person behind the mask .
