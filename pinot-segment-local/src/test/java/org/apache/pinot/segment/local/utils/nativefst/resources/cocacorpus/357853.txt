@@101419100 @5619100/ <h> Forged Piston Set <p> The mountune Focus RS EcoBoost forged piston set has been designed in-house by mountune Racing as a high-performance upgrade for those wanting the ultimate piston for reliable , high-power builds . <p> Featuring an enlarged 23mm gudgeon pin to address a known area of weakness , the mountune piston also inherits many of the design features that have been developed and proven in our highest performing racing engines . <p> The pistons are manufactured exclusively for mountune in the US by MAHLE Motorsport utilising its 4032 grade alloy . This alloy was chosen by mountune 's engine designers not only for its strength and durability , but also because of its high-silicone content , low-expansion properties . This means that a tighter piston to bore clearance can be used , which will result in a tighter seal and less noise when the engine is cold . <p> The forged pistons also feature a distinctive grey phosphate coating . This dry lubricant coating ( not to be confused with a thermal film coating ) provides a lubricant film in the pin bores and ring grooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; particularly useful during the initial start-up or break-in of engines to protect against galling and micro welding . <p> In addition to this , the piston skirts have also been treated with MAHLE 's patented Grafal coating to reduce drag and friction in the cylinder bore , and also help to reduce some of the noise often associated with forged pistons.
