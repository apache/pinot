Packing the right stuff for a fun-filled fest in the sand is ultra-important . Do n't get tide down ( a bit of sea-level advice ) to making a list of everything you need " just sit back and let the waves roll in while we provide you with ten essentials for Tortuga ! <p> 1 . Your coolest pair of sunnies One item to make you look instantly cool in any occasion ? The perfect pair of shades to block the bright sun from wrecking the stage view . Sunglasses , from aviators to cat-eye , can bring anyone 's festival look to the next level and leave the glares to a minimum . <p> 2 . A little bit of SPF Sorry to be the mom in this situation , but keeping your skin from a devilish-red sunburn is the only way to survive a multi-day beach fest . Whether you prefer SPF 4 or 30 , make the right choice to lather up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; trucker hats You can wear them to the side . You can slide them on top of a ponytail . They even look good worn backwards with messy hair . Snapbacks are where it 's at on the beach . Besides , what country song these days does n't involve a lyric about sporting a ball cap all day every day ? <p> 4 . Coozie coolers I like room temperature beer , said no one ever . Coozies come in all shapes and sizes to keep the drinks ice cold when the weather is burning up . Tip : the funnier the coozie , the more friends you will make . Trust us . <p> 5 . Fashionable flip-flops Word of advice : do n't be a shoobie . You know those people who wear socks with sandals like a tacky tourist ? Avoid this fashion faux pas by investing in a solid set of flip-flops . If you 're not into Rainbows or Reefs , try a cute pair of strappy sandals for easy walking in hot sand . <p> 6 . Swimsuits , swimsuits , swimsuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , do n't be afraid to bring out those bikinis and board shorts ! Wearing a swimsuit to the festival may sound bold , but just throw a vintage t-shirt or printed sundress on top for a quick and easy look .

Time to dig out those thrashed thrift-store Levi shorts once again ! If you like them high-waisted or totally faded , any pair of denims you 've got will do just the trick for looking cute and staying comfortable . <p> 8 . Beach bags are forever Let 's face it : pockets never hold enough stuff . Find a durable beach bag to store all of your festival goodies in one small tote . Mini tribal-print backpacks or 80s-inspired fanny packs work wonders in this department . <p> 9 . Take your pic ( ha ! ) : digital or disposable camera Picture or it did n't happen .
