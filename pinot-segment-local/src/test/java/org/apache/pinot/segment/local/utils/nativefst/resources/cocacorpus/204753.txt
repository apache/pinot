@@74607888 @3307888/ <h> 12 mistakes you must avoid when planning your new kitchen <p> Some of these are really basic but you would be surprised how often we see them ! <p> - <p> Free standing appliances need more depth . <p> I have seen this many times . The kitchen looks fine but free-standing washing machines and or dishwashers stick out from the line of units by around 50-75mm ( 2 to 3 inches ) . <p> If you must keep free-standing appliances the worktops need to be around 650mm deep rather than 600mm . This allows room for the pipework behind . <p> With everything in line they do n't look quite so bad , although it will still tend to look more like a utility room than a very stylish kitchen . <p> Mind you , integrated appliances look better , are n't significantly more expensive these days and contrary to popular opinion are very easy to remove if necessary ! <p> - <p> American Fridge freezers wo n't work up against a wall <p> Most American fridge freezers have a pair of wide doors which open through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to a wall you stand a good chance of not being able to open the doors or slide drawers out ! They generally need to be more than 300mm from a wall . <p> They also stick out because they are far deeper than kitchen units , so they do require a lot of space . <p> - <p> Do n't design tight against a wall <p> Walls are never straight ; they often lean in or out . An allowance must always be made for thin panels called ' fillers ' which can be scribed to the wall shape . We recommend at least 30mm at either end of a run . <p> - <p> Gas hobs near tall housings <p> There must be a gap of at least 300mm between a gas hob and a tall vertical combustible panel . This is n't just a guideline , it is law . <p> A gas fitter is not allowed to connect a gas hob if the installation does n't comply with the rules . <p> If the design just does n't have that much space an induction hob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't apply . <p> - <p> Hoods over gas hobs <p> Any cupboard or hood over a gas hob must be at least 750mm above the hob unless the hob manufacturer states a different distance . I have seen dozens of kitchen designs ignoring this basic safety rule . <p> - <p> Sink hob &amp; fridge miles away from each other <p> It is widely known that the sink fridge and hob should all be , where possible , just a few steps from each other . A triangle between the three is ideal . Anyone who has ever prepared a meal will see the sense of this . <p> There should be worktop space between the sink and hob . I have seen designs which look great but sentence the poor owner to years of endlessly walking back and forth . <p> - <p> Tiny corner fillers and drawers <p> Every time a kitchen turns a corner there has to be a ' corner filler ' . The only exception is an ' L ' shaped corner . <p> This filler needs to be wide enough such that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with handles on the other side . <p> You would be surprised how often this detail is over-looked in poor designs . <p> - <p> Building appliances in permanently <p> When a kitchen is installed , it is essential that the eventual floor height is taken into account . If the floor is to be tiled after the fit then the kitchen should be installed at the planned height plus the thickness of the tile and adhesive . <p> The same goes for wooden floors . In the worst cases , I have seen washing machines installed under the worktop and then ' trapped ' in place by a newly tiled floor ! <p> In the event that the washing machine needs maintenance or replacement , either the worktop has to come off or the floor needs to be ripped up . Not a decision you would want to have to make . <p> - <p> Not thinking about access with tall/corner housings <p> Many units come fully assembled which cuts down on installation time and cost but it pays to note how easy or difficult it might be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some flats ( especially in Brighton - normally older conversions ) where it is impossible to deliver any fully assembled corner or tall unit . <p> This is something I have seen done and the results are n't pretty . A laminate worktop has to first be cut and then re-edged where is runs around the sink . This edge is n't waterproof . <p> As soon as water makes it 's way into the chipboard core then that 's the end of your worktop as it expands and opens up ugly water absorbing cracks . <p> The only way around it if you insist on a Belfast sink and a laminate top is to sit the sink higher than the woorktop and seal the join . Wood works but needs constant oiling to avoid going grey and black . Quartz granite and Corian are the only serious options . <p> - <p> Free standing appliances behind a door <p> We are occasionally asked to fit an appliance such as a free standing washing machine behind a cupboard door . This can be done if the work top is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door in front of the machine . <p> This typically adds around 75mm to the depth increasing the cost of the worktop . Sometimes even this is n't enough as the hinge can foul the soap container which often pulls out on one side or the other . <p> The other alternative which wastes valuable space and looks lop-sided is to use a 400mm door with a 300mm dor to create a 700mm wide space . <p> So you end up with more expensive worktops and possibly unbalanced looks . This often ends up being done because ' there 's nothing wrong with it and it 's only about 8 years old ' ! Please do n't base the design around an ageing appliance ! <p> - <p> Ceiling height issue with lift up door units <p> Wall unit doors which lift up are now very popular and give the kitchen a linear look . <p> Care must be taken to ensure that sufficient height exists above the unit to allow the door to open without crashing into the ceiling . <p> This is normally around 190mm abovethe top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here at Showcase kitchens we have 25 years experience in designing kitchens .

@@74607948 @3307948/ <p> This article is intended as an overview of the contents of a Separation Agreement . If you are separating from your partner and are trying to decide whether a separation agreement is appropriate , this article will give you an idea of the practicalities of the agreement and the types of assets and responsibilities it aims to formally divide between you and your partner . <p> If you do decide that a separation agreement is for you , you are advised to seek independent legal advice in the drafting of the agreement . <p> The agreement first seeks to outline the relationship background : the names of the separating couple making the agreement , how long they 've been living together and any children of the relationship or outside of it . Fundamentally it also states the date of the separation when the agreement will come into effect . <p> In order for the agreement to be taken as binding by both yourselves and the Courts it is essential that it clearly states the principles under which you are making the agreement . This is where you acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are three basic principles that make a separation agreement likely to be upheld in court : <p> You are entering into the agreement voluntarily , neither party should feel under pressure or duress to agree to the terms , as this would imply it was not an agreement . <p> Thirdly , that both parties have made full disclosure of all their assets and responsibilities " this is essential to end up with a fair agreement . For example the terms of the agreement can be deemed as unfair if it is later discovered that one party has a financial income or burden even which they have not revealed to the other party . <p> And finally , that it is a full and final agreement where both parties accept that it encompasses all things relevant to the separation and agree on the settlements detailed within it . <p> There are some clauses which can be found throughout such an agreement which allow for variations in the agreement due to changes in circumstance , for example , what is to be done in the event of : death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or co-habitation by either party and any other significant change of circumstance , for example a change in income . <p> In order to formalise full disclosure , the agreement should include several lists or schedules detailing all assets and responsibilities , their values and other relevant details . These lists are then referred to by the various sections of the terms of the agreement that deal with different types of assets and responsibilities . <p> The Family Home : <p> The agreement should set out what is to be done with the property you have been living in . For example , you may need to take steps to sell your house or flat and divide the proceeds from the sale according to the agreement . Alternatively one party may pay the other to gain sole possession of the property , or you may wait to sell until your children have matured . The agreement also addresses how any ongoing expenses associated with the process are to be split . Tax implications are relevant where one party leaves the principal residence to live elsewhere , capital gains tax becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of an accountant in such circumstances is crucial . <p> Personal effects <p> Here you decide who keeps what , and a time-frame for collecting personal items . You also agree to care for items until they are collected . <p> Financial and business assets <p> This includes actual or potential assets and businesses . Generally this section sets out the amounts of money to be transferred in order to achieve sole ownership of assets by each party . For businesses , the party leaving the business agrees to completely disassociate themselves from the business , giving up any title , business contacts , intellectual property etc . It is very important for those who may have established a business , perhaps entirely by themselves , to note that it is nonetheless open to share/division in such a situation . <p> Maintenance payments <p> Here the agreement sets out any payments " lump sum or periodic " which will go to a partner for their maintenance and/or for that of any children . There could be a clause here which allows for inflation in living costs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their utmost to ensure they both maintain the best possible relationship with their children , for example , by agreeing to avoid criticising the other partner to the children or obstructing their relationship in any way . The time that each partner is to spend with the children can also be set out herewith . <p> Lump Sum Payment <p> Here it is agreed if there is to be a lump-sum payment to either partner : the amount , the time-frame and acknowledgement that this is a final payment. - <p> Provision for Divorce- <p> If this agreement is intended as a precursor to divorce , this section ensures that both parties agree to this intention and the time- scale for proceedings . It also states that they intend use this agreement as a basis for their divorce settlement . The Courts are always striving to reduce costs in family proceedings and minimize the use of the ever-stretched Court time . If a couple have successfully agreed to a division of their family assets and the agreement has worked well for a period of two or so years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discretion when a properly prepared separation agreement is presented to it . <p> There is no doubt the timescale for finalising financial affairs at the end of a marriage can be significantly reduced when a separation agreement has previously been drawn. - More and more people are choosing to adopt the route of obtaining a separation agreement and , whilst a gentleman 's agreement rather than something enforceable in law , the agreement tends to make each party feel more comfortable and allows for the divorce to take place when the tension has subsided a little. - <p> When you do eventually divorce , the separation agreement , if it has worked , can form the basis of the Consent Order application and the District Judge is notified of the parties ' long term agreement and the fact that it has worked well . <p> As aforementioned , a separation agreement is not binding in the same way as a commercial contract , the Court still has a complete discretion to make an order in different terms to any previous agreement. - However , when or if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge will make an order ( which will be binding of course ) in the terms of your agreement provided : <p> the agreement is fair ; <p> you both worked on the agreement without pressure and entered into it freely ; <p> it covers all your assets after full disclosure . <p> The extent to which a judge will stay with the agreement reflects the level of his acceptance of the above three points . <p> If one of you is in breach of the deed of separation and the other goes to court to enforce it , the judge will make an assessment as described above and will enforce the agreement to the extent that he feels is right . <p> Becoming the Women 's Lawyer has been my goal for several years .

Typically a day 's work ( -200 ) and around -180 to properly dispose of the old kitchen and appliances . Fridges can be taken to be disposed of by - the council free of charge if you take them yourself . If you ca n't do that any commercial organisation will be charged around -50 for disposal of one fridge and will have to pass that cost on . We often donate working appliances to charity which is better than recycling . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An average cost would be around -400 . <p> - <p> Electrical Wiring Costs <p> Wiring is an area which does require expert assessment . In all but the simplest kitchens there will be a requirement to alter wiring . Whenever a bathroom or kitchen is re-modelled there are normally changes made to the lighting or the power circuits to suit the new layout . <p> What many people fail to realise is that there can be additional costs over and above the immediate work in the kitchen or bathroom . <p> Since August 2008 ( in the UK ) whenever an electrician makes any changes to circuits in a kitchen or bathroom he/she must bring the installation up to the latest standards . This means that all circuits ( including lighting ) in a kitchen or bathroom MUST be protected by and RCD or RCCB ( same thing ) . So if your electrics have n't had any work since 2008 there may be additional work needed . If you have a fuse box with wired fuses you certainly will need additional work . <p> Electrical costs can vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing installation and the extent of changes required to supply appliances and lighting . <p> - <p> Kitchen Units Costs <p> The cost of the kitchen units themselves might typically be between -3000 and -7000 for an average sized kitchen but of course it does depend upon the style , the finish and the features . Handle-less kitchens cost more as do wall units with lift-up doors . Drawer packs always cost much more than the equivalent cupboards . So the design has a strong bearing on the eventual cost and we always bear budgets in mind when designing . <p> - <p> Kitchen Worktop Choices <p> Worktop choices have a big impact upon the overall cost . Laminate worktops are the cheapest but these days you can choose from solid surface worktops , quartz worktops , granite , glass , concrete , timber or Corian . So in a typical kitchen the worktops can cost from -300 to several thousands . It all depends upon the choices you make . <p> - <p> Appliances and White Goods <p> Then there are the appliances .

You can also choose coffee machines , warming drawers , boiling water taps , wine coolers , microwaves , combi microwaves , steam ovens , - fridges , freezers , American fridges , - and waste disposals . - So these can ( once again ) cost from perhaps a few hundred to several - thousands . There has never been more choice but that makes it difficult to come up with a meaningful guess . <p> - <p> Flooring <p> Flooring is another area to consider .
