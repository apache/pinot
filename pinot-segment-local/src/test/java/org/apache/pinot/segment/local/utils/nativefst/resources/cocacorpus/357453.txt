Kidney disease is increasingly becoming a health problem that affects more than 20 million people only in the United States . <p> The importance of the kidneys <p> The kidneys play huge role in maintaining your general health and wellbeing . Kidneys perform quite a few vital functions in the body : <p> Waste excretion : - they filter out the toxins , excess salts , and urea , the nitrogen-based waste created by cell metabolism . Urea is synthesized in the liver and then transported through the blood to the kidneys for its removal . <p> Water level balancing : - Kidneys are essential for the chemical breakdown of urine and they react to the changes in the body 's water level during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly adjust and leave the water in the body instead of helping excrete it . <p> Red blood cell regulation : - When the kidneys are not getting enough oxygen , they are sending out a distress call in the form of erythropoietin , the hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells . <p> Blood pressure regulation : - The kidneys require constant pressure to filter the blood , therefore when it drops too low , the kidneys increase the pressure . <p> Acid regulation : - When the cells metabolize , they produce acids . The kidneys keep a healthy balance of these chemicals . <p> What causes the kidney disease ? <p> Kidney disease might be caused by many factors among which an infection , diabetes and hypertension .

This is among the reasons why just 10% of people with chronic kidney disease know that they have it . <p> In addition , the kidneys might easily adapt to the infection as they lose their function . <p> These are some of the initial symptoms and signs of kidney failure : <p> Sleeping issues <p> Fatigue and lack of strength <p> Changes in urine color ( for example , blood in the urine or frequent urination ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental clarity <p> Loss of appetite and metallic taste in the mouth <p> Hiccups <p> Swollen legs or feet <p> Pain in the back , just above the waist ( where the kidneys are ) <p> Poor circulation <p> Muscle cramps <p> Skin rash or chronic tingling <p> Loss of breath <p> It 's of essential importance to be able to recognize the early signs of kidney failure because leaving these signs undetected or untreated at the early stage can do more damage later on . <p> If you experience any of these symptoms , you have to visit a doctor immediately , because the sooner you address this problem , the better . <p> Smoking and drinking has to be avoided by all means as these habits severely compromise the health of your kidneys . <p> Regular exercise is also very important .
