@@107579416 @2979416/ <h> Ask Paul : 1st Edition : What are home automation protocols and which ones does Nexia support ? <h> Tips &amp; Ticks , Technology <p> There is a lot written about smart home protocols in the media and many companies are fighting for a slice of the market , but the reality is probably a bit simpler than the hype . - A simple way to describe a protocol is that its the language the products speak to each other . Common home automation protocols are Wi-Fi , Z-Wave , ZigBee , Bluetooth and the list goes on . - Several companies have even created their own protocols that only work with their proprietary products . - Nexia now supports 10 different protocols , yet- 90% of the approximate 400 compatible devices use Z-Wave , - which has proven to be the most- dominant in the connected home market . <h> What exactly is Z-Wave ? <p> Z-Wave has become the market leader by defining the language and the specific commands that each type of device uses to communicate . Then , it forms a network in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have to be in direct range of the bridge , aka hub or gateway . The industry calls it a mesh network and it allows each Z-Wave device added to the network to increase the strength of the network . This means the more Z-Wave devices connected in your home , the stronger the signal and the better the performance . With the Z-Wave common language defined , hardware manufacturers only need to make one version of their device and software developers like Nexia only have to integrate the device type , not every specific device . Z-Wave is n't perfect for everything , that 's why Nexia supports nine other protocols and will continue to add more .
