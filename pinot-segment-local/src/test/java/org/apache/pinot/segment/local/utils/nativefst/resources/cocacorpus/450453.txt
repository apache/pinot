At different times of life , and in different family situations , different things are important . When creating or reviewing a benefit package , employers need to consider the demographic of their workforce and employees need to think about whether the benefits they have are the right ones for them . <p> Here are some of the most common employee benefits , in plain English . <h> BENEFITS THAT PROVIDE FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK before reaching state pension age ( Source : DWP ) <h> Pension <p> This is a vehicle for setting aside some of an employee 's income for retirement . There are several types . Most pensions these days are ' defined contribution ' pensions . In this type of pension , an employee and their employer each put a set amount of money into the pension account each year . The value of the pension when the employee retires depends on what they 've put in . Once they retire , the employee then has a pot of cash which they can use to buy themselves an annual income ( like an annuity ) . <p> The main reason for getting a pension through work is that the employer will often contribute too . <p> The second type of pension is a ' defined benefit pension ' , and it 's becoming much less common in private sector companies .

There 's more information at www.nestpensions.org.uk <h> BENEFITS THAT SAVE FOR THE FUTURE <h> Share Schemes <p> There are lots of different types of share schemes . They usually involve employers giving their employees free shares in the company , or matching any shares that they buy in the company with the same number of free ones . Schemes can be limited to certain levels of employee , or require a certain number of years of service . <h> Workplace ISA <p> More and more businesses are offering extra opportunities for employees to save or invest money through their workplace - above and beyond traditional methods like the company pension scheme . <p> An ISA through the workplace typically allows employees to contribute to a stocks and shares ISA investment direct from their salary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy extra cost savings such as lower or no management fees , start-up charges or fund switching free of charge . <h> BENEFITS THAT PROVIDE FOR ILLNESS OR INJURY <p> Each year 300,000 people leave work due to illness and injury ( Source : DWP ) <h> Sick Pay <p> Most employees are entitled to -88.45 a week ( 2015- 2016 ) after their first 4 days off sick . It 's called Statutory Sick Pay , and covers them for their first 6 months off because of illness or injury . Employers sometimes offer more sick pay than this ( it 's often called Occupational Sick Pay - OSP ) , or offer employees cover for a longer period . It 's worth an employee finding out how much they 'd be paid , and how long for , because it 'll help them decide which other sorts of cover they might need . <p> Sick Pay Insurance provides short-term financial support for sickness absence . It can start from as little as one week 's absence and generally pays out for up to one year 's absence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage of an employee 's salary each month ( typically 60-80% ) as a regular income , if they ca n't work due to a long-term illness or injury . Getting Income Protection through an employer ( it 's called Group Income Protection ) will often mean that medical conditions that an employee has prior to the policy are covered . It 's also often a lower cost for an employer than if an employee took out a similar policy themselves because the chance of someone claiming is spread across all those covered . <p> Income Protection policies can be set up in different ways by an employer . Usually , they 're set up so that payments start once Statutory Sick Pay or Occupational Sick Pay end . Most Income Protection policies start after 6 months off work . The payments continue until either the employee goes back to work , or reaches the retirement age given in the policy . Some policies have a ' limited term ' which means they only pay out up to a set time " say 2 , 3 or 5 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Medical Insurance ( PMI ) <p> Private Medical Insurance pays for the cost of private treatment for medical problems . It does n't cover every medical condition , so it 's important for employees to check the policy details to see what 's covered . Employers decide which pre-existing conditions are covered . PMI pays for the costs of treatment : it does n't help supplement an employee 's income while they 're off work . It 's also a taxable benefit . <h> Dental and Optical insurance : <p> These are a bit like PMI , but more specific . Typically , corporate dental insurance covers the cost of routine NHS treatments like examinations , hygienists , fillings , crowns etc. as well as injuries and accidents - anywhere in the world . It also contributes towards the cost of more expensive treatments such as implants and child orthodontics . <p> Optical insurance helps pay for eye tests , glasses and contact lenses , and often pays out a lump sum in the event of accidental and permanent sight loss . Cover for both can normally be extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance pays towards the cost of private treatment up to a set limit . <h> Critical Illness Insurance ( CII ) <p> Critical Illness Insurance means an employee will get a tax-free lump sum if they 're diagnosed with one of a number of specific medical conditions ( the insurance company will have a list of exactly which medical conditions the policy will pay out for ) . To get the payout , the employee needs to have one of the conditions on the list , and they usually have to survive for a minimum period of time once they 're diagnosed ( usually between 14 and 28 days ) . <h> Health Screening <p> Health screening provides a regular health check . This usually involves a physical examination to identify any current conditions an employee might not be aware of , but will also involve questions to help work out which diseases they may be at risk of , and how they can improve their health by changing their lifestyle . <h> BENEFITS THAT PROVIDE FOR DEATH <h> Life Insurance <p> Life Insurance ( also called Death in Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to provide support for the people who depend on them financially ( like their partner or children ) . It 's often calculated as a certain number of times their salary , so if they earned -25,000 and had a ' 4 times salary ' policy , their dependants would get -100,000 . <h> OTHER MONEY-SAVING BENEFITS <h> Childcare Vouchers <p> Childcare vouchers are taken out of an employee 's salary before tax and National Insurance through something called ' salary sacrifice ' . That means that where they could have , for example , -700 in their pay cheque over the year , they can choose to get -1,000 of vouchers instead ( though the exact amounts will depend on how much tax they pay ) . These vouchers can be used to pay for nursery , preschool , a nanny or a childminder up until a child 's 15th birthday . <h> Car Allowance <p> A car allowance means that an employee gets an extra payment to allow them to buy a car for their work .

You pay a monthly premium and if an employee goes off sick the insurance will supplement SSP and pay employees a percentage of their salary for a set period . <p> One of the main benefits of covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the costs are predictable and can be budgeted for effectively . <h> TYPES OF SICK PAY <p> There are two types of sick pay : Statutory Sick Pay ( SSP ) , which employers are legally obliged to pay to qualifying employees and Occupational Sick Pay ( OSP ) , which is an employers ' own scheme and more generous than the legal minimum <h> Statutory sick pay <p> Statutory Sick Pay ( SSP ) is the minimum amount you must pay workers when they are off sick . <p> You . All employers must pay Statutory Sick Pay for their workers . Previously , you could recover some SSP costs if you paid a certain amount out in a month under the Percentage Threshold Scheme . However , the scheme was scrapped in 2014 and funding was diverted into schemes which help employees on long-term sick return to work quicker . <p> When do you start paying SSP ? <p> SSP kicks in on the fourth day in a row that a member of staff is off sick " known as the qualifying day ' . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of sickness " these are known as waiting days ' . <p> When do you stop paying SSP ? <p> Typically you stop paying Statutory Sick Pay when the employee returns to work . However , if someone is off on long-term sick , SSP stops after 28 weeks absence . <p> SSP also stops if employees have had linked periods of sickness , separated by less than 8 weeks , which have lasted for longer than 3 years . <h> Occupational sick pay <p> Occupational sick pay , also known as company sick pay and contractual sick pay , is your own sick pay scheme which goes above and beyond SSP . <p> You might ask why you 'd pay more than you have to , especially given that sick pay places a significant financial burden on employers . However , many employers consider company sick pay a really great investment and a valuable part of their benefits package . <p> Like any staff benefit it can help you attract and retain the best workers , boost employee morale and productivity and increase staff loyalty . <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on SSP for several months , so they see sick pay as an important issue . <p> How much is occupational sick pay ? <p> That 's completely up to you " you can choose to add on a little bit extra , like paying workers for the first 3 days before SSP kicks in or topping them up by -50 a week . Or you can go the whole hog and promise to pay workers full salaries for a set period of time . The only rule is that your company sick pay ca n't be less than SSP . <p> Who is eligible for company sick pay ? <p> Again , it 's up to you to set the rules . You may want to open company sick pay to everyone from day 1 or have it as an extra perk for people who 've worked for the company for a certain period . Remember , you have to pay SSP for any employees who do n't qualify for your company sick pay . <p> With company sick pay , you can use your discretion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't technically qualify for sick pay under your company rules . However , be careful , as you can open yourself up to discrimination claims if you treat employees significantly different . <p> Who pays company sick pay ? <p> You pay any company sick pay , so it 's important to think carefully about how much you can afford before setting up your policy . <p> Would it cause major financial problems if you had 2 or 3 members of staff on long-term sick , for example ? Remember , there are numerous costs related to employee sickness , including providing cover and indirect costs such as loss of productivity to consider , as well as sick pay . <p> Anything else ? <p> If you run your own company sick pay scheme and workers are entitled to sick pay that is equal to or more than SSP you can opt out of the SSP scheme . However , you must ensure you keep basic sick records . <h> SETTING OUT YOUR SICK PAY POLICY <p> Whether you are paying SSP or have your own company sick pay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they stand . <p> Details of your employees ' sick pay entitlement , whether that 's SSP or company sick pay , should be set out in their written statement of employment particulars . <p> You also need to outline how employers should tell you they are sick . For example , do they need to call before a certain time in the morning ? <p> If you offer a company sick pay scheme it 's important that you outline : <p> How many days company sick pay people are entitled to . <p> Who qualifies for company sick pay , i.e. do people have to have passed their probationary period or worked for you a certain number of years to qualify . <p> Any situations when employees might not be entitled to company sick pay , i.e. if they are off work because they were injured playing a risky sport . <p> If you offer company sick pay , it 's a good idea to make it discretionary " this gives you the freedom to be flexible .

Wholly committing to company sick pay which is very generous to employees can also work out very expensive . <p> If your policy is discretionary , it is important that you act consistently and fairly towards all employees . <h> KEEPING SICKNESS RECORDS <p> So that you can prove employees are getting their proper SSP entitlement , it is important that you keep records of all employee sickness which lasts more than 4 days in a row and all payments of SSP . <p> Employers who have fully opted out of SSP must keep records of dates of employee sickness lasting more than 4 days and all payments of company sick pay . <p> This allows HMRC to check that all employees are receiving the correct sick pay they are entitled to .

This is not simply because it 's the right thing to do ' , but because recognising , valuing , improving and protecting mental wellbeing in the workplace makes good business sense . <p> The modern workplace can be stressful . Our always on ' society means it can be hard for people to switch off " even when at home . <p> People with mental health problems made up an estimated 15.9% of those in employment in 20152 , and yet people are reluctant to discuss mental health issues with either their colleagues or managers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports their mental health3 . <p> In 2014 , 4 in 10 workers experienced a mental health problem , but kept it from their employer4 . <p> 1 in 5 people have taken a day off work due to stress and more than 1 in 10 people have resigned from a job due to stress5 . <p> Clearly , the number of people simply surviving and not thriving is still far too high . And this can impact not only their long-term mental health but also your business . <h> Thriving not just surviving <p> But it does n't have to be that way " in fact the opposite can be true . People with mental health issues can still thrive in the workplace with the right support and resources in place . <p> Research from the Mental Health Foundation estimates that the output of people with common mental health problems in the workplace is nine times more than the cost of mental health problems to economic output - -226 billion to -25 billion6 . <p> The report found that : <p> 47% rate employment as very important to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> 12% either said it was not very important ( 8% ) or not important at all ( 4% ) . <p> The report added that people with mental health problems felt returning to work following absence or periods of being unwell was necessary and beneficial for their own wellbeing . <p> Clearly , creating an atmosphere that supports colleagues and staff 's mental health is an important part of today 's workplace . <h> Warning signs <p> One way to help people thrive in the workplace is to spot the warning signs of mental health before they become a bigger issue . <p> Most people show signs of stress at work occasionally " but if people are stressed out most or all of the time , it can take a serious toll on their mental health . <p> According to **25;55;TOOLONG , there are some key early warning signs to watch out for which could indicate an emerging mental health problem7 : <p> But even if you know what signs to look out for , monitoring staff 's behaviour can be difficult , especially if you 're busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pick up any tell-tale signs that someone is struggling . <p> This can involve : <p> Having regular reviews and appraisals with staff to check in with them and give them the opportunity to air any concerns or issues they may be facing . 1 in 4 people did n't disclose a mental health problem as they felt there was n't support or guidance for doing so8 . <p> Fostering a culture of openness within the workplace as a whole , so staff feel comfortable talking about personal issues . 84% had a mainly positive or neutral experience when disclosing mental health issues to employers9 . <p> Getting staff to fill in health check questionnaires on a regular basis , to help monitor their health and wellbeing .

Training on issues such as time management and stress-handling techniques can help people tackle problems head on , before they escalate into something more serious . <p> Flexible working : If people are struggling with mental health problems , they may find it difficult to work 9-5 every day . Why not use flexible working to allow people to start later in the morning , do some work from home or work around appointments ? <p> Create some space : Providing a section of the office where people can relax and unwind encourages staff to take much-needed breaks and can avoid stress building up . <p> Share information : It 's important your staff feel supported so make sure they 're aware of the ways you 'd like to help them , whether it 's through training , offering flexible working , or via access to an Employee Assistance Programme ( EAP ) .

Buddy schemes involve members listening to their buddy 's concerns , encouraging them and helping build their self-confidence and offer advice and guidance as appropriate.Such schemes can be particularly helpful if an employee is returning to the workplace after an extended period of absence . For more information about setting up a buddy scheme , check out this guidance from the Shaw Trust . <p> Make adjustments : Some small changes in the workplace can make life a lot easier for anyone struggling with mental health issues .

Among the measures introduced were weekly sessions with a registered mental health nurse and monthly sessions with a consultant psychiatrist so people could access appropriate support at work rather than needing time off , while two members of staff were trained as mental health first-aiders .

Yes , you did read that right . Odd , but true : in Portugal employers are n't allowed to include a termination period in an employment contract which means they ca n't legally give any worker the sack . What this means in practice is that the Portuguese workforce is largely employed on fixed term contracts or taken on through temp agencies . If you want to get rid of someone in Portugal , you have to either hope they resign or pay them a lot of money to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer can insist that women workers wear bras . A State Labour Court in North Rhine Westphalia made the ruling two years ago after workers at an airport security firm took the company to court , complaining its stipulations on their dress and personal appearance were too strict . But the court took the view that asking women to wear a bra was not infringing on their human rights . German employers can also tell female workers to keep their hair clean and their fingernails neat and trimmed to under half a centimetre , and men to keep their beards neat . The court 's ruling applies to all German companies . <h> Example #3 " USA <p> In the USA , employees have no legal rights to regular lavatory breaks . In theory a really mean boss could prevent workers from going to the toilet , although we have n't come across any recorded instances of that happening in practice ! <h> Example #4 " Saudi Arabia <p> In Saudi Arabia , a recent employment law prevents men working in women 's clothing or cosmetics shops . <h> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only developed country in the world to have no statutory annual leave for workers . This means American companies are perfectly within their rights not to give their staff any holiday at all . In practice most companies do give annual leave but the amount is generally not particularly generous compared with other countries . The average American employee gets 14 days off a year compared with a minimum of 20 days in Britain . In China workers get no holiday in the first year and a certain number of days after that , while in some European countries like Sweden and Austria the minimum is 25 days . 85209 @qwx285209 85210 @qwx285210

@@27065121 @765121/ <h> 50 Shades of Grey " The Ageing UK Workforce Infographic <p> 23 January 2013 <p> Over the last 30 years , the shape of the UK workforce has changed significantly . One undeniable trend is that people are working longer . The number of people working past retirement age has almost doubled in the last 20 years . <p> According to the Office for National Statistics those working past state pension age , 65 for men and 61 for women , are more than twice as likely to be working part time as the general population . There are now more than 1.4 million workers in employment beyond retirement age and over 60% of these are women . <h> Reasons Behind the UK 's Ageing Workforce <p> There several reasons behind the ageing UK workforce . Many people 's pensions are simply inadequate , failing to give them the financial security they 'd hoped for in retirement . Life expectancy is increasing through better awareness of health and fitness plus advances in medical science , meaning people are physically able to work for longer . The baby boomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel young at heart and many do n't feel ready to be put out to grass just yet . ONS notes that many older men are employed in higher skilled occupations at director level , where the retirement offerings are likely to be higher than average , indicating that they are choosing to work for reasons other than financial ones . <h> People Expect to be Working for a Longer Proportion of Their Lives <p> While employees no longer expect to be with the same company for life , there is also an expectation that they will be working long past 65 . In an ICM survey commissioned by the Guardian on behalf of Unum in 2011 , 20% of employees did n't expect to retire until they were over 70 . This is a realistic view as many commentators conclude that without further rises in the state pension age , Britain 's gross domestic product will be reduced significantly . This is because the percentage of the UK population over 65 is rising much faster than those aged 16 to 64 , who make up the traditional workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be significantly fewer employees paying taxes to support those in retirement . <h> Your Older Employees Are Valuable <p> Despite a baby boom in the last few years , older workers will be making up a greater percentage of the workforce in the future . It 's important that employers recognise this fact and put provisions in place to deal with their needs . This means that different employee benefits may be required . For example , while in general people are staying healthier for longer , the risk of serious illness does increase as you get older , so an integrated health and wellbeing programme for staff becomes more important to deal with this ageing workforce .

@@27065159 @765159/ <p> In a recent survey with People Management , 84% of HR professionals stated they viewed managing sickness absence as important strategic issue for their organisation . In today 's challenging economic environment , there are many issues that businesses are grappling with , but sickness absence is one that can be tackled head on . With effective policies and a clear focus the direct and indirect costs of sickness absence can be managed more efficiently . But , what is the reality ? What sick pay arrangements are in place and how do companies manage the issue ? We commission research with Holden Pearmain to find out the answers to these questions . <h> Sick pay " what do companies actually pay ? <p> Only about a third of private companies in the UK with 10 employees or more offer some kind of Occupational Sick Pay ( OSP ) , over and above Statutory Sick Pay ( SSP ) . Perhaps surprisingly , medium sized companies are just as likely to offer OSP as large organisations . This means 64% of companies only offer SSP , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Do companies offer OSP straightaway to their employees ? <p> In most cases the answer is no , over half the companies surveyed that offer OSP said their employees were only entitled to it once they had been with the company for 6 months or more . <h> What happens when OSP or SSP stops ? <p> SSP ceases to be paid after an employee has been off work for 28 weeks . Most OSP policies only cover the first 6 months of absence too . If an employee has a long term illness , such as cancer , then almost 4 out of 5 companies have no formal provision in place to pay employees beyond 6 months . This means there is huge financial uncertainty for many employees who are off work for more than 6 months . The same is true for their employers , who can not be certain of their staffing costs to cover that absence . <h> How long do companies offering OSP pay an employee their full salary ? <p> Most employees have no idea what their company 's sick pay policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period of time their usual pay cheque would continue to be paid month after month . Around 50% of employees believe their employer would pay their full salary for 6 months . The reality is very different . Out of the companies surveyed which offered OPS , only 10% paid anything beyond 6 months and only a third of those offered full pay . This means the financial safety net , that many employees image to be there , simply is n't . <h> How is sickness absence tracked ? <p> It 's very difficult to manage the issue of sickness absence if you do n't have a clear idea of the size of the problem . Over a fifth of companies surveyed do n't have a tracking policy in place , meaning they do n't have an accurate record and do n't know how much it 's costing them . In fact , only a third of companies surveyed measured the cost of sickness absence for the first 6 months . <h> How is sickness absence validated ? <p> If the absence is for less than a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's fit note . Once the absence is longer than a month then companies start to use other methods too , but almost 3 out of 5 continue just to rely on the fit note . <h> How does sickness absence impact workload ? <p> If an employee is off work for a significant period of time , it impacts their team , department and the company as a whole . If the company is not seen to be looking after the employee , it can have a detrimental effect on staff loyalty and motivation , exaggerating that impact . Productivity suffers , which can affect the overall profitability of the business . Perhaps surprisingly , larger companies with more than 500 employees felt the impact on workload the most . <h> How long can companies absorb the cost of sickness absence ? <p> The cost of sickness absence is felt by companies very quickly . Almost a third of companies can only absorb the cost of sickness absence for a maximum of a week .

And companies who 've invested in good employee benefits , but have n't told staff what they are entitled to , are no better off than if they had n't provided the benefits in the first place . <p> Employee retention and engagement is lower amongst staff who are unaware of the benefits on offer , and as a result are more likely to call in sick or leave the company altogether .

Having an open dialogue between employers and employees about benefits builds a more productive and loyal workforce , and the bottom line benefits are evident .

Nearly a third of employees in large companies ( 30% ) say wellbeing has got worse in the last 3 years compared to just 14% of employees in small companies , and 41% say current levels of wellbeing are only adequate or poor compared to just 26% in SMEs . <p> Different business sectors experience different levels of workplace wellbeing .

The research revealed another potential danger for businesses as dissatisfied employees may be more likely to push for higher salaries in lieu of feeling well looked after by their employer .

In many cases it 's not because they 're not interested , it 's because the information they 're presented with is too technical or detailed and it 's not immediately obvious to the individual how it relates to their role . <p> Financial data is at times hugely complex and sensitive , but if employees across all levels are shown how their roles fit into the bigger picture , the likelihood is they 'll be more productive and engaged in their work . <p> So when the time comes to deliver your next quarterly financial performance update , how can you ensure your employees understand what you 're saying and , importantly , are inspired rather than bored by your presentation ? Here are some tips <h> 1 ) Do n't use overly technical financial terms <p> Financial jargon may be second nature to you , but anyone who does n't have a background in accounting or business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every time you use words like deliverables ' , leverage ' and return on equity ' you 're losing your audience . <p> Use straightforward language wherever possible and where that 's not possible , make sure you explain the terms you 're using .

Offer information that shows them what the implications of their work are , such as the impact of mistakes on the business ( without singling out individuals , of course ! ) , and the value or loss of a customer . This will help them make better decisions , improve performance and take a vested interest in the financial health of the company . <p> This can be particularly beneficial to small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's job and financial results , it 's more likely that staff will get engaged and adapt how they work based on the information they 're hearing from you . <h> 3 ) Set financial goals <p> It 's a good idea to set some goals when delivering financial information , especially with employees who receive bonuses based on their performance . <p> Point out which products and services are most profitable , and highlight the expenses that have the biggest impact on profits . Then set targets for everyone to make small changes to achieve growth in the next quarter . Not only will staff be more likely to take an interest in and understand the company 's results , you 'll also help them understand the direct impact they can have on the next quarter 's results and motivate them to take action . <h> 4 ) Confront difficult issues <p> Telling employees about a successful year is always nice , especially if it means you can give them a token of appreciation , whether that 's an extra half day 's holiday , a bonus , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always the case . If financial results are less than rosy , it could mean there may be job losses , a reduction in hours or salary freezes . It 's important not to hold back information when the news is bad as employees may jump to their own conclusions , resulting in poor morale . <p> If you have bad news to deliver , you could consider : <p> Showing it 's not all doom and gloom . Begin on a positive note by saying what 's good about the company before sharing the bad news . Then simply state what the bad news is without using emotive language or being overly alarmist . You 'll gain the trust of your workforce by telling it to them straight . <p> Empowering the workforce . Consider sharing information that could rally your troops to turn things around . If people know what the problems are , they 're more likely to come up with solutions .

You may have had a bad quarter or year end , but you wo n't rally the troops by focusing on what everyone 's done wrong . While it 's important to be realistic about the situation and what it means for the future , you also want to try to inspire your employees by ending the presentation on a positive note . Try recapping what 's gone well in the past and then give an overview of what 's gone wrong in this quarter and why . <p> Explain the positive steps the company can take to get back on track in the next quarter or two .

And that 's before you look at the benefits of an inspiring company culture for existing staff : engagement , motivation , retention , intrapreneurialism <p> Here we look at some of the biggest culture problems , and how you can start to fix them : <h> Innovation <p> For a business to thrive , you need to create a culture where ideas and originality are encouraged , not shot down in flames . If innovation is stifled , morale falls and employees become so disenchanted that they do n't even want to reveal their ideas .

If your company culture is focused too heavily on rigidity and fear of risk , you wo n't be able to empower your staff to be creative with the latest technologies and digital media . The risk of staying the same is far greater than the risk of change . <h> Communication <p> Your employees are your most valuable asset , so regular communication within your organisation is crucial . So often there seems to be a culture of secrecy , with staff feeling marginalised if they 're not included in conversations . Information should be made available to everyone , whatever their pay grade . By maintaining an open dialogue , employees feel fully informed and invested in the business . The more transparent you are , the more your staff will trust you . Netflix is a great example of a transparent business .

While 71% think better diversity is a good thing , 29% doubt its value altogether . Globally , the proportion of women in top executive roles stands at just 5.8% , but firms that fail to adopt a policy of gender diversity could be undermining their business . <h> Hierarchy <p> Too many companies are still taking a top-down approach to management , where employees at the bottom are treated poorly and those at the top are too controlling . Forward-thinking businesses are tending to move towards flat hierarchies , where there is very little or no management , and employees are trusted to run their own lives . This approach makes workers feel more engaged and actually increases their productivity , although they still have to be motivated . <h> Appreciation <p> Do n't be reticent in letting your employees know that they 're valued and their work is appreciated . If a project has gone well , or someone has put in extra hours to get a job done or has gone the extra mile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go unnoticed .

To keep things fresh , pairings should be changed regularly .

@@27065242 @765242/ <h> Are You Ready For Pensions Auto-Enrolment ? <p> 25 September 2012 <p> From October 2012 pensions auto-enrolment begins , and all UK employers will be required to provide a company supported pension scheme for their employees . <p> This poses a problem for many employers with existing pension schemes . In the past employers have made a voluntary decision to offer pension benefits to their employees for a variety of reasons , but the key driver for many companies was an assumed Return on Investment ( ROI ) in lower recruitment and retention costs . Yet once employees understand that pension scheme membership is now a legal right , rather than a privilege , the kudos of offering this benefit may lessen . So what can employers do about this ? <p> One approach might be to view employee benefits in the round , rather than just pensions in isolation . Ask the question : Are the benefits on offer relevant to the workforce ? <p> Let 's take life assurance for example . This is a common benefit alongside many pension schemes , and demand for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees contracted a major illness .

So perhaps income protection might be a more valuable and welcome benefit for today 's employees than life cover ? <p> A full review of benefits is likely to throw up many such inconsistencies , and the resultant package might well be better suited to both employer and employee needs . And time does remain for many employers to include a wider benefits review into their auto enrolment plans . A Jelf Employee Benefits Survey in May 2012 found that only 31% employers had yet taken any concrete action regarding auto-enrolment . <p> So , If your employer is one of the remaining 69% , the time for pensions action is now , and I would strongly urge a complete employee benefits review as part of this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced , benefits package .

@@27065286 @765286/ <h> The History of Employee-Owner Contracts <p> 13 May 2013 <p> The new scheme which gives workers the chance to trade in employment rights in return for tax-free shares in their company has been one of the Government 's more controversial ideas . <p> First announced by the Chancellor in October 2012 , the new employee-owner contracts are intended to promote growth in fast-growing businesses by cutting down the burden of employment law . But they have attracted criticism by those who fear they 'll be open to abuse . <p> So what are the pros and cons of employee-owner contracts ? Are they coming in , and if so , when ? Here 's the story so far . <h> What are Employee-Owner Contracts ? <p> Employee-owner contracts , now renamed employee shareholder contracts , are a new kind of employment status . They are part of the Government 's Growth and Infrastructure Bill 2013 . <h> Under the Scheme : <p> employers can give staff shares in the company worth between -2,000 and -50,000 which are exempt from capital gains tax . <p> employees surrender some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rights to redundancy pay and to request <p> flexible working and training . <p> Employee owners have to give twice the amount of notice period when returning from maternity or adoption leave . <p> Employee owners still keep some of their rights , such as unfair dismissal in cases of discrimination . <p> If an employee-owner is made redundant , the business can buy back the shares . <p> The scheme is mainly intended for fast-growing SMEs hiring new recruits , although businesses can offer the new status to existing staff members . The Government has stressed the contracts are voluntary . However , when employers are hiring staff , they have the option to offer jobs only on an employee owner basis . <h> What Has Been the Response to the Idea ? <p> The Government consulted on the scheme between October and November of last year . Much of the response was negative . One of the main concerns was that employees could be put under pressure to accept the new contracts and would lose some important rights in doing so . <p> The other main criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate and that the income tax issues for employees were n't clear . <p> In response to the consultation , the Government made changes to the scheme , including opening it up to non UK-registered companies in the hopes of exciting start-ups opting for British shores rather than , say , America " which has much less stringent employment laws . <h> So is the Scheme Going Ahead ? <p> Initially , The House of Lords rejected the idea and the bill was ping ponged back and forth between the Commons and Lords over the early months of 2013 . <p> The bill was finally approved at the end of April after the Government agreed several compromises , including a seven day cooling off period and that all employees being offered the new contracts should get independent legal advice paid for by the company . <p> Employee-owner contracts are due to come into effect this autumn . <h> Employee-Owner Contracts : A Timeline <p> 1929 " John Spedan Lewis ( owner of John Lewis ) gave Partnership to all of his employees to balance the happiness of all its members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chancellor at the Conservative party conference <p> October " November 2012 " Consultation on employee-owner contracts takes place <p> December 2013 " Government response to the consultation published and employee-owners are renamed employee shareholders .

An online programme allows staff to submit claims anytime , anywhere and from any mobile device . This is a way of simplifying processes and limiting the scope for bogus claims . Automated software can : <p> check mileage claimed between destinations <p> identify duplicated expense claims <p> upload employee expenses from multiple locations <p> However , an automated system does n't account for the unexpected , so do n't rely on it too much .

Instead , a good time to broach the subject is when the policy has changed slightly , for example , if your mileage allowance has gone up due to fuel cost increases . This is a good time to re-acquaint your employees with the policy and a natural time to explain the seriousness of falsifying expenses and that it could result in them being dismissed . <p> The key to getting people on board with your employee expenses policy is to ensure everyone is treated the same . You 'd be on shaky ground if you accused an employee of making a false claim , only for them to name several colleagues who have made the same claim in the past without any action being taken .

In some instances it will certainly be necessary ( and worth it ) ; in other cases , it could just be a convenient way for your employee to bolt on a holiday after the business meeting " getting one-way of their trip paid for in the process . With the growing focus on wellbeing at work , this is n't necessarily a bad thing ; just make sure that your policy 's clear on whether you pay for a plus-one to these venues and what your stance is on hotels and food for the entirety of the trip .

Under new Government plans , mothers will have to take two weeks ' leave immediately after the birth of their child , but the remainder of the 52-week parental leave period can be shared between both parents .

Retaining good people is paramount to running a successful business . <h> 5 ) Absence management <p> One of the biggest concerns for employers is how to handle absence from work . Not surprisingly , Mondays and Fridays are the peak days for short-term absence , which can be extremely disruptive to businesses . Longer term absences are even more challenging , but improvements can be made by holding back to work interviews so staff can discuss any issues they might have .

@@27065360 @765360/ <h> Does your company have a sweet tooth ? Infographic <p> 2nd February 2016 <p> Cookies , cakes , fizzy drinks , hot drinks , bread , sauces , fruit <p> Whether you have a sweet tooth or not , it 's pretty hard to steer clear of sugar completely . Even if you 're not big on snacking on chocolate bars or Haribo during the mid-afternoon slump , there 's a good chance you consume a certain amount of sugar just by eating your M&amp;S sandwich at lunch . <p> Recent research , campaigns and calls for a sugar tax have helped to highlight the large " and for some , dangerous " amount of refined sugar in our diets . With obesity rates starting to climb and the risks of disease that coincides with being overweight , many people are starting to realise how difficult it actually is to avoid foods with sugar . <p> There 's even a reality TV show called Sugar Free Farm where celebrities cut out the sweet stuff completely while doing manual labour on a working farm . It documents the surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything with a hint of sugar . <p> So with all the articles and revelations recently , like how a can of coke actually contains more added sugar than your recommended daily amount , getting the right balance in terms of health and wellbeing at work can be tricky . On one hand , you do n't want to treat your employees like children in a sweet shop " thinking they ca n't be trusted with vending machines or fizzy drinks " but you do n't want to encourage an unhealthy workplace . After all , people spend 8 or 9 hours of their day at work , so environmental factors can play a big part in routines and habits . <h> Restrictions and bans do n't work <p> There will always be that part of the working day when someone needs a sweet fix , so taking away vending machines and chocolate bars is more likely going to frustrate your employees , rather than help them . Sugar is still part of a balanced diet after all and while it might be better for someone to have a banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yorkie bar , they 're going to get a Yorkie bar . And it 's really not the end of the world for their health . <h> Give people a choice <p> If people have the option of having something healthy , as well as the usual sweet treats , you may find that they 're more likely to choose the foods that are good for them . And sometimes , having a colleague who 's on a health-kick can inadvertently sway others into better habits . If you have a company restaurant , perhaps consider having a healthy dish of the day ' , or stock your vending machines with seed snacks and things like Nakd bars . Show your staff the healthier options in the canteen with stickers , or detail the nutritional information in case they 're torn between options . <h> Communication and diets <p> Dietary goals can change from person to person . Whereas Katie may want to lose a stone , Eric might just want to cut down on saturated fats in what he eats day-to-day . So Katie eating a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of Cadbury 's Buttons , could actually be hindering weight loss . Serving sizes of these bags can typically be around 650 kcals " more of a main meal than a snack . For Eric though , substituting this for chocolate containing refined sugars is getting him on the right track ( if he 's eating in moderation of course .. ! ) Make sure the right messages about the food and snacks in your canteen are clear to help your employees with whatever their diet targets are . <h> Reinforcement and catering <p> Jumping on the bandwagon is n't necessarily a bad thing . After TV shows and press reports , there 's no harm in reflecting on the findings of these in how you conduct your company restaurant . So following all these revelations about sugar , why not highlight all the products you 're stocking that have no added sugar ? It 'll help drive the facts home and could see employees taking the initiative to get into better habits . Take advantage of the catering company 's renewal period and work out how you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add or reduce to make sure your employees are given a healthy choice of meals and snacks ? <p> It 's important to make sure you 're treating your employees like adults " they know what 's good and bad for them . By all means present the facts , but preaching or nagging could be counter-productive . As long as you 're not encouraging the consumption of sweet treats , like pricing fruit above chocolate bars , or putting two for one offers in on unhealthy items , it 'll help staff to realise you 're looking after their health . Showing that you care for your workforce can not only be a good thing for them personally , but also for the performance of the company . <p> A healthy workforce is a happy one . 85209 @qwx285209 85210 @qwx285210

Many SMEs could learn a lot from this , as the cost of absence can be particularly crippling for some . And with people also having to work longer before retiring , sickness levels are only likely to increase . <h> Capping paid sick leave <p> According to the Centre for American Progress , around 38% of US workers do n't receive paid sick leave , while for others there 's a cap on the number of paid sick days they can take2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and not take the odd duvet day here and there . <p> Obviously , the flip side of this is people feeling they literally ca n't afford to stay off work even when they 're genuinely i 'll , so it 's one to think carefully about . <h> Flexible working <p> It 's important that your employees feel happy and motivated at work . Stressful working environments and rigid hours can increase absence levels . Introducing flexible working , which is used a lot in the US , can be the key to supporting people 's health and wellbeing as they get older . Those who have a good life-work balance are less likely to take time off . <p> Measures such as skills analysis and mentoring can also help to place staff in the right jobs and improve morale . <h> Managing long-term absence <p> Mental illness and musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs ) , particularly back pain , are the most common causes of staff taking long-term sick leave .

Identify the key drivers for mental health , and the key indicators ; figure out how to measure these and what level the company should achieve and ensure these are an integral part of your company 's performance targets . <p> 3 . Choose your moment <p> There are some important dates throughout the year which can help to get the conversation started with staff and board members , including Mental Health Awareness Week in May and World Mental Health Day in October .

There are also many internal milestones that can help to put mental health on the agenda like board meetings , staff surveys and staff absence reports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is busiest and staff are under the most stress , so you can raise the issue ahead of time .

It may be they have experienced a mental health problem themselves , or they may simply be passionate about looking after staff . They can also help to lead by example , encouraging more junior employees to think about their mental wellbeing at work . <p> 5 . Break the taboo <p> Mental health is still a taboo subject in some workplaces .

@@27065427 @765427/ <h> Facing the taboo " how to support an employee through bereavement <p> 9th May 2016 <p> Your workforce is made up of individuals " people with different backgrounds , beliefs and family circumstances . And everyone handles situations in their own way . <p> Employers are starting to recognise that one-size-fits-all solutions do n't really work for the modern workforce , so , when it comes to employees going through a bereavement , the right support really comes down to understanding that individual . <p> Bereavement can be a tricky subject to address , especially for line managers . What 's the best way to support someone ? What are the right things to say or do ? How much communication should there be ? <p> Our new online module , developed with St. Catherine 's Hospice , aims to help HR professionals and line managers understand how bereavement might affect the workforce and ways you can support employees in a way that 's right for them . <p> A death of a loved one not only affects people emotionally , but brings with it funeral planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to understand an employee 's situation . At any one time , bereavement impacts 1 in 10 people in the workplace1 " and it 's something everyone will go through in their lifetime " so it 's crucial this subject is high on a company 's radar . But where do you start ? <h> Policy <p> In a recent study 87% of respondents agreed that all employers should have a compassionate leave policy2 , it 's hard to ignore the idea that many people feel that coming into work unsupported following bereavement could lead to problems . A policy can help employees understand what they 're entitled to and for some , give them peace of mind when returning to work is something they ca n't even face at the time . <p> A crucial part of writing up bereavement policy wording is not to put a measurement on grief . A loved one could encompass anyone who 's close to you , so limiting the policy to only include blood relatives , for example , would hugely disadvantage your workforce . The death of a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Line managers <p> Knowing your employees is key , so line managers will be on the front line when an employee 's grieving . And while a policy can give guidance , a period of absence to help a staff member cope should really be down to the line manager 's discretion . After all , managers will be closer to the individual and will have a better understanding of their situation . <p> A policy may be fairly restrictive , but the line manager can allow more time off , a graded return to work , or can cooperate with the team in managing workload . It 's important the correct training is given to make sure managers are comfortable with knowing when to give support and when to step back . Trusting that your line managers know their team best and empowering them to come up with the best approach for that employee is really important . <h> Support in the workplace <p> What sort of support network does your company have ? Are there any counselling initiatives implemented ? Some companies have developed a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day jobs , are on hand around the office to offer emotional assistance to other employees . Sometimes an impartial , sympathetic ear can be exactly what somebody needs . <p> Perhaps your company offers an Employee Assistance Programme to staff " make sure the benefits of this are communicated to the workforce . An EAP helpline is available to not only give emotional support , but also practical advice to assist with finances and aspects of the law . This can be really valuable for anyone dealing with a death of relative . Employees can also be pointed in the right direction if they need further help or counselling . <h> Working through bereavement <p> What works for one employee , may not work for another . You may find that some people prefer to come to work sooner than you would expect " they could view the office as a bit of an escape and a distraction from what 's going on at home . It 's important not to push anyone to take time off if working is how they choose to get through bereavement . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're back in the office . <p> Depending on the situation , some may jump back into work straight away before the incident 's had a chance to hit them . So make sure you 're keeping an eye out for any signs of distress so you can step in when needed . <h> Death of a colleague <p> The death of an employee is something no employer ever wants to have to consider . Whether it 's following a long illness , or something more unexpected , unfortunately , there may be occasions when a company needs to support multiple employees through a colleague 's death . The employee 's team will not only feel the effects emotionally , but their work may inevitably suffer as a result . Support within the workplace might work for some , but it could be that additional counselling needs to be funded . <p> Line managers could possibly need support from higher managers within the company to help with the workload , but also to cover them in periods of absence . If required , be sure to communicate funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Employees may want to organise an office memorial , or plan something more personal , so it 's important to stay in tune with the feeling in the business . <p> The effects of bereavement can last long after the person has passed away . Whether it 's a colleague who 's died , or an employee 's loved one , there may be days that are harder than others . Christmas and birthdays , for example , might churn up new feelings so keep an eye out for changes in mood and behaviour and do n't assume people can deal with these episodes alone .

This often leads to stress and anxiety , which can exacerbate any existing mental health issues . Or , an underlying mental health issue can manifest behaviours which in turn intensify financial worries . <p> It 's a vicious and dangerous cycle . CIPD published research which found the top three causes of stress in employees ' lives are money worries ( 22% ) , the nature of their job , ( for example , pressure of working hours ) ( 22% ) , and family and relationship issues ( 20% ) . According to the Money Advisory Service 's ( MAS ) 2015 Financial Capability survey only 59% of adults manage money well . <h> Why Should Employers be Concerned ? <p> Barclays ' report , Financial Well-being : The last taboo of the workplace ?

PwC found that 37% of employees say they spend three hours or more thinking about or dealing with issues related to their personal finances while at work . <h> Problems employees face <p> The Independent newspaper surveyed 2,000 people in 2015 , and found that the top worries facing people in Britain today are : getting old , money/savings , low energy/diet , debt , job security , ageing/appearance . It 's no surprise that 1/3 of the biggest worries are money-related . <p> University Hangover <p> The stress of debt starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of people attending university will be responsible for their own bills , food shopping , and rent for the first time .

Credit card debt , bank loans , peer-to-peer borrowing and pay-day loans rose 9% to -239 billion last year " or -8,936 per household . One in five Brits say they are worried about how they will make future payments .

A Nationwide survey found that although 79% of 2000 participants correctly interpreted abbreviations like LOL , only half knew the meanings behind financial terms like APR and PAYE . Misinterpreting this kind of terminology is leading people to put trust in payday loan companies and further increase their debt . <p> PwC found that just 1 in 5 of us will correctly estimate the cost of a mortgage , and just 3% correctly estimated the cost of a payday loan .

However , these resources are n't necessarily accessible to all students across the country . Bad financial habits obtained during university translate too easily to the workplace . <p> The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute ( MMHI ) has produced new research , having surveyed nearly 5,500 people with mental health problems to try and establish why they are more likely to face financial difficulties . 93% of these respondents said they spent more " possibly above their means " during periods of poor mental health . <p> Helen Undy , Head of External Affairs , says , " Financial difficulty and mental health problems are intricately linked .
