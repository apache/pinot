Like a mint Phase 3 for $35,000 , an A9X Hatchback for $30,000 , an A9X 4 door for $15,000 , an E49 Charger for $9,000 or unbelievably a LJ XUI Torana for only $5,000 . I bet you 're all saying the same thing . Oh ... @#% ! **30;0;TOOLONG . So what does the future hold ? <p> Aussie muscle cars have been through ups and downs for sure , but even after the recent downturn in values following the 2007 GFC , the values are still looking a lot stronger than the returns generated from the share market or real estate . <p> For example , if you 'd bought a mint Phase 3 in 1988 for $35,000 , your investment would be worth at least $350,000 today . That 's a tax free 10 fold increase and we 're sure you would have had a lot more fun to boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your investment would have come under pressure due to economic circustances . In the mid 1980s for example , Phase 3s were heading towards $100,000 .

And they steadily climbed to $600,000 and higher in 2007 . <p> So judging by the past and the fact that historically Aussie Muscle has trended steadily skywards , this might be a good time to start looking for a nice Aussie Muscle car to grace your garage . Afterall , it all comes down to supply and demand and they sure did n't build a lot of these monsters . And the market has definitely turned up following the GFC and interest has significantly increased . <p> So how is the best way to buy these muscle car investments . According to AMCS ' accountant you can purchase an Aussie Muscle car in your self managed super fund .

But on closer inspection it turned out to be an original K-code , four-speed , Wild Violet with black interior , factory dual-exhaust , Falcon 500 GS . <p> The car had been the lucky recipient of a typical 1980 's replica make-over - holes drilled in the quarter for the GT fuel ring , holes in the dash for the woodgrain and padding , holes in the engine bay for vacuum tank , MSD , and every other conceivable fitting , holes in the guard for an aerial in the wrong place , studs around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for GT moulds , even rear swaybar mounts in the chassis , and a tow bar for good measure - etc. etc . <p> But under the yellow paint on the inside - there was Wild Violet . And Wild Violet inside three of the four doors . All the necessary 54H bits are there - the radiator support brace , the engine crossmember brace , the exhaust mounts , and the chassis number lines up too . <p> So began a ground up nut and bolt resto . According to Geoff , the following has been done : <p> In general terms - car is in very good shape , when you consider the massive corrosion and damage usually found in XY 's and other vehicles of similar age that have been in fairly constant use for many years . See attached six photos named " Bare Metal .......

See attached six photos named " Repair ...... " <p> It is worth noting that some repairs appear unfinished , but have been primed . This is our normal i.e. no repair or bare metal is left unprotected for any length of time - not even overnight in a sealed building . Corrosion can start from fingerprints , moisture in the air , or any number of other factors , therefore all worked areas are primed every day to ensure that nothing starts anywhere unnoticed . <p> This cutting , cleaning , fitting , aligning , welding etc. process takes a number of weeks , and involves the fitting and removal of swinging panels ( doors , bonnet , guards etc. ) a number of times to ensure that fit and alignment is correct - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that doors open and close as smoothly as possible .
