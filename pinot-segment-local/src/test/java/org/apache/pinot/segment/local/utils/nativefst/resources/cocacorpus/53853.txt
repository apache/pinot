William Layer of Army Public Affairs ( OCPA ) confirmed that the new OCP ACU boots will be produced in " coyote brown ( coyote 498 . ) " <p> In November 2014 , the Department of Defense announced that the Army would be making the transition to coyote brown boots by summer 2015 . The main advantage of the new colorway is that it is more effective at providing concealment in a wider range of environments .

There has been speculation that tan 499 , the color currently used for findings ( pulls , Velcro , zippers , etc. ) on the OEF OCP ( MultiCam ) ACU , will be the tan component used on the new ACU boots .

The Defense Logistics Agency began to convert its contracts for the ACU from UCP to OCP in November 2014 . All bag item boots like hot weather issues , temperate weather issue and hot weather FR will convert from desert tan to coyote brown . <p> Desert tan boots will be authorized for wear on both the UCP and the OCP ACU with a wear-out date of October 1 , 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OCP ACU .

These test results , along with samples of the boot , will be submitted to Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center ( NSRDEC ) . From there , NSRDEC will review the results and samples to make a recommendation for either approval or disapproval to PM SPIE , the PEO Soldier program responsible for developing and fielding effective uniforms . If the boot is approved , PM SPIE will generate a certificate number and the boot will be certified for three years . <p> The first list of UQCP-approved boots will be posted sometime in the 3rd fiscal quarter by PEO Soldier .

Instead it 's a tool for commanders to know which industry combat boots meet Army standards . Commanding officers have the final say on which boots can and can not be worn . The UQCP does not supersede a commander 's guidance . <h> ACU Changes <p> A new Army boot color is n't the only ACU change on the horizon . Starting summer 2015 , the uniform was completely revamped . Like the boots , the T-shirt and findings are a slightly darker tan 499 instead of desert tan . This will allow them to blend better with the OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) camouflage pattern . <p> In addition , some distinct updates to the design of the uniform were made .

It 's likely coyote brown boots will be required for all branches along with the new uniforms . <p> Current Boots of Other Branches Currently every branch has a service-specific boot colorway . <p> Coast Guard/Navy : Both the Coast Guard and the Navy are required to wear black safety boots . <p> Marines : Marines wear olive mojave rough-out combat boots with the eagle , globe and anchor insignia on the heel . The color is less green than its name implies . Instead , Marine boots closely resemble coyote , looking very similar to what the new coyote brown boots will look like .

But the funny thing is one of the most intense looking guys at the symposium had a wicked humor and a huge heart . No , not me . I was having the same trouble as my new friend .

For full-grain boots , some advise using a stiff brush to remove dust and dirt on a regular basis , while Danner and Belleville both suggest a softer brush . For suede boots , pick a metal bristle brush and lightly stroke the boot no heavy scrubbing ! Doing so can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation . <p> 2 . Clean em . Instead of a brush , you can use a wet rag on full-grain leather boots . Danner offers its Cleaning Gel , which can remove even the tiniest particles of grime and helps with waterproofing . Apply the gel sparingly to wet leather . On the other hand , suede boots should be wiped down only on the inside with a wet , soapy cloth . If your boots have Cordura nylon fabric , that can be tidied up with warm water but NOT polish . <p> 3 . Polish em.Note : This only applies to certain types of full-grain leather . Utilize a polish containing silicone to keep the leather soft . Wellco suggests you use mink oil , and rub a small coat into the leather and seams with a cloth or dauber . To give them that super-glossy , rock-star look , make sure you buff em , too . <p> 4 . Waterproof em . Even if your boots are awesome enough already to have Gore-tex waterproofing , you still need to treat the leather . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , because that 's what they say . Apparently water can get in between the leather and Gore-tex liner and create ugly water spots . And nobody wants that . The solution ? They propose Danner Waterproofing Gel as a proper solution , which should be applied after boots are cleaned . Once you massage it onto the boot , allow some dry time and then wipe away any extra gel hanging around . However , they do warn : Do not use Danner Waterproofing Gel on nubuck , suede or rough-out leather boots . Instead , use our Danner Waterproofing Spray , which will help maintain the original texture of those products . Whatever you say ! <p> 5 . Condition em . On this one , if you own nubuck , suede and rough-out leather boots , you 're in the clear . What does that leave ? Full-grain leather !

Your best bet , unless you own a professional boot dryer ( which , let 's face it , you probably do n't  ) , is to let those puppies air dry . It will be really tempting to get out a hair dryer or head over to the nearest Wal-Mart bathroom and stick it under a hand dryer , but DO NT DO IT ! All that blistering air could put your feets best friend in critical danger . Its best that you let the sun or air at room temperature take care of it . Plus , that 's less work for you , right ? <p> 7 . Restore em . If you 've been a neglectful boot parent , its OK . We forgive you .

I had never been in trouble with the law in my life and possessed the highest security clearance available . I began seeing things I never paid attention to before . I used to have such faith in our legal system , from the code enforcer to the beat cop to the Supreme Court . Then I witnessed firsthand how the system is rigged . I witnessed firsthand the lying , underhanded , and scheming ways of the police forces . I witnessed the cover-ups and obfuscations of the police departments and government agencies . I witnessed the corruption of the courts and prosecutors . And as I opened my eyes wider , I realized it was n't just happening to me . The corruption , abuse , and oppression was everywhere ! I realized I can no longer give ANY government official the benefit of the doubt and think they actually care about my well-being or rights . Not all government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the problem . If they can treat me like a criminal because there are criminals among us , why should I treat them any differently since there are crooks and frauds among them ? <p> The mayhem as a result of the shooting last night hits close to home for me since it happened in my home state and just a few hours from where I live . I want to share my thoughts on the incident . I realize that not everyone will agree with my assessment and only those with the capability of being objective and analytical , having an open mind , and can accept hard truths will understand what I 'm trying to say , even if they disagree . My intent is to hopefully help in understanding why these things are happening and why I feel the way I do . Some of these are hard truths and many will refuse to accept them at face value in spite of the evidence . I freely admit that I have gone from an apologist to a cynic . I no longer have the ability to bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatant violations of law by the highest of officials in government is cast aside by the leading law enforcement branch in the country . <p> " RIGHT WING NUT CASES " ARE NOT THE PROBLEM <p> In spite of what our Justice Department and the Obama Administration has been claiming since 2009 , this is not a rightwing , returning combat veteran problem . These tragedies are happening across the entire spectrum of social , economic , and political ideologies . They are being perpetrated by so-called conservatives , so-called libertarians , and so-called liberals . They are conducted by the godless and the faithful . They are perpetrated by black and white people alike . It is happening in the midwest , northeast , west coast and everywhere in between in varying scales . Its happening in small towns and big cities . The incident in Dallas was carried out by a leftwing , racist . Other incidents , like the Murray Federal Building bombing were rightwing in nature . <p> Much of the violence has been perpetrated by liberals against conservatives . Just look at the hate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morphed into a modern day Weather Underground or Black Panthers hate group . There are even unsubstantiated reportsconspiracy theories of them working hard to usher in martial law and hand Obama a 3rd term . <p> The reason that there appears to be a growing extremist element in society is because as government continues to grow and negatively affect the lives of Americans of walks of life , more are forced into fighting back . Unfortunately , too many believe that this fight must be kinetic and take matters into their own hands . Too often , they have been given no other option . After the system makes them a criminal , they find it hard to get meaningful employment . Since the government has destroyed the job market , this becomes even more exacerbated . When you cant provide for your family , some believe their only option is crime . And the cycle continues . <p> When you have citizens taking matters into their hands against the BLM on one side and law enforcement on the other , its hard to blame those that are upset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll notice that no one at the Bundy Ranch fired a single shot in spite of being extremely angry and a man has his livelihood destroyed . Violence should only be used in response to violence and no other time and for not other reason . <p> THE GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING THIS ON THEMSELVES <p> This is difficult for many people to fathom because they instantly go into defensive mode when you say it . Images of vigilantes , the Matrix and Guy Fawkes come to mind . We all know there are good cops and bad cops , good troops and bad troops , and good politicians and bad politicians . I wont argue whether there are more good or bad in any of the groups . However , what we as a nation need to do is look at these issues through the lens of " government " and stop apologizing because there happens to be good people in it . We also need to stop idolizing ANY government entities .

" Ronald Reagan said , " trust but verify . " I 'm going to focus on law enforcement for the purposes of this post because that is the catalyst for a lot of what is happening these days . As I say this , readers should understand that I know not all cops are bad , but that wont stop me from criticizing a profession that is bringing this on themselves . I 'm speaking generally and nothing I say is intended to suggest everyone is at fault . Take away the faces and names of law enforcement for a bit and focus on the profession of law as a whole . Just as we criticize the EPA , IRS , etc. , this is about the actions of the entity , in spite of the good people that may work in it . <p> For too long , law enforcement has been given carte blanche protection to do nearly anything it wants .

I hear people say all the time that " the time to stand up for your rights is n't on the streets . Its in the courtroom .

If you voluntarily surrender your rights and obey unlawful or unconstitutional orders , you have lost your " standing " to even sue in the first place . No one , even the most staunch and ardent supporters who refuse to criticize any police action , can honestly deny that cops now have more rights than the people they serve . You are only fooling yourself if you do n't  believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  agree . <p> Cops are " allowed " to speed , have busted taillights , fail to come to a complete stop at a light or sign , or even drive while intoxicated because of " professional courtesy . " Cops are allowed to lie to you , but you cant lie to them . Cops are allowed to disarm you " for their safety , " but you cant disarm anyone for yours . Cops can throw you into a police car for no reason or because they did n't  like the way you talked to or looked at them , but you have no recourse when they are rude to you . They can shoot you based on a " fear " and only have to endure an " investigation " while on administrative leave at taxpayer expense , but you must prove that " fear " in court after being arrested or sued if you shoot in self defense at great expense to you .

Forget it . Your life is over . <p> The justice system itself has now created a separate class of protected people : the government . At any level . For example , its okay for prosecutors and judges to be armed without a license , but not the " little " people . We must get a license . They can carry into a courthouse , but we cant . Politicians can violate federal law about the protection of classified information , but we are raked over the coals and our lives ruined . IRS agents do n't  have to worry about being audited . The government can murder its citizens in Waco , disarm them after a hurricane in New Orleans , and pepper spray them during a peaceful sit-in at UC Davis . They can tax you into oblivion , take your property on a whim , search you without warrant , and kidnap you without cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a toy ) without recourse or punishment . And the people are getting fed up with it . The government has forgotten that we are not slaves and that their sole purpose is to protect our liberties , not their own . This is why we are faced the current environment in America . <p> POLICE ARE NOT HELPING THE PUBLIC FRUSTRATION WITH GOVERNMENT <p> Every single day , there is a story about a no-knock raid on the wrong house , shooting of an innocent man , confiscating money from someone with " too much " ( civil asset theft ) , beating someone who made a smart ass remark , or in some other way infringing on the rights of the people . A man killed a cop and injured two others during a no-knock raid on the wrong house locally and is in prison facing murder charges . I see a bunch of people with " Remember Officer Dinwiddie " stickers on their cars , but no one with stickers wanting justice for a man trying to protect his home from supposed armed robbers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found nothing alleged in the warrant ! But , when they accidentally kill us , its because of the " complex " situation and we should n't complain until we 've " walked in their shoes . " They are harassing , assaulting , and arresting photographers , peaceful protesters , kids selling lemonade on the sidewalk , walking across the street somewhere other than a crosswalk , wearing NRA t-shirts , feeding the homeless , walking down the wrong side of a road , or simply for looking and dressing a certain way . That 's all okay , but if you dare stand up to their harassment , you are OUT OF LINE ! <p> When a police officer is obviously in the wrong , the departments and fellow officers do everything to protect him instead of demanding his resignation or charges be filed . The " thin , blue line " has become nothing more than a " thick , watch my spine . " Near unanimously , when a cop is violating the rights of someone , other cops wont stop it and most will join if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no honor because there is no one willing to do the right thing . Its become a profession of groupthink . There was a time when the unwritten motto of Americas law enforcement was " choose the hard right over the easy wrong " and " protect and serve . " That is no longer the general rule . If it were true that there are only a " few bad apples , " where are the rest putting a stop to it ? ! How is it possible that all those " few bad apples " just so happen to be in the same place at the same time helping each other out beat people up ? <p> On top of that , when law abiding citizens are wrongfully accused or treated poorly in error , instead of simply admitting they were wrong and letting bygones be bygones , they will typically find another offense to charge them with to save face . They will alter their reports accordingly . For example , in my 2013 incident , I was stopped for the lawfully carry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutionally disarm me , I naturally response was to defend myself . When the department and the county realized that I did n't  do what I was charged with , they simply changed the charges several times to find something that would stick . They had no right to disarm me , but when I naturally reacted to that attempt , they simply charged me with resistance instead of dropping the false charges altogether and reaching out to me that they made a mistake . Too often , pride gets in the way of ego in our nations police forces . Whenever a citizen stands up for his rights and directly challenges the unlawful or unconstitutional actions of a cop , the reaction by the cop is generally one of " I 'll show you . " <p> The public enables this attitude . I cant tell you how many times I hear people say , " the time to stand up for your rights is n't on the streets . That 's what the courts are for . " Or , " well , he got what he deserved for not following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful , wrong , and/or unconstitutional . The public attitude is that cops can do whatever they want to you and you are just supposed to suck it up and do their bidding . They say that if you later feel like you were wronged , that 's what the courts are for . What they do n't  realize is how nearly impossible it is to get justice in a courtroom for two reasons : 1 ) qualified immunity and 2 ) the prohibitive cost of suing . So , literally the only place you can possible get any justice is on the street at the time your rights are being violated and just hope it works out for the best . I 've actually had much success just educating myself on the law and knowing how to argue it . A good cop will recognize he is wrong and stop what he is doing and a bad cop will simply ramp up his attitude . Other bad cops will jump on the bandwagon . The problem is that there are too many of the latter these days . And there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was Iraq and more recently Afghanistan , our rules of engagement for firing our weapons against the declared enemy threat were more strict than the rules of engagement police departments have about shooting the American people . The police merely need say they " feared for their lives . " In combat , we needed to actually see and identify a threat . Fearing for our lives was a daily reality , but we did n't  kill everyone that looked suspicious , darted behind a corner , or made a sudden move in our presence . <p> THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO CHANGE <p> This needs to happen on many levels . First , the public needs to treat everyone with respect to the point they are being disrespected . We can not blame all cops for the actions of some . But , cops also need to stop blaming all citizens for the actions of a few . Just as most cops are likely good people , so is society . So , why is it okay to treat everyone like a suspect or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to them ? That does n't  mean , however , that we give them all a pass just because they wear a badge and put themselves in harms way from time to time . Respect is a two-way street . Unfortunately , every time there is an incident , the default judgment is that " police have a tough job " or " its just a few bad apples . " Anyone that tries to hold those " bad apples " accountable are attacked because they want to protect the rest . If you dare expose those bad apples , suddenly you 're a " cop hater . " You do n't  protect the good by protecting the bad . <p> The public needs to stop dismissing the bad apples by diverting attention to the good ones . This process of apologizing for bad behavior has gotten us nowhere . We need to admit that we do have a problem in this country with how law enforcement engages the public . On the Open Carry Texas YouTube channel , there are videos of both good and bad police encounters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad encounters with cops and they accuse us of being " anti-cop " without even acknowledging the other videos we share of positive encounters . This is why the problem is getting worse and not better . Instead of dealing with the bad events , we try to deflect by engaging in the " not every cop is bad " rhetoric . We all know that , but when holding any government official accountable and let 's face it , cops are government officials giving them a pass helps no one . <p> We love to say that cops are brave and selfless , but when they kill an innocent man , we revert to " they have a tough job . " We blame the victim . Heck , before my dashcam video came out , people blamed what I must have done to deserve it . That 's the impulse every time : he must have done something wrong . We are training these officers in the academies to treat each of us as a threat ; as the enemy . They are told to care more about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the public just wanting to go home at night .

Loggers , taxi drivers , landscapers , truck drivers and other have far more dangerous jobs than police and those industries are n't  tasked with protecting our liberty and do n't  have contact with criminals all day . The way the media and pundits talk , you would think we need to cut them a lot of slack because they 're dying left and right when in fact intentional homicide of police is at its lowest point in over 30 years . <p> According to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund , there were 124 officers killed in the line of duty last year , which is a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was a spike in traffic fatalities .

" Meanwhile , traffic-related fatalities increased 6 percent , thirty officers died from other causes , 43 percent increase , job-related illnesses , such as heart attacks , rose to 24 officer deaths compared to 18 in 2014 . Do n't  get me wrong , I 'm not playing the " well it could be worse " card . ONE felonious killing is too many , but its to be expected in that line of work much like combat deaths are expected to occur within a military at war . That does n't  mean its a good thing , just a known risk .

We should all be uniformly pissed off about these events instead of criticizing people for daring to share them . I used to be ignorant about what has happened to this once noble profession . Not anymore . It happens everywhere , every day . I do n't  hate cops . I hate bad cops and departments that do nothing about them and a justice system that protects them .

Gates was arrested for " disorderly conduct " when he argued with the police . While I agree with Obama that the arrest never should have happened , once officers confirmed that he lived there ( see the third section of this post ) , the officer should have left it at that and recognized that a man was merely protecting himself on his own property .

When Obama gets up there along with his other Democratic race baiters , he only incites the black extremists and pisses off the white extremists . He drives that wedge as far as he can . Meanwhile , those of us that see the big picture that this is n't a black vs white thing , but a cop vs the people thing are told we cant have an opinion because we are whitemaleor both . This kind of division is exactly what government wants . By inciting a race war , they can impose martial law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disarm us . If they can disarm us , they can rule without limits . The longer we continue to fight each other the more power the government gobbles up in the name of " safety . " The nation returns to its pre-Civil War slavery , only ALL of us will be the slaves . <p> Because of this huge chasm in racial politics , even when you get people to admit to the fact that twice as many white people are killed by police than black people , they want to instead dismiss those numbers and argue the " proportionality " or ratio of killing by race . In other words , it does n't  matter that people other than black people are being slaughtered . Obama says only " black lives matter . " Listen folks , I do n't  care if cops were killing white people disproportionately , proportionately , or whatever . My concern is that unarmed people are being slaughtered because our government thinks its lives are more important than ours . <p> That is the real problem . It all boils down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans lives are to be viewed as nothing more than collateral damage in the fight against government manufactured " crime . " <p> GUNS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM , GOVERNMENT IS <p> The people can only take so much from a government that is continually finding ways to control every aspect of our lives . There are so many rules , regulations and laws on the books that govern every aspect of our lives that its impossible to obey them all . This is actually what government counts on ! Ayn Rand said it best : <p> This is seen frequently when otherwise law abiding citizens who are " rude " or " non-compliant " with bully cops or illegal orders suddenly find them charged with a crime for " interference , " " obstruction , " or some other invented crime that did n't  exist until the officer created the circumstances for it to occur . This has been used on people doing nothing more than filming an encounter , refusing to speak , or trying to walk away from what was initially a consensual encounter they did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was initially arrested for resisting an arrest that never occurred in the first place . Then , the charges were changed to " interfering " with the unlawful police actions of being assaulted and disarmed in front of my son . In other words , no crime was being committed until the police officer created the circumstances where he could claim one . <p> Our government , for around 100 years , has precipitously found ways to regulate every aspect of our lives , steal our treasure , incrementally destroy our liberty . When anyone stands up to the micro and macro oppression , they are violently suppressed . When government screws up or suffers a violent backlash , they look for a scapegoat . Its everyone elses fault . Its guns fault . The constitution is outdated . If they could just have MORE control , they could fix the problems that their quest for control caused in the first place . If only they could take our guns . If only they could perform searches without warrants . If only we could listen in on their phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do all that , they could solve all of our problems . <p> Its plainly obvious that it does n't  matter how we vote , Republican or Democrat . The tyranny and government overreach grows with each new administration . Each party accuses the other of destroying the country . The irony is that they are both right ! The excuse for their ineptitude in creating crime , poverty , and chaos is always staring them right in the mirror . <p> They realize they cant do these things overtly , so they find fancy catch phrases and efforts that may sound good t o the people . " No fly lists . " " Terrorist watch lists . " " Common sense gun reform . " " Gun safety . " " National defense authorization act . " We need to ban people from buying guns if they are on the no fly list because " we cant have terrorists getting guns , can we ? ! " It sounds so great , but they do n't  define what a terrorist is . To some , the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To others , Open Carry Texas members are terrorists . To some , the Black Panthers and to others preppers and militia members . So , as great as it sounds and while no one thinks anyone should be able to murder another person what 's to stop the government after they 've been given this authority from simply labeling any political opposition as a terrorist or terrorist organization ? What 's to stop them from putting all of us on the no-fly list ? <p> Look what they did with the felon prohibition on having guns . The overt intent was to keep guns out of the hands of violent convicts . However , the law applies to ALL felonies . This means if you 're caught with a bald eagle feather that you found on the ground , you can be convicted of felony possession of that feather . You just lost your gun rights . Read your husbands email without permission to track an affair ? You can be convicted of felony hacking . If you get arrested for refusing to allow government agents to fondle your breasts , felony obstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refuse to leave a home that was passed down from your ancestors because of a flooding after a hurricane ? Felony obstruction and gun confiscation . <p> The fact is that if " felons " are too dangerous to be in society with a gun , why are they in society ? If someone is deemed too dangerous to fly on a plane , why are they safe enough to drive a car or walk the streets ? The problem is our accommodating and pampering penal system , not guns and not felons who have served their time and just want to get on with their lives having learned from their mistakes ( most at least ) . But , since it sounds so good to " keep guns out of the hands of felons , " most of us simply nod our heads in agreement with the infringement in the name of supposed " common sense . " Meanwhile , someone like Martha Stewart has no rights . <p> DO RIGHTS EXIST OR NOT <p> What all this boils down to is whether we , as citizens , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to protect those rights even when its inconvenient to government at any level . Agreeing to a little tyranny is no different than saying its okay to eat just a little dog poop in your brownies . No one wants ANY poop in their brownies and I hope they do n't  want any tyranny either . For too long , weve voluntarily given up our liberty in the name of " convenience " or expediency . I cant tell you how many people have attacked me for refusing to I 'd to a police officer when Ive done nothing wrong and I 'm just exercising a right . Yes , standing up for my 4th amendment right results in me spending 10 minutes or more during an encounter instead of 5 , but I 'm not willing to sacrifice my rights at any cost . Too many people are and they 're critical of those of us that are not . We are called " rude , " " disrespectful , " or worse . If you stand up for your 4th amendment right and the officer becomes demanding and forceful , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youre told " and surrender your rights , as minor as it may seem . No rights should treated lightly and given up so easily . Once you do , youve just set the new baseline so that the next infringement does n't  look so bad . <p> Do you know what is rude , though ? Having your 2nd amendment rights violated by being illegally disarmed just because a cop wants to talk to you . Do you know what is disrespectful ? Having your 4th , 5th and 6th amendment rights violated just because a government official says so . Where do we draw the line ? Is that line just handing over an I 'd when you have no duty to so that you can prove you 're not a felon ? Is it allowing a search of your vehicle to prove you 're not a drug dealer ? Is it allowing them to search your home , dressers , and closets to prove you 're not a child porn collector ? Is it allowing troops to be quartered in your home to show that you 're not an anti-government insurrectionist ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that its for the greater good while looking for a suspect ? <p> Look what happened during Katrina . <p> If we have rights , why are we so afraid to stand up for them no matter how small the infraction ? Why is our love for law enforcement so strong that we allow our rights to trampled ? Probably because it has n't  happened to you yet . Its easy to cheer on when other people are having their rights violated , but how hard is it to speak up when it is happening to someone else ? Its easy to armchair quarterback . I did it for years . I was that guy that said , " he did something to deserve it " or " he should have just done what he was told . " Isnt that what they did in Auschwitz ? When you boil it down to the root concept , is it really that much different ? <p> At some point , we need to take back the liberty that we 've given up incrementally for far too long . Its time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with everything it is because we are allowing it . We nod our heads approvingly under the banner of government brainwashing of " common sense . " We have stigmatized guns and gun owners in public to the point where we are supposed to be ashamed of owning them , much less carrying them , and even less carrying them where people can see them . Weve gotten to a point where government can carry any and as many weapons as they want , but we need to be disarmed or at least hide our guns for fear of being shot . Is that really how we should be living our lives : living in fear that if we make a wrong move , look a certain way , or exercise a certain right , we are taking the risk of being killed ? Is that really what it means to be a free people ? <p> Why is it okay for government to simply assume someone is a criminal because he/she carries a gun ? Why do we allow ourselves to be treated guilty first and innocent after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were innocent , why do we allow them to turn us into criminals when we refuse to give up our rights ? <p> All this said , nothing justified what happened in Dallas Thursday night . Nothing . Violence should never be used in an offensive capacity . Violence should only be used to defend against violence . At that point , the violence should be overwhelming to the point that the initiator of it thinks twice about ever doing it again . The 2nd Amendment is a wonderful protection of a pre-existing right , but its a right of last resort and its never meant to justify offensive use in my opinion . So , I do n't  want anyone to think Im justifying what happened in Dallas in any way whatsoever , because if I were there , I 'd be standing shoulder to shoulder with those officers or storming the parking garage to take the shooter out . <p> Our Founders went to war for much less than what we are facing today . Either defend liberty all of it or prepare for continued slavery . Were bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ourselves . Government is just doing what we allow them to do . Just look at what happened to California after the people continuously allowed the government to incrementally take away the rights people have fought , bled and died to protect little by little over time in the name of " public safety . " <p> I lost friends who thought they were fighting for liberty and our constitutionally protected rights . I will honor their sacrifice and not suffer a single infringement if there is a breath in me . When I am 80 years old ( If I 'm not assassinated by then ) , I want to be able to look at my kids and know that I either left them a better life or did everything I could to prevent what became of it .

@@96509450 @709450/ <h> The Tactical Pants Style Guide <p> At a glance , tactical pants appear to be a simple cargo . Yet upon closer inspection , one finds strategic placement of an array of pockets tailored for the real-life action figuresomeone ready to strike within a moment 's notice with all the necessary tools in reach . <p> These ++ber-durable trousers are far more than the average cargo pants . Reinforced with bar-tacks , gussets and some even coated with DuPont Teflon , tactical pants have become the everyday armor for those who put their lives on the line . Whether patrolling the streets or practicing at the range , men and women across the country select tactical pants as the choice operational wear . <p> However , these trousers did n't always hang in the closets of law officers , EMTs , FBI agents and military operators . Rather , they were first designed for those who opted to conquer the natural worldmountain climbers . Tactical pants were initially developed by Royal Robbins , an outdoor clothing company founded by an adventurous husband-and-wife duo . Years later , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avid climbers , found that the resilient pants could be used for more than scaling mountains . <p> Eventually , tactical pants made it all the way to the FBI Academy in Quantico , Va . And just like that , pants once used for recreation became a major player in workday uniforms . As a result , tactical trousers have become as ubiquitous as gun holsters and pocket knives in the tactical world . Today , a number of brands offer countless options of these pants in many different styles , fabrics and colors . The options , at times , can be almost overwhelming . Use this review to learn more about each brand to map out your next pants purchase . <h> Brand : 24-7 Series <h> 24-7 Series Tactical Pants <p> Highs : Pure pocket bliss with too many to even count . It 's symmetrical and extra roomy . <p> Lows : Its extreme tactical look might tip off the bad guys . <p> Verdict : For those seeking functionality that 's not exactly discreet . <p> Founded in 1950 , Tru-Spec by Atlanco began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BDUs . Still a family-owned business today , Tru-Spec entered the tactical pants game five years ago with its 24-7 Series line . This line filled the gap between hardcore tactical gear and an everyday cargo pant . <p> In order to differentiate the pants , 24-7 Series designers added pocket flaps with a slant . The slanted back pocket flap has less to do with functionality and is more of an immediate visual indicator of the pants ' uniqueness . Because of this , Kevin Cain , who served as Tru-Spec by Atlanco 's business development manager , said people can immediately tell a 24-7 Series pant when compared to others on the market . <p> Another feature that sets the trousers apart is its pocket construction . Although some tactical pants utilize patch pockets ( a pocket sewn onto the pants themselves ) , 24-7 Series pants have a thigh cargo pocket that physically expands to open further . The pants are also extremely symmetricalif there is a pocket on the right side , that same pocket will be mirrored on the left . This means that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he or she will have equal functionality . On both sides of the pants , there is a small knife pocket unique to the 24-7 Series . <h> Best Seller : 24-7 Series Tactical Pants <p> Pockets : A symmetrical pocket construction with 14 pockets total including two internal pockets and two knife pockets . Although the pocket material is sturdy , the color of the inside pockets on a khaki pair is two shades lighter . <p> Front pockets are extra deepmore than 1 foot to be exact with a 7-inch-wide opening . <p> Two rear pockets ( 7 inches long , 5.5 inches wide ) have a slanted flap with a Velcro closure as well as bellowed side gussets . Facing the rear of the pants , side gussets include Velcro closures so you can decide whether to expand or contract the pockets as necessary . <p> Fabric : 8.5-ounce , 100 percent cotton canvas . Its basket weave construction is typically stronger than other weave types and has a natural breathability . Pants are pretreated to prevent shrinkage and color fading . <p> Fit : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomier in all the right places . On a 34X34 pant , the front rise is 13.75 inches ; the back rise is 16.5 inches with a leg opening width of 8.5 inches . <p> Crotch construction : With no gusseted or diamond-shaped crotch , the pants use its elastic slider waistband to relieve the tension and prevent blowouts . By leaving out the crotch gusset , Tru-Spec is able to offer its pants at a lower price . <p> Waist style : The elastic slider waistband gives two inches of flexibility per side . Not only is this beneficial for movement , but it also helps with weight fluctuation . Five 2-inch belt loops can accommodate a belt up to 1.75 inches wide . <p> Reinforcements : Reinforced knee with built-in knee pad pockets . <p> Fly type : French fly with Prym snaps and a thicker brass-colored YKK zipper ( two sizes larger than the average zipper ) . <p> Colors : Black , coyote , dark navy , khaki , olive drab , stone . <h> Additional Styles <h> Lightweight Tactical Pants <p> The only difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . Every other element is consistent . The blend of 65 percent/35 percent poly-cotton ripstop gives the pants color longevity , color consistency and makes it more applicable to uniform wear . A DuPont Teflon coating prevents it from absorbing liquid and stains . <h> Simply Tactical Cargo <p> Made for the heavier-set man , these pants come in big and tall sizing up to a 60-inch waist . It features an elastic waistband and a traditional cut for a more tailored fit .

The buddy strap can snag on foreign objects at just the wrong moment . And again , 100 percent cotton is breathable but also notoriously fades , shrinks and wrinkles . <p> Verdict : Although 5.11 's tactical pants may be the first , there 's definitely a lack of innovation to further the pants ' functionality and quality . <p> When people think tactical pants , the first thing that comes to mind is 5.11 . That 's because 5.11 Tactical was built around the cargo trouser . Although a female mountaineer named Liz Robbins designed the first tactical pants for Royal Robbins , Dan Costa purchased the outdoor gear company and later sold it to found 5.11 Tactical . <p> The start-up 's flagship product was Royal Robbins ' popular 5.11 Pant . Named for the most strenuous rock climbing difficulty , 5.11 turned out to be the perfect pants for a number of high-pressure situations requiring serious mobility .

Its Velcro thigh pocket is large enough for a magazine , cell phone or knife , and its Velcro rear slash pockets are extra deep for extended mags , a baton and even a 15-inch flashlight . <p> As evidence of its rock climbing heritage , the back of 5.11 pants still feature a patented " buddy " or utility strap initially created to tote carabineers . Although some see no use for the strap , others have found it an excellent place to store ear protection or even a flashlight . Another unique feature of 5.11 pants is a built-in blousing system at the pants ' ankle , which can accommodate 500 cord . <p> The original tactical pants maker has no doubt expanded its brand through the years . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia , available in a range of seven colors ( gray , black , khaki , tundra , OD green , coyote brown and fire navy ) . <p> Even though 5.11 set the stage for tactical pants , some have come forward to criticize the original trousers . Online reviews show that there have been complaints about the 100 percent cotton pants fading too quickly and fitting incorrectly . Companies have even been founded to compete with 5.11 simply due to unsatisfied customers . Despite a few negative assessments , 5.11 remains the benchmark for tactical pants everywhere . <h> Best Seller : 5.11 Tactical Pants <p> Pockets : With just seven pockets ( symmetrical aside from the extra pocket on the left side ) and no hidden ones , these pants have the least amount of pockets in the lineup .

Slick features such as intelligent magazine storage and a stay-tuck liner add to their appeal . <p> Lows : Packed with features at a premium price . If that 's not what you 're looking for , move along . <p> Verdict : If intelligent storage options , durability and extreme functionality are high on your list , then these are the pants for you . <p> The fact that Blackhawk makes some of the most durable and feature-packed tactical pants on the market should n't come as a surprise if you know the company 's background . Founder of Blackhawk and ex-Navy SEAL , Mike Noell , was on a mission in Afghanistan when the strap on his issued backpack broke , falling onto a land mine that luckily did not detonate . Ever since , Noell vowed to make high-quality , functional and feature-rich products for operators that improve their performance rather than hindering it . <p> What sets Blackhawk tactical pants apart is the sheer number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing stitch that guarantees extra reinforcement . Upping the number of bar-tacks lengthens the assembly process , said Terry Naughton , who served as Blackhawk 's vice president of marketing . However , this is essential in creating long-lasting pants with secure belt loops and Velcro areas . <p> " If you laid all the manufacturers ' pants down next to each other , and you counted the number of bar-tacks in them , Blackhawk would have the highest number , " Naughton said . <p> Other special features include a stay-tuck liner , flexible waistband and gusseted crotch . Stay-tuck liners are a silicon grip inside the pants that keeps shirttails neatly in place . The flexible waistband is forgiving enough to allow for placement of your weapon and holster without having to buy a size up . The gusseted crotch allows for more range of movement without constriction .

Instead , the design pattern was made specifically with the tactical female in mind . Like their male counterpart , these pants are rugged , lightweight and equipped with well-thought-out storage options . <h> Women 's LT2 Tactical Pants <p> Fitted for a female 's body , these pants take style as well as functionality into account with their design . The Women 's LT2 tactical pants offer high-performance features , various functional pockets and a lightweight fabric . <h> Brand : Genuine Gear <p> Propper International , a supplier to the U.S. Military , introduced new tactical pants to its Genuine Gear discount sub-brand in July 2010 . In addition to BDU trousers , coats and shorts , the brand now carries the 10-pocket trousers at an ultra-low price point of $29.99 ( MSRP ) . This low price makes Genuine Gear tactical pants the most affordable brand on our guide . <p> Manufactured in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propper brand apparel is made . Compared to Propper 's original tactical pants , the Genuine Gear pants have several design differences . Its biggest distinction is the double cargo pockets , a design that creates two pockets out of one . Featured on the lower thigh of each side , the cargo pocket contains one pleated large pocket with a hook and loop fastener along with an open-top stash pocket behind . The open-top pocket allows for storage of larger items like a notepad , wallet or even a flashlight . <p> " I find that being able to drop tools into the pocket is helpful , " said Dan Bergeron , who served as Propper 's design director . " It is a great place to put things temporarily for easy access . " <p> Bergeron added pocket flaps with a hook and loop closure to the back pockets after receiving feedback from police officers and SWAT team members . The officers complained that , while the back pocket was a good place to store credentials , without a Velcro or button closure , it was n't secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty secure but probably not for credentials for an FBI agent or a Marshall , " Bergeron said . " The intent of the back pocket flaps was to give them something that was very secure but easy to reach . " <p> The new features on Genuine Gear trousers do n't stop at pockets . Propper 's previous tactical pant designs contained 35/65 percent poly-cotton blend , while the new pants boast 60 percent cotton and 40 percent polyester . Additionally , the trousers have a mid-rise fit that is less baggy than typical tactical pants with no pleats in the front . It 's comparable to dress pants or a class B pants . Additionally , a smaller elastic waistband makes it easier to find the right size . <p> Fit : The trousers have a mid-rise , straight fit that leaves out front pleats found on other Propper tactical pants . For a 34X32 pant , the front rise is 11.25 inches ; the back rise is 15.75 inches . The leg opening has a width of 8.5 inches . <p> Crotch construction : Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gusset . <p> Waist style : A 3-inch-long internal elastic waistband on each side allows flexibility and is far less substantial than Propper 's original pant band ( 7 inches long on each side ) . Six belt loops can accommodate belts up to 1.75 inches wide . <h> Brand : Propper <h> Propper Men 's Tactical Trousers <p> Verdict : Perfect for the frugal shopper who likes military-grade gear at an all-time low price . <p> For those seeking true military-grade tactical pants , look no further than Propper International . As one of the largest contractors for the U.S. Military , Propper 's level of quality control is bar none . After manufacturing BDUs for 25 years , it was a natural progression for the Missouri-based company to branch into the world of tactical trousers . <p> With a no-corner-cutting state of mind , Propper employs staffs who monitor and review fabric quality and production . And when something does n't meet its high standards ? It 's rejected . Even if it means the product line will be late to market or orders will go unfilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jim Guntli , Propper 's former Vice President of Sales " Western Region . " That is our greatest selling pointquality . That it is the highest . " <p> Propper 's tactical pants come in four styles and are manufactured in China . The various styles range in price from $24.99 to $49.99 ( MSRP ) and can be found in up to seven colors ( black , coyote , olive , dark navy , LAPD navy , gray and khaki ) . The manufacturer was one of the first to treat its pants with DuPontG Teflon- coating . This coating prevents staining from blood to water to coffee . <p> When compared to other manufacturers , Propper 's price points are the lowest . In addition to affordability , its lightweight tactical pants come with a matching belta feature offered by no other manufacturerand will soon be added to all canvas pants , too . The pant fabric blend of 65 percent polyester/35 percent cotton , 8.5-ounce canvas keeps the fabric from fading , shirking and wrinkling . While cotton might be more breathable , Guntli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As far as pocket configuration , Propper 's pants have the ubiquitous wallet pocket within a pocket . On its lightweight pants , there are two coin pockets , a cell phone pocket and nylon reinforcements to prevent knives or other objects from rubbing through the pants . <h> Best Seller : Propper Men 's Tactical Trousers <p> Pockets : The structure ( somewhat symmetrical aside from one extra pocket on the left-hand side ) features 10 pockets including a coin pocket located in the front right pocket . <p> Two front pockets ( 1 foot long , 6 inches wide ) are double stitched . On the khaki version , the inside pocket fabric is n't an identical color but a close match . It is not the same cotton canvas fabric yet is substantial enough to survive wear and tear . <p> Fabric : A blend of 65 percent polyester/35 percent cotton , 8.5-ounce canvas with a DuPont Teflon treatment . The polyester blend keeps it from fading , shrinking and wrinkling . <p> Fit : For a 34X34 pleated pant , the front rise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg opening width of 8 inches . <p> Crotch construction : There is no crotch gusset , but the feature could be added in the future . Propper said it has n't received a tremendous demand for that crotch type for its tactical pants . <p> Waist style : An elastic waistband expands and contracts with movement . Five belt loops around the pants can fit a belt up to 1.75 inches wide . <p> Reinforcements : Fabric is doubled at the seat and knees . <p> Fly type : A French fly with a Prym snap and a standard-size gold YKK zipper . <p> Colors : Black , khaki , dark navy , olive green . <h> Additional Styles <h> Chino Pants <p> In 2013 Propper introduced its Sweep collectiona collection made specifically with the purpose of creating tactical clothing that blends into the non-uniform environment . The collection features Propper 's version of a " tactical chino " called the District Pant . These pants , made of a durable polyester/cotton twill , have functional features hidden in a sleek , professional-looking design . They offer nylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your leg for better ergonomics and a kick panel at the bottom of the pant for extra durability . A utility pocket on the left-hand side can accommodate either a phone or a magazine . In addition to two back wallet pockets , there is also a hidden back pocket . <h> Lightweight Tactical Pants <p> Its fabric , a 6.4-ounce , 65 percent polyester/35 percent cotton ripstop , is the first noticeable difference between it and Propper 's flagship tactical pants . There are also two coin pockets , a cell phone pocket big enough for most smart phones , reinforced front pocket openings , extra-large belt loops and a D-ring . The pants also come with a belt . <h> Sonora Pants <p> Weighing in at only 4 ounces , these pants weigh even less than Propper Lightweight Tactical Trousers . These ultra-lightweight pants are made from 100 percent nylon ripstop material , which is a performance fabric that wicks moisture to keep you dry and comfortable during intense activity . For additional functionality , the pants are equipped with easy-access , slanted cargo pockets that sit high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thigh with zip closures , and back pockets store either a magazine or phone . <h> STL 1 Pants <p> The STL 1 Pants aim to combine athletic and tactical components . Inspired by athletic wear , the stretch nylon/spandex fabric of the STL 1 Pant is comfortable , breathable and moves the way you do to enhance your performance . The gusseted crotch gives you a greater range of motion while rapid-access angled cargo pockets keep your crucial supplies quickly within reach . These pants are n't blatantly tactical , yet they have more usable features than other more covert options , such as the STL 2 Pant . <h> STL 2 Pants <p> The STL 2 Pants are tactical pants in disguise as regular pants . The clean-cut design of these pants makes it hard to spot the cleverly concealed tactical features . These hidden features include inverted cargo pockets , expandable openings for boots and reinforced kick panels . The pants are made of the same stretch nylon/spandex as the STL 1 Pants and are also outfitted with a gusseted crotch . <h> Women 's Lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same features as the men 's version but were designed with a female in mind . <h> Women 's Tactical Pants <p> These pants have identical features to Propper 's original tactical pants except for its female fit . It 's made with an 8.5-ounce , 65 percent polyester/35 percent cotton canvas blend . <h> Brand : Under Armour <h> Under Armour Tactical Basic Pants <p> Lows : These pants lack the functional features many other pants offer . Luckily , Under Armour offers its Tactical Duty Pants , which step this style up to the next level of functionality . <p> Verdict : Made from high quality materials for high performance , it gets the job done without all the bells and whistles . <p> Under Armour is a brand recognized internationally for its innovative fabric and superior quality . Originally created for athletes , Under Armour was born in 1996 when Kevin Plank , a football player at the University of Maryland , got sick of having to change out of the sweat-soaked T-shirts he wore under his football pads and jersey .

Under Armour released its Tactical Duty Pant in fall 2012 . Because of the great success of the Duty Pant and a demand for a more entry-level pant , Under Armour released the Women 's Duty Pant and the Men 's Basic Tactical Pant in spring 2013 . <p> The most impressive feature the Tactical Basic pants offer is its fabric technology . Lightweight yet durable , the poly-cotton fabric has as durable ripstop quality to it . Coated with DWR resistant , the pants keep you dry without holding in water and getting heavy . <p> " We like to know that the quality that people expect from us still continues even though it 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourgia said . " We want to make sure that we provide the people who serve us with the best product out there on the market . " <p> The pants feature a seven-pocket design and comes in five colorsdark navy blue , marine OD green , black , desert sand and coyote brown . The front pant style is flat rather than pleated for what Bourgia described as a more modern look . <h> Best Seller : Under Armour Tactical Basic Pants <p> Pockets : With six symmetrical pockets and one right-side knife-pocket , Under Armour tactical pants , along with 5.11 's tactical pants , have the least amount of pockets than any other featured on our guide . All pockets are made with ripstop fabric for increased durability . <h> Additional Styles <h> Tactical Duty Pants <p> Under Armour takes it to the next level with its original line of tactical pants , the UA Tactical Duty Pants .

The fabric has a stretch to make it fit a woman 's form but not too much that it hugs too tightly . <h> Brand : Vertx <h> Vertx Men 's Tactical Pants <p> Highs : The pioneering fabric blend , discrete look , odd sizing and excellent fit set it apart . To top that , it 's the only pants out of the originals that does n't use Velcro closures . <p> Lows : This level of sleekness comes at a high price . <p> Verdict : Fashion-forward pants for the tactical trendsetter that easily transition from work to play . <p> The Vertx brand was created through a partnership between Fechheimer , a uniform manufacturer owned by Berkshire Hathaway , and Arc'teryx , an outdoor clothing and sporting goods manufacturer . In 2008 , the innovative brand developed tactical pants for a federal agency . The pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphold the discrete appeal of regular khakis . <p> Manufactured in Indonesia , Vertx tactical pants come in three different styles for both men and women . Most styles are offered in six colors : law enforcement black , khaki , desert tan , olive drab green , navy and MultiCam . However , the OA Duty Wear Pant is offered exclusively in navy , black and brown . The pants feature unique sizing that includes odd-numbered waist increments on certain inseams as well as articulated knees and hips . The nine-pocket pants set itself apart with a differentiated rise , a unique fabric blend and a specialized cut to accommodate firearms . <p> " It 's arguably the most comfortable pair of pants you can buy , " said David Walsh , who served as Director of Brand Management/Special Projects for Vertx . " The mobility of the pants is fantastic and the low visual profile . It is just cut better than the average pant . " <p> Increased mobility can be attributed to Vertx 's gusseted crotch , according to Walsh . It is cut in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fabric mix also plays a significant role in the level of mobility . With a high-quality fabric that 's 98 percent cotton and 2 percent Lycra , the blend gives a comfortable stretch but does n't make the pant appear too synthetic , Walsh said . When compared to the original tactical pant , which some call the " just-shoot-me pants , " the Vertx pants design is much more discrete in nature . <p> Although the pant may only appear to have two pockets , it really has nine , which adds to the pants under-the-radar appeal . The no-Velcro pocketing gives the pant an extra layer of stealth . Furthermore , hidden pockets within other pockets increase ability for discreet carry and keep items from rolling out . <h> Best Seller : Vertx Men 's Tactical Pants <p> Pockets : Nine pockets are designed in a way to keep gear from falling out without using Velcro or magnetic closures . <p> Fit : With lower rise when compared to other tactical pants , these nonpleated trousers are cut for mobility and comfort with an articulated knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise is 1 foot ; the back rise is 15.75 inches with a leg opening width of about 9 inches . <p> Crotch construction : A large gusseted crotch is cut in a specific way to reduce bulk in the seaming and boost freedom of movement . <p> Waist style : - An internal stretch waistband creates less bunching on the waist sides and stretches about one inch on each side . The pants feature unique sizing that includes odd waist increments of 33 and 35 on a 32-inch inseam . There are six belt loops that can fit a 2-inch wide belt . <p> Reinforcements : None <p> Fly type : Tack-button closure with an extra-wide bronze YKK zipper . <p> Colors : Black , desert tan , khaki , navy , OD green , MultiCam . <h> Additional Styles <h> Phantom Lightweight Tactical Pants <p> It took three years after the release of its original tactical pant for Vertx to release the much-anticipated lightweight version .

These pants have the same features as the original pant including a stretch waistband , notch pocket with concealment zipper on the right-hand side , low profile cargo pockets and Intelli-Dry technology . <h> Women 's Phantom Lightweight Tactical Pants <p> These lightweight tactical pants are the equivalent of the Men 's PL Tactical Pants but with a women 's fit . <h> Women 's OA Duty Wear Pants <p> Made for the female officer , these tactical pants have all the same features of the male duty pants but in a design made for a women 's form . <h> Women 's Tactical Pants <p> For its women 's line , Vertx focused on producing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer started with an entirely new fit blockit did n't just take a men 's pant and alter it .

@@96509456 @709456/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Ship To Be Named After Disgraced Ex-Marine John Murtha <p> According to Fox News and other sources , the Navy has decided to name one of its newest ships after former Congressman and Slanderer John Murtha . <p> The Navy is naming its newest San Antonio-class amphibious transport-dock LPD 26 for Murtha , the powerful chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee who became an outspoken and influential critic of the Iraq war . <p> Murtha died in February at age 77 after complications from gallbladder surgery . <p> San Antonio-class ships support Marines and can carry roughly 700 troops , their equipment and vehicles . They are usually named after cities ; the USS Murtha will be a break from that tradition . <p> Not only will it be a break from tradition , but it will absolutely be a slap in the face to the Marines forced to be assigned to the ship . As you may recall , Murtha slandered Marines in 2005 by calling them " cold-blooded murderers " and never apologized for it after EACH AND EVERY MARINE was acquitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected and purported to have all the " evidence " to defend his statements prior to any trial . <p> In an editorial to the Philadelphia Enquirer , Robert Greer , a Life Member of the Marine Corps League , had some pretty pointed words as well about the Navys Decision : <p> To the Editor , <p> Before we name the LPD 26 San Antonio-class amphibious dock ship after John Murtha we should first consider the impact that that act would have on those 700 Marines who would be asked to serve on that ship . <p> Major John Murtha was the S-2 Intelligence Officer for the First Battalion , First Marines in Vietnam . Serving under him in the capacity of forward observer/intelligence photographer was Sgt. Scott Camil , 1st Bn. , 11th Marines , attached to 1st Bn , 1st Marines . <p> At the Winter Soldier Hearings in 1971 , conducted by young Vietnam Veteran John Kerry , who later became the Honorable Senator from Massachusetts , Sgt Scott Camil gave testimony in regards to the conduct of Major John Murtha and the officers and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camils testimony reveals that Major John Murtha presided over a United States Marine Combat Unit that " cut off ears , cut off heads , called in artillery on Vietnamese villagers for games , randomly burned down the homes of innocent Vietnamese villagers and raped and sexually mutilated Vietnamese women with entrenching tools and tree limbs . " <p> John Murtha had a lifetime to defend himself and the Honor of the United States Marine Corps against these charges . Murtha did not defend himself . <p> In Marine circles it is widely believed that it was John Murtha who fabricated these bizarre incidents as part of Commandant David Shoups exit strategy from Vietnam . <p> Regardless of whether these atrocities really happened or were fabricated , Major John Murtha brought shame and dishonor on the United States Marine Corps . <p> I wonder if Major John Murtha was thinking about the atrocities that he himself committed in Vietnam when he accused our young Marines of killing Iraqis " In Cold Blood . " at Haditha , or was he just knowingly lying again for his own self interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LPD John Murtha " ( or as Marines call him " Porky the Vagina Mutilator " ) then take that ship out to sea unmanned and sink it . <p> No United States Marine should ever suffer the dishonor of serving on an acursed ship named after Major John Murtha . <p> Amen ! The Haditha Marines names and reputations were drug through the mud before they were even privileged enough to enjoy the rights they serve to protect were realized in the concept of innocence until proven guilty . I personally hope that Murtha is rotting in a painful and excruciatingly morose hell . No ship in any military outside landlocked Iran deserves to be named after this dishonorable waste of human flesh . And that 's my opinion . <h> 8 Comments on " Ship To Be Named After Disgraced Ex-Marine John Murtha " <p> After returning from Viet Nam in 1967 , I was as politically motivated as a fence postthen , that sorry sack of human ( I do n't  want to defile the word " animal " ) excrement named John Kerry ran for president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . <p> A looong time ago , I thought I was the only one that abhorred John Murtha . Evidently , NOT ! You both summed it up very well , " GruntforLife " and " bback . " <p> I do n't  know where Murtha is buried ( actually , he was n't buried he had to be screwed into the ground because he was so crooked . ) But , on 10 November , I WILL step outside my back door , piss on the ground and say , " This is for you , Murtha . You 're another sorry sack of excrement and may you rot in hellEX-Marine ! " <p> It is said that there are no " Ex-Marines " , only former Marines . Murtha is in the eyes of many an ex-Marine and he will be remembered as one who betrayed his country , his Corps and the brave warriors he lied about . <p> He sold out for promise of political gain and his own party reneged on the promised reward hed receive if he went public with the fabricated Haditha story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding his legacy and standing as a Marine , and apparently he felt it worthwhile to accept the risk . <p> Risk what , you might ask ? <p> He risked becoming what he actually has become a person so reviled among Marines that his name will forever be associated with words such as " treason " , back stabber , coward " to name a few . Of course , he realized that his status in the Marine Corps would be permanently assigned to the Persona Non Grata category . <p> I am quite sure that Marines will find out where this pathetic excuse for a man is buried and will begin a new Marine tradition pissing on his grave each year on November 10th , which is the birthday of our Corps . <p> Murtha went to his grave knowing something that I would fear worse than death itself the knowledge that Marines past , present and future would never again consider him to be a fellow Marine . Sounds a bit corny perhaps to non-Marines , but to us , nothing could be worse than to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marine " . <p> I must agree with Mr. Greer about the outrage that this action brings . The dishonor John Murtha has brought to the Marine Corps is unforgivable . And to think that the same honor was given to Cpl . Jason Dunham , MOH recipient , makes it even worst in my opinion . I feel for those Marines who will have to sail on that ship .

Yon never mentions these critical points . <p> Yons point that the Army should arm and remove the red cross from its MEDEVAC aircraft fails to acknowledge larger issues . Doing so would place the US outside its commitment to conducting MEDEVACs under the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions and moral norm for how Western nations identify their aircraft dedicated to medical evacuation . <p> Furthermore , the Pedros 7.62 mm or .50 cal . machine gun does provide a level of self-protection but it is not on the level of an accompanying AH-64 Apache carrying 30mm cannon and rockets . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firepower and protection ; something our Soldiers take confidence from when scrambling under fire to evacuate wounded comrades . <p> As for factual inaccuracies , Yon states that it took 65 minutes to evacuate the Soldier who subsequently died . Not true , the official operational logs show that the mission was wheels down ( WD ) at the medical treatment facility in 59 minutes ; and the MEDEVAC aircraft did n't  come from Kandahar , the Dustoff was launched from nearby FOB Pasab and linked up with its armed Apache escort from Kandahar enroute to the Point of Injury ( POI ) . The fact is that despite extended distances and enemy forces in the area , this evacuation was accomplished under the US standard of one hour . Of the 2240 MEDEVAC missions conducted in the RC-S area of operations since 1 Nov 2010 only 1.5% were Out of Standard and 0% of those were assessed to having a clinical impact on the patient . <p> Yon also states that commanders on the ground have no discretion to call for a Pedro over an Army medevac an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails to mention that all requests for air evacuation are called into a central point in each Regional Command called a Patient Evacuation Coordination Cell ( PECC ) . The PECC receives a MEDEVAC request , then determines the quickest way to get the Category A ( CAT A ) casualty from the Point of Injury ( POI ) to a Medical Treatment Facility ( MTF ) that can provide the appropriate level of medical care for the injuries suffered . The ground force commander does not have the capacity to make this call while in the close fight . The system is designed to allow for the most efficient response across the battle space with the assets of not only our MEDEVAC aircraft , but all rotary wing assets . Commanders understand the requirement for rapid evacuation of our wounded Soldiers and every effort is made to execute the MEDEVAC mission safely and effectively . The highest survival rates in the history of armed conflict bears out this fact . In the RC-S area of operations there have been 2240 MEDEVAC missions since 1 Nov 2010 with a 98% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factual errors have done a disservice to our Soldiers and all those who care about them . These inaccuracies may unnecessarily cause some to doubt the US medical evacuation system in Afghanistan . Further , it could undermine Soldier confidence in what should most certainly be described as the worlds finest battlefield evacuation system . <p> We did not always have Apache escort sometimes it was another Blackhawk with 7.62 door gunner and at certain times after picking up casualties we would not stay with the escort as they were not as a fast as our aircraft . Secondly it states in the sorry ass Geneva convention that our aircraft can not carry crew served weapons . Weapons such as the Squad Assault Weapon ( SAW ) are not crew served weapons on should be on all medevac aircraft . We are the only nation I know of that Flys around with the big red cross painted on the aircraft that says shoot here . Since the transition of medevac companies to a single standing unit to being brought into the fold of the general service aviation brigade ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating procedure to stupid , or just do n't  care figuring that if an unarmed medevac big gets shot down it would outrage the country and help the propaganda arm of the military . I knew , worked with and lived with Bryan for many years on Deployments and can say without any hesitation or doubt he was and still is in my mind a true HERO and the best Flightmedic I ever had the luck to work with . <p> This article shows how much mass media will twist and leave out information and details to make their story sound realistic , and how ever they want it too . This is disappointing seeing as they are basically disrespecting the people who are trying to protect us . <p> Mass media changes too much to make the story more hard hitting , the way the reporter left out very important information that showed the MEDEVAC system working as it should makes you think what else they change . 
@@96509459 @709459/ <h> Convicted Scammer Now Using Military to Target Women <p> UPDATE 6 Oct 2014 : Here are a few current pictures of Link or LJ or whatever he calls himself these days . Link McCormick ( LJ McCormick ) must be stopped . He is still scamming people in Central Texas and Oklahoma areas . He was arrested yesterday in northwestern Oklahoma . If you have information about this man , please contact me at **25;0;TOOLONG <p> On April 16 , 1988 , Link Joe McCormick enlisted into the Army National Guard in St. Paul , MN , as a member of A Company , 3rd Battalion , 3rd Infantry . He had impeccable career that ended when he was discharged as a Private on February 1 , 1989 . His numerous decorations and medals include the Marksmanship Badge with Rifle Bar . Here is a copy of extracts from his DD214 : <p> But , that 's not how his friends on Facebook know him . On Facebook , McCormick ( who also goes by " Mike " ) is a decorated war veteran of multiple conflicts , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a veteran of 3rd Rangers Battalion . He claims to be an Army Ranger who was shot down in a helicopter over Mogadishu , Somalia . The truth is that he served time in Stillwater , Minnesota prison for assault . He fooled a lot of Vietnam veterans , online and in person , who said he was an amazing con-man . He has had many convictions for swindle , felony credit card theft , assault on women , and terroristic threats involving a weapon . He had an Army uniform with patches and medals . He wore a Purple Heart medal . He had a Ranger " coin . " He also claims to be a retired Army Major with over 21 years of service . Here is the shadow box he has on his Facebook page : <p> Its impossible to read the plaque because of the resolution , but some of the first indicators that this guy is a fraud is that the rank does n't  go any higher than Captain . He claimes to have a Silver Star , but does n't  show up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to have retired 3-4 months ago , but is n't in the Army retired personnel database . <p> I was first informed of this guy by a woman who has been scammed out of nearly $1300 from this dude . This is n't your typical Nigerian Scam . Its an actual American who is using his fleeting experience in the military to befriend woman and convince them to give him money . He claims to be a father whose wife left him and took all his money . While he s trying to fix things with the Army retirement system , he needs a little here and little there to make ends meet . Women typically send about $40 a week or so to help pay for food and his cell phone bill . <p> The problem is once women get an idea that he is a fraud , he gets very profain and abusive . When I contact him on Saturday , he went into full rage mode right off the bat . <p> I can not print what he said for the new minute of so of his ranting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot . She want your ****** *** in her mess " and on and on and on . Boy , did I send him into a tizzy . He then tries to pull rank on me by saying I better watch myself because he s a retired 0-4 . I asked him why he was n't in the database , then , but I 'm not sure he heard me over all his yelling . On multiple occasions he asked if I knew anything about the UCMJ as an apparent threat to me for talking the way I was to a retired officer and called me an online commando . <p> By this time , I had already done my homework and located this guy . So , if you ever come across someone named Mike McCormick , or Link Joe McCormick , or Michael OMalley McCormick , he s a fraud . Here are the pictures he s using : <p> Keep in mind that these photos are NOT of the real Mike McCormick . These are just the photos he stole from a REAL Ranger who was able to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never do . The REAL person in this photo is enjoying his life outside the military in Washington State , enjoying the honor he truly deserves . <p> To the women being scammed by this guy , you need to contact the FBI immediately with all the information you have . I already have a LOT of identifiable information that is being passed to them already , including his arrest photos . Again , there is an easy way to tell a scammer when dealing with Soldiers . If they ask for money no matter what they ask for they are a scammer . And if he really is a Soldier asking for money , he s a loser and needs to be dropped as well . This one is actually an American , so we can put his rear behind bars again for a LONG time . <p> I received a friend request form a Kanen Bentley who claims to be in the US Army a commander with four stars I noted on his collar . Station in Bagdad Iraq . to cut it short I usually only let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspicious of this one after the usual your beautiful in so many ways theme . Wanted to live in Australia . Apparently born in Corpus Christi Texas . The photo look genuine enough so think he make have stolen someones I 'd so thought you might like to know . I have defriended him so hope this help others . No harm done as I became suspicious quickly . <p> Hello to all , I have recently accepted a friendship request on Facebook from a certain Donovan Plasse . We have talked by FB messenger , unfortunately I do n't  have a copy of our conversation because Facebook notified me is no longer available because it was identified as abusive or marked as spam , in just 1 day . However , I gave that guy my mobile number . I hate myself for doing this . He said was born in Waco , Texas , but now is in Afghanistan ( being in the Army ) , 43 years old , divorced because his wife wanted his money , 2 kids and 1 adopted , asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Told him a few things about me like age , where I live , what do I do for a living , how many sisters I have , parents , etc . I used short phrases and he wrote me poetry . Thanks to a FB user who shared his picture ( and who blocked me because I sent her a message telling her I think he is a scammer ) , I found some accounts using the same profile picture : Donny Plasse , David Plasse , Mike Plasse . On google+ he uses the Martin Plasse name LONG ... and his gmail is m.plasse997@gmail.com . Reported David and Donny Plasse account at FB as fake profiles so I do n't  know if they are still active . I do n't  know his real identity . I do n't  judge him , but he disappointed me . Being kind and good at heart people take advantages . I just wanted to meet new people , honourable ones . Sorry if I made grammatical mistakes , but English is not my mother language . <p> I have been just talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , New York from Houston Texas and serving as Staff Sergeant in the Army a Coastgurad off Syria .

Thanks . <p> I have posted my story two weeks , and still my story of my scammer has not been posted yet , is it still under moderation ?

Stationed in Tamale , S. Africa &amp; is dire need of money to pay his high internet bills ! First he wanted my personal info &amp; I was like who in f*ck do you think I am ?

He stayed with us for 2 months before we caught on to his shit and he took off running . That is him and he needs to be caught . Hopefully by a few REAL military heroes and accidentally misplaced . <p> I encountered him years ago when MySpace was popular . He told me his wife died shortly after the birth of his son . Years pass and then I hear from him again , this time he s in Hawaii even had a roommate , told me a gf in Indiana had his son because she worked for the gov. He s very volatile when confronted . Told me he had no teeth I 'm front because a bomb exploded . I keep getting emails but nothing personal to get an IP , just a generated email . Please stop him , he scares me . <p> John Graves started texting me in Oct. 5,2014 . He told me right off he love me and wanted to make a life with me when he got back home to Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had three cars , rented a big apartment , his parents were died , had no family . Then he started asking for money for one thing and another.I kept saying no ! <p> I just talk to him , he was using John Graves name until I ask him what his real name was and he said Cole . Then I ask him if his name was Mike , he said it was Mike Cole . He wanted me to send money to and Awal Jamal Seen in the Country:West Africa/Ghana City:Tamale N/R Zip Code : 00233 <p> Hi I have uncounted this idiot talking himself up on Facebook pages in Australia claims to be gods gift to the American Army , we are all over this prick like flys to hot shit . We are waiting for this piece of shit to resurface and we will give him a hiding . Ass Clown ambush is set we are having him booted off every veterans page in Australia . <p> I remember talking to him onlineHe told me that he was a Major , and a ranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorry if its choppy My memory is n't all that good , so I 'm writing it as it comes to me . Also that he taught College ROTC at BC . He was surprised that I knew the ROTC patch . He showed me the same shadow box as the one that was pictured . He also told me that he went into the Reserves and did n't  keep his major rank , and was a SGT or something like that . Then said that he was going to retire shortly and that hed get the benefits of a Major yet he s claiming to be a SGT something in the reserves . There were only a few things he told me , I do n't  remember it all , if you need to contact me , please send me an e-mail and I 'll get back with you . Thanks , and I hope that this helps . <p> well he is at it again and here is his picture ! ! ! LONG ... and what do you know LJ ? let 's see what i know ! i know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! i know you have been convicted of felonies ! and i even saw the mug shot ! i know that there are over 30 women who claim that you have scammed them out of money and one woman even claims you raped her ! i know you told one woman that you had a 10 year old daughter and gave the same reasons that you have not seen her as you told me and my family that you have not seen your son ! you claim to have been in combat yet i cant find you anywhere on the dod sight for wounded warriors ! you also claim to have been a major in the army yet your box of medals show nothing higher then a captain ! you claimed the bus company lost your luggage but after speaking with them they claim you never checked any luggage in ! i also cant find your name on any business license in west virginia that has you listed as the owner ! i 'm still looking into that ! also the little lies you told my militia group about me being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then have all this evidence that your a criminal ! so you scammed a 2 month place to stay out of me and my family ! tried to break up me and my wife of 25 years and when we started looking into you and my wifes co-worker started asking questions about you you got all upset and said " i do n't  like being sniped " ! ! ! i wonder why you do n't  like people looking into your past ! ? oh let 's not forget about the supposed home for orphans you lived in ! and how you had a choice to go into the military or jail at the age of 17 ! let us also talk about the the minnesota criminal system and how much jail time you did in juvy ! ? your big on how you said you went to CJs home and threatened him and he refused to come to the door ! and how he lied about his military carrier but i found him the the database and could only find a 1 tear stint in the national guard for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these transfers back and forth to active duty as you claim ! also i never asked for a dime while you were living here for free and eating my food wearing my clothes and shoes ! so stop telling people you gave me $6,000 ! you did n't  have a penny to your name and made dam sure we knew it ! for 2 months you had 1 piece of mail and if you were a vet you would have had your disability/retirement check sent to my addy so you would have money to get on your feet ! or at least had a bank card where the check was being direct deposited into so you would n't have to live off of my generosity ! now all this being said if you wish to dispute anything in this comment please feel free to come over to my door like you did to CJ and i would be happy to discuss it ! but somehow i do n't  think a coward like you would be willing to return the the scene of your crimes and face your accuser ! now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAMILIES HAVE DRAMA ! if you actually had a family and children you would realize that ! now to clear this up a little further ! you stayed in my home while my wife was in the hospital and extremely sick ! and during her subsequent surgeries ! and even after my diagnosis of cancer you still stayed and took advantage of my family ! you are one big POS ! my best advise to you would be to run away little girl this is one wolf you do n't  want to fuck with anymore and my bite is much much worse then my bark ! <p> So a guy names Paul Roscioli just friended me on facebook claiming that we knew each other at some point . Everything he said seemed fishy so I did some reverse searches and took the pictures from his profile pics and searched them in google . I found this site . The picture of the tall soldier standing in the desert is in his collection of photos . He claims to have a brother names Jeff Roscioli , some family living in Doylestown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery Mall , and to have grown up around this area . I have no idea how he knew about the changes that have occurred in this area without actually being here , but he did . He claims to be a Captain with the Army Rangers and to have 25 enlisted men report to him . <p> I only had one facebook message chat with him so I do n't  know what he is after , but he claims that he is in Fort Drum now , and transferring to Fort Dix , NJ in 4 months . He says he has 1.5 years left and then wants to be a teacher . He claims to have his masters in education from University of Phoenix . I have reported his account to Facebook , but we all know it wo n't do much ! <p> Link Joe McCormick is short , around 55 . His weight fluctuates depending on how well he is being fed by the people that he mooches from . Medium brown hair , brown eyes . most of his front teeth are rotted away . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He travels around to different states depending on who he can con out of a bus ticket . He grew up in Minnesota . He knows each place he lives is only temporary until people catch on that he is a con artist so he is always online looking for his next victim . <p> I can not believe how much this man has gotten around . He must live online . <p> I spoke with him off and on for about a year . Nothing ever came of it , Thank God . I do n't  allow men who lose their temper over the dumbest $hit to remain in my life . Nor do I allow ANY man to speak to me in such a demeaning way . He s lucky he was n't in my presence or I would have attempted to castrate . I 'm thinking the women he s scammed out of money , or broke hearts of should ban together and lure him to a hotel room where there are a dozen real Rangers waiting for him . I 'm sure they would have something to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete psycho and pretending he s one of them . It shines them in a negative way by association and I respect the HELL out of the Military . <p> This is an email I was a part of a while back . I guess an ex hacked his email account and sent the following message to everyone in his address book . I unfortnately was one of his contacts , but I did n't  respond or really care . I thought it was hilarious actually . <p> Ladies please be ware Mike is playing you . he is looking for a free ride use your own judgement . do not send him money if he loves you he will have his own money to come see you he just left michigan as he was talking to other woman he said I was his sister . ok right . not I also fell for his bullshit . he now has left for hawii. you poor lady i know you paid for his ticket please get him out do n't  allow him to take any thing from you . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads up whoever this is but i have not had contact w/ mike in almost a year nor do i plan to . <p> ( ANOTHER CONTACTS RESPONSE ) : well he told me that he was in iraq right now and has been for about a year . he gets mad at me when i do n't  want to commit to him . like he wants a relationship with no effort on his part at all .. i knew something was up that 's why i did n't  trust him . he gave me some sad story of his wife passing away . now its just his son and him . and he s needing a loving mother for his child . i 'm curious what the truth is . <p> ( YET ANOTHER CONTACTS RESPONSE ) : I received the same story SXXXXXa . When I was n't empathetic enough , he became abusive via chat . Spouting off racially insensitive remarks . <p> ( A CONTACT WHO THINKS HACKING IS NOT COOL ) : Seriously ? You hacked the guys account . What ever the misgivings you had with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Besides all of that , please got back to the 7th grade and relearn your grammar and spelling . <p> ( A CONTACTS RESPONSE ) : wow i 'm shocked . The lies , he told me that he lived in san diego cali , and his son was being taken care of by his dead wifes parents while he is in iraq , he got really verbally aggressive with me when i just wanted to be friends with him . it was like relationship with him or nothing . i always thought it was kind of weird how he never had any new pictures . after knowing him for like 5 years ive only seen the same old poor quality photos . i thought for awhile that maybe he just stole someones pictures . also was curious why he would only try to call me late at night maybe 2 am. he added me on facebook then wrote me 2 days ago and asked me if i was done trying to be with jokers and ready for a real man lol <p> ( A CONTACTS RESPONSE ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he wrote me on facebook a moment ago and called me 2 faced and said he was going to delete me. lol sounds like he s been playing games with everyone . whoever hacked his email thanks for the heads up . We ladies got to stick together . he got exposed for his lies and now he can run and hide with his tail between his legs . Mike- your getting too old to be playing lil boy games . seek help ! <p> That is not a picture of Link Joe McCormick . Wrong birth date and name and the picture does not look like him . Link Joe McCormick has a much more angry piggie look . His birth date is 01/25/1971 according to http : **36;27;TOOLONG which is the Minnesota Trial Court Public Access ( MPA ) Remote View website . I should know- the case is on there from 1997 when I sent his butt to prison . Happy hunting and stay safe folks . <p> I met this guy in the summer of 2010 , he only conned me out of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his next con sprung for a plane ticket , poor girl . I feel fortunate that I was not assaulted as others were . I caught on quick to some of his bull as my father was retired Navy and I know of the benefits military servicemen and women can get . <p> My friends and I knew Link McCormick in St Cloud around 1992-1993ish . He was arrested ( ? ) with terroristic threats on his live in girlfriend , he raped one of my friends , and was just a complete leech . He was lying about being a Ranger way back then , his story then was that he was in Grenada and his stories completely matched those from the " Eyes Behind the Lines " vietnam biographies from some 101st rangers . <p> I have no problem being contacted regarding this sociopath , he s a danger to women and friends . I would n't doubt if his violence has escalated in his 20 years of victimization . <p> OMG I can not believe this ! Thank you to the blogger for putting this out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years . He was separated , has a son . On deployment , ect . Weve talked on the phone but that is as far as things went . Then I had n't  heard from him in a couple of years until tonight . I get a message from him . And everything that you posted is what he was telling me . I had known him as Mike , but tonight he said it was Link McCormick . So I googled it , momma did n't  raise no idiot , and low and behold this came up . He was telling me how his wife cheated on him and that he was in jail , and he is retired as a major with 21yrs service and just waiting for his pension . He sent me a picture . States that he is living in Delaware Ohio with friends . And would like to start a relationship with melol yeah right ! <p> So now my question to you all how can I scam the scammer ? What can I do to get this guy arrested for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things I 've done successfully in the past . I lead them along for awhile . When they start asking for money , I appear genuinely interested in helping them . Tell them you want to send the money , but the Western Union or Moneygram office near you wants a fee that you cant afford . For example , if they are asking for $1500 , tell them that you can help them but you ONLY have $1500 and your local office is demanding a $50 fee first to make sure you are sending to a legitimate account . Tell your scammer that if they can send you the $50 , you can send them back $1550 the $1500 they asked for and the $50 " fee " they gave you . Then , walk away knowing you just took them for $50 and move on . I 've collected about $350 that way and donated it all to charity . <p> Would a military uniform ever have there first name only ? Ive been taking with a staff sergeant named jolley William , gut says he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has name on uniform as jolley . <p> ad cj do n't  ya beg for money for soldiers angels . ya give a total of 28 cents on the dollar to soldiers and the rest is for ADMIN expenses and you 're most certinly on the board of DIRECTORS along with several milbloggers and ya basicly buy surplus gear from you 're sponsor as a kickback. check out charitywatch , com and look up soldiers angels ratings .. its terrible and CJ collects along with the daughter or is she a niece or cousin of general Patton they buy overpriced boots for the troops downrange WHO DO NT need them from they 're sponsors . and Cj how many times have ya been forced to stop blogging lol how many times have ya been called BS .. and ya then call the accuser a fake a fraud a scammer when you and you 're chronies took in in 2011 12 million yet only 28% of that went downrange LOL <p> What 's funny Cj is you 're also being investigated for scamming tons of Money via soldiers angels and i have several articles about you 're crediblity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an M9 .. ya want some real info on CJ grisham how he lies when called on his bs and his Soldiers angels scams check here . <p> http : **28;65;TOOLONG oh and let 's not cjs PTSD claims to get sent home after his 4 months in afghanistan due to his COMBAT STRESS yet the next day he s at a godsmack concert while he left his comrades at Bagram. and his accusations of SEVERAL who call him out for being a blowhard and an outright liar or how he also accused Micheal Yon and Paul Rieckhoff the chairman of the IAVA fakes yet was busted .. see folks cjs crediblity is n't too good he s a bully at least and a liar at best.ya ever wonder how he obtains basicly folks dd-214s or portions of 201 files andd edits them . <p> Obviously , you 're free to comment here . Care to back up your claims that I 'm being investigated for scamming money out of whomever ? Obviously , you left this comment two years ago , so what happened to the " investigation ? " <p> pls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual scammer ? or is it a case of his I.D . being stolen . as I have an address and name in nigeria , i will be reporting pls let me know if u have this or any other info . many thanx. gloria . <p> Still , LJ , Link , Michael .. whatever your name is all these other people sure have enough to say about you , and I myself have SEEN you use the photos shown here that belong to and are of other people . There may be one photo of you on your now defunct FB account that was really you , and its PAINFULLY obvious that it is NOT the same person in the other photos you flashed at all of us on a certain FB page . All the testimonies from women who have posted here match up perfectly to what these guys are saying . I am not affiliated with ANYONE on this page and do not know the creators/admins here , yet I followed this link that a friend of mine came up with after typing your " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word you said to me reinforced exactly what they are saying . The medals and ranks shown in the shadow box do NOT match up with what you say you are . You are pathetic excuse for a human being . <p> The above photos are of my husband ! We were sent to this site and article by a friend . We first heard of " Mike " about a year or two ago . We could not believe someone we have never known somehow got a hold of photos I have never even seen of my husband . My husband is present in the two bottom photos only . However we too have seen the first top photo as well . This is beyond CRAZY . I just pray my husband does n't  get arrested one day for mistaken identityI guess that is what youd call it ? ! ? ! <p> There is no 3/3 and has n't  been since the 3/3 was deactivated . The 3/3 was an Army Reserve unit , attached to the 205th Inf . Bde , as a round out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BNs of the 3rd Infantry Regiment , are the 1st and 4th BN which are part of the Military District of Washington , and the 2nd BN , which is assigned to FT Lewis . For those that do n't  know , the 3rd Infantry Regiment is known as " The Old Guard " . <p> At no time in history , has a unit of " The Old Guard " been National Guard . If he had been 3/3 , you would see the buff strap and Regimental crest in his shadow box , as those are not available to non-members . <p> wow . 20 years ago i could n't even convince anybody i was in the army . the town i lived in must be a retirement choice for the special ops community since my bar had 2 green berets and one seal . they would drone on about the people they killed , top secret missions and their medals . " cowboy " threw his medal of honor away when we pulled out of nam these are the guys who doubted my service . one night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i asked for proof . there was outrage ! the seal actually had his 214 . it said he qualified as a radioman on a destroyer and served 2 years . he had a vietnam service ribbon . when i said a seal would probably have more stuff , well , of course it was all top secret ! then the bartender told me to stop stirring up the nuts . that 's the type of contempt these guys should be treated with . i served 3 years active and 2 in reserves . got an air assault badge , army of occupation medal and an arcom , which i feel silly about because a general just happened to be on the range when i was shooting . i had a great time , but i kept my watch and held my slack , which is something to be proud of . my brothers say i was a good soldier . still , its pretty boringi need to re-invent myself ! teaching mixed martial arts to rangers ? as far as scamming money , maybe i should just post pics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> hi i need info i 'm talking to a nelson tyson smith i really need to know if he is a military scammer he has shown me a national i 'd for the us but it had hitler on it and a germany symbol would n't thingk that woul be on a usa i 'd card he is 51 has lost his parents and wife he has a daughter i 'm not sure what to think i need help <p> Melissa nelso Tyson Smith is a scammer in the first place from what I understand it is illegal for US Military to scan and send their Military I 'd to anyone a real US Military member has said it on this blog many times this is a West African scammer after your money delete and block him please as he is a fraud and what Jennifer said is the truth.Anonn <p> I came into contact with this guy via Twitter in the Supernatural fandom , he claimed his name was Tommy . Though he never asked for any money , he held a trivia contest and said the winner would be sent a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was going to mail it to me . I sent my address for him to mail it , but so far nothing has shown up , and I have my doubts it will . I 'm hoping if this is the guy because the photo above is the one he gave me .. that he was caught before he could use my address in any way . <p> Unfortunately he is still at it , I know because I was one of the women he just recently been verbally abusive LONG ... is his facebook account , and it is still active . He is a very verbally violent man ! I never gave him money or anything , but we were friends on facebook . He is a scam , he was supposed to help a fellow model and I out as we were unaware of what kind of person he was . In order for him to have had helped us , he began asking us personal questions , such as our address and such . Well one night I had made a post , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts over my post and posting very mean things about me on my post . He started making threatening comments and was also trying to make himself sound like he was all high and mighty just because he CLAIMED he was in the military Ladies watch out . He tried making my model and I go against each other , may I remind you my model and I are good friends as well . This guy is CRAZY AND INSANE . <p> From what my co model has told me , that same night Mal Hombre Cockroach attacked me on my post , he was also telling my co model that her husband was fake and a liar . I personally have met her husband , and they are both very nice people . He is just absolutely crazy ! He sit there and told my model that her husband had no military background , which by the way is a lie because her husband WAS in the military . Not only did he try and create a wedge between my model and I but he also tried creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attempts worked . <p> i belong to a site called myyearbook.com . everyday i catch a handfull of scammers. most are ones posing as military personnel . i have become very very good at seeking these posers out before they even put on thier show/act so to speak . one right now claims to be a military captain by the name of garces george . he wanted money to pay off his colonel thomas holmes for papers to send him home . he was very angry when i told him that our military soldiers are not wimps and if he was a real u.s. soldier , he is to stay and do his time . so anyways , i have been talking with him for a month now . he thinks i am very much in love with him . such chrm this man expresses . he says he is in afghanistan and will be there the next 5 yrs , if i do n't  help him get $2000.00 to pay this colonel . he even gave me the name and other infop of this colonels secretery to western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names i will say like jeff murphy , colin sayers and many more . if you know of a site in which i can get on to help others and post pictures of these people or the soldiers they are posing as , please let me know . i will be glad to give all the information i have . <p> I am an actual U.S. Army Ranger ( class 07/01 ) and would love to sit down with this guy to have a nice little " Chat " . He s obviously lacking in the self esteem department and needs to be validated by being revered as an elite human being . The fact that he is scamming people is just downright evil . Do n't  worry , though ; what goes around comes around . <p> I just found him again on a website called OkCupid . He put the first picture on this page along with another picture of a man who was killed in Iraq named , Michael Cerrone . I 'm glad he was n't able to get anything from me . So scary . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him holed up in a hotel room tonight ( Sept 22 , 2011 ) in New Jersey . Tomorrow I 'm shipping him out of my life.unless I have to go thru legal channels first . <p> Please give me info on this man for months I have tried I see as late as June some people knew him well I need to know more .

Jonny Rellinger was writing tome and took me in big and I lost money to him , before hand I was talking to a David Bromley11@yahoomail.com He said he was a art dealer and travelled the world but camed from Australia said he was 47yr old .

I never heard from him untill tuesday of this week after I had found out about my scammer . After I had come on here and read I knew what to look for , ( God I wish I d known 6 months ago about it all ) When so called David said " hello How is everyone around you " Alarm bless chimed ! ! Jonny Rellinger scammer Always used that sentence . I had a conversation with david ? ? who said he was still in china , I asked about his sons college and he went quiet for 10 mins he came back and said some one had been at the door I mentioned that I thought he had been in hotel and he said he had a place of his own lol i asked the name of college again in Adelaide Australia and he said what college then quickly said Lincoln North Adelaide I was laughing at him so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many people has made me so angry I look after my terminally i 'll father , and even this has effected me .. I have my health and love of my children I am broke lost all my saving and it hurts me to think he will now steal my identity and the photos of some of my family I have sent and even my pets and father , I can only pray that he will one day face the justice System . I am a British woman .. I just feel so sad for all those people who have had their identity stolen from these scum bags <p> Yes , I have a scammer also . Jeffrey White Abizaid , jeffabi1@hotmail . He claims to be in Kabul , Afghanistan , son Kelvin " Kells " , other names he mentioned are Constance Botchery , Desmond , Alex Schofield , Shadrach Michson-Yeboah . He also is going by James , and Jeff Johnson . He sure is a smooth talker . Love to nail him . <p> I just found out that the army man I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scammers. the name he is going by is Brian Wood . Stationed in Afghanistan . Has cute little blonde boy . Wife died in car crash earlier in year . Couldnt acess his money till he got the states . His son is in UK with wifes parents . He did n't  get anything from me except some dignity . His email is **26;95;TOOLONG . He s real sweet talking . He now also has mobile phone . I saw that as I deleted his ass ! ! ! <p> I have been emailing and chatting with the first man on your wall of shame that has the child and you refer to him as Terry Perry Knox . He calls himself David Knox , email address davidknox49@Gmail.Com and davidknox49@yahoo.com . He prefers to use Google hangouts to chat 2-3 times a day . I clicked on your site accidentally and his picture he sent me was the second one On the site . His story is the script : in Kabul retiring in 3 months 11 year old boy that is currently living with an army buddy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago after 15 years of marriage . I immediately copied your article and sent it to him , he tried to say his yahoo email was hacked so that is why he switched to gmail . He has the same broken grammar and spelling errors as I have seen in examples of your reviews . I played his game for about a week when he started sending me love poems and professing his love for me , I told him to back down since we had never met . He also claimed to have no access to funds or a phone . The major thing that put me over the edge of playing his game was when he had his son ( fake ) friend me on Facebook , his sons name is Jeff Knox who immediately began calling me " mom " . A week later I got an emergency Google hangout saying his son had been in a bus accident and he needed funds for the child to receive treatment since his US military insurance would not cover him in Ghana . That 's where the BS ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of him , then I was told he was sent to a specialty hospital for a head injury , he layer this on so thick it was unbelievable . I would really like to apologize to the actual soldier in the picture for his service to our country and for the lowlife scammer who use them and do n't  have any remorse for their actions . Thank you for having this blog . <p> I was recently approached by this scammer a couple of days ago . I had fallen asleep on the sofa early after a busy work week . I woke up at 4am and checked my Match.com notes . He sent a chat request .. I checked his profile and he said he was 50 , but the SINGLE photo in the picture did not look like a 50 yr old man . He said t was because he worked out a lot . I asked why he only had one picture and his profile said his eyes were brown but the man in the photo has blue eyes .. he did not answer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen and heard it all so I am cynical by nature . It was late , so I did n't  bother to remember or write down the profile name he was using .. I thought I would see it on my home page under contacts/connections However , match.com has this wonderful feature for " scammers/criminals , psychopaths " that allows them to view/contact you but HIDE their own name/profile from appearing in the history . He asked if we could Instant Message .. he was in a hurry to get off of the site .. So I gave him one that I rarely use . He was going by knoxdavid49 on Yahoo . The English was broken , he claimed he had a 13 yr old son in the 6th gradeSTUPID .. a 13 year old is usually in the 8th or 9th grade . He told me the same story about his wife cheating on him , dying of breast cancer , he was a good loyal husband but she did not appreciate him .. I asked him what time it was there and he was off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations from New York City to Afghanistan quick enough . I asked him why he would allow someone to take his son all the way to Africa of course there was no response to that .. He uses a photo of a tall handsome soldier with blue eyes . The picture on Match.com showed him with a white/yellow jersey type shirt . These websites should not make it so easy for criminals to hide their identities . I am a very busy woman and tend to try online dating from time to time , but it has proven to be more trouble than it is worth . <p> I am reading your post and I have and Army Sgt. who has sent me a request on fb and he did ask for money for his son and I said no . He then asked about a care package for him but wants it to sent to an address in africa . How do I find out if he is real ? his name is David Jeff . Looks american but does n't  talk american <p> I have one that 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leutenant in the US Army ! I have been playing along to find out more info . He claims he is in Libya and his nurse wife died of a heart attacked and his daughter stays with his almost blind mother . No other Family ! <p> The messages below if from Messenger yesterday : " Honey i am sorry i was in jail that is why i have not been online i have a big problems here in mission on Tuesday night , i was in the bush and we are looking for the killas and my gun are always ready to shoot and a little girl run out from they bush i think it is they bad people that want to attack me , i have to put my hand on my gun and shoot the bullet on they little girl back and she fall down and the military took me , and put me in jail , and they told me that i am not careful i told them that i think they little girl want to attack me , right now they little girl is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surgery at they little girl back so that , they bullet will come out and the military told me that will pay for all the hospital bills and i have to tell them to let me out , let me talk to my beloved friend if she can help me with anything , that is why i am here i have not eaten seen Tuesday night , i have been suffering with some hard jobs pls i need help they bill is 700 dollars if you can help me with anyone God bless you i am going back to jail i will tell them , i will check on you later so that they will allow me out , i miss you so much i am so sad in jail bye i am sending you this with a big tears in my eyes .

I am going back to jail , i will tell they military to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i feel like dying in jail ! " <p> Hi everyone , I 'm from the uk and I 'm a single mum . I wish I had known about this kind of scam before . The guy i 'm talking with , calls himself Chris Brad Cordingly , he says he is serving in Afghanistan , but also there was another guy working with him and this guy also contact it me , this one calls himself Mr. Lloyd Henry , I spoke to both on the phone and one has an american accent but the other one sounds african . I have also their email addresses and a few photos from this U.S. American Soldier . I have been through a horrible ordeal and this only happened last weekend . I have lost -9.250 and on top of this they were demanding me to pay another -18.000 pounds , when I told them I could n't get this kind of money and that I had no more money left , the american soldier that i was talking to , the one that calls himself Chris , he told me that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan but by now I got suspicious and talked to a friend of mine who already knew about this type of scams , I just wish I had gone to her sooner . There is a lot more to this story but right now I feel so upset over this and havent got the energy to write everything that has happen , I end up spending the night in the hospital because of this . Now I cant hardly afford to buy my sons Christmas presents and I will be strugling paying for my bills and my morgage . I still ca n't believe that I got myself into this situation , I feel so stupid and ashemed now . I just wish that I could find out who is the real person in the pictures , to let him know that his pictures are being used to scam inocent and vulnerable women . Now I keep wondering if the real person is still alive or dead , I just wish I could find out , if anyone knows a way of finding out please let me know , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may have jumped to the wrong conclusion after reading these articles and reported someone that I now believe to be who he says he is but I am still proceeding with caution . It is hard to know when meeting someone online if they are who and what they say they are and it is a shame that these people are misrepresenting themselves . The name I reported was Charles Schulzes and if I have caused unnecessary work for anyone I deeply apologize . Thank you for being there for those who need you . <p> It is best to always proceed with caution and to please do your homework when it comes to meeting people online . You never know who is behind that monitor and keyboard as many killers , rapists and scammers use their online personalities to hurt and swindle those who are vulnerable . Also it would be most wise to make sure you do not give out any information about yourself ( online or otherwise ) to this person unless you have met them face to face or know them personally . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who a scammer was/is . Scammers/predators steal our dignity , our money , our self respect and our hearts promising us the moon and the stars .. but leaving behind a trail of destruction behind them as they go to the next victim . Please be careful <p> not only facebook , its all dating sites and social networks . and yes it happens extremely often our grou has almost 2000 members that most of them were scammed some more then once . we are trying to identify these @$$holes before they cause damage <p> What I find truly disgusting about this horrible excuse for a human being is the fact that he also borrowed $200 from a woman on disability , never intending on paying her back . Instead , he yelled at her terribly as she said she was going to the police to turn him in as a scammer . He was coming to visit her but had to help a friend in Hawaii . How convenient as he has told another that he was stationed in Hawaii because he was angry at a domestic situation involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass beer mug in front of his son . I am praying like mad that this bag of filth will be arrested and made an example of by those wanting justice and peace . What I find most disgusting of all is that he used a true soldiers identity as a smoke screen to steal from female victims all around the United States . CJ , you should be commended for your hard work on this case . Let us know the update of when this loser gets arrested and convicted . Thank you ! <p> What I find interesting about your story is that I know for FACT you sent this man a birth certifcate to him in Hawaiiso if your so dead set on putting this " scammer " away then why do n't  you give them the address you sent the birth certificate too . I mean you know this manyou my dear need a life just like this blogger . <p> Link Joe McCormick is a very bad and dangerous person . I knew him in 1997 and he lived with me for 10 months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real name until I finally had him arrested for assaulting me and threatening me with a knife . He loves knives . He said he was a survivor of the " Black Hawk Down " incident . He took me for a Lot of money and subsequently served 14 months in a Minnesota state prison . Please beware of this man . He has assaulted numerous women and is a pathological liar . I fear he will eventually kill someone . <p> I just want to add that at the time of his arrest for assaulting me in 1997 , the police advised me that Link Joe McCormick had outstanding warrants for assault and terroristic threats against other women . He also had been convicted of " theft by swindle . " He becomes very agressive if confronted in any way , as I found out . Some military men I spoke with after the fact said he was one on the best con men they had ever met . He was constantly on the Internet , grooming new potential victims , and it seems his process has not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheldon whom I met , who seemed to actually be in the Army , but Link Joe McCormick told vastly inflated stories about Sheldons rank and military history . Sheldon seemed embarassed by this and may no longer be an associate of McCormick . It would be nice to get the word out to more sites about McCormick , since it seems that prison has not deterred his career as a military impostor and con man . Also , he looks nothing like the man whose pictures he is using , being short and kind of heavy-set and unattractive . <p> Well I 'm actually in contact with the idiot at the moment. - Who ever thinks he s a good- " Con Man " he s rubbish - I 've been talking to him from the begging of April- - It did n't  take me long to work him out. - It took me longer to track his I.D down Well the thing is you got to have a good memory to do what he is doing He Defoe ai n't  got one of those- Apparently he s told me he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died 7yr ago with breast Cancer , leaving him with a 10 yr old Daughter , who lives with his Aunty- in the i 'm the woman which have been brought down from Heaven . I 'm his Angel He wants to marry me , do n't  say much about his poor daughter thou only he ai n't  seen her for 2 yrs Ive even received his vacation forms from his apparent " Commando " Hysterically looks so fake unbelievable lol- I 'm actually enjoying watching him squirm &amp; - plead to me declaring his dying love I keep telling him to go away , but he keeps coming back for more He is obversely strapped for cash lol Well he wont be getting a penny from me the idiot- When I finish doing his head in , I will be more then willing to send any information I have on the loser - I sometime wonder who the real scammer is Me or Him lol- <p> is there a way you could provide a real picture of Link Joe " Major Mike " McCormick for us ? He was / Is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lies however i have a feeling the profile pic is not truely his . we have reported him to stolen valor and numerous other sites dedicated to frauds posing as soldier . Did you know he lost a leg in Iraq ? that 's his latest <p> Funny he friended me on facebook , I am a combat vet and he tried to convince me of his accomplishments he even went as far as opening a new site for Vets called Veterans of War and he is the admin ! I think he talks to vets and uses their life stories as his own . We had a conversation today and when I mentioned stolen valor he unfriended me and blocked me this ass is a dirt bag <p> Hay this is cathy I think I may have some info too . Not sure ive gotten a face book friend request . It would be nice to know if true or not but all the storieslisted here sound like mine ? Anyway this ones name is Allen Mata i just started searching for more info on him cuz have lerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably is . So this is a facebook thing to but has also had me install hangouts tracks conversatikn better . Some times the righting is jenuine some times broken english . Let me know if I can be of assistance . Contact me let me know you have recieved this letter . Ive been wrighting him for three days now . thanks cathy 
@@96509461 @709461/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Why You Should Support Allowing Felons to Keep and Bear Arms <p> When people hear that I support allowing felons to keep and bear arms in self defense , people are up in arms . " How can you support violent felons having the right to guns ? " Then , when they find out I do n't  support background checks either , they label me as an extremist or some other epithet . I am actually a very tough-on-crime guy . So , I hope you 'll hear me out . I think you 'll come to agree with my reasoning if you believe in liberty . <p> I decided to write this story after reading a this story on the Blaze . While this story has absolutely nothing to do with guns and is an amusing story , it motivated me to write this post after reading this : <p> Graham has since been charged by Chicago police with one felony count of criminal trespass to a place of amusement . <p> If convicted of running across a field in a gorilla suit is a felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed ? Where is the victim ? I 'm seriously , " criminal trespass to a place of amusement " ? ! What statist politician look at a sporting event and thought to himself : let 's make it a felony offense to run across a football field ! We MUST do something about this ! BUT A FELONY ? ! ? ! If convicted , this man would lose his RIGHT to keep and bear arms . <p> Let 's look a few more felonies that actually exist . Here in Texas , its a " crime " to exercise your right to keep and bear arms without a government issued permission slip . However , if you were caught carrying that firearm into a place that sells alcohol say , WalMart that class A misdemeanor suddenly and magically becomes a felony even if all you went to buy was the latest X-Men movie . <p> Writing a hot check is a felony , even if you may have done so accidentally if you have an aggressive prosecutor . Curfew and loitering violations can be considered felonies depending on the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , Martha Stewart is a felon and she also is n't a threat to anyone . As I kept studying I found one of the most absurd felonies of all : possession of a bald Eagle feather . Only certain tribal members can own them and then only with a permit . If you 're found with one , even if you picked up from the ground while hiking in the forrest , you can be charged with a felony . <p> I 've had several " felons " contact me asking what they are supposed to do to protect themselves . I know that at least here in Texas , 7 years after your conviction or sentence ( whichever is later ) , felons may have firearms for self defense in the home only . However , some of these " felons " were convicted 20 , 30 , and in one case 42 years ago when they were stupid teenagers . There was no way that they could have known taking a plea deal would effect them for the rest of their lives . There is no statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felon whether they were charged as a minor and agreed to a plea deal of community service or probation . Many minorities and those in poverty who are falsely arrested or charged with crimes cant afford legal representation and they are encouraged to take plea deals to avoid trial and an " inevitable conviction . " <p> Now , that said , what about " violent felons ? " Without background checks , how do we keep guns out of their hands . <p> Let me first talk about the base reason I oppose BGC is because it gives the government the ability to determine who " qualifies " to exercise a right . While Im sure politicians had good intentions when they passed this law , they failed to take into account the wide net they just cast . Instead of the law only applies to violent crimes , everyone " convicted " of a felony was affected . <p> By allowing the government to determine that " felons " have no rights , what 's to stop an out of control government from simply creating more and felonies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , literally now have six degrees of felonies . Some examples of these felonies include promoting a suicide attempt , computer trespass ( in essence if you used your spouses or anyones computer without permission ) , gambling , consensual prostitution , eavesdropping , failure to pay child support and wearing a bullet-proof vest ANYWHERE to name just a few . What 's to stop the government from just making EVERYTHING a felony ? <p> Texas is an excellent example of what happens when you allow government to dictate the terms of ones rights through criminal prosecution . The moment a Texan is merely arrested and charged with a " crime , " whether justified or not , that person either loses his license or not qualified to obtain one until after trial , a violation of due process . A perfect example of the flaw in this law is the arrest of several gun rights activists at the Texas capitol . They immediately lost their licenses even though charges were eventually droppedAFTER A YEAR ! ! These law abiding citizens were stripped of their rights for no reason than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are suing them ) . If " convicted " of a class B misdemeanor or higher , that prohibition extends to five years after the conviction or end of punishment . This includes graffiti , littering , DWI , theft , disorderly conduct ( which includes cursing ) , and driving on a suspended license to name a few . Other than California , Texas is the only state that strips its citizens of the right to keep and bear arms based on nonviolent , non gun-related " crimes . " When we allow states to also dictate who qualifies to exercise their rights , what 's to stop them from making jaywalking , spitting on a sidewalk , walking down the wrong side of the road or other nonsense charge a discriminator ? Government should NOT have the ability to decide who can and can not defend themselves . <p> So , you may ask , " if you do n't  believe in background checks , how in the world do we keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals ? " See , I do n't  believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals do n't  willingly submit to such checks . Its only an impediment to law abiding citizens and senseless delay . The real problem lies in our penal system . The question people should be asking is , " if these violent individuals are a threat to society , why are allowed in society ? " The problem lies with lax sentences or even in plea deals given to violent offenders . A life sentence should be a life sentence : no parole except in extremely rare circumstances ( like young offenders ) . The death penalty , exercised as expeditiously and thoroughly as constitutionally sound , is a great deterrent . I 'm not averse to capital murder convicts sentenced to death from being hung in the public square or facing a firing squad . Crimes involving the illicit use of firearms should be no less than a felony , and a stiff one at that . Prison should be for violent offenders and , once there , should be the most demeaning and uncomfortable place imaginable . They should have no access to cable , entertainment of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to pay for college like the rest of us , I support that ) . That will deter them . They should be forced into manual labor that benefits society and encompasses the worst jobs for which government employees must attend to : clearing sewage , maintaining shoulders and roadways , cleaning up after states of emergency , etc . Anyone attempting to flee would be shot on sight . After all , these are violent criminals . <p> Solve the penal system problem and you solve the violent crime problem . Once a prisoner is legitimately deemed safe for society , all rights should be reinstated . One of the problems we have in this country is recidivism . One of the reasons is because these people cant get real jobs with convictions , even if it was an honest lapse of judgment that taught them a lesson . Once someone has paid to debt to society , as dictated by legally and strictly applied punishment , they should have the ability to reintegrate . If these people cant get jobs , their only recourse is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet their needs of survival or they become addicted to drugs to help them cope and become a drain on society . <p> I 'm all for harsh punishment as a trade-off reinstating rights to criminals who have paid their dues and been deemed rehabilitated to return to society . Its not a " soft on crime " stance by any means . Non-violent " felons " should not lose their rights just because a law was passed making some petty action a criminal offense that some lawmaker decided to make a " felony . " I believe it would legitimately lower crime rates , make people more productive , and reform our criminal justice to what it should be intended for . 
@@96509462 @709462/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Snowflake Obsidian &amp; PTSD <p> A few years ago , I went through an intensive PTSD treatment program on Fort Hood called the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Program . I wrote about that in a little more detail here . It was an intensive , 3-week long , outpatient program . It was our place of business those three weeks . We had to be evaluated and accepted into the program based on the severity of our PTSD and upon approval from our units . In other words , we really had to be hurting and almost at the end of our ropes to get admitted , but it was a voluntary program . Some people decided they could n't meet the requirements to complete the program because it required active participation and dropped out . <p> When we graduated , our counselors gave us a few way to help us cope with future stressors and also to remember the progress we made through the course . The first one was a gold hat hook that goes on the brim of a hat or placed somewhere prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hat mine was on ) . The second was a set of little star stickers the kind teachers use to put on a chart in elementary school if you were good or completed your assignments . We were supposed to put the stars in places we frequent , like the bathroom cabinet , refrigerator , wallet , rearview mirror , etc . The idea was that these stars represent bright point in our lives ; to cling to them ; and remember that our lives are worthwhile . The third was a rock called snowflake obsidian , which I want to talk more in depth about because I think it will help all my readers , not just military veterans . <p> Depression has many causes . The loss of a loved one , including a brother in arms , parent , sibling , good friend , neighbor , or Kurt Cobain . It can come from a chemical imbalance in the brain . It is a byproduct of several psychological diagnoses , like bipolar disorder . Divorce or a break up , lack of money or a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other well-known causes . Unfortunately , most people do n't  seem to understand these causes because either they have n't experienced them or they are n't  as important to them . For example , to some people , being in a relationship and having someone to lean on defines a large part of their lives . However , someone who does n't  really put a high priority or emphasis on physical and emotional connection wont understand how a break-up would be a reason to fall into depression . Someone that comes from a broken or abusive family probably would n't react losing a parent . You can easily identify these people , because their answer when confronted with someone suffering from depression is usually , " get over it " . <p> Anyone that has dealt with depression knows how debilitating it can be . It does n't  matter what causes the depression nor how bad it is . Sometimes we just feel down and other times we feel like there is simply no point in living . Ive been on every end of that spectrum . More often than I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm on the latter part of the scale . It can cause those who suffer from it to lose sleep or even not want to stop sleeping , cause them to withdraw from the very people that can help them , or just stop doing the things they once enjoyed . The one that plagues me the most is a lack of energy and constantly feeling tired . This is why I try to force myself to keep busy or engaged in something . Regardless , we feel as if we are surrounded by darkness and there is no light at the end of the tunnel . <p> Snowflake obsidian is " a natural volcanic glass that can be polished to a very high luster . Some stones of obsidian contain white crystals of the mineral cristobalite . When polished these stones produce a gemstone known as snowflake obsidian . " <p> It comes in many different varieties . Some have more white " snowflakes " than black , while others are mostly black with specks of " snowflakes " . We were given these upon graduation and encouraged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we are feeling down and depressed or that we are surrounded by darkness , there are always bright spots in our lives we can focus on . When we feel like failures or that we cant do wrong , we should focus on the happy or bright spots in our lives . Those white specks should remind us of those time . We were told to ascribe times in our lives when we were happy , successful , or content . <p> So , when I look at this rock that I keep in my pocket I am reminded of the day I met my wife and then when we got married . I remember being on the phone the moment my oldest daughter was born and hearing her cry for the first time . I think back to the pictures and letters I received from my kids while deployed . Something I 'll never forget is being invited to the White House and getting to sit and talk with George ( that 's how President Bush introduced himself , as if he needed introduction ) . Becoming a First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishments of " accomplishing the mission " and ensuring " the welfare of my Soldiers " . <p> I have hundreds , if not thousands , of happy experiences that I can point to . However , its difficult to remember those times when you 're in a deep , dark hole and you 're not sure how to get out of it . Your life can seem as if it will never get better . I cant remember who first gave the advice that " pain is temporary " , but Ive fallen back on that many times and imparted that wisdom to others as often as I could , because its true . <p> We all through dark times in our lives , but we have to focus on the bright spots to help out of that darkness . We need to walk towards them . When I am in that dark place and I find it hard to see my own worth , having this rock in my pocket reminds me of who I am . It may not remove the depression I 'm feeling at the time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . Those bright spots represent happiness . They are what is important in my life . Each snowflake is a happy moment or person in my life . <p> I promise you that when you are having a hard time , that pain is temporary . It may seem permanent because it is n't resolving itself on your time , but that does n't  make it any less temporary . Sometimes it lasts a few minutes and , unfortunately , it can last a few years . However , in the grand scheme of things , you 'll look back at those times and see how brief they are in the aggregate . <p> What is n't temporary is suicide . It is a permanent solution to a temporary problem . I 've lost two friends who were veterans to suicide . I 've helped many others change their minds and get help . Ive been there . Everyone in my Reset group had either contemplated or attempted suicide . From what I 've been told , graduates of the program have nearly been cured . At the very least , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop up and they do . <p> Above all , we have someone to rely upon . You need to have that someone . Someone you trust that wont judge you , will be there at 3am when Hillary wont , and will help you through it . If you do n't  have that someone , contact me and I 'll be that someone . I encourage you to find yourself a snowflake obsidian for yourself to keep on you at all times . Though a tiny rock , it will help you through big problems . You can get one for about $2. <h> 8 Comments on " Snowflake Obsidian &amp; PTSD " <p> ptsd not only hurts the soldier , it also hurts their family . how can one deal with such a condition , devoid of feelings toward your loved ones , and yet can t let them go ? will the pain ever stop ? will the children be able to grow up knowing what love is ? through the grace of God , the pain will stop . <p> I found that he was n't the idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an incredi my intelligent and thoughtful man who cared deeply and passionately about the troops . He was intimately aware of what was going on in Iraq and Afghanistan and got emotional when I asked him to honor the sacrifices of those who died fighting .

I want to reiterate a few points about how to easily determine if the person you are speaking with is a real service member or not . <p> 1 ) They ask for money , especially through a money service like MoneyGram or Western Union . These are easy , immediate tip-offs . <p> 2 ) They send you pictures that do n't  match the rank and service they tell you they are . I cant tell you how many times I get emails and comments asking me to look into someone saying they are a Staff Sergeant and wearing Major rank or a supposed Colonel wearing Sergeant Major rank . Educate yourself on military ranks and uniforms and do due diligence before wasting my time with these obvious indicators . You can find US Military ranks here . <p> 3 ) They tell you that they are assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret intelligence units wont say they are assigned to secret intelligence units . <p> 4 ) Ask them to send you an email from their military email as confirmation . If they send you one , respond to it and ensure they did n't  make it up . You 'll find that most if not , all of these emails will come back undeliverable . If they say they cant give it to you for security reasons , its a scam . <p> 5 ) They need your help with " special leave .

I 'm married and I do n't  even need my wifes help if I want to take leave . It does n't  cost military personnel a single penny to take leave EVER ! <p> 6 ) Check the photos .

@@96509473 @709473/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> The PTSD Addiction <p> Every now then , a song will pop up on my playlist that fills me with emotion and motivation to write something . Before I begin , watch this video by Blue October . <p> I 've written extensively about my battle with PTSD and depression here . I recognize that any time I talk about this internal battle , I run the risk of having it used against me by my critics and haters . Screw em . I 'm stronger than they are and I 'd have to care what they think to be bothered by it . For those who are new to reading this blog , I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2009 . I was in combat with the 3rd Infantry Division for the main assault into Iraq in March 2003 , which is what led to it . <p> Due to my mission , I was always attached to whichever unit was on the front line of the effort . I crossed the border with 3/7 Cavalry , then moved to 4-64 Armor after the battle at As Samawah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1-64 Armor for the assault into Baghdad , including the two Thunder Runs . Once Baghdad fell and Fallujah became difficult to pacify , I was moved to 3-15 Infantry to take back the city . It was weeks of direct combat , which was exhilarating , but taxing . <p> My team was responsible for battlefield interrogations and intelligence gathering . After each battle , it was my job to search the dead , living , and captured for intelligence . Depending on how long it took to clear the battlefield of enemy threats , some of those bodies lay where they died for days . Some of them were nearly unrecognizable because they were torn apart by a Bradley or crew-served weapon . Some of them were so decomposed in the 100+ degree heat that I literally had to oxygenate my blood with quick breaths then hold my breath as long as possible to avoid the smell of the corpse as I searched it . One guy in Baghdad was so bloated that I could n't even get his wallet out of his pocket because of how tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pocket , but as I did so it slightly shook his body . This caused his right ear to fall onto his shoulder , exposing maggots that were crawling all through his neck and ear canal . I was barely able to keep from vomiting all over the place seeing his skin literally crawl . <p> In another instance , I had to help a family retrieve a love one from a vehicle that tried to blow through a checkpoint . It was taken out by a Bradley and caught on fire . The body was charred beyond recognition . I 'm not going to go into too much detail since I wrote about it on this blog post . You can read it here . <p> I share this just to give you an idea of what ultimately led to my ongoing nightmares ( I take medications that largely suppress these now ) . I consider myself a very religious man with a strong belief in the precious nature of all life and when I got home everything that I did in Iraq began to haunt me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way . I began seeing the faces of the people I shot in combat shortly after I redeployed back home . I did n't  feel guilty about it or even regret anything I did . My job was to defeat the enemy and stay alive and I accomplished that . But , it did n't  escape me that these men were fathers , brothers , uncles , sons , etc . Many of them were forced into combat having never picked up a rifle in their lives and told to shoot at us or be shot by their own . From a Christian standpoint , this weighed heavily on my mind . What about their kids ? Their wives ? <p> This conflict was in my head and the constant stream of images , smells , and sounds began tearing me apart . I was promoted to Sergeant First Class in Fallujah and senior NCOs did n't  go to mental health . We sucked it up and drove on ! For five years , I tried to self-medicate . I began this blog in 2005 as a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was comforting and helped me work through my demons , but really all it did was cover up the pain . <p> In 2009 , Vice Chief of Staff General Peter Chiarelli launched a war on the stigma of troops seeking help for PTSD . I had an opportunity to interview General Chiarelli on a radio show I co-hosted called " You Served . " You can listen to that interview here . I was a First Sergeant at the time stationed in Huntville , Alabama . During the interview , I felt compelled to admit for the first time that I needed help and vowed to test his initiative that seeking help wouldnt hurt ones career . How could I counsel my troops to get help if I was hiding my own problems and resisting it ? I pulled my troops together after meeting with my commander and explained that I needed to step down to get help and focus on myself for the first time in my career . <p> Unfortunately , around the same time I was dealing with a battle with my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery that much more difficult , but that 's another story that you can also read on these pages . Since I had already completed my 1SG time and more , I worked out a deal to move to Ft . Hood for a fresh start . <p> Over the past eight years , my battle with PTSD has been a roller coaster . While it can be treated , it never really goes away . Through intensive counseling and support , it just becomes more manageable . Its always lurking in the background whispering to you every now and then that you 're worthless or unworthy of living . <p> I equate it to what its like to be an alcoholic . Even when alcoholics stop drinking , they still consider themselves alcoholics . That temptation for just one drink is always there . I remember those days when I was a teenager in Japan and would have probably been considered an alcoholic as much as I drank . The depression and amger became like a drug ; something I kept going back to . I could n't shake it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head to get the upper hand and sending me into another depression . In 2013 , it was the stressful and traumatic false arrest heard round the world and subsequent railroading by the corrupt justice system that triggered the worst episode ever . Again , another story well documented on this site that I do n't  need to go into detail on . That arrest and the subsequent notoriety it brought me sent me into a major self-destructive episode . Not many people realized what was going on with me because I was really good at hiding it . I almost destroyed my family and treated my wife , Emily , absolutely despicably . <p> Despite my unforgivable actions throughout 2013 and 2014 , Emily stuck with me no matter what . No matter how hard I tried to push her away , she refused to give up on me . I actually tried to commit suicide later that year and , no , I did n't  use a gun . I was n't only destroying myself , I was destroying us . She probably suffered more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on track . <p> The reason I share this song is because when I hear it , I always think about her persistent refusal to give up on me even when she had every right to . She stuck by my side when people I once thought were friends turned their backs on me . I made and lost a lot of friends during that time , but few knew what I was truly dealing with . I learned who my true friends were and the best among them was Emily . The lyrics are practically written about us . <p> Time stopped , the arch of her back grew wings . And pulling me further from a devil to a heaven , she said " Believe . " True peace as she looked into my soul . She said " I 'm here to show you faith , and to help you when you fall . " <p> I 've fallen a lot in the past 14 years since Iraq . The video is also a great metaphor for what I was going through . I 've never done drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would literally not be here today had my wife given up on me . My thinking at the time was that if I just made her hate me enough it would n't be so hard to accept when I ended my life . I think she recognized this and that is probably why she held on and kept fighting for me . She stood by me when I wanted nothing to do with her or anyone . I was a completely different person in public than in my private life because I had become this person looked up for inspiration . Meanwhile , there was nothing inspiring about my life . <p> I simply do n't  deserve her . I will probably spend the rest of my life trying to earn her love and convince her she did n't  make the wrong choice in sticking it out . I made a lot of mistakes I 'm not proud of . I will forever hate what I 've done and continue to seek ways to forgive myself , but I will never take for granted the chance at life in general and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicate this song to her and tell the world I 'm the luckiest man alive . I hit the jackpot when I found her . Unfortunately , she got the short end of the stick . I can only hope that one day I can look at myself the way she looks at me.

If you do n't  believe in God , want to mock God , or get offended because you werent hugged enough as a child , do not read any further . <p> The Soldiers from 3rd Platoon , 62nd Engineer Company , 4th Engineer Battalion pray before a mission . Although not all of the Soldiers are religious , they all join in to be a part of the circle and pray before every mission . <p> Nearly five years ago , I wrote a post based on my experience in called " How to Lose Your Soul . " It was difficult enough to publish the first time and more embarrassing to point out again . But , I never really published my thoughts leading up to that day and what led me to make that decision outside of that days events . <p> By the time this was written , I had been in sustained combat for nearly a week straight . We crossed the border just prior to midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . While there were moments of quiet and boredom , they were interrupted by the reality of an enemy that though they could defeat us . <p> Before you keep reading , keep in mind that is going to be a very religious post because in order to believe in a soul , you have to understand the religious nature of that soul as I see from my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints , or " Mormons " were sometimes referred to . I write this post to highlight steps I learned from my last deployment to avoid suffering again . <p> I was baptized into the church on my 19th birthday two years after I had completely given up on a religion with God at its head and turned to a religion whose deity lived at the bottom of a bottle . Before I was old to even drink I would be considered an alcoholic , though few ever knew it . Then , I met a beautiful girl who seemed to make sense of my wasted life . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life for . She did n't  use profanity , did n't  drink , and lived her life in a manner that radiated a spirit and brightnesss about her . I WANTED to be a better man ( to borrow a line from Jack Nicholson ) without being forced into it . <p> I studied the church , met with the missionaries , and asked a ton of questions . I had already read the Bible and had my own understandings of it . I was hesitant to be baptized into another church after being baptized into no fewer than five other religions in my search for truth and enlightment . So , I did n't  make my decision lightly and studied for three months . I read the Book of Mormon and reread the Bible . I prayed and fasted for answers . I had received the answers to my prayers . I had found my soulmate . I was reborn in a more complete knowledge that I was important and through Christs atonement I would be forgiven of my sins . <p> I learned about the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we " are agents unto ( our ) selves " ( Moses 6:56 ) . However , we are accountable to the Lord for how we use that agency to better ourselves , and to help others . We are our brothers keeper . I completely forgot that on this day back in March 2003 . <p> The reasons became clear to me over the next several years as I sought to find myself again and get my life back on track spiritually . Through years of counseling and reliance on my wifes spirituality I dug myself out of the hole it took mere days to dig myself into . Looking back , I can see clearly where I went wrong and I 'm applying those lessons to this deployment . <p> First , I stopped praying . Not because I believed any less , but because I allowed myself to get caught up in stuff . Sure , I said little prayers as bombs were falling all around me and bullets whizzed by my head , but I never just prayed when things were fine . I only sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were happening in the first place . <p> A Navy Chaplain leads U.S. Marines with 1st platoon , Alpha Company , 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance , Task Force Mech , in a moment for prayer before they head out on missions at Haditha Dam , Iraq , on May 10 , 2008. 2nd LAR , Task Force Mech , Ground Combat Element , Multi National Force West is conducting operations along the northern boundary of Al Anbar Province in support of Operation Defeat Al Qaida in the North . ( U.S Marine photo/Sgt . Rome M. Lazarus ) In combat and in life , I 'm sure we frequently ask how God can allow tragic things to happen . However , when we ask such questions we forgot about free agency . Biblical scholars will recognize this basic tenant of Christianity from Revelations and the foundation of the war in Heaven as described in 12:7 . Our scriptures described the cause of that war in which Satan had a plan to redeem mankind , but that redemption came at the expense of forced loyalty . Christs plan was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose the right . <p> So , the reason bad things happen is because bad people made choices that affected the lives of good people ( or other bad people ) . If God stepped between good men and bad men every time , we would n't have that free agency . We would n't have those trials and tribulations that teach us how to overcome evil . It was part of the plan that Eve bite into that apple to open our eyes and begin exercising our free agency . <p> Because I had n't  been praying , I could n't receive the answers through the spirit to the questions I had . Its hard to hear the spirit over the sounds of combat . Its hard to feel anything . And because I was n't laying the foundation of a strong faith prior to combat , that foundation was built upon sand that the storms of adversity washed away easily . I was n't in a position to get the answer I sought asking why there was so much death and destruction . The answer was there ; I just was n't able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my scriptures . When we pray , it is our time to speak with God directly . In return , God speaks to us in different ways . Sometimes , we receive instant revelations to the questions we are asking . Sometimes , as Garth Brooks pointed out , silence is the answer to our prayers . That silence can mean a few things , among them that the answer is so clear we just need to open our eyes to see it . In other words , if I pray to God that the Cowboys become a winning team this year , his silence probably means to stop asking for stupid things ; the Cowboys will never have another winning season and stop being so selfish ! <p> God also speaks to us through searching and pondering the scriptures . He may reveal something in a passage that we had n't  noticed before . For example , many years ago I was having a rough time in both my personal and professional life . I was trying so hard to do everything right and everything seemed to be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more I screwed stuff up . While reading in the Book of Mormon I came this passage in Mosiah 4:27 : " And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order ; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength . And again , it is expedient that he should be diligent , that thereby he might win the prize ; therefore , all things must be done in order . " I was trying to do too much at one time and not focusing on any one task . That lack of focus caused me to drop many balls . <p> Finally , I had not gone to church in months . I had plenty of excuses , but the reality was that I was n't making the time . Sure , we were all busy , but not so busy I could n't find an hour each week to attend a sacrament meeting . I look at my faith as the equivalent of Green Lanterns ring . As time goes on , its energy gets used and needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . I was n't going to church to get spiritually refreshed and began the war without a fully charged ring . I did n't  recognize it at the time and probably would n't have noticed had it not been for combat . I was even able to give fellow Soldiers blessings prior to crossing the border . <p> All those things made for a recipe for disaster when I needed to rely on that ring ( my faith ) . It was n't as strong as it could have been . <p> So , this deployment I came in knowing what I needed to do to stay strong . I pray nightly and I read at least one chapter each night . My goal is to finish the entire Bible and Book of Mormon before I redeploy . I attend church services at least once a week ( so far twice a week ) to recharge my ring . The fellowship I receive also provides me with a support network if its ever needed . <p> I also know that this deployment is NOTHING like my last deployment . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented last time . I 'm not involved in sustain combat on a daily basis . But , this deployment does present its own challenges that come with too much idle time . So , I 've found constructive ways to spend what little free time I allow myself . Of course , there 's not as much free time as I 'd like to have , but it could be worse . <p> I write letters to my family and supporters . I keep up with the news . I take photos . I read books onto a DVD that is sent to my kids . I also read my own books . I 've started the Insanity workout program to get in better shape so I can keep up with the youthful vigor of my wife ! <p> In other words , I 'm choosing wholesome activities to occupy my time . I 'm keeping the Spirit as close as possible and that ring charged so that when/if an event arises in which I or someone else needs to rely upon it , I wont waver . I will not falter . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ) . It took me years to find my soul again .

" It brings out the worst in people , myself included . Besides , its much easier to discuss things more in depth here than in a Facebook or Twitter posting . So , I 've decided to return back to the tried and true blog ! Ill be talking about military and national defense related things as well as government and constitutional issues . Basically , I 'm getting back to the way it was before , but will probably have a heavier emphasis on gun rights and rights issues than before . I 'm also going to use the freed up time to finish the book Ive been writing for several years . <p> On February 1 , 2015 , I officially retired as a First Sergeant from the United States Army . The retirement was bittersweet , but I do n't  miss it . It seemed that since Obama took office , all I was doing was fighting a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright hostility towards anyone that did n't  toe the party line . <p> After the false arrests of 2013 happened , the Army showed its true colors in trying to rake me over the coals before I had set foot in a courtroom . I realized that the Army no longer cared about its troops , but would support lawlessness by government officials . Attempts were made to punish me with an Article 15 , but when I demanded a court martial , suddenly everyone did n't  seem as intent on making an example of me . However , they did make my life as difficult as possible . Add to the problem disgraced bloggers relegated to living in foreign countries generating more contention and I had all I needed to start cashing in my chips and hang up my uniform . <p> While that 's all been discussed here before ( you can read all the posts from about March 2013 on ) , I only wanted to briefly touch on it . I used to love the Army . I was a walking poster boy for the Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and window stickers . I even paid over $300 for an Army-licensed motorcycle jacket that had a built-in reflective vest to comply with on-post riding regulations . I lived , breathed , ate , and slept Army ! I volunteered with pro-troops organizations around the country , from local to national . <p> By the time I left the Army , I could n't get out fast enough . I wanted nothing to do with it . I was no longer proud of the service I had given for over 20 years . I felt betrayed . While I did n't  want to leave my troops behind knowing the kinds of leaders they would be stuck with , I had to think about myself for once . Then , after my second false arrest ( in which charges were eventually dismissed a year later and I never saw a day in court ) the Army made the decision for me : retire or face an administration separation board . I removed my stickers , got rid of most of my military themed clothing , gave my uniforms away , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leave and was able to " get out " much sooner than my official retirement date . I started going to college to finish up my degree and began working on the family farm . <p> I found as I was contemplating returning to regularly writing here that there is actually a lot to talk about . After all , I 'm a civilian again . I have a lot to share about the military experience from a new perspective . Was the transition easy ? What advice could I give to Soldiers still in ? What are my experiences with the VA ? How will my military experience continue to influence my post-military life ? <p> These are all themes I plan to cover here . I will also discuss hot political topics of the day , review some great military oriented products , like books and firearms , and talk about what drove me to become an activist for the 1st , 2nd and 4th Amendments , among others .

@@96509477 @709477/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> The Immigration Conundrum <p> Ive been watching the immigration debate surrounding Trumps executive order with interest . I spent the last 15 years of my military career as a counterintelligence agent with a focus on counter-terrorism . In fact , it was the USS Cole bombing in 2000 that convinced me to change jobs from a Spanish Signal Intelligence Voice Intercept Operator/Linguist . While I was in training for my new job , 9/11 happened . I was more motivated than ever . <p> I find it laughable as a gun rights activist when I hear liberals especially Obama push gun control with the " if we can save just one life " narrative . The hypocrisy is glaring that they take on a completely different tone when it comes to immigration control . My take is a bit different . It is n't about saving one life ; its about saving tens of thousands . If this was truly about banning Muslims , why did n't  we add the other 36-41 Muslim nations to the list ? <p> A recent CBS News propaganda piece trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illegal immigrants ( I intentionally did n't  use the word " undocumented " as the story did ) " had an incarceration rate of 1.7 percent , compared with 10.7 percent for native-born men without a high school diploma . " Notice the slight of hand ? They compare ALL illegal immigrants , but narrow down the native-born category to just " men without a high school diploma . " If you were to include ALL Americans the way CBS News included ALL illegal immigrants , the percentage is 0.7% of LEGAL citizens incarcerated and that is assuming the worst case estimate of 2.3 million people in prison and a population of about 319 million . <p> The Pew Research Center estimates that there are approximately 11.1 million illegal aliens in this country . The Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform , using DHS data , noted that this number increases by about 700,000 every year . This includes those overstaying their properly obtained visas . Using the CBS News numbers , that means that there are about 188,700 illegal aliens incarcerated for crimes including rape and murder with approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , the argument should be " if we can save just 200,000 victims every year " <p> While I cant get into specifics for obvious reasons of classification , I can say with certainty that among those 700k entering our country each year are people whose sole purpose is criminal activity and terrorism . They are exploiting our weak borders and lack of enforcement . These are groups like MS13 , and La Raza that want to reclaim parts of the south for Mexico as well as extremist Islamic terrorists that want to hijack the next plane or bomb the next marathon . <p> On January 27th , President Trump signed an executive order barring immigration from Iraq , Syria , Sudan , Iran , Somalia , Libya and Yemen until a system of extreme vetting can be created to ensure that the likelihood of terrorists entering this country is minimized as much as possible . Let 's take a look at the mindset of people in these countries . <p> In Iraq , nearly one in ten people think that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in Afghanistan believe that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against citizens is justified . Nearly all Iranians have been brainwashed into wanting the destruction of the United States . 8% of American Muslims say that violence is " sometimes " or " often " justified against civilians in the name of Islam . Iran , Sudan , Libya , Syria and Yemen are all state sponsors of terrorism . We already have bans on North Koreans entering our country , another state sponsor of terrorism . Approximately , 49 nations are listed as " Muslim " nations . Most of them are not state-sponsors of terrorism , though Saudi Arabia could be argued is one . So , to all the liberals the same ones led by President Clinton that raided a home in Miami and ripped Elian Gonzalez from his uncles arms at gunpoint who think that this is a ban on Muslims , any rational being would clearly see it is not . Of course , liberals are not rational so that point is moot . They suffer from TDS ( Trump Derangement Syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country with respect , no matter who they are . Its not disrespectful to kick people out who are here illegally . <p> If you think otherwise , consider this video from a contractor in Iraq . <p> The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 gives the president broad authority over protecting the United States by preventing or slowing immigration from certain places . It of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate . " <p> We are a nation of immigrants . No one can deny that . My family emigrated from England where we were nobility at one time . In fact , there is a law school named after one my ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , we are also a nation of laws and sovereignty . I know there are people reading this who do n't  believe in borders . Borders are what protect our way of life , our safety , our republic , and our success . They ensure that those coming here respect our constitution and our system of laws ( even though we have disdain for many of them ourselves ) . For example , in most Muslim countries there is overwhelming support for Sharia law , especially in the countries on the Trump ban . Most of that support is above 80% ! Sharia is incompatible with our system of law and Europe is now having to deal with the repercussions of their lax immigration policy . <p> What 's happening in Syria and in much of the Muslim world 1 ) has been happening for millennia and 2 ) wont be solved by siphoning out their best and brightest . Assuming we are n't  bringing their best and brightest to this country , why would we want to bring people here who will only be a drain on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East that should be stepping up and taking care of the problems in their own backyard . If they wont help their own neighbors , why should we . I know , its " because were better than that , " right ? That bigoted argument only suggests that the people coming over here are inferior to us or not as good . At the MOST , what I think we should be doing is helping to establish safe zones over there for refugees . That way , if and when the conflict is over 2,000 years from now , they will still have their culture . <p> I 'm always told that I need to pick my fights . I admit that I seem to appear as if I 'm always looking for one . My philosophy is that I do n't  really recognize degrees of wrong when it comes to government . Wrong is wrong and I will stand up to wrong every time . This Syria thing is n't our fight .

@@96509481 @709481/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> College Police Chiefs to Vets : We Do n't  Trust You <p> Last month , two bills were filed ( one each for the Texas House and Senate ) that would legalize self-defense by concealed handgun license holders on college campuses . In typical fashion , Texas law enforcement agencies are n't  supportive of the idea , especially the Texas Association of College and University Police Administrators . According to WOAI.com , apparently the only people that can be trusted with guns on a campus are police officers : <p> Felipe Garza , President of the Texas Association of College and University Police Administrators , says there are too many uncertainties of college life , from being away from school for the first time , to the stress of college , to the temptations of drugs and alcohol . Garza says he is also worried about the security of the guns which are taken into college dorms and campuses . <p> " That may cause , if they have a handgun present or nearby , they would steal it from someone they know , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Texas System Chancellor Admiral William McRaven last week wrote a strongly worded letter to college presidents telling them that campus carry is a real bad idea . <p> Garza is echoing those sentiments . He says having concealed guns in the close quarters where college students live and study would cause major problems . <p> " If they are potentially weapons carriers , they have no way of securing that , or keeping those weapons safe , or preventing somebody else from using those weapons in a moment of anger and distress , " he said . <p> Its a telling statement about how the police view the public they are sworn to protect as undesirables and criminals-in-waiting , claiming that students are basically LOOKING for a reason to commit crimes ; they just do n't  have their roommates gun to do it with . If the state allows a responsible adult who is capable of voting , serving in the military , and actually serving on that same police force to carry , that responsible adult suddenly becomes a violent criminal in search of a victim according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its laughable . But , this is n't the the worst of it . <p> On February 1 two days ago , I officially became a civilian again . I 'm now 1SG(R) CJ Grisham . Prior to retirement , I enrolled in college full time to complete courses needed in pursuit of a law degree . As I sit in my classes , I ca n't help but notice that I 'm not even the oldest guy in the class . In one class , there is a Vietnam Veteran with Stage 4 cancer . In another class , a retired Air Force NCO . In others , veterans from recent wars and veterans who never saw combat . I would venture to say that about 40% of students are seasoned and responsible adults . <p> These veterans who are arguably more trained on the use of firearms in self defense than cops are forbidden from protecting themselves and others around them because state law bans firearms on college campuses . Mr. Garza and Admiral McRaven have no problem disarming veterans while their cops operate freely , but sparsely , around college campuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers will be in the classroom with me when someone decides they 've had enough or need to exact revenge on another person . Us veterans will be forced to either confront the shooter unarmed or hide behind our book bags while we wait excruciatingly long minutes for campus police to arrive ( people with lawfully carried guns ) . <p> If students who are legally qualified to own a firearm and possess a concealed handgun license are good enough everywhere else in Texas , they 're good enough on our college campuses . There is no reason that those living in college dorms ca n't be required to secure their firearms in a gun safe in their rooms or an arms room provided by the university . There is no reason that students who have met CHL requirements ca n't be trusted just because they cross an imaginary line called a college campus . <p> I 've served in two combat combat tours and several non-combat tours in S. America . I retired as a 1SG , often in charge of training over 100 Soldiers at least twice a year on firearm safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish a degree that I placed on the backburner two decades ago to serve my country . And yet , even though I 'm well trained and licensed to carry a concealed firearm , I cant defend myself or my classmates while I 'm in class . THIS MUST CHANGE ! ! <p> These police chiefs are afraid of losing their control , not the safety of their students . These are the same people that opposed the CHL law being passed in 1995 . Gun free zones are crime spree zones . Texans must come together to pass SB11 and HB937 . Call your state representatives and senators and demand they return our basic human right to self defense . When did the opinions of law enforcement begin trumping the rights of the citizenry they serve ?

I worked closely with FBI around the country ( mostly in the southeast ) and never imagined the agency could sacrifice its integrity so brazenly . When we investigated Soldiers for similar violations of **29;153;TOOLONG classified information , there is no way wed agree to this . Our job is to protect the classified information , not those in possession of it beyond the extent of providing the tools necessary to protect it . Heck , we prosecuted Soldiers for forgetting to secure classified information when done with it or accidentally sending it on an insecure server . Sound familiar ? We had separate servers for unclassified , secret , top secret , and even SAP materials . Soldiers went to jail , lost their clearances , and/or were dishonorably discharged for far less . <p> It is plainly obvious that Hillary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " possessing unworldly virtue that is unmatched in society . Obamas Justice Department has not only bent over backwards to Teflon coat Hillarys candidacy , but he s twisted it into a contortionists pretzel to get her elected .

Every day , it becomes more and more obvious that both are likely true . <p> To help you better understand , think about it this way . Police pull over Kim Kardashian while driving down the highway during a rainstorm . She has two friends with her and they all have enough crack cocaine in their possession to be charged with trafficking and intent to distribute .

The police release her and she gets robbed at gunpoint after whining about guns . <p> This is the kind of " the law for thee , but not for me " government corruption we are now living with . The government is setting a precedent that has the potential for causing anarchy . After all , if Clinton can get away with it , why not the rest of us ? Why should troops be held accountable for mishandling classified information if our other government officials are n't  ? Do n't  they represent us ?

" How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirrors will it take before we wake up as a country ? Aristotle also recognized that the law is n't always unbiased . In fact , he recognized that it is only biased to those that disagree with the regime in power since the law is created with the biases of the those in power . <p> This is why those on the right can support the statist policies of Donald Trump and those on the left can support the statist policies of Hillary Clinton . Its because they agree with the bias of their candidates and ignore the fact that both believe themselves to be " gods among human beings " and will legislate according to their desires and not what is best for liberty or necessarily the country . <p> This is why we have laws though . The laws and constitution are designed to prevent people like Clinton or Trump from getting away with lawlessness . Since the laws are already in place , they are theoretically impartial to those in office because they should hold their power in check . Aristotle says that no matter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , otherwise the power of men will corrupt and lead to civil war . Ruling according to ones own set of rules is what he defines as tyranny . <p> The fact that the FBI made this deal to shield Clinton and her cronies from prosecution should be evidence enough that we are being ruled by tyrants . The political elite in this country believe that they can do as they will . While I disagree with Trump on many of my " deal breaking " issues and wont be voting for him , at least we wont be getting a career politician in office if he is elected . Unfortunately , I do n't  think that will end rule by people who see themselves as possessing " exceptional virtue " who are " gods among human beings . "

It has used its supposed " interstate commerce " authority to enslave the states by taxing them into oblivion and then bribing with that money to do its will . For the past few decades , presidents and congresses have usurped power from the people and the states , trampling on our protected 9th and 10th amendment rights , among others . <p> We now face a president who , more than anyone else , has single handedly destroyed the country he vowed to destroy before taking office . To fundamentally transform America , he has driven us into virtual bankruptcy , destroyed the health care system , nullified the rights protected by our Constitution , decimated our military , and made us the cowardly laughing stock of the world . <p> When I was active duty , I actively opposed these policies and paid for it . In 2009 , after Obama was elected , I told his public affairs staff to their face in the Roosevelt Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to our veterans and troops . Not even three months into his presidency , Obama was pushing an idea to force veterans to pay for their health care . Not even a month later his Department of Homeland Security released a report warning that military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with combat skills could be recruitment targets , especially those having trouble finding jobs or fitting back into civilian society . He has signed dozens of executive orders infringing on the rights of Americans to keep and bear arms by declaring veterans who need help managing their finances as " mentally defective . " The United States Justice Foundation reported that " a coordinated effort by multiple federal agencies to disarm the American people . The tactics being used are not just violating the Constitutional rights of Americans , but include outright criminal acts such as extortion and blackmail . Veterans continue to be the primary target , but the groundwork has been laid to expand the disarmament efforts to the rest of the population . <p> " The veterans are clearly considered the most dangerous of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us and we all took an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic.

It was drafted after I and several other Soldiers exercising our right to keep and bear arms while off duty and out of uniform refused to present identification to law enforcement for doing nothing illegal . As a result of filing these complaints and daring to challenge the authority of unconstitutional actions by the very leaders tasked with protecting and defending our rights , the CG refused to sign my retirement award . <p> Thankfully , I 'm not alone in standing up to the unconstitutional actions of our nations leaders . Army captain Nathan Michael Smith has filed a lawsuit in federal court against President Obama over the legality of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria . There 's no telling whether the lawsuit will result in a return to constitutional principles since the courts have basically given the executive branch absolute power to do whatever it wants . Additionally , the legislative branch continues to legislate away its constitutional powers to keep the executive in check . <p> CPT Smith is 100% right . Whether you agree with the war against ISIS or not , the fact is that Congress has not passed a declaration or authorization of war in Syria or Iraq . If the only standard is " terrorism " then what 's to stop the president from waging war here in America when/if terrorists take root ? Of course , that 's ignoring the fact that this president already considers freedom-loving Americans to be terrorists . Despicable and corrupt leftist senator Harry Reid even went so far as to call patriots in Nevada " domestic terrorists " for daring to interfere with his crony land deals .

Yet with a few snips here , some tucks there , you can create tailor-made pants in a few minutes . <p> But what happens when you 're in a rush " there 's no needle and thread " and , like most of us , you do n't  know how to sew ?

If you 've never hemmed anything before in your life , check out e-Hows measuring steps . <p> Press with an iron where they need to be hemmed . That way the creases set in . <p> Apply Steam-a-Seam around the hem , and press it with an iron . Let it cool , and peel the paper off .

Using one that steams is not a good idea with the Stitch Witchery . Also , the iron has to be pretty hot and you want to apply a good amount of pressure to make sure that it creates a nice seam . I almost always have to double the amount of time that I apply the iron from what the directions say , but hey , live and learn as the amount of time largely depends on the fabric .

@@96509488 @709488/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Bad Leaders Are Destroying Our Military <p> This weeks Army Times lead story is titled " The No. 1 reason NCOs are quitting the Army : BAD LEADERS . " Amen ! <p> As a promotable Staff Sergeant it absolutely drives me bonkers seeing how many of my peers treat junior NCOs and how many officers treat us all . The NCO Corps has taken a back seat to leaders that want their hands in everything . Here at Fort Hood we will be shutting down operations next week for a day to address a distressing uptick in sexual assaults on post ( 13 IN ONE WEEKEND ! ) . Im told that most of these occurred in the barracks . <p> It is the JOB of NCOs to visit the living environments of their troops often , not just when they are told right after PT . At least in my unit I can tell you that Ive never seen another senior NCO in the barracks in the evening on a Friday or Saturday and I 've been here almost three years . They would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights , ordering Soldiers into their rooms for the night due to intoxication , or identifying potential conflicts of interest between junior NCOs living in the barracks and their Soldiers . <p> NCOs should NOT be drinking with their troops AT ALL ! I do n't  have the facts but I think that alcohol is a leading cause of these incidents . These Soldiers get together and each buy a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and just hang out . After too much alcohol inhibitions are lowered and bad things happen . Perceptions are altered as to what someone is thinking or what is right . The next morning one party realizes what happened possibly against their will if they were sober . Alcohol is NOT an excuse for sexual assault or inappropriate relationships . <p> Life is difficult for juniors especially young Sergeants . Suddenly they are leaders and they must find way to deal differently with friends they now outrank . They have to set an example and enforce a standard even if its unpopular . <p> Another issue in the military that the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion system . I remember when they did away with the 4-week PLDC ( now WLC ) requirement and went with a 2-week model . Two weeks is not enough time to create and institutionalize junior NCO leadership skills . The same goes for CPTs . Unless an officer completely screws up they WILL be promoted to CPT and possibly Major . The article says that the promotion rate to Major is " 95-98% " which is absurd . Working with Captains on a daily basis I can say for a fact that there are more than 2-5% of them that do n't  deserve to be promoted to Field Grade status . Unlike the NCO ranks there is no personal boarding process for young officers working their way through the junior officer ranks . <p> I do n't  know if its a Corps Policy or Army policy but some very competent and knowledgable Master Sergeants ( yes , I 'm talking about CJ as well ) are ineligible to perform duty as a First Sergeant solely because they have a permanent profile that prevents them from running with troops . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys and girls are n't  allowed into leadership positions . Its not like there are is a vast pool of Master Sergeants to choose from and Ive seen too many completely ineffective 1SG in those positions because they can run but they could n't lead ants to an Oreo cookie ! <p> The military has been more focused on the " next cool thing " instead of focusing on our troops . NCOs get virtually zero opportunity to attend college the way officers do unless they are fortunate enough to attend the Sergeant Major Academy . Officers are frequently allowed to attain their Masters Degrees with promises of additional service . NCOs get no such offers , even if to attain an Associates or Bachelors degree . We promote Specialists and Corporals to Sergeant without proper training . We promote Sergeants to Staff Sergeants without ALC . We promote Staff Sergeants to Sergeant First Class without SLC . Some of these NCOs wait over a year because of deployments before they 're able to attend this training . I 'm waiting to pin on my SFC rank and havent been to ALC yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . The Army made these changes because NCOs werent doing their jobs and properly mentoring and counseling their Soldiers ! Had we been doing our job the Army would n't have taken our authority and input away from us and decided to promote automatically . We dug this hole and its up to us to fill it back in with sound leadership principles and return to focusing on our troops . <p> Finally , we need to get rid of these senior NCOs who are unapproachable . There is a high level CSM on Ft . Hood that no one feels comfortable even approaching . Its okay to be a hardass leader but Soldiers should feel like they can approach their CSM for guidance , instruction , or just to say hi without having their heads chopped off . I 've heard the term " toxic " applied to various leaders and this comes close . This is second hand knowledge , but I was talking to a 1SG neighbor in another unit who said that most BN and BDE CSMs are afraid to speak up during meetings because they fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Sort of goes against the idea of the " open door policy . " <p> We can reverse this trend . It just takes personal motivation and a dedication to the troops . I recognize that even leaders needs personal and family time , but our first priority as leaders should be our troops . We have to be willing to sacrifice some of that to assist our troops . Its going to mean that a Friday or Saturday night may be spent in the barracks for a few hours just seeing what goes on after hours . I want to leave with a quote from the Army Times article from a SFC that summarizes everything I 've said here : <p> " One of the things I harp on is we have tenets of leadership , leading by example , knowing your Soldiers , knowing your jobs , doing theright things and setting the example for your Soldiers . Today , those things are not done . Everybody gets the impression that leadership is a trait we all posssess . But its taught , and were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad Leaders Are Destroying Our Military " <p> I say we have too many of the " Educated " wannabes in thereshould have ROTC before 12th grade to see if they have what it takes to soldier/lead. this way , we weed people out BEFORE seeing a recruitermost kids cant do soldiering as I have seen and the ones who can are last to be promoted . <p> What about the pressure for LT to promote to Captain at such a fast rate ? Some of these captains are just way to young to take the reinsI think that the standard should be the age of at least 30 . And , yeah , it keeps the LTs in a bit longer , but I think it takes time to develop a good leader , just saying . <p> There are some legit comments here but some are simply complaining . For instance , working long hours is a non- issue because that 's what soldiers do and that 's what makes the machine run . However , I believe we have an Officer problem first , then an NCO problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the real problem is that our " educated ones " are not concerned with how things are , but rather how they seem . I found many officers in it for themselves , satisfied as long as they were getting their BSMs , CIBs and over- inflated OERs . As an ROTC Instructor myself , I saw first hand how these folks are conditioned by senior officers to check their blocks for promotion at all costs . Again , I am by no means insinuating that all Os are bad and all NCOs are good . It takes a village . BTWmost CSM should be placed in the Officer category because they are looking out for themselves as well . I found throughout my career that most 1SG and below actually care about the troops to some degree but that CSMs forget where they came from when they get an office at HQ . <p> I could not agree more that bad leaders are destroying our military . My husband used to LOVE the army . He has put in almost 10 years of service and has deployed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and it feels like we are in hell . Literally . It has driven my husband to chose to get out of the army when he was planning to re-enlist in def. the only reason he may chose to re-enlist 3 more years is to pcs and get the heck out of here . <p> They treat their soldiers like absolute shit , could care less about taking care of them and their families and the Command SGM is HORRID . For example we have had our command sponsorship done for months and they refuse to give us housing , we can no longer afford to stay in a hotel and he is not allowed to have me in his barracks room . The army has pretty much left us homeless . Thank god for a friend taking us in off post or we really would be . I had to have surgery over here after we lost our unborn child , was in my husbands room recovering and the SGM kicked me out hours after my surgery . <p> They work him till at least 2000 everyday .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " homework " . He is in the field now , left at 0130 am Sunday and have not stopped working them . My soldier has not had a chance to sleep or eat since then and with no sleep they are having them jump ! Also , he has been an e-5 since 2008 , has n't  had the chance to go to alc bc of deployments and now that he has the chance to go and finally get promoted , they informed him they will not be sending any e-5s for the next FIVE YEARS . He s the hardest working person I know and never ever complains . It hurts me to see how unappreciated he is . <p> Th leadership is what is driving the good leaders out and nobody is even concerned with that . I am a SGT and I can wait to ge out . Incompetent leaders will be the demise of this institution and if toxic leadership is ok because it get the job done , then why have army values in place ? We more away from the basic and tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirt . <p> I completely agree . I just hit my 11 year anniversary in the Army , and I 'm still just a SGT E-5 . I have been a SGT for 5 years . However , I do n't  have WLC . I was deployed , then TRADOC cadre , then reclassed , because of low promotability in my MOS . I always put the job before the schools . Now , I 'm in an MOS where Soldiers spend 2 years in training and get auto-promoted to SGT . I have Staff Sergeants above me , who have been in the Army for less time than I 've been an NCO , who do n't  know the first thing about taking care of Soldiers . They know a lot about padding their points and taking care of their careers , but they could care less about the Soldiers . And , they look down on me , because I did n't  make seven in seven . The NCO Creed says " My two basic responsibilities will always be uppermost in my mind , the accomplishment of my mission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishment is inherent to being a Soldierlower enlisted , NCO , warrant , or commissioned . What makes the NCO Corps unique , what is the defining factor for us , is that we are charged with the care of the Soldiers . If you ca n't handle thattake the stripes off ! <p> The bottom line with the issues of the army or military as a whole is this : No organization or business can ever grow to be better than its leaders . If you have a leader who is an overall five our of ten on leadership , his unit or organization will not ever be better than that unless another leader steps in or ensures the right thing is done . Ive been in the army for awhile now , and every unit has its issues , and more and more it seems like more units are having them . Used to you kinda had a chance of going to a bad unit but you knew you had a good chance of going to a good one , and if you went to a bad one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That seems to not be the case now . <p> I do n't  want to downplay deployment experience by any means , especially those that actually faced combat , but I think the only real thing an individual can learn from combat is that getting shot at sucks ! It does n't  make you a better leader although it can provide some experience . <p> These recent conflicts have caused a lot of people to get promoted quick , the E-7 in seven years has become more common , and those our now the senior leaders . I currently work with some of these quick bake senior leaders and they literally do not know their job . Most of them have attended SLC by all are E-7 and above . I literally do not get paid enough to do all of their jobs as well . The only thing I see them do is yell at subordinate companies and give there junior NCOs a hard time when they do n't  know what right looks like themselves unless I show it to them . <p> The thing I am really tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes an act of congress to take this rank , and by the time you could get it I would be retired anyways " . What is it about senior leaders being unwilling to take care of soldiers or do the right thing . <p> I sat in on a board and listened to the Sergeant Major , who was n't even in accordance with AR 600-9 himself , give soldiers hoping to get promoted a hard time over not knowing how to take care of soldiers . He gave them a hard time if they stated they would report alcohol related incidences to the chain of command because then their soldiers would n't come to them for future help . I tell you what has the army values completely gone out the window ? What has happened to Duty or Integrity . You have some of these senior leaders harping on taking care of soldiers so much when they walked all over them to get where they are now . Anyone that tells you that they went to the Audie Murphy Board to benefit soldiers is a liar . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get promoted and make more money . Yes the bottom line is with promotion comes the ability to help more soldiers , but anyone that is willing to do that for free is in the wrong business . <p> My final rant would be this . A leader with no one following him is simply taking a walk . There are soldiers who will follow you because they have to , those that will follow you just to see what you are going to do next , and those that follow you because they want to . What kind of leader are you now , or going to be in the future ? The organization will only get better with better leadership . Everyone can rant but unless you are willing to put forth the extra effort it wont change . <p> You have to be willing to correct deficiencies and explain things in a way that people take them to heart and move on . Be envolved in your soldiers lives even outside of work . Your soldier is less likely to do something stupid if he knows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows him that you care about his well being and take an interest in his life and family . And finaly , obey the regulations . Do n't  break regulations because you think you know better . They were put in to place by someone that drastically out ranks you , and has way more time in then you . <p> Sorry for being long , but I could write a book on this . We are all tired of seeing things going the way they are , especially if you have been around a bit , however for the people coming in this is all they know . We have to show them better . <p> Its so true . Ive been in the Army for less than a year , and I have been busting my ass for my unit . But I get treated like a shitbag because I failed a PT test ( yes I know , I should work on my PT , I do , I run every other day and run on the weekends ) , but my leaders do n't  care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is try to get me chaptered because I was a few seconds off on my run time ( yep , just a few seconds , I had trouble with PT in basic and AIT and even here at my unit ) . I have never gotten to do the remedial PT we are supposed to do if we fell short on a PT test ( does n't  matter anyway , I run in my free time ) . And I had my 1SG tell me he could n't wait to chapter me . See , my unit is one of those units that tries to chapter everyone out or hand out Article 15s like candy . I hear my leadership joking about kicking people out and destroying their lives ( they always try to go for max punishment ) . I know i 'm not a shitbag , and I would just like to get some respect from my leaders like I give them . I mean how can they expect to lead us into battle if they make us hate them ? <p> Also , beyond that issue , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Soldiers out to dry . I 'm an OPs Clerk for the company , and my 1SG told me to go get someone ( which I did ) , while on my way back with the person he needed ( E5 type ) , he realized he did n't  need them after all , but gave me and the E5 a good ass chewing instead . So instead of him looking like a dumbass he decided to make me and the E5 look like fools instead . My leadership above E6 is unapproachable ( I have only one e7 that is approachable ) . I came here so motivated and so willing to do anything it takes for my country and my unit , but now , I really could care less if I get chaptered or what happens to me , I 'm going to try and pass my PT test , but if I do n't  , I could care less , bad leadership has ruined my army experience . And this is only a little taste of how bad my unit is . <p> All I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a fellow soldier get a DUI , get arrested , and go AWOL for a month to than come back to the unit and get promoted ! ! ! He literally got verbally smoked for getting a DUI and got promoted all in the same conversation . Seconds later he runs down the hallway to announce it to a room full of quality hardworking soldiers who will continue to get passed over for promotion time after time . <p> I had served with a unit for a month and then some without a commander and we did more in that month and a half and morale was way up The senior NCOs just did there job and no BS involved things got done and done well . They either need to go through the same programs we go through and then they can walk the walk They need to stop trying to please BC and trying not to let personal families get involved with work <p> I got out early . I sat around most time doing not a damn thing but read manuals . Most NCOs goofed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names or threaten me . I finally went to the JAG , it helped a little but later , I felt it hopeless so I went to a chaplain for CO discharge as I do n't  trust anyone there . <p> I know the frustrationI was an E5 in a NG unit active duty and got fed up with drinking , fights , and insobordination . I saw people pay to escape detailsofficers not show up for daysmy 1sgt vanished for several months , never seeing our barracksit was us E5s that ran the show , most E6+ just hid out somewhere together and would not even hear about problems we hadI got cussed out by a female E6 for complaining in front of othersI unloaded on her back hard and that did itend of career and I am all too glad . <p> I doubt by looking at the date on the last comment anyone will see this but I am literally lost in the sauce when it comes to dealing with the complete lack of regard from my leadership . As a 12B our main mission is route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather speed and race down our routes than actually do our jobs . Today for example one of the few E5s with a desire to do the mission regardless of the time it takes was enterogating something he felt the need to check out further ; over the net the PSG 3 trucks back says " Its clear , fuck it were guna miss chow . " A comment that is becoming all to familiar from all of my leadership . From a lower level leader ; my TL was chastising the SQD for a soldier being late to mission prep states after a long rant ; " I will drag you all down to hell and leave you their cuz I do n't  give a F*** , I do n't  give a F*** bout any of you anymore . " Followed by the A TL attempting to quote the second line of the NCO creed studering his way through it makes it the end and leaves out probably the most important part to his junior soldiers " and the wellfare of my soldiers " , like it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations of stress and anger things get said , got it . But to tell his soldiers that he would drag us to hell and leave us their because he did n't  give a F*** about any of us ; to ommit portions of the NCO creed either by blind rage or incompetence ( my personel vote out of knowing the individual ) in order to what ; make us want get in the soldeirs ass to get to the motor pool on time . Big Negative ghost rider . only fueled extreme discontent . These are but mere glimpses into life in my SQD and PLT . As a senior E4 ( rank that gives me nothing but headache and constant verbal denouncement ) what do I do fix this ; what do I do to change these individuals who ride their rank instead of instilling any sort of cohesion within their soldiers . LOST IN THE SAUCE is there anyone out their ? <p> I am so glad that you wrote this post . I have been in the Army 3 years and have 5 more to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all my heart . I came in knowing that this would be my career . However 3 years later , my ets date ca n't come fast enough . I once was what you call a hooah hooah soldier , now I am so close to just wanting to throw in the towel and naming my own self a s*** bag . I am in an air defense unit although I am not air defense . Their promotion points are very low so there are alot of young soldiers who got promoted to e5 waaaay to soon and sadly are very immature and not ready to be leaders . I got to the unit as a PFC and am now a SGT . I worked very hard to get promoted . I joined the Army at the age of 22 and already had a good amount of college , i worked on my correspondence courses and was able to get promoted pretty quickly compared to many of my peers in my mos ( 25U ) . I went to wlc a week after getting promoted to SPC . One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my unit telling me to hold out on WLC and wait until the last possible minute . I thought , why would I do that ? That was just an example of what kind of leaders we had . There are many lazy people in the Army looking for a handout . Then once they get their rank , they feel the need to treat other soldiers like crap . I was brought up to respect one another . And no matter what rank I am , I never want a soldier to feel that they cant approach me . My unit has poor leadership all around . One of the main problems is the Army seems to be becoming too officer led . Starting with my battalion commander . He has put it in all of the officers heads that they can treat NCOs , no mater their rank like they are beneath them . This has caused many of the senior NCOs in my unit to not even speak up and take care of the enlisted soldiers . My father is a retired SFC and my stepfather is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it is one of the major downfalls of the Army today . I do n't  want to ramble on , but I just want to say this . Everyone I know that I have told I am getting out keeps telling me I should just reenlist and get to another unit . I am too scared that I will run into the same problems . I talked to many soldiers that were in other units while I was in Afghanistan and they have the same problems . Poor leadership and it is causing many soldiers who had dreams of staying in to now want to get out . Everyone says stay in you can change things . Sadly , I do n't  think me as one person can change anything . I feel instead of being so focused on pointing the finger at lower enlisted soldiers , the " higher ups " should be evalutated by the joes and you will see where your real problems are . In closing , I read an article about a soldier who committed suicide while deployed overseas because his leaders basically dogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People around saw what was going on but no one would stand up and say anything . It should not take a soldier killing themselves before someone speaks up . Oh and his leaders , moved on with their lives in the army , some even being promoted . When will something change ? <p> I almost got out as a Staff Sergeant until a conversation with my dad , a retired Navy E9 . He said , " Son , if you 're getting out because of poor leadership , in who 's hands are you leaving your troops ? " That got me thinking that I wanted to be someone that provided a positive example of what leadership and caring for Soldiers looked like in spite of what was around me . I stuck it out and I 'm finally in a position where I can at least provide influence on junior NCOs and Soldiers and show them what right looks like . <p> I would ask you the same question my dad asked me . However , it really only works if you 're in it for the right reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unfortunately this is so true . I am a SPC in the army and I feel like I cant approach my supervisor , that is an E6 now . It seems like leaders today only care about themselves rather than their soldiers . they are quick to counsel you negatively but positively , never at all . My NCO went ahead and had another NCO type her weapon card and give her 40/40 when she did n't  even shoot at all , that 's why she got promoted to E6 . <p> I agree with your posting . Leaders at all levels have to be involved with our Soldiers . I have been in the Army for 15 years and I have seen all the examples you talk about . On the weekends I was always in the barracks checking on my Soldiers , talking to them , and trying to help them through their issues . I had a 1SG that tried to be a hard ass and was unapproachable , I was just an E6 but I had to tell him I was n't afraid of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what the Soldiers thought about his leadership style , he changed . I see Soldiers , hard working and dedicated Soldiers get treated like crap because they have a profile . Those Soldiers give 110% everyday but because they have a profile , they are substandard . I think this type of mentality needs to go awaya Soldier should n't be judged because of a profile . <p> You know what , no matter what we say or do nothing changes . Senior NCOs and Officers only care about how their NCOERs and OERs look . They Senior NCOs lost focus on " Putting the need of the Soldier before their own " . They do n't  help the soldier get closer to their families , they do n't  care about the soldier Exceptional Family Member issues , they do n't  care period ! All they want is a NCOER or OER that looks stellar on paper . <p> I am in total agreement with you , SGT Widowmaker . I have a P3 profile on my PULHES and have to give up my Hat because I ca n't run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my darnedest to take care of troops and do the things you do . I have seen those upper enlisted who receive rank for being out in the FOB drinking coffee and sending others out on missions become 1SGs , SGMs and CSMs . Their leadership skills are lacking and appalling . AND they look at me like a scab for being injured and having surgeries to correct my ills . I am not complaining . I can deal with my problems . But , I see the pool of NCO leadership shrinking at an astounding rate . The Army Values are just cute cards passed out and not something to live . I see upper echelon leadership dismiss the high-speed , competent soldier for their buddy soldiers in the rule of promotion . WTFoxtrot ! ? ! I have lost good E-5s to this stupidity . And I have to babysit the E-7s , E-6s , etc. because no one knows what is going on or what to do . This is demoralizing . <p> Sergeant , God bless you ! I wish there would have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only name a few that I really looked up to because they had the , " I want you to be where I am someday " mentality . The leadership I witnessed was something that really made me not re-enlist because I thought , is this really the best thing for my life ? I like to believe that I excelled in my time serving but I can only imagine what a better institution the Army would be if everyone took upon personalty responsibility for their Soldiers . <p> What you 're describing were the same conditions I contended with in Germany back in 72 , 73 , 74 and 75 as a SP4 except for the addition of the hash smoke on Fridays . <p> At the time , I was assigned to Recon , 1/4Inf , then in the 3rd I 'd in Aschaffenburg . Our barracks were terrible until late in my tour , the NCOs were terrible ( For the most part there were some outstanding NCOs as well , to be fair ) but so was everything else : equipment ( M114A1E1 tracks ) a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . <p> We had good officers in Recon . But some of the NCOs were drunks ; many of the troops were druggies ( We actually sent in a bottle of JP4 instead of a urine sample for one troop ) and then there were those involved in the black market and , of course , the occasional gay NCO who would use his position , or at least try to , while the others turned a blind eye . <p> Its for these reasons and others that I have been talking my stepson out of enlisting . Because unless you 're going Ranger or SF , and possibly Airborne , I cant trust the run of the mill NCO to want to , or to actually do , their jobs . <p> There 's a reason our only living Medal of Honor recipient is getting out , when his military future is set if he stays in . And that 's particularly troubling since you know he could write his own ticket . <p> By your writing , I assume you are a former Officer ? If that is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you did , and so your words hold little value . Officers not supporting NCOs is one of the driving forces for which these issues arise . I agree that some NCOs are weak , just as weak as many of the Officers . I served in every NCO leadership position through 1SG and worked with some great NCOs and Officers , When we were all on the same page , we rocked . On the other hand , when the Officers failed to support good NCOs , units fell apart . In the best Cavalry unit I ever served in , we had a new Company Commander come in who bummed cigarettes and bought drinks for privates and that unit went to heck in a hand basketbut the soldiers thought he was cool . Just what he wantedto be thought of as a cool commander . At that time I was a Platoon Sergeant and I approached said commander about this . He shrugged me off and told me to relaxhe was just being one of the boys . More recently , I have seen leaders at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " cool guy club " . I am not insinuating that Officers are at fault , only that they play just as much a part in unit success when they lead by example , demand high standards , and then empower and demand NCOs enforce those high expectations . <p> How about instead of saying " The next morning one party realizes what happened possibly against their will if they were sober " , we stop- right here and now- assuming that sexual assault allegations arise when a victim was too drunk to realize they did n't  want to have sex . That places the onus on the victim to not get drunk , instead of on the person who committed the crime . A soldier should be able to be passed out drunk and not be worried they will be raped by a fellow soldier . But- they should have more respect for their job than to be passed out drunk . As of today however being passed out drunk is n't a crime and sexual assault is . <p> Maybe it should read " The next morning one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other person . " Let 's start telling soldiers to have sex when they are sober , instead of trying to liquor someone up for the purpose of getting sex that is otherwise unattainable . I think will clear up some time for more good training . <p> That is n't what I intended . The point I was trying to make is that frequently , alcohol is involved . Read the reports on sexual assault and 80% of the time , that is the case . But , whether or not alcohol is involved it is NEVER the victims fault . Alcohol seems to be a major contributing factor in the overwhelming majority of these incidents . <p> The onus is BOTH the victim and the perpetrator when alcohol is involved . I completely agree with your last paragraph there . <p> Now this problem of sexaul misconduct is not new . The leadership refuse too get down and hold those who rape and it is not just in the lower ranks but in all ranks upper and lower . How many cases of rape was reported during Iraq and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too do the right thing . Now they are up set with congress for telling them all ( Not No , Hell No Will the Commanders be involed in investigations of rape ) . They had more than enough time to correct the behavoir and fialed too do so . Now that prison time has been placed on the table for those who rape now look and see them all ( Come Home To Jesus ) . Get them all and you will see a change . America the right stuff needs to be taking place . <p> What if your in a unit that wants to distroy their soldiers . My Husband is in one of this and everything his Leadership want is to distroy their soldiers life . My Husband has a lot of medical Problems and needs a MEB . His Doc told him that but his Unit is fighting it even he ca n't proform his Duty . They violet profiles and do n't  care in what condition the Soldiers are . All they do is care about them self and get promodet . The Army needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chain of Command before more Soldier get treated like Shit bags . This unit was deployed . Half of the soldiers came back earlier because of medical problems . The ones what had to stay are so burned out that they are going to complain to higher ones about the way they get treated . The army needs to wake up and take care of their soldiers and not of bad Leaders <p> Your just wrong ! This is a woman who cares about her husband , and the first thing you talk about is her grammar ? I think the men are too burn out myself . But the fact of the matter is , the politicians know that if they started the draft , theyll get voted out . So they do n't  care if they send the same people in a 100x over , just so they get re-elected . In the end , the military should be looking out for their own . Not putting down wives that are just worried about their loved ones ! ! <p> MSG , you already accused someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so my grammer sucks . She was only pointing things out because she cares for her soldier . Is this how you handle things by assuming things ? Wow , just by your response shows what image and a leadership you are .

Yes , the NCO and some got into trouble but , our spouses got retaliated for it . I finally told my spouse get out its not worth putting another 4 years to get retirement . They can keep that crap and shove it up their asses . Best decision he ever made . <p> MSG , you already accused someone about their grammer . English is not my first language , so my grammer sucks .

@@96509492 @709492/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Post 9/11 GI Bill Benefit <p> When I joined the Army back in 1994 , I never expected it to be a long-term commitment . When I was first called by the recruiter I had long purple hair and was enjoying my now-extinct , minimum wage job at Blockbuster Music in San Antonio . My sister had given them my name after feeling bad for backing out of her decision to join . When the recruiter called me , I told him I was n't interested . He asked me what I was doing with my life and what my interests were . <p> Now , I was making great money as a DJ prior to moving back to Texas after I graduated from high school in Japan . In fact , I was making about $50 per hour DJing clubs oversees . When my dad moved to Jacksonville , Florida , I began DJing weddings and made even more money upwards of $150 per hour . However , I hated having to deal with the Momzillas and Bridezillas . No amount of money was worth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas and found another job where I could be around the music I loved . <p> While the recruiter was talking to me , I realized I had no real direction in my life . But , I did n't  really see myself doing well under the strict , authoritarian requirements of military service . After some prodding , I agreed to take the ASVAB , but only on the condition they come to me with it . Apparently , he had to get special permission to do it that way . I ended up scoring really high on the general technical ( GT ) , electronics ( EL ) , surveillance and communications ( SC ) and skilled technical ( ST ) portions of the test , but I did n't  like any of the jobs that opened up to me but one military police . While I attended high school in Jacksonville ( Nathan Bedford Forrest High School ) , I qualified to attend a technical school for half a day and high school the other half . It was a school that helped earn dual credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really liked . I placed 1st in plaster casting and fingerprinting at the state level VICA competitions and 2nd in extemporaneous speaking . I was also an Explorer and got to do fun events with law enforcement . I wanted to be a cop one day and help catch bad guys while serving the community . At the time , we did a lot of community engagement and policing . We would stop and join a water balloon fig , ht or help catch a dog that got loose . It was awesome . <p> Unfortunately , in order to become an MP at the time , I had to be 57 ? and I was 55 ? ! ! I was n't happy about that because there was n't a height requirement for women ! So , I told him I was n't interested in joining the Army . He said there was another possibility based on my scores if I was interested , but it required another test that I would have to take in a testing center . He said there are a lot more options available if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battery . <p> The DLAB is by far the craziest test Ive ever had to take . It consisted of a fake language , but was based on a set of rules . I cant remember how long we had , but we had to memorize the rules of this fictitious language within a set amount of time . Since its a fake test , its not designed to test how well you know a language , but your ability to learn one . There were over 125 audio and visual questions based on the rules given . Depending on your score , you qualified for various levels of languages . For example , Italian , Spanish , and Portuguese are a few Level I languages that require a score of 95 or higher . Level IV languages are the toughest to learn and require a score of 110 or higher and includes Arabic , Chinese , and Korean , among others . The max score is 164 ( I had to look that up ) . I scored a 118 . <p> Because I had passed the test and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence field . I was particularly interested in Signals Intelligence and decided to sign up . Because my training was two years long , I signed up for an initial six year . Turns out , I was pretty good at being a Soldier . I was an expert shot on every firearm platform I qualified on , plus LAW and grenade . Drill &amp; Ceremony came easily since I was a JROTC cadet during my senior year of high school in Japan . I loved reading and quickly memorized many army regulations that helped me succeed and get promoted quickly . By the time my first enlistment ended , I was a Staff Sergeant . I realized that I really loved the tactical aspects of SIGINT , but having done some missions in S. America , I was n't excited about going to a strategic unit a necessity if I wanted to make Sergeant First Class . After the USS Cole bombing in 2000 , I decided to branch over to become counterintelligence special agent in the hopes of making an impact against terrorism . Next thing I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire . <p> Because I was promoted so quickly , I did n't  have a lot of time to take college classes . I spent most of my time reading army manuals to be a better leader and Soldier . I took a class here and there , but I focused more on pushing my junior Soldiers to take courses to help them get promoted . I did n't  need the points from civilian education because I had maxed out my military education , awards and commanders recommendation points . Plus , I had already been Soldier of the Month and Quarter several times , which helped my appearance before the board . <p> Near the end of my career , I started going to job fairs . There were a lot of great companies I looked into . I began meeting with corporate recruiters who welcomed my experience as a great fit for the position . However , when they asked where I went to school and what my degree was in , I had to admit I did n't  have a degree . In spite of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job because I did n't  have a piece of paper that somehow made my intelligence official . <p> I know many of my predecessors who retired or left military service who waited too long to use their GI Bill benefits to get a " free " education ( there 's a 10-year statute of limitations ) and I was n't about to let that happen . I had a LOT of leave set up and had already turned over most of my duties a couple of months prior to start of my leave so I asked my command if I could start going to college during the fall semester of 2014 and they approved . Thankfully , my attendance at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center earned me a ton of college credits . <p> George Bush signed into law the Post 9/11 GI Bill . Under the old GI Bill , all expenses related to school had to paid for out of the $1700 each month while in school full time . Depending on the school , this did n't  go very far . The Post 9/11 GI Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the veteran gets up to $1000 for books . The new benefit also paid a monthly housing allowance to help offset the costs of being a fulltime student . This was very helpful considering that I had gained a family over 20 years the money helped offset some of my retirement so that I could focus on my education instead of worrying about needing a job . When I joined , I had to pay $100 for 12 months to qualify for the GI Bill . That 's a lot of money for a private , but my drill sergeants strongly encouraged us to do it anyway . That went away with the Post 9/11 GI Bill . <p> I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient the transition was . Most school have a Veterans Assistance office to help veterans use their benefits . The hardest part I found was the paperwork , application and registration to the school , and choosing a degree plan . The VA helped every step along the way . They government will only pay for classes that are in line with the degree plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of it . There is also a GPA standard students have to meet to get their benefits , though its admittedly not a very high standard in my opinion . <p> Its been a challenge to retrain my brain back into study mode , especially for my math classes , but I 've actually learned a lot . I 've also had to endure some of the liberal biases , which I unapologetically challenged . Much to my surprise , I still did well , maintaining a 3.9 GPA . My sociology teach docked me a grade for missing too many classes during the legislative session even though I got As on all my homework and tests . <p> I cant recommend that veterans take advantage of this valuable benefit instead of letting it lapse . The benefits of having a degree in the civilian world though I adamantly disagree with this thinking is immeasurable and could mean the difference between a potentially stagnant life and a potentially rewarding one . This is especially important for those jobs like many combat arms fields that do n't  translate well in the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit that our country felt we earned , so use it ! Its not difficult at all and there are plenty of people to help with every step of the process .

I 've got a few drafts that just do n't make enough sense to publish . Plus , my momma always said if you do n't something nice to say , shut your mouth . Not that I 've necessarily heeded that advice over the years , but I thought it prudent recently . <p> I lost a good friend a week ago . SSG Brian Cowdrey died October 13 , 2011 , during combat operations in RC-East . Brian was a medic with the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade .

He was hit by on his way back into the helicopter by the rotor blades as a result of high winds and only enough landing space for the choppers two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night are still living today . There were only two people who died in that firefight one being SSG Cowdrey , the other being an American Soldier who had already expired when Brian got there . <p> The shock was difficult to process . We had just been emailing each other that day and I was waiting on a response to question I had asked him about what he does . We were working on a blog post together about the great work that MEDEVAC troops are doing in Afghanistan in spite of some reports . <p> Then , I read on his wife , Jills , Facebook page confirming rumors that he had died . Here I was in Afghanistan and had no idea this had happened and then the nearly 12 hours of silence from him hit me . The first thing I did was head to my email and shot off an email to Brian : <p> " Brian , you have to answer this . I think Im seeing things and I need to answer this . I do n't  care what you say or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this email and let me know you 're ok . " <p> Nothing . Silence . Outlook just jeered at me in a pathetic lack of activity . Two days later , I was still not convinced . " I know now I 'm talking to myself , but I miss you bro , " I wrote in a Facebook message to him . He always responded on Facebook . He did n't  respond this time . <p> The tears flowed freely and I took a day to myself , not leaving my little 5+5 cell . I slept most of the day because I did n't  want to face the world and have people see me in that state . I use the time to grieve and get all the emotions out . <p> Initially , I was angry because I had missed Brian when he came through when he first arrived . We were making plans to try and meet up at some point while we were over here , but recognized it would n't be for awhile . We got here at about the same time and things had n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to find out if his body was coming through Bagram or Kandahar . If I was n't here to welcome him to Afghanistan , I was sure as hell not going to miss him leaving ! <p> I sent emails and made phone calls to my leaders asking for permission to fly to Bagram where the dignified transfer was to take place . I did n't  get any response to any of my messages , but I found out that I had missed him by two hours . Strike two . <p> I contacted his unit to find out when the memorial would be held . I again tried calling my unit and sent emails asking for permission to fly to Bagram to attend a good friends memorial . Nothing . <p> Strike three . I had failed Brian three times . I was blessed to have a friend I know and trust there with me here waiting to go on leave as I struggled with dealing with those emotions of loss .

He s one of the good ones and I consider him a friend , but I wo n't embarrass him by naming him . He knows who he is and needs to hurry back for a new game of Killer Bunnies . <p> Instead of succumbing to my anger , I opened my scriptures and read . And it just so happened that the chapter I was reading that day was Jacob 3 in the Book of Mormon . The Lord spoke to me immediately in verse 1 saying , " Look unto God with firmness of mind , and pray unto him with exceeding faith , and he will console you in your afflictions , and he will plead your cause , and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction .

I wont get into the specifics of which is which or who the players are , but suffice it to say that hypocrisy reigns in todays military , but there are also beacons of hope and justice in the darkness . <p> As affliction after affliction began piling onto my shoulders , my training and therapy began to kick in . I decided to start painting since writing was n't helping me . The words were coming out too sharp and I wisely sought the guidance of friends ( and my wife ) who suggested I not publish my words in my current state . <p> Kandahar is a rough place to be deployed for a year .

On Kandahar , we have what is affectionately known as the Poo Pond . It is a 4-stage , water treatment facility . And it stinks . I guess the best way to describe the smell that permeates most of the base is to imagine a cross between the worst sulphur odor mixed with beer vomit and sickly diarrhea . And that still does n't  do it justice . <p> The Poo Pond is sort of an icon here at KAF . You cant miss it .

My design had to be creative and different that what had already been done . <p> " Area Fifty-Poo " came pretty naturally .

And the result , I think , is a work of art . <p> Its important for Soldiers to find positive outlets for their angers , frustrations , and feelings of guilt and being let down .

@@96509505 @709505/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> The Case From Hell <p> A few days ago , frustration over my case again began to creep in . After all , I 'm stuck in legal limbo until the 3rd Court of Appeals issues a ruling on my appeal . Self Defense Fund filed the appeal in March 2014 , almost exactly a year after my false arrest and shortly after the second trial that resulted in a corrupt " conviction . " On February 23 of this year ( seriously , 2.23 ) , the court heard my appeal and just needed to release an opinion . <p> It is now October and we still have n't heard anything . I wanted to know if this was normal or if something was going on . Meanwhile , I 'm still " convicted " of a crime I did n't  commit , which is putting a lot of my life on hold . I have been wanting to start teaching LTC classes while I 'm going to school , but under Texas law if I do n't  qualify for a license to carry , I cant teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texans " convicted " of minor , non-violent offenses of their right to keep and bear arms . It is illegal to carry a firearm outside the home or office ( unless in a vehicle ) without a license . So anyone that is " convicted " in a Texas court for any misdemeanor offense loses their rights for five years just like a felon . The only other option is to get a nonresident permit from a reciprocal state to carry " legally . " Ironically , I got a letter from DPS about two weeks ago reminding me that my license to carry is set to expire in March and that I need to renew it ! Texas has had my license suspended longer than I 've been able to use it ! Regardless , I 'll never get another Texas license until it pass constitutional carry , then I 'll only get it for convenience if they reduce the outrageous 2nd amendment tax . <p> I knew that the appellate process could take some time working its way through the courts , but I never really knew what " time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals website to see if I could ease my mind a little and convince myself to be a little more patient . <p> In doing my research , I did not include civil cases , nor did I include cases that were dismissed or limited in scope to deciding on motions . I only considered cases with a final determination where the court either affirmed or reversed a conviction or remanded a case back to the trial court . For brevity , I confined my initial search from June 1 to September 30 , the last day they have published opinions . Eventually , I 'll all the back to the date my appeal was filed . While looking at the dates of the appeals , I did n't  think it was necessary to add another 120 lines since many of the appeals were filed after mine anyway . Plus , its monotonous reading through court documents ! <p> The research sample ended up consisting of 70 separate criminal cases that were ruled on by the court . The cases ranged from " failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " capital murder . " This was important because I was thinking that maybe the reason my case was taking so long was because it was a minor Class B misdemeanor case . Surely , the court has much more pressing matters to attend to and I would just have to wait . I found that there were many convictions for more minor offenses that the court had disposed of . <p> So , was my case unique and I just need to be patient and let the process work ? Heres what I found : <p> The average time between when an appeal is filed to the time the 3rd COA hears the case is about 444 days . The shortest time between filing and hearing was 85 days for an " evading arrest " conviction , a Class A misdemeanor . The longest time was 1,112 days for " aggravated assault , " a 2nd degree felony . The time it took the court to hear my case after we filed the appeal was 719 days the fourth longest time among the cases since July and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has heard a case , they need time to discuss and deliberate about whether the appeal is valid for a reversal or whether the trial court did everything right and the conviction should be affirmed . So , the next number I delved into was how long it took the court to issue an opinion once the case was before them . <p> The average time it took the court to issue an opinion after a case was brought before it was about 15 days . The shortest time between hearing and opinion was same day and the longest time was 221 days . Assuming that my case was decided today , it currently stands at 221 days ! ! So , of the cases that the have been decided since July , mine is already taking the longest and its still pending a judgment . The next longest time between hearing and opinion was 51 days . In other words , my case has taken 4.5 times longer than the next longest case and it still has n't  been resolved . Look at how long it took the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those top three cases that took longer than mine to go before the panel . They received an opinion within a week . <p> So this begs the question : what makes my case so special , different , or challenging that it is taking so long to issue an opinion ? It ca n't be because this is a complicated case . Its hard to imagine by any stretch of the imagination than an " interference " case would be more complicated than a " fraud , " " murder , " or " organized criminal activity " case . Is it because of the constitutional implications ? Many of the DWI and traffic cases involved constitutional issues as well . <p> One can only infer that the reason this particular case is taking so long is because it is the only case involving a second amendment issue of all the cases I saw through June . The 2A has become a very hot topic in Texas politics and this is an election year . I 'm not going to go any further down that line of thinking because I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other about elected judges . I just cant help but think something smells fishy . <p> All I know is that for SOME reason my case stands alone on the timeline. <h> 10 Comments on " The Case From Hell " <p> CJ , its obvious based on your research , it certainly appears unreasonable that your case would take so long . It certainly could be stalled because of the political climate . Then that would mean the Justice system is politically motivated in a biased way of some sort . What does the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals have to gain or prevent ? So it looks like the Justice system is not providing fair and timely results on your case for a reason unspecified . <p> So , it may be time for a Congressional or Senate intervention on your behalf . At what point will your lawyers ask the court about the delay based on the facts you have uncovered ? At what point will you go directly to the Governor for assistance . And at what point will you go back to the news media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outs of the legal system or personalities within Texas that you are dealing with , but your case could set a legal precedence . That is why it has been delayed until after the elections I think . <p> I am sorry to say our Justice system is NOT a just system . Just as our democracy is not a true democracy . The benefit of the doubt and the burden of proof of innocence is truly on the accused persons shoulders . A persons life is put on hold until they can prove their innocence . It may be completely destroyed while waiting for proof to be accepted or denied . <p> This country needs a complete revamp of the CRIMINAL justice system . And note it is a CRIMINAL justice system . It is permitted to lie , twist , and distort in order for convictions . It is permitted to arrest illegally and charge ( stack charges ) a person with whatever the DA wants , and falsely fine and or imprison that person for something they were not arrested for in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested on what avenues you had to take to get resolution . I may find myself in the same situation at some point and the final resolution of your case could be the key to a timely resolution . Please keep us informed of your progress . <p> I understand the frustration . I do n't  get how they can make a unconstitutional law to where you cant get your license to carry because of a DWI . But I cant get my license to carry until 2020 . I 've gotten two DWIs in a 10 year period . Since I got the second DWI its a class A Misdemeanor and if you have a class A you cant get your license until 10 years after the conviction date . I wish they would pass constitutional carry . But I doubt that will happen in my life time .

@@96509508 @709508/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> The Sentient Handgun <p> Longtime readers of this blog know that Ive been talking about gun rights for about 10 years here . The constitution is something I feel extremely passionate about . I am especially protective of the 1st , 2nd and 4th amendments . Its not that the others are less important , but more that I feel those are more under attack . I think these days gun rights are most endangered of those three . If I were to rank the most endangered of the three , it would be 2nd , 4th , then 1st . Right behind those but not far would be the 10th and 9th . <p> As I began my fight to repeal antiquated and reconstructionist Jim Crow gun law here in Texas , I 've heard it all . Nothing has angered me more than those who think only cops and our military should be armed as if they are somehow better , safer people than the rest of us . They do n't  realize that the entire reason the constitution protects our inalienable right to self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding fathers were highly suspicious of a standing army , as they should be . However , in the 1700s , there werent police forces like we have now , which I would argue are the standing armies of our time . <p> Before I go further , I 'm not anti-cop . I think its a great institution with a lot of people who truly want to make society better . There are also those that don their uniform because they crave the power , the respect , the authority , and the " rights " they think they have that others shouldnt . There was a time not even three years ago where I would give cops the benefit of the doubt in every situation . When I 'd see videos of people being beaten , handcuffed , or assaulted I was sure that those people did something to deserve it . That is , until it happened to me . <p> After I was assaulted and falsely arrested , my eyes were opened . I began paying more attention and noticed that these werent isolated cases of police misconduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same year I was arrested , the same department broke the collar bone of a 15-year old kid for spitting on the ground and tased a man for refusing to stop while he was trying to get to the hospital to see his dying brother even though at one point he jumped out of his truck and the told the chasing officer exactly what he was doing . Instead of escorting the guy to the hospital , he called in backup and when the guy got the emergency room , tased him for more than 9 seconds as he got out of his truck . His brother died while he sat in jail . <p> I do n't  think its disrespectful or even anti-cop to highlight and criticize those bad cops for what theyve done . I think that the unwillingness to do so is what enables them . Our courts enable them by virtually giving them limitless power to do whatever they want under the umbrella of " qualified immunity . " Our government bodies enable them by exempting them from the laws that us plebes must obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior and dismissing it as " a few bad apples . " <p> The main point I wanted to talk about in this post is a recent incident here in Texas wherein a University of Texas Police Officer shot himself in the leg . <p> University of Texas Police officer , Cory Morrison , was injured Tuesday morning when a weapon accidentally fired while in his holster . The bullet went into and out of his right leg according to UTPD Chief David Carter . The accident happened in the parking lot of UTPD headquarters at 7:30 a.m. when Carter said Morrison was talking to two colleagues . Morrison was standing outside a patrol car while talking to the two men inside when the gun went off . <p> See , if this happened to you or me , wed be arrested for endangerment and have to prove in court and plea out to a prosecutor that it was " an accident " in spite of the fact that there is no such thing as an " accidental discharge . " Instead , police officers get paid administrative leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot itself . If someone is safely handling their weapon it will NEVER " go off " or " accidentally fire , " especially one that is " in his holster . " There 's more to why I wanted to specifically mention this incident . I guarantee you that the officer was " playing " with this gun when it went off . I 've witnessed many times where officers standing around have their hands on their guns unseating it a few inches and reseating it repeatedly . They play this " in and out " game nonchalantly perhaps not even realizing it . This is most likely what happened to the UTPD officer . There is no reason to so much as touch a gun unless you 're about to use it . <p> During the committee hearing on open and campus carry , the Austin police chief ( where the University of Texas is located ) , the UT police chief , and the UT Medical police chief all testified against campus carry . They were concerned about " accidents " and " friendly fire " incidents . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incidents and were trained with firearms . <p> Now , here we have a situation where those officers who will respond to incidents and are " trained " with firearms are shooting themselves in parking lots on campus . What this proves is that law enforcement officers are n't  omnipotent . They are no better than you and me . They are people just like you and me are . They are not infallible . Police officers have shot themselves or others again and again and again and again and again and again and again andyou get the point . <p> I 'm not so stupid as to think that there will never be a negligent discharge somewhere on a college campus as some point in the future . The odds that it will happen eventually are high . Weve seen it on occasion with teachers allowed to carry guns ( or not ) . In the future , however , the student or teacher wont be given the benefit of the doubt . Upon the first incident occurring , there will be a steady drumbeat of " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry . This is in complete contradiction to what is occurring right now with this UT incident in which people are basically just shrugging their shoulders and " investigating " it . The officer may or may not be reprimanded or even fired . Regardless of what happens to him , you can bet that there are n't  calls to disarm law enforcement . <p> When Chief Acevedo testified , he remarked about how it took three minutes to arrive on the scene of an active shooter with an AK47 . THREE MINUTES ! The UT chief testified that they can respond to incidents at the school within five minutes . At Fort Hood , it took military police seven minutes to respond to the last active shooter and even longer for Nidal Hasan . <p> There is a double standard that needs to be addressed about incidents involving the use of guns ( notice I did n't  say " incidents involving guns " ) . We must return to a time when Americans were free to defend themselves wherever they went . A holstered gun is not a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 year old adult .

When their capital was done , they were finished . " Obviously , will power is different in every person . Some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If everyone could handle the events that lead to a diagnosis of PTSD , would there even be PTSD ? If everyone could handle PTSD , would we need counselors , programs , and mentors ? Now , that 's not to say that no one with PTSD is capable of dealing with life without those things . They all have some sort of help , be it family , friends or meaningful distractions . They are seeking treatment and finding people that help them " handle it . " Unfortunately , there are a lot of people at least 22 veterans per day who ca n't handle it . There are those that deal with their demons with alcohol , engaging in risky and adrenaline charged activities , or taking part in other reckless , criminality . Those are the guys that cant handle it . But , Trump is n't calling these people weak . <p> And Hillary has the unmitigated gall to go out and feign outrage while suggesting that Trump does n't  support veterans or that he thinks they are weak . She seized the opportunity to also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments are not just ignorant , they 're harmful , " she said , raising concerns that such remarks increase the stigma surrounding mental health . <p> " Every one of our troops matter . Their wounds could be visible , or they could be invisible , " Clinton said . <p> I wonder how many of the survivors in Benghazi are afflicted with PTSD because Hillary and Obama refused to send backup . How many survivors of those brave men that died think that Hillary truly believes " every one of our troops matter ? " If her boss , Leader Obama , cared about veterans , why is the VA worse off today than any time in decades ? Do you know how a Hillary presidency would affect veterans ? One only needs to look at how an Obama presidency HAS affected veterans . <p> A 76-year-old veteran committed suicide on Sunday in the parking lot of the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Long Island , where he had been a patient , according to the Suffolk County Police Department . <p> Peter A. Kaisen , of Islip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92 , the nursing home at the medical center . Why Mr. Kaisen decided to end his life was not immediately known , but two people connected to the hospital who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss his death said that he had been frustrated that he was unable to see an emergency-room physician for reasons related to his mental health . " He went to the E.R. and was denied service , " one of the people , who currently works at the hospital , said . " And then he went to his car and shot himself . " <p> What the media refuses to cover is that Trump understands the pain of troops with PTSD and has a plan . Whoever the new president is will have to undo the damage that Obama has done over the past eight years , including restoring funding to PTSD treatment programs . One such program with a phenomenal success rate in graduates at Fort Hood , the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Program , was cut over 60% ! ! I know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this program literally saved my life . I had tried to commit suicide in late 2013 prior to being admitted ( no , not with a gun either ) . I had a major relapse and needed help . After graduating from the program , I 'm in a better position than Ive ever been before . <p> Trump is saying he is going to restore what Obama has broken and he said as much when he followed up , saying , " we are going to have a very , very robust level of performance having to do with mental health . We are losing so many great people that could be taken care of if they have the proper careWhen you hear the 22 suicides every day , that should never be . So , were going to be addressing that very strongly and the whole mental health issue . Its going to be a very important issue when I take over and the VA is going to be fixed in so many waysIn many respects , that 's going to be the #1 thing we do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we would n't need mental health in the VA . I realize that its a difficult truth to admit , but it is the truth . <p> War is hell and inhuman . Ive written and talked about this often on this blog . Having to kill another human being is a difficult thing to overcome . For some , killing people is easy . For other , it is n't . That in no way makes either category of person bad . When in combat , killing should be easy or you die , but its not for everyone . Susan Mendus , a political philosopher , talks in her book Politics and Morality about how some people attribute virtue and integrity to their very identity . To some , not killing another man is just that virtue , but when they are forced to do so , they feel as if they have given up a part of who they ; that they have lost a part of their soul . This is what can lead some to experience PTSD and its something they ca n't handle . Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support him or not will understand that . 
@@96509517 @709517/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Awards Bias <p> Ive been wrestling with this post for a LONG time . The main reason is because to adequately demonstrate my point , I need to use a personal example . Its a very personal example and by sharing it I run the risk of looking like a whiner or self-righteous . So , I 'm going to begin by saying that I do n't  share this story as a way of puffing myself up , wanting sympathy , or to be treated like some sort of hero . As I relate this story , understand that the survival instinct is a strong one . I was motivated strictly by the desire to see my family again . I wrote about this a few years ago when I began to publish my blog , but I heavily edited this post for the reasons I 've just mentioned . You 'll understand as the post progresses and I 'll be honest that I 'm still not sure I 'm actually going to click the " publish " button on this one . I just do n't  want to draw attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army is the politics behind awards . I cant complain for myself because I 'm sort of the exception to the rule . I busted my ass as a junior NCO and I was awarded appropriately for it . However , when I got my first PCS award as a Staff Sergeant ( E-6 ) , my commander recommended me for a Meritorious Service Medal . Keep in mind that by that time , I had three or four Army Achievement Medals that I had earned by winning Soldier and NCO of the Year competitions . I also had earned the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal . All within the first four years of my military service . <p> When my MSM recommendation went up , it was strong ( I say this because my commander said so , not because I 'm stuck on myself ) . I believe in doing the best job possible at EVERYTHING I do in life . If my job is to burn poop , my goal is to be the best , most thorough poop burner ever ! If I have to clean the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stable will be the cleanest stable in the Army . When we took our trucks to the wash rack , I was always the last one done because of how thorough I was in cleaning it . <p> My leadership time in the Army started in basic training . Being a JROTC graduate , the Army was n't very difficult to master . Being a military brat , I understood the quirks . During the first three weeks of basic training , my platoon went through five platoon guides ( the Soldier responsible for marching the platoon , passing along orders and information , and ensuring standards were met . I was the sixth and I lasted the remaining five weeks , graduating as the platoon guide by not getting myself fired . <p> When I got to my first unit , we were so undermanned ( it was Clintons Army ) that I was put in charge as a Private First Class of a squad . I remained a squad leader until NCOs came along and then I was placed as a Team Leader . Basically what I 'm saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rank dictated . And I did n't  mind . I loved the challenge . I still love the challenge . <p> When my MSM went up ( I know , I keep getting sidetracked ) , someone up at Squadron kicked it back and said that it needed to be written as an Army Commendation Medal because I was a Staff Sergeants and still on my first enlistment . My commander strengthened the award even more and it got kicked back because I did n't  even have an ARCOM and now I 'm being recommended for a MSM ( from lowest to highest rank the medals are : AAM , ARCOM , MSM ) . The commander came to me and apologized for the politics and asked what I thought about getting an ARCOM . I told him I did n't  care what I got , but what did he think I honestly deserved . When he told me he thought I deserved an MSM , I told him that he should submit it as an MSM . There is a reason that the back of the award recommendations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block . Each level in the award approval process has the opportunity to either concur with the recommendation or recommend that it be downgraded to a lower award . <p> So , my commander a brave and noble officer named Scott Hurley submitted my award as an MSM knowing it was going to be downgraded . When it got to Squadron , we got a call saying that the LTC was going to downgrade it and wanted to give us another shot just to send it up as an ARCOM . " Keep it going , " we said . That 's why they call them " Intermediate Authorities " and , finally , the " Approval Authority . " I now have an MSM that I wear that is signed by a Captain , recommended for downgrade to an ARCOM by a LTC ( not a lowly rank ) , overrided as a MSM by a COL , and finally approved by a Brigadier General as an MSM . Interestingly enough , every command echelon left a comment in the comment block EXCEPT the LTC who recommended downgrade . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach rank to an award criteria . <p> Nothing has changed . As a First Sergeant , I feel like I expend a lot of energy fighting this same system . To be honest , a vast majority of them are because the recommender does n't  write the award very strongly . They use empty statements , vanilla bullets , or poor writing to substantiate their recommendation . Just as a Staff Sergeant or sergeant should n't be denied an award by virtue of their rank , neither should a senior NCO or officer get an award because of it . I 'm not going to get very specific about my present situation since I do n't  want to burn any bridges or embarrass anyone . <p> You may remember a story I wrote in my journal about having to clear a trench line . The background is that after a major firefight outside of Al Hilla , Iraq , I dismounted to survey the battleground and collect intelligence on the unit we had just fought . People talk about being affected by seeing dead bodies or body parts my job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at varying degrees of decomposition than I ever care to talk about . I 've seen , smelled , and done it all with respect to that . <p> So myself , one of my SGTs , the commander of the armor company I was attached to , our embedded reporter , and two engineers began our mission collecting intelligence and weapons and surveying the battlefield . The area consisted of several irrigation ditches crisscrossing their way through a bunch sparsely populated palm forest . The trees were spread out approximately 15 feet from each other in neat rows at least the ones that werent toppled during the firefight . As I was checking the bodies , I looked up to the sound of an M-16 going off and one of the engineers jumping over a ditch that turned out to be a trench . The sounds of AK fire broke the calm , eery silence and a hail of bullets filled the void . All of our support was cut off as their only weapons were their main cannons and they could n't use them or theyd hit us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Command and Press to repulse the ambush . Six people , only five of whom are armed , and all of whom are scattered beyond the ability to coordinate . Our weapons consisted of my 9mm pistol ( I left my M4 in my track as I completed my mission ) , the commanders 9mm pistol , the reporters camera and notepad , and three M16s ( one of which had an M203 grenade launcher attached . <p> For the purposes of this discussion , I 'll use the enemys location in the trench as the 12 oclock position . I was located approximately 150 meters from the trench at about the five oclock position . the commander and reporter ( Jules Crittendon ) were about 200 away at the six oclock just behind me and to my left . My SGT was about 25 meters to my left at about the six thirty position . The two engineers were located at the eight oclock position approximately 200 meters away from me . The commander was yelling for the grenadier to fire his M203 into the trench and upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered and prepared for the signal . Nothing . Again , I shouted the order as loud as I could over all the gunfire . Nothing . <p> This is where the survival instinct takes over . We have our basic load of ammunition which is being expended quickly and who knows what they have stashed in that trench . Something had to be done quickly . We were at a terrible terrain disadvantage . I timed my move to coincide with a short lull in 7.62 lead flying our way and bolted for the next cover position to my left about 50 meters away both towards the engineers and the trench line . As I reached the tree I realized it was much too skinny for me to crouch behind and decided to stand profiled behind it . the bark from the tree shattered right where my head was . If the tree had n't  been there , neither would my head . <p> Okay , I do n't  want to go into the details anymore . Long story , short : I ended up making my way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we could bound forward . The problem was that I was the only one bounding . With only one magazine left , I made the decision that I was just going to take the trench at the next explosion . I 'm still alive so I obviously made it out barely . <p> A short time later , the commander came up to me very apologetically . He told me that he had submitted me for a Silver Star for saving his life and the others with me . You see now why I do n't  like telling this story ? I do n't  want anyone to look at me differently . Unfortunately , the command told him to downgrade it to a Bronze Star Medal with V device . He said he fought it , but that I deserved something for my actions that day and if the most they were going to authorize was a BSM(V) , he was going to submit it as such . I told him did n't  want or expect anything , I just wanted to live through the day . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There were a lot of people in that trench and it was luck that I had a full magazine . <p> Fast forward a few months . Baghdad has fallen and we are supposed to be going home . As part of our preparations , the leaders were supposed to write up the end of deployment awards for our Soldiers . We had been in theater for 9 months , with three of those being involved in heavy force of force combat daily ! After the Hilla operation , I was attached to the China Battalion , 3/15 Infantry . My callsign China Spook . As all the awards are getting submitted , my chief tells me that my BSM(V) was approved , but that I would not be getting an end of deployment award . The reason : I was already getting one ! So , at the risk of sounding whiny , nothing I did during combat is reflected in any type of award except that one , hour-long firefight . Nine months boiled down into one hour . Keep in mind , too , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , my team went through more ammo than all the other THTs put together . And we did n't  waste any of it . At the height of stupidity , I actually had to write a freakin memo about why I had used my thermite grenade . Our battalion had n't  quite figured out we were at war yet ! They were stuck in the rear where we had cleared a safe passage through the barrel of a gun . So , to avoid the " unfairness " associated with giving out more than one award , they just made it look like my BSM(V) was my end of tour award . I did get an ARCOM for my time in Fallujah , though ! I 'm sure that made those commanders happy that did n't  think I should be wearing an MSM without one . <p> Believe it or not , I did n't  care that I was n't getting an award . I really did n't  think I deserved that BSM(V) either . Ill skip over all the Fallujah stuff since it does n't  further my main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we finally got home , the Battalion held an awards ceremony . I was called up with a bunch of other individuals receiving Bronze Stars . All of them were senior NCOs , Warrant Officers , and Officers . The junior Soldiers got ARCOMs or AAMs . Wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong . I had to FIGHT hard just to get my Soldiers AT LEAST a V device on their ARCOMs . They almost died with me on many occasions . And standing up there with these real heroes who deserved better were all the staff officers and NCOs who were safely tucked into their FOBs and at the airport with their shiny Bronze Stars ! I wanted to be sick . My Soldiers DESERVED BSMs for their actions , not their rank . <p> Thankfully , I think the military has gone a long way in awarding combat awards , but there are still problems . However , its amplified here at home with " peacetime " awards , or PCS awards . here 's the bottom line : If a Soldiers deserves a particular award , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if factual does n't  look like the award you were thinking of , downgrade it yourself or reassess your bullets . <p> I 'm not quite sure where I am anymore as I 've worked myself into a frenzy here . I 've probably got a million grammar mistakes from typing so fast ( did you know I can type 80 words per minute ? ) . We just need to do a better job of recognizing our Soldiers . It really boils down to taking care of Soldiers by conducting regular counseling and actively being involved with them . Keep records of the things they do and write down metrics of success . By keeping up with this with each of your Soldiers , writing the right award wont be so difficult . You wo n't even have to " embellish a little " to make it sound good . The last thing we want is for the awards system to get more inflated with silly recommendations that should never get approved . <p> If the Soldier is deserving of an MSM , write it as an MSM . If its deserving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , write it as such . If that 's all a Soldier did , then that 's all they deserve . No one is ENTITLED to an end of tour award . But they also shouldnt be denied one because you do n't  want to go through the pains of actually writing it correctly ! ! NCO ( and officers ) need to take their time and write that award as if they were writing it for their best friend or a family member . If you REALLY think they accomplished something , it should reflect in the award . <p> Simply doing ones job is not a basis for an award . For example , I work my arse off every day . I put in about 12-14 hour days almost daily . An eight-hour day is " coming home early " to my family . But , that 's what First Sergeants do . We have a lot of keep track of and very little time to do it all . And I work my admin folks to the bone , so I 'm not trying to do it all myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an award when I leave here because I 'm just doing my job . Now , if a Sergeant First Class or Staff Sergeant were doing my job , that would be different because they are accomplishing tasks way above their pay grade . If you honestly believe a Soldier is deserving of a particular award , you 've taken into consideration the Command Sergeant Majors guidance ( who 99.9% of the time knows what he/she is talking about ) , and still honestly believe in your recommendation send it up ! Do n't  downgrade it because someone in the chain is afraid of it getting downgraded . <p> Keep in mind that you have a history of getting awards downgraded , it looks bad on YOU . No one will ever trust your recommendations and you 'll be doing more harm than good in recommending Soldiers for anything . I 've NEVER had an award downgraded . I 've had them kicked back for corrections and changes , but never downgraded . Because when I write an award , there 's a reason I 'm doing it . A Soldier is deserving of recognition . Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're supposed to if you believe that strongly in your write up . If it gets downgraded , you 've learned a less hopefully and will incorporate that lesson into future recommendations . Or you 'll just be laughed at . Your choice . <p> Okay , some final notes . I do n't  want to be patted on the back . I know that some Soldiers read this site because we get a lot of . mil hits each day ( probably just big brother keeping tabs on me ) . My hope is that they get something out of this with respect to awards legitimacy and bias . <h> 31 Comments on " Awards Bias " <p> I see no change . Awards are still based primarily on rank . As such , they are meaningless . There should be a way for soldiers to recognize their peers without the imposition of rank . Even if they are not counted on records or worth " points toward promotion . " I can not write MSMs for those that deserve them , my command will not " bother " a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It is a problem in all fields of service so it seems . I got to this site trying to find help writing up a good award for one of my guys that I am being told to write up a NAM for . The issue I have with this is that I am being asked to write an award to someone who is just doing their job and our job at the moment is n't really that hard . So how am I suppose to write up an award for someone when in my heart I do n't  really feel they deserve it ? <p> Great points and well taken . I came to this posting and had to read your whole point . I am under the gun to write MSM awards to soldiers who yes did all we asked of them . They came to work on time . They did extra hours . A couple of them even deployed . My issue is that I do n't  see how to write an award to a soldier who after 30 years was still only an E5/SGT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do yet I find it just hard to justify it . Hell I busted my ass too and all I have after 32 years is 4 AAMs from the units I have served in . Even a deployment earned me only an AAM ( my unit did the 50/50 thing AAM and ARCOM and because I got promoted to SFC in theater I only deserved the AAM ) . I will write them up as best I can . If they fly great . If not I can only do my best . Maybe I will get schooled here . <p> Thanks for the points . I completely agree with you and I am venting too . Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . <p> I wish I would have had your first commander . On my last PCS award my first bullet was a year in Kuwait , the next bullet was 3 months in Egypt and the next two were TDY and other missions I accomplished . I never got a tour award for Egypt or Kuwait because they kept telling me they were saving up for an MSM . Well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award but in the end the recommender sent it up as an ARCOM . <p> You know I am fighting this right now with my LT from Viet Nam . I was in a ARP/LRP unit of the 11th ACR .. recently We discovered that many of the soldiers did n't  even get CIBs even though all had or were involved in 4 or more major contacts where we lost KIAs and many WIAs . I found out recently that the pilots all had DFCs Silver Stars , BSM/Vs AMs , Arcoms you name it . Even though the guys were put in for various awards non or few received anything now we are fighting to right the wrongs . We found out that the Awards officer trashed most of ours . For what reasons who knows . One Medic was put in for the MOH heard nothing and was then given a Silver star 10 years later with NO orders . Presented by a Congressman . This whole deal stinks . Rank has its privilege .. <p> Totally agree with you . I saw this problem myself . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had one and LTs should only have one " . Funny thingI busted my arse so much he could n't get away with doing that again and I got two others before he left command <p> This very a very good post . I have served for over 13 years . I have list of accomplishments that I have all the documents and evidence from my accomplishments . It is good to know that my previous leadership has been given awards . I have documented that as well . <p> In peacetime and deployment , I have seen awards go to people with UCMJ actions , investigations , Height/Weight issues , and for doing nothing . <p> Top , I was just promoted on June 1st this year and am in the process of writing my first award for one of my soldiers . He is a SPC and has been recommended for an ARCOM by another units CWO3 for bringing in a mission that no one at site could accomplish ( were strategic SATCOM ) . The award was downgraded to a Certificate of Appreciation , not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the year he worked as our STEP NCOIC , a position normally manned by a SSG or higer . He received no recognition for this . Now he is back on shift under myself and he was again pulled to the STEP office because the SSG who normally holds that position had to go out on emergency leave . For the past two weeks he has been pulling double duty working 15 hr. shifts also responsible for STEP and Circuit Actions . I found your entry VERY helpful and just want you to know that you have supplied me with knowledge as to how the system works and what to expect . <p> I remember reading the account Jules wrote about the firefight you described . I never made the connection and realized that you and your guys were the ones involved . If I recall correctly , he wrote that that firefight was the one time he wished he was carrying a weapon . <p> I thin everyone who has been in the military has stories similar to yours . The one of mine that burned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a BSM(V) for " holding the battalion together " in Ramadi after an IED strike killed 3 soldiers from my platoon in Falluja . Meanwhile , two soldiers who performed heroically on the ground had their BSM(V) citations downgraded to an ARCOM(V) and a ARCOM . Go Army . <p> CJ , the Army is n't the only branch that has problems writing up awards . Every thing you said can be echoed on the Marine Corps side of the house . <p> Just an example from my deployment last year , we had special staff officers and SNCOs getting NavyCom medals and above while the troops who were out pushing up the dirt to make the COP , building the SWA huts for the COP , and providing security were lucky to get a CerCom . I was one of those special staff NCOs who ended up getting squished for awards because the S-1 section " did n't  do anything " on the deployment . Yeah , okay . I deployed doing a job that I had n't  even been to the formal school for and still did better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to the formal school ! Not complaining about the award I got , but let 's use some common sense , folks . <p> " Do n't  downgrade it because someone in the chain is afraid of it getting downgraded . " <p> Amen , Top , make them publicly make their mark on the award . It burns me when I see a young NCO or Soldier busting his ass and going above and beyond whether in garrison or combat , and the award write up backs all of that up , but the Head Shed only looks at the rank of the awardee . <p> I think the problem is that these medals are important for promotion , and promotion is necessary for retention ( or at least was when I was in the Army ) . <p> I spent 12 years in the Army , 8 active duty and 4 DoD civilian . During that entire time , I was locked in a basement with a very big computer and did stuff that I cant really talk about and most folk would n't understand . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly worried about meeting my height-weight requirements . <p> I did n't  care about medals . I did n't  care much about getting out in the sunshine at all . I had a couple million dollars worth of hardware , a virtual reality setup , and all the time in the world to play with it . Periodically , someone would come down and tell me I was getting a medal . <p> I do n't  know why I got the medals . I do n't  actually remember what they were . I got a certficate for something I did after 9/11 , but that did n't  come with a medal and I do n't  know why that was , either . <p> I asked my boss ( who was a civilian ) why he bothered with these medals . I could care less . I was happy doing what I was doing . Everybody else seemed happy with what I was doing . What was the deal ? He told me that if I did n't  get them , I would n't get promoted . And if I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the medals . <p> I always felt guilty , because I knew there were people out there busting their butts and getting shot at . While what I did kept some folk from getting killed , and made sure some of the right people *did* get killed , it certainly did n't  put *me* in harms way . <p> And , certainly , my medals werent for combat . But apparently they were necessary for me to keep doing what I did . As long as these things are necessary for that kind of mundane advancement , there will necessarily be gaming of the system about it . <p> CJ , I guess many of us were in the same boat , but I got lucky and recd an AAR instead of an AAM , because the NCO I worked for understood that as a B10 , no advanced school , my culture and identifying skills were those of a B30 or better . So , you are correct , keep pushing when you know you 're right . And , damn , somebody tell those politically punked officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero respect . Leading by example is the only way . Good Job , Top ! <p> To be fair , I recently read the book " Medal of Honor : Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty . " Its a great collection of stories about Medal of Honor recipients . However , if you look at the overall MoH statistics , most recipients were enlisted men . <p> Top , Thanks for this great post . You really struck a nerve with this one . It is funny that the organization that defends the American way of life is itself a socialistic nightmare . I can not tell you how sick it made me to see officers getting awards for wiping their asses while those that worked for a living were totally ignored . You hear things like , " I doubt he will get a MoH , because they do n't  like giving that out to lower enlisted . " <p> I served in peace time . The system kept me at a SP4p in an MOS that had its promotion points at 999 for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me switch my MOS . During this same time I would watch incompetent , in my judgment , officers getting their rank due to time served . I am not complaining for myself , but for those now serving . <p> This is also why I believe the Swift Vets when they say Kerrys medals were never or lightly earned . <p> Most of that comment I made was intended as commentary for those who think you 're " tooting your own horn " . My point was , for those that know you , it does n't  take the award to know that you are a good person . I know you do n't  like a big deal made about what you have done , " just doing your job " as you see it = <p> That being said , those who are deserving should be rewarded solely for their actions , with no connections whatsoever to rank . As I said above : " Good post ! " <p> Couldnt agree more ! seems many of these BSM awards have confused duty for bravery/courage . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when debriefed after a horrific VBIED attack &amp; firefight , left out the part where he spent 10 minutes of the 11 minute attack huddled in panic in a stairwell while his squad moved assets and defended their position . and the two E4s who were responsible for saving the lives of the squad were told point blank that their battalion did n't  give BSM to ranks below E5 after their second deployment to Iraq the soldiers used to joke that the only way to get a Bronze Star was to be an officer ( even a non-commissioned one ) or dead . <p> this is from a 2004 Slate article ( and I suspect the ratios got worse , not better , through time ) : <p> The Air Force awarded 2,425 Bronze Stars and 21 Silver Stars from March 2002 to August 2004 for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . Twenty-seven airmen were killed in combat during that time , making the Air Forces ratio of top-level ground-combat medals to fatalities 91-to-1 . ( This figure does n't  include medals awarded for airborne bravery . ) <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17,498 Bronze Stars and 133 Silver Stars in Operation Iraqi Freedom , while 636 soldiers have died , an awards ratio of 27-to-1 . <p> And the Marine Corps has awarded just 701 Bronze Stars , 12 Silver Stars , and six Navy Crosses ( the Navys second-highest award ) for combat in Iraq , while 264 Marines died%u2014a ratio of less than 3-to-1 . <p> I experienced similar things with our division the last time I was deployed . You can only get so many awards , this guy could only get this award and no higher . Everyone will get an end of tour award ( even if they are a dirtbag ) , random downgrades of awards earned in combat with no explanation from higher as to whyits infuriating , and baffling . <p> In an Army that is concerned with retaining soldiers , one of the tools at its disposal is awards . They do n't  cost anything , they let the soldier know someone appreciates what he has done and it rubs off on othersthis is when the award system is done correctly . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces the opposite of the intended effect . <p> That is what I love about the Army , it never changes ( but should ) . I had many similar stories from 1966 to retirement . <p> TOP you and the good CO , will be always hold a place of honor with those who served with you . They know the true story . The strap hangers and star chasers will be remembered by all for what the truly were . <p> I feel your pain , CJ , having been there , done that myself . Long story short , I retired as a 1SG after serving in SpecOps and Abn units for the majority of my career . My retirement award ? A big fat nothing ! Seems my chain of command couldnt find it in themselves to submit me for anything higher than an MSM ( to go with the 5 I already wear ) ; when I told them that I would consider it an insult to my career if they did so they took the easy route and did n't  submit anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff happens in the SEAL Teams as well , and our officers are regularly overcompensated in the awards process . Per regs , the BSM is available for either heroic or meritorious achievement in a combat zone . As such , it is very subject to abuse and it is a huge difference if it carries the V. That said , rank does play a role and my BV likely would not have been awarded had I not just made Chief Petty Officer at the time of the write up . <p> To me , when you are talking about Silver Stars and up , there is absolutely no room for politics and bullshit . The idea that somebody could receive a SS for an end of tour award is disgusting . You get the SS for risking your life in combat to get the job done , not for completing a deployment in overall outstanding fashion . I see the SS as an award that is tied to a specific action and not to cover a series of missions performed well . The Acheivement , COM , MSM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the SS . <p> I saw the same rank-based award system . Not to get all Pshrinky , but its just FOBbits trying to impose comforting ORDER on what is , by its nature , disordered . Eyeball-to-eyeball combat does n't  fit into nice , sterile categories . " Oh , this is a silver , oh this is a bronze " Absolute studs turn into sniveling wrecks and duds present steel-laced spines . Rank does not correlate to bravery . Awards will ALWAYS be jacked up in our job because its an orderly process overlayed onto a hash of action and reaction . Not making excuses , Top , just sayin <p> Top , you are absolutely right . Having just returned from Afghanistan , I saw exactly what you are talking about in action . I saw an LTC submit HIMSELF for a Silver Star , have it refused outright by his boss , and then try to submit himself twice more for BSMVs . He s got political aspirations . Lots of Bronze Stars going to desk jockeys who just did their jobs and were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit a SSG who was doing an SFC or MSG job as a mentor for a BSM . We submitted our SECFOR guys , who did n't  belong to us , for awards only to have them hijacked , downgraded , lost , and under-represented by their real chain of command . Our boys did n't  get anything that we submitted them for . I could go on and on , but sometimes it does work out . Some of our guys ( mentor team members ) got what they deserved . One MAJ who seriously deserved the Silver Star had it downgraded on the front end because of his rank and the fact that the awards board at Phoenix did n't  know what to do with a SS recommendation . They were afraid . He got a BSMV , but it was a compromise . He is one of the finest officers I 've ever known . LTCs who deserved a spanking go home with a BSM because its just what they get and nobody wanted to deal with the huge whining sound that would have erupted had they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and frustrated with the whole shebang . You are not the lone ranger . The advice about consistently taking care to document your soldiers is the best stuff there . This is particularly hard in combat or in little outposts , but it is what will make a difference at the end of the day and the end of the tour . Thanks for writing this piece . <p> CJ , I want to give a big AMEN to this post ! It should be required reading at every leadership and command course in the armed forces . Not inflating awards and writing them truthfully is just as important as putting someone in for an award who deserves one . That 's how you support your troops ; not by putting everyone forward for an award whether they deserve it or not and certainly not by " forgetting " to write an award because you 've already written one or because they 're leaving , or because its just too much of a hassle . Leaders take care of their people ; and recognizing deserving deeds is just a part of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great leader . <p> Good post , CJ . And , regardless of what awards you do or do n't  get , your friends and family , and I 'm guessing also your colleagues , know that you are a good man , and I guess that 's about the best that could be said of anyone .

I did n't  really even know about the group until he told me . However , I 've been mesmerized by their stupidity ever since . <p> Most of you know about the recent " hunger strike " that Code Pink has been suffering through . I say it that way because its not really a hunger strike . They eat fruits and drink vegetable and fruit juices on this " strike " . Maybe their friends Saddam Hussein and the guys at Guantanamo werent clear when they explained the rules . <p> Supposedly , five Iraqi delegates heard about their hunger strike and invited them to Jordan to discuss topics related to the US presence in Iraq . The Code Pink delegation consisted of former Democratic Senator Tom Hayden ( also an advisor to the Out of Iraq Caucus ) , retired Colonel Ann Wright ( who has been actively encouraging our soldiers to go AWOL and other overtly subversive activities ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " soldier " who still wears his desert camouflage uniform top with the US flag sewn on UPSIDE DOWN at events ) , Medea Benjamin and other members of Code Pink . <p> As a matter of fact , it was mainly Code Pink that consisted of this delegation .

Even after an exhaustive Google search on the topic , their identities remain anonymous . Until now <p> I 've learned who at least two of these five " delegates " are . The first is Iraqi Front for National Dialogue leader Saleh Al-Mutlaq . Dr. Mutlaq is a supporter and ally of Muqtada al Sadr and the Mahdi Militia .

Their rise to prominence came after the crisis in Fallujah . The Association helped to broker the cease fire and an exchange of prisoners for money . Yup , for money . " He regards resistance as a personal duty ( fard +G-ayn ) that is ignored at the risk of denying tawhid , the unity of God . " ( Middle East Report #237 ) He is quoted as saying that taking up arms is even more important to a Muslim than fasting and prayer . <p> These are the types of people by whom our Congressmen are being advised .

The caucus has also joined forces with the " Troops Home Fast " organization , which was formed by Code Pink . You see where this is going . Its one big circle . If your representative happens to be on this list , I suggest you send them an email or give them a telephone call . <p> ( Update ) Here are the names of the other Iraqis who met with the delegation and their identities .

Not only in our words , but in our actions as well .

Take the time to write letters to our troops , send care packages . Visit America Supports You , contact one of the many Troop Support organizations they highlight and get involved .

My youngest son is a SrA and leaving in about one week on a second deployment to Iraq . I know he will have a strong suppport group . I am a member of the Blue Star Moms , a USO volunteer , and I help with Operation Care and Comfort . Its with these various support groups we can support not only our sons and daughters , but we can reach out to those who do not have strong support .

The kids all brought money one night and we loaded up the leaders cars and headed 5 minutes down the road to Wal-Mart to buy things . The kids had a BLAST picking things out for the soldiers . We sent 5 boxes to the Chaplain of the unit . You should have seen these kids . The girls in my group were trying to figure out how to buy the most for our money ( " buy generic , its cheper ! !

It is so hard for me as a Mom to think that some people have children over there that they do not even write to . I understand that times are tough so care packages might be hard on them financially but a letter ? ? ? I have had soldiers in that situation and it just breaks my heart . <p> Normally , around the holidays , I send out several small packages to random soldiers that I get addresses for from anysoldier.com .

Many of us here write to soldiers and send care packages , some through Soldiers Angels , AdoptaPlatoon and other organizations that are listed on America Supports You . Having been doing the troop support stuff since 2000 , I 've heard many of them say over and over that the things that mean the most to them are the letters from home , many times letters from people they do n't  know , telling them how much they support them . <p> Maybe you 've heard of it , maybe you have n't , but there is a program that matches people here at home who want to support the troops by writing to them , with troops who would like letters of support . Its called My Soldier , and they have a website at mysoldier.com .

I 've written a couple letters and it just makes me feel like I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that it may only affect one person . Its quite rewarding . <p> I totally agree . Supporting our troops is very rewarding and I 've made some lifelong friends in doing so . <p> Thankfully , the military is beginning to recognize that this is indeed a serious problem and they 're putting more and more services in place for both the deployed troops and the troops who are returning from combat . But so many of these soldiers , like SPC Crutchfield fall through the cracks and either do n't  reach out for the help or are told by insensitive commanders to " suck it up " . That 's why its so important that we DO something , not just talk about it . <p> After reading the first two sentences , my thought was " I need this to get his address " and then I read is name and recognized it . So sad that things like this keep happening . If you do n't  already do something in support of our troops , please consider doing so . It is so easy and so rewarding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it was suicide this breaks my heart .

John of Argghhh ! even went so far as to call it a " mall guard uniform " to General Bergner during the Milblog Conference . The uniform is virtually identical to the current dress blues for enlisted Soldiers ( shown left ) , with three small differences . Most notably , the new ASU uses low-waisted trousers exclusively , instead of the current choice of low- or high-waisted trousers . On Soldiers in the rank of Specialist and below , the pants will NOT contain a gold trouser leg ornamentation . Only NCOs and Officers will have these . There is virtually no change for officers from the Dress Blue uniform to the new Army Service Uniform . <p> Second , the service stripes that used to wrap around each sleeve of the jacket for enlisted Soldiers have been replaced with the Army Green service hashes . Not only does this allow for service time as the Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overseas service bars ( called combat stripes by some ) on the right sleeve . While I wish that the Army had chosen to keep the historical wrap-around service stripes , this is only a minor change . <p> Third , and finally , is the placement of the " Combat Service Identification Badge " . At first , I had mixed reviews of this myself , but then I got to thinking about it . No longer will Soldiers have to worry about sewing patches on and off their Class uniform , ruining the jacket as they move from unit to unit . Those of you who have PCSd from 1st Cav to some place like 3rd I 'd know what I 'm talking about . The sleeves get ruined by the constant sewing and removing of unit patches and the holes left from previous larger patches are eyesores . From now on , the only " patch " that will need to be changed would be the CSIB . And even that would be a matter of choice if a Soldier has deployed to combat with more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue uniform , so why is everyone so upset with the ASU ?

My greens are hanging in my closet and look like they just came from the cleaner . They hold their shape well , the material is strong and does not get those little " pilings " . The new uniform does . It looks like a door mans uniform . Not that there is any shame in being a door man , but we are soldiers . I do n't  mind paying the money or changing things . But why something that looks like a uniform out of the civil war ? And its cheaply made . Who do we have to petition to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retiree indicates he/she is retired with the ASU . Anyone know the answer ? AR 670-1 does not address the ASU for retirees . Obviously , you do n't  sew on the retirement shoulder patch . <p> A reason for the change is because they want to " stream line " our uniforms and to make us a " more uniformed " service to match our sister branches . If I wanted to wear a Marine style uniform , I wouldve joined the Marines . We should be proud to be in the Army and to distinguish ourselves as our own branch . It should be Navy whites , Air Force blue , Marine brown , and ARMY GREEN . The beret is tacky , and with all of the decorations worn on the front , it looks cluttered and like a Christmas tree .

I graduated BCT with the greens and was proud to wear the same uniform that my mom and my brother wore when they served . I 'm disgusted and embarrassed to have to change over to Dress Blues . This new Army Service Uniform does n't  promote tradition or pride in my service . <p> Well get out then ! Blue has always been the traditional color of the Army . Hell its the traditional color of the US . Just like green is for the Russians , red for the British , light blue for the French , and gray for the Germans .

So get over it or get out ! <p> I served in the Regular Army from 83-85 , and from 87-89 . Since I served in Combat Arms-Field Artillery , I did not have many opportunities to wear my Dress Greens ( aka The Class A Uniform ) . When I did wear the Greens , I did so with pride . Even though I have been out of the service since Aug of 89 ( I was medically-honorably discharged for sustaining a back injury while performing my duties as a Cannon Crewman/Gunner ) , I can honestly say that I DO NOT LIKE THE ARMY SERVICE UNIFORM . Some folks have remarked that it looks like a clown suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter comment . The blues were not designed to be worn as frequently as the greens . For one thing , the light blue trousers and the white shirt soil easily . And I have NEVER liked the decision to switch to the beret . The Rangers got a royal screwing when that fool Shinseki ( sp ) decided to let all troops wear it . Nope , I 'll take the greens anytime . The Army Service Uniform looks like crap . That is one thing that I do n't  miss about the Army . I 'm sure some of you soldiers out there will beg to differ , and I invite you to notice that as an Army Veteran who served honorably ( No demotions , No Company Grade and Field Grade Article 15s ) , I am entitled to express my opinion . Thanks and keep up the outstanding job , Soldiers . HOOOWAH ! <p> We rarely even wear dress uniforms . So your argument is invalid . We wear ACUs in garrison , field , or on deployment . Wearing dress uniforms while traveling went out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in the 101st for 3 years we never wore a dress uniform except for the companies ball . That was mandatory for all Soldiers to attend from PV1 to O3 . <p> Granted that there will be modifications to fine tune the Army Blue uniform over the next few years I believe that the " rank and file " will come to accept and then stand tall in Yankee Blues . However , there are a few suggestions that occur to me . Since the white shirt for Class B use seems to be very unpopular why not go back to the traditional Old Army shirt when worn without the blouse . A dark blue shirt over the light blue trousers . Enlisted chevrons ( large ) and leg stripes to reflect branch colors of the wearers MOS . Service stripes to be larger like the Navy or USMC types but not as huge as the wrap around style . For current unit identification : lapel ( class A ) and collar ( class B ) brass would be numbered to the battalion level . Officers would continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard many comments regarding adding a belt to the Class A blouse . If a belt is seen as important , why not adopt a garrison belt for enlisted and a sam browne belt for officers ? Headgear is always a controversial subject . For what its worth , I think the beret should be reserved for traditional beret wearing units : Maroon for Airborne , Green for SF , and whatever color the rangers would choose ( perhaps by vote ? ) The default headgear for everyone should be the blue visored service cap showing branch or MOS affiliation . Good looking cap and goes well with the blues . Lots more thoughts but these are plenty enough for now . For those of you currently on active duty , how about doing a web-search to see examples of traditional Army Blue Uniforms and then providing some feedback ? Thanks . <p> The Army has yet again demonstrated that it does believe in Army tradition : feigning interest in Soldier feedback , not actually listening ; promising to incorporate feedback ; then doing whatever the current PEO/Senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We have TRADITIONALLY had more than 1 ( quasi ) dress uniform . It is TRADITION to maintain multiple uniforms and have pride in doing so . Yeah , its uncomfortable and inconvienient : so are deployments . Yet , that is the life ALL of us chose . But you stand up ASUs vs . Dress blues , dress blues will win everytime . They look sharp and have a connection to the Civil War . So do n't  feed us that hogwash about Roots in the Revolutionary War . If that 's the case we need to rock what the fife and drum corps is wearing . <p> Also do n't  forget recent traditions , like unit patches .. I have pride in the 1st I 'd .. and proud of its WW1 thru present history . That counts too . The Army espirit de corps comes from the BN and up not the Army level down . <p> There is no cookie cutter/one size fits all solution to this problem- just like the ACU failed , the ASU will too . Maintain tradition , do n't  destroy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes us special and unique trying to keep up with the joneses <p> i took my class blues and just converted by swapping the service stripes and combat stripes . iam going to wear the old pants that used to have the suspenders instead of the one with the belt . Is that okay ? how would any one know . if i did not take my jacket off . <p> I think the new ASU is a terrible mistake . I like the dress blues ; they look great . The ASU with the jacket on ( ie , the " class A " ) looks great too . BUT , the " class B " uniform is 100% mall cop . Look at the cover of the movie " Mall Cop , " and what do you see ? Oh , that 's right , its the class b ASU with a flag on the shoulder . <p> Many of you do n't  wear this uniform everyday , but for those of us who do , I am embarrassed to wear this uniform and feel naked without the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . A colored shirt ( either gray or tan ) would make a world of difference ! Ill be trying to wear my old green class Bs until 2014 ! ! <p> I like the Dress blues that the Honor Gurad wear at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . The tunic is a bit longer , does n't  have junk all over it in unorderly locations , and has a belt to sinch down the middle for a very tight , sharp look . The new ASU basically took that unifrom and mutilated it . Use of the beret with it only looks tacky . Instead , why not just have colors for the band on the cap of the old blues ? I hate the direction the Army is going in ; lower standards . The ACU was bad enough . <p> All I can say as a former Army soldier is that the new ASU is fine except that the current unit patch and the combat patch should still be on the shoulders like they are with the green uniform . I do n't  like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> this new uniform is a JOKE .. there is a reason that the " Old Guard " has stricter height and weight standards . just wait till some of those 54 ? soldiers on the overweight program start running around in dress blues . you know the ones i 'm talking about . they make up about 5-10% of every company . sure the combat arms units are a little better off but i assure you its going to be ugly . Hell , there are still knuckleheads that cant wear that stupid beret after 10 years . At least the greens somewhat covered up those " chunky " soldiers . the good news is ill have retired before these are mandatory .. god help us all . <p> There is an awful lot of emotion with the change to the ASU . I can say , at first I was very resistant to the idea of it . I believed that the greens were just fine , although uncomfortable . However , there is a good amount of talk about " pride " . I do n't  think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disheveled uniform is not only out of regs , but it does take away from our image as a whole . I too dislike the ACU uniform , but its what we have now . I cant say I one hundred percent back the ASU , but its what we 've got . So be it . My pride comes from somewhere else though . If the Army that I love outfitted me in rags and sent me out , that 's okay . Clothes do n't  make the man . My pride comes from knowing that I 'm part of something much bigger than anything most people will ever understand . My pride comes from knowing , my brothers in arms and I are ready to do whatever we have to for our great nation . I understand that a lot of people have a desire to have devices that display their combat service . All I can say to that is , to each their own . I personally do n't  wear my combat patch on my ACUs . No need for me to advertise to anyone that I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all willingly signed up for . I would listen to anyone just the same , whether they deployed or not , and I expect the same from others . The new uniforms , love or hate them , are here . Anytime the Army changes something there will always be those who sit on one side of the fence or the other . The only thing we can do is accept it and soldier on . <p> I do like the look of the " blues " but some of changes I do n't  agree with . One is the position of the Combat Service Identification Badge . Why not put it and your current unit on the shoulders ? It looks tacky having it on the jacket . It looks even worse on the female jacket . I have also noticed that if you are n't  in an airborne unit the NCO has to wear the service hat ( or as I call it the bus driver hat ) . Since we are stuck with the beret why not make it the head gear for the ASU . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless you are in the airborne , special forces or rangers which are elite units , keep the patrol cap for garrison wear . <p> I have read some of your comments and agree with some . I personally think that we should have left the beret to the Rangers . They earned it ! ! I especially agree with the fact that the Marines have not changed their uniforms so why are we changing ours . When a marine wears his/her uniform you can definitely see the pride . Bring back the combat patch and unit patch . Go back to WWII or stick with the green . Stop changing the unifors . Oh by the way . Go back to the BDU . The current ACU looks awful . We look like a bunch of wrinkled clothes velcro coming off , dirty boots that can not clean properly . Where is the pride <p> Personally , I voted for the pinks &amp; greens , but I do n't  have much control over things like this I would have kept the grey shirt , SSI and SSI-FWTS but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier has done for his/her Army as far as deployments go ( one of the biggest factors in todays Army ) . The metal badges on the belly/waistline have only the one pro , and many cons ( less cost over time , but you still have to buy new ones ) . <p> Summary : <p> Go back to grey shirts Bring back the shoulder patches Keep the Green ribbons on the forearms <p> Basically , take the accessories of the Greens and put them on a more tailored , classically-colored uniform <p> The black beret was originally for tankers and they were pissed to see it go to some ground pounders . Black berets are not stained by rease and takers are covered in grease . As for shaping berets , why would I ask the SF when they do everything in their power not to wear the uniform or shave or render proper military courtesy . <p> As an officer I do n't  mind the changes overall , but what I do find offensive is the fact that officers no longer where their units DUI . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear unit " patch " / " badge " to denote the unit they are currently assigned . There needs to be a " belly badge " on the other side to denote the unit one is currently assigned to . Without these how are we suppose to build esprit de corps ? <p> As a PL , CO CDR , XO or BN CDR I now have no affliation what so ever with the unit I am commanding/leading in . <p> The complaint is not the ASU it is the loss of the Green Uniform I hear soldiers and veterans+GG complain about . I am sure when the old Brown and " pinks " uniforms were eliminated the same happened . My father told me of the uproar when the Eisenhower Jacket was discontinued . Take it for what its worth . <p> It is entirely fine to call it " 1st Cav " . Nobody assumes you are refering to a Regiment , as they would if you said 7th Cav . Also a Regiment is n't commanded by a LTC , squadrons are . Also if you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about . <p> I am writing for three comments I keep hearing troops complain about . I keep hearing all of the comments about the Army not staying with tradition and the we should go back to the WW II dress uniform . Yes , the WW II uniform was a very stylish uniform . If you try to put all the overweight troops in them it would not be as appealing as you think . If you look up the heritage of the dress blue uniform you will find it dates back to 1779 . This was the uniform worn until 1902 . In 1954 , the official dress uniform became the dress greens . At that time , the blues became the official uniform for specialty services such as the honor guard . The troops stating that the uniform is not staying with traditions are way off mark . <p> Next , is the beret , get over it . The beret is the official headgear ! Learn to wear it properly an wear it with pride . In my opinion by troops wearing it incorrectly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beret worn by the Army Rangers was not a big deal . It was changed to all troops to unify and inspire . Lastly for the combat i 'd badge on the blues . It is not mandatory to wear it . If you do n't  like the placement , do n't  wear it . Simple . <p> As a senior NCO , what do you say to people who DO wear the beret properly and with pride and still do n't  like it ? Are we not allowed to express any opposition to something a HUGE majority of troops do n't  like ? Personally , I like the blues and I 'm glad its becoming the official uniform . <p> I might be one of the few here who are not that impressed with the WW2 uniforms . Olive drabe color looks ugly . The Khaki pants had a pink tinge too them that I though quit odd . The enlisted uniforms were even uglier then the current fugly green Class As . There really is no reason any more to wear green uniforms any way . Why do we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Blue ASU ? No ! But its a start in the right direction . Return to the AArmys roots , go blue ! ! ! <p> If we want to go to a uniform " rooted in tradition " then let 's not go with the mall guard uniform and go with the pinks and greens from WWII . Unlike the abomination above , the pink and greens looks like a uniform that you would be proud to wear , not , I 'm in this monkey suit for 40,000 for college . Even the class As you where proud to wear . I am proud of the uniform I wear ( not the ACUs , that 's another story for another day ) , it was uncomfortable yes , but , I carried myself with pride in it , I never looked at it and thought to myself , you ca n't be serious . The combat patch is on the stomach , who came up with this madness ? For all those who say it looks exactly like the blues , you obviously did n't  gag when you first saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the Blues are meant for functions that would probably require a nice suit that requires a bow tie .. something Joe would n't attend . So Joe gets a uniform that looks good and can be worn to weddings , funerals , church , I do n't  know what else and looks professional . The best way I can put it , its like wearing a suit with tails to a funeral , its just not practical and that 's what I think when I see the ASUs. ( clown suit sounds more deserving ) It is n't a practical uniform , it does n't  scream I have pride when I wear this , it does n't  tell me that he/she is a Soldier . We are talking pride here and the ASU just does not deliver . <p> David if you are only in this " monkey suit " for the 40,000 college then shut up . Your opinion means nothing . In fact , it degrades the opinions of those that actually matter . If you did a little research you would see that the blues are a homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the revolution until the late 19th century . <p> For a uniform rooted in history go back the the revolution and note the color Blue . The current ASU is rooted in that tradition . Look at the civil war era uniform . It was blue and as much of the same ornamentation that the ASU right down to branch colors and shoulder straps and light blue pants . This is the tradional uniform of the army in the traditional color . For the record , I like the WWII pinks and greens too . <p> I hate the ASU . It takes away from the historical significance of unit patches . For soldiers that have not been to combat they will no longer be able to wear the non-subdued unit patch taking away a lot of history with it . The pin on combat badge on the females looks dumb since it is only a couple inches above the waist . We need to keep the full size service stripes . Also the blue pants with white shirt looks really bad . When you have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They need to keep the blues the way they were and bring back the old kahki tan color uniforms from WWII . The Marines have not changed their uniforms why do we have to keep changing ours . Let 's keep some history for once ! <p> I got ta say I am not a fan . I was even one of the few soldiers that was surveyed late last year and I gave my input , but it was not this . I think they should have kept the grey shirt for everyday wear and white for formal only . Also , they need to agree to one headgear , keep the large service stripes and dumb the pin on combat badge/pin thingy . <p> Bill , this new uniform is not meant for the retired Soldiers , as hard as that is to admit . It is meant for todays Soldiers . Why would you want to wear a uniform you never wore in service anyway ? I loved it when my grandfather came to my military functions wearing his WWII uniform instead of trying to keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer on active duty any more by wearing the uniform they retired with . <p> As for the clothing maintenance allowance , why should we have to live with it ? Our clothing allowance is barely enough to cover the combat uniforms as it is , much less having to care for uniforms ruined because of needless and constant alterations . Why continue a problem to be paid for than solve a problem that will save money ? <p> You have a very good point with regard to the overseas service bars . I think the ribbon says it all and we should have kept the wrap-around sleeve bars . <p> I do n't  think a regulation is need for VETERANS to wear the new uniforms . Veterans were soldiers that served and fought like those of us have today . Young and old we are all brothers and sisters of the armed forces , and both have earned the same rights as the next . We would n't be where we are at today in our MOSs had the veterans had n't  lead the way . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the uniform its self . The other two thirds is made up of the brothers and sisters of the armed forces . In other words the new ASUs are n't  what 's important , its the individual who 's wearing it ! So I say forget about the looks and remember why we wear it ! May all my brothers and sisters in arms have a great day ! <p> -The seam to seam service stripes are part of the alure &amp; tradition of the blues , KEEP em ! -The changing of shoulder patches with each assignment is why you get a Clothing Maintenance Allowance live with it ! -Overseas Service Bars already have a ribbon why duplicate ! -Combat Service bars can be replaced by another ribbon ! -How will a Retiree show that they are not on active duty anymore ? <p> I 've noticed a couple of comments on the Overseas Service Bars throughout this thread thought I 'd make a note ( sorry in advance for the length ! ) : <p> The Overseas Service Bars denote 6 months of creditable service in a designated combat zone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please let me explain- <p> The Overseas Service Ribbon denotes an individual tour ( usually 1 year hardship or 2-3 years accompanied ) to an overseas duty location . Campaign medals denote participation in certain named campaigns campaign stars can be added to certain medals , but do not indicate how long an individual was actually there ( simply participation in one or more named campaigns covered by the medal ) . The Shoulder Sleeve Insignia-Former Wartime Service ( SSI-FWS ) denotes at least 30 days creditable service in various combat zones ( unless the Soldier was injured but that 's another story ) but again , does not indicate how long a Soldier has been in combat . The Combat Infantry/Action/Medic Badges all indicate honorable service while engaging or engaged by the enemy but again , do not indicate how long the Soldier was there and only one award may be given for each Operation . <p> The list goes on however , the function served by the OSB remains unique on the uniform . <p> As to replacing the Overseas Service Bars with another ribbon that is certainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ribbon may end up diluting the visual impact ; a tower of OSBs makes a much more dramatic visual impact to me than a long line of bronze , silver , or gold oak leaf clusters . <p> I hope this clears things up a little . Thanks for the interest , and have a good one ! <p> According to Army AR 600-8-22 , Army Awards , the Overseas Service Ribbon is now authorized for successful completion of an overseas tour per TCS or PCS orders , regardless of length , and regardless of whether a separate award ( i.e. campaign ) is authorized . <p> In addition , according to Army AR 670-1 , Army Uniforms , the former SSI-FWTS ( combat patch ) which is being replaced by the CSIB aslo had a change recently ( Appendix F ) . This change is significant , now completely eliminating the time period required meaning from day one in theater and only allowing credit from your organic unit meaning the patch you wear going into theater is the only one you can wear as your " combat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post . <p> Well thank God is n't up to you . The greens with the cunt cap made you look like a dork . It was an abomination ! Let me guess you are some retiree who is mad that you did n't  get to have a set of dress blues ? Do n't  worry you can still wear your cunt cap on Veterans day and show todays Soldiers what their missing out on ! <p> Im retired , and I thank God I am . I would be absolutely appalled at having to wear that embarrasing blue uniform and look like a mall cop , instead of the combat soldier I was . The Army has an atrocious history with uniforms , and a seemingly insurmountable challenge with tradition . Since 1940 , the Army has changed its Class A uniform five times , its Class B uniform four times , and its combat utilities no less than eleven times . Over that same time span , the tradition-bound Navy has never changed its Class A uniform , the proud Marine Corps has never changed its Class A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class A uniform since its creation . <p> The 1940-1945 olive drab enlisted , and pink and green officer Class As evolved through Koreas nondescript uniforms and into the modern greens . With the discontinuance of the khaki Class As , the greens became the single standard . As an evolution of the Armys uniform from its glory days of World War II , through Korea , then Vietnam , and into post-Vietnam , the greens represented a classic soldierly appearance based upon at least a semblance of history , and came to symbolize the modern day United States Army . Sadly , all that was lost in an instant with these hotel doorman-like blues . <p> If the Army is so insistant on the wearing of thse pathetic blue Class As , at the very least they could begin to limit the ridiculous issuance of ribbons and badges . Seems the Army now has a ribbon , and a badge , for everything . Apparently , they now even have a tab for every occasion . A ribbon for completing basic , seriously ? A badge for flying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seriously ? With those laughable blue uniforms , and rows of ribbons rolling up chests and over shoulders to halfway down their backs , Army soldiers now resemble tin-pot dictators from some third world 1950s-era banana republic . <p> General Patreus wore 18 rows of ribbons , and never fired a shot in anger . I served three tours in Vietnam , first with the 173d Airborne Brigade , then on a SFOD-A with 5th SFG , then on a SOG Hatchet Team in CNN . I was awarded a Silver Star , a Bronze Star , and two Purple Hearts . I came home from Vietnam with two rows of ribbons and a CIB . Where did Patreus fight to earn 18 rows of ribbons . He looks like a joke from a B-grade move about South America . Now with all those phony accoutraments on those stupid blue uniforms , he looks like a clown from a Barnum and Baily circus . <p> And , if they insist on wearing those blue uniforms , at the very least they could drop all the multi-colored headgear . Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Berets are British , garrison caps are traditional American . We used to have a saying when I was in . The Army will dress a man to look like anything , while the Marine Corps will dress anything to look like a man . Seems some things just never change . Soldiers in those blue uniforms do not look like men , they look more like adolecent mall cops . <p> When I was in , no soldier was proud of anything more than wearing that combat patch on his right shoulder . That 's gone with these blues . Airborne troops were proud of that para-glider patch on their garrison caps , because that connected us with those increadible men of the old 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions . That 's gone with these blues . Same with blousing out jump boots , and that looks absolutely stupid with these blues . Later on , none we more proud of any part of our uniform than our green berets . They look absolutely stupid with these blues . And I wo n't even get into the pathetic Army legs hijacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking when I read Johns post about the new uniform ! Its very much like the current Blues , which I love . The tucked-in pants for Airborne looks out of place with the Blues , and the smaller service stripes are n't  quite as impressive as the wrap-around stripes , but otherwise , I like the new look . I 've never been a fan of the Greens , but love the Blues , so maybe that 's why . <p> Tracy , the only reason the guy on the right has his trousers tucked in is because he s Airborne . Most troops will not tuck in their trousers like that . I do n't  like it either . I think its always looked tacky , even in the greens . <p> I noticed that the guy on the right has his pants tucked into his boots and the guy on the left does not . That makes it look less " dressy " but I do n't  know if that matters or not . Just something I noticed .

Even when I sort of wrote about it when I shared my journal a few years ago , I glossed over this episode . Ive been ignoring it for a long time publicly , while battling it daily privately . <p> I recently started back to school in a difficult step towards getting a degree . One of my assignments for my English class was to write about an event that shaped my life . Before I even finished reading the assignment , this story popped into my head . I do n't  share it in an attempt to gain sympathy or cry for help . To me , its just therapy ; one of the reasons I began this blog to begin with . <p> I believe that war is an inhumane act . It forces people to become animals . Now , that does n't  mean that I 'm a pacifist or that war is n't necessary . On the contrary , it is unfortunately . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few steps back in an evolutionary sense . Survival tends to tap an instinct most of us suppress until called upon . The story Im about to tell is n't pretty . You wo n't find a hero in this story . You wo n't even find a noble soldier . You 'll find a human who was required to make a difficult decisionand made the wrong one . <p> March 26 , 2003 : The day I lost my soul . <p> We had been fighting a very determined , though ill-trained , enemy . The smell of moisture mixed with dust and sand was in the air , forcing its way into our lungs . The blistering sound silence resonated into the core of our ears , it threatened to drive us mad . In the distance , the howl of a mangy dog sounded the attack . The silence was broken by the unmistakable whistling sound that precedes the thunderous boom of an artillery shell landing nearby . The concussion literally steals the very breath from your lungs . The air turned into the stale odor of explosives . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fight had only just begun . Before it was all over , I would abandon my personal values and lose my soul . <p> In the distance I could make out a flash . At first it appeared as if it could have been lightning . However , lightning does not whistle after it flashes , and it does n't  get louder and closer . <p> " INCOMING ! ! " I shouted . My team hit the ground . We covered our faces with our hands as if that would save us . At such a moment , one tries to minimize his presence and the fetal position seems to be the best way to hide . Katink , tink , tink+G- . <p> The round is a dud and lands within several feet from our position . In the distance , I heard a loud boom and instantly the radios came to life . <p> Everyone was talking over everyone else trying to find out what had happened . A familiar voice finally waded through all the static and fuss and the commander told everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that a car slammed into one our tanks . <p> Shortly after the loud boom , a blur moved past us just a few inches above our truck . It was followed by a whoosh and left a smoke cloud in its wake . It had come and gone before we even had a chance to react to the RPG being fired at us . The shooter was taken down . I was getting angry at all these close calls . <p> The occupants of the car arrived at my position . The loud boom I heard two minutes earlier was their car exploding in a huge ball of fire and debris . After it crashed into the tank it was pushed off to the side of road . It had failed to detonate when it crashed , but was obviously still armed . No one was hurt in the explosion . <p> Through the thick sand I could make out the three silhouettes moving towards us . One of the men was dressed in common Iraqi clothing +G tan , baggy pants , a plain white t-shirt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic brown tennis shoes . The second man had been shot a few times . His upper , left shoulder looked like it had been hit twice and a trail of blood dripping down his right arm most likely hid the evidence of a third shot . He wore a tan , short sleeve , button-up shirt that was tarnished with sparkling red blood oozing from the bullet wounds . He wore a greasy mop of dark hair that appeared to have a mind of its own , collecting as much mud , blood , and dirt as possible . The last individual appeared to be the oldest and most in trouble . He was propped between the shoulders of the other two men , hunched over and barely able to keep his head up . As he approached us , his knobby knees , covered with tattered material from what used to be his jeans , buckled twice . His leathery face attempted an awkward smile as his defeated brown eyes met mine . Without saying a word , every expression called out for my help . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to provide first aid to anyone that needed it . This old man needed it . His left hand was all but nonexistent . He had maybe two fingers left . The brilliant white bone what once connected fingers jutted out like quills of a porcupine . One of his bloody , mangled fingers simply hung from his hand , swinging from side to side freely with each movement . A skeletal pinky bone was all that remained of the last finger . It had been stripped of its meat and muscle . Someone had placed a tourniquet around his lower arm in an attempt to stem the bleeding . It was n't working . The stench of iron permeated my nasal cavities as we seated the bloodied men next to our truck . <p> We were still getting shot at and he kept asking for help . I asked him where the soldiers were coming from . They claimed to have no idea . I asked him why he rammed into one our tanks . Silence . Swooooosh+G- . <p> Another near miss from an RPG , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned red . My pulse quickened . My blood pressure shot up . I decided I did n't  care if this old man died right then and there . We stopped trying to stem the flow of blood and forced him to keep walking . For the first time in this war , I refused medical care to someone in need and I paid for that decision with my soul . The shell of my body returned to its position , unloading my weapon into the forest . <p> For the remainder of my time in Iraq , I thought about this one event . What became of that old man ? Did he make it over the bridge behind us ? Did I now have blood on my hands , both literally and metaphorically speaking ? My parents always raised me to think of others before myself . My faith teaches me to love everyone , even those would rather see me mangled and lifeless .

She replied " If I do n't  look after myself then how can I expect to look after any one else ? " <p> I feel so very priviliged to read your diaries CJ . God has given you a gift . He allowed you to go through what you did . If that is only to show his grace and mercy through you online in this virtual world , then it works ! Everything you write is filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2003 you managed to convey a sense of responsibility for your thoughts and acts when faced with the extreme . <p> You are one of the noblest Americans I know . A fine example of everything I could hope for in a representative of our country and in our values , and in our military . I think your writing proves that you still have your soul . Thanks for sharing your experience . It is remarkable in its stark honesty , and I shed a tear for you . Thanks again , a million times over , for your service . <p> CJ , I 'm like the others here . I do n't  blame you for what you did over there . Until we have been in the same situation you were in , we will never know what we would do in that situation . <p> From all your writings , I can see that you are a very kind person who would not intentionally hurt anyone . Yet in the heat of battle , you have to do some things that you do n't  like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for doing your duty for our country ! ! You are one of my heroes and do n't  ever forget that ! ! <p> Anyway , if you did something wrong , we have a loving God who will forgive you and let you go on with your life . I will pray for you about this . May God Bless You Always ! ! <p> Having met you in person CJ , I know that you 're definately not a person who 's lost his soul , but instead a very giving , loving and caring man who did what he thought best in a very difficult situation . The CJ that I know and care about is someone who is proud of his job , proud of his country and someone who gives of himself , even in the face of possible death and ridicule from others who do n't  share the same beliefs you do . You acted in a very tense and heated situation that many of us will never have to face in our lives . You did what you felt was necessary at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for writing about something that has bothered you for sometime , for sharing something about yourself that many would n't have the courage to do . <p> CJ , you wrote your post from the perspective of a person who has lost his soul . Please help me , does the actual evidence support this view ? In my view , the facts show you writing about that internal battle going on in your mind . Without a soul , this awareness would be impossible . I am glad you had the strength and courage to write about it . Respectfully , " Grumpy " <p> War is terrible , no question , no matter if it+GGs right or wrong . It doesn+GGt matter how much training , how much experience , it all comes down to survival , and you are just a human , and part of a band of brothers . The fact that you are not proud of your actions shows how great a man you still are , and I truly believe you did what you thought best in the heat of the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments , for all service members . Please do not beat yourself up about this . Those men made a choice too . <p> Facing the truth about ourselves is hard sometimes . I 'm afraid that when we refer to terrorists or murders as " monsters " we defame the poor beasts of the earth . Only mankind is capable of inhumanity . I learned sometime ago that there is no evil that another human being has done that I am not capable of . <p> But it is not necessary to loose your soul . I gave mine away when I was quite young to the only one who can keep it safely . And if at some time in rebellion I do the unthinkable ( which has incidentallly happened before ) , he is the only one who can do anything to fix it . I tell you the truth , in every difficult situation I have ever facedeven the ones of my own makinghis grace has been more than enough .

My desert storm hat has a Combat Infantry Badge ( CIB ) pin on the front of it , and I considered placing the pin on my new hat . As I was doing this a thought came to me of a time when I first came home , I had not been back long at the ripe age of 21 . I went into a convenience store and was buying something at the register ( probably gas ) and as I was leaving this young guy maybe a little younger than me was coming in the door. +- <p> I had my+- BDU+- ( Battle Dress Uniform ) jacket on with a+- CIB+- patch on it . This young punk was coming in the door and looked at the patch on my jacket and said , " Did you earn that ? " I immediately went into homicidal+- ideation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , after what seemed like hours , I told him in as shitty a way that I could and almost screamed at him " YES ! " I am pretty sure I had an intimidating posture to put an emphasis on my point . Guess what ? Instantaneously he became extremely intelligent and did not say another word . <p> If you see a person in public with military clothes on , a hat or something that signifies that they were in the military . Do yourself a favor and do not ask him or her about medals , badges , or any insignia they may have displayed right away , especially in a negative way . Tell them welcome home , and then gauge their reaction and if they want to talk to you they may open up some . But , do not take this as an invitation to ask personal information . Our military+- experiences+- have anextremely+- sacred and personal compartment in our minds and hearts that we place them in . Many of us do not even tell our wives , family or friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear our military memorabilia+- because we want people to ask us about them , we wear them to remind us of shit we will never be able to forget . If you can not understand that then you have no business asking us about anything. +- <h> 22 Comments on " More Stupid Crap to Say to a Combat Veteran " <p> I have asked a few people wearing a " C.I.B " if they earned it but it was because they were not the type to have earned it . You see I was in the service and a combat veteran and I get realy offended when I see a hippy or protester wearing the medals or badges that friends have died to earn the right to wear . I understand your responce and would have been the same . I see many kids who are 16-23 and are well mentaly slow and cant spell there names and on ssi pretend to be veterans when seeing myself and my friends walking by . These idiots will ask " does it bother you to have killed all the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap on them . The usualy respond with " I was a navy seal but i got kicked out of boot camp in Ft . Benning for smoking pot " WTF do they even know how stupid they sound ? I find it to realy bother me to see people wearing military and veteran items that do n't  even know anyone who served . I once was kicked out of a store for pulling out my military i 'd to show my age when buying smokes . Later after sep11 the same store clerk tried to give me a free pack of smokes . My own family have said some realy bad things and did n't  even know it . Myself and my younger brother are both combat veterans , and my brother is now in the guard as a recuiter , yet i am realy messed up from wounds recieved in combat . My brother and I have little contact with our other family members since we hold grudges from the stuff they have said . Our dad for example does not understand why I had been so upset when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found in my grandmothers house when my grandmother pasted on . My dad said " that 's just a silly ring " and those words hurt so bad . Not only did I earn the one ring from my first A.I.T. but the second one was when I reclassed and wow the second M.O.S. had a hard selection . And I have had friends die when in both the M.O.S.es . some friends were even badly hurt trying out to earn those rings let alone those who died for there service . <p> Quote : " This young punk was coming in the door and looked at the patch on my jacket and said , " Did you earn that ? " <p> I wonder what was he thinking ? Perhaps he was not a punk , but maybe dress weird ? Can be you descriptive of the person . <p> Is it possible you pre-judged him ? I just want to rule that out . <p> He could have been a not-so-bright individual also . Where he does n't  understand respect . So , in his mind , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to understand that also . There are a lot of low IQs around . Trust me . <p> And if you were gone say , from 18 to 21 . That is a big difference . A lot of people I knew when I was 18 have gone separate paths . At least I have . I know what it is like not knowing anyone in a town , and feel foreign . But , I tried anyway . <p> Yet , I do agree with you in that , I get asked this all too often . Where are you from ? And what do you do ? <p> I just met you . I am just not used to this kind of conversation . I never started conversations like that . Shows their intelligence level also . Why do n't  they chill , talk about something non-personal first . <p> Just because you know everyone else sh*t in the city does n't  mean I am going to tell you mine . And notice how they wont volunteer any of this info to you . Or give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you must control it , and really say . <p> To " Fabulous me " . The big one is obvious , but maybe not to civilians . Do n't  ask " Did you kill anyone ? " . If anyone asks what I did in the Marines , I tell them , I sat behind a desk . Its none of their business ! ! My son who did 2 tours in Iraq , I was able to talk about somethings , that I have n't told my wife of over 30 years . Ill probably be able to talk to my other son , who 's over there now , when he gets back . <p> And the last thing , is Do n't  Push them to talk ! ! If they want to talk to you , they will in their own time . <p> I agree with Russo that there are many some in NYC with military gear . I wont make a related remark as I had embarassed someone for wearing a Marine hat someone bought them for Christmas . On the otherhand , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked him for his service , asked him if he needed directions , etc . NY-David <p> my husband is about to come back and i want to in the easiest way possible prep family , friends , and acquaintances to not say what i call " stupid questions civilians ask soldiers/veterans " and maybe give them a few things that might not upset him . see the thing is , i love him and do n't  want him to ring anyones neck because orange is just not his color ! <p> i have a few things already , but would love suggestions both questions and statements of " dos and donts " i appreciate this post and plan on passing it on to them in hopes that they will come read it themselves . <p> I can give you the ins and outs of coming home from combat ; expectations and opportunities of being a modern warrior at home . Check out my website PTSD : A Soldiers Perspective ( PASP ) to see our new mission in action . Just as you say you want to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At PASP we strive to bring together people who have environmental connections with Combat PTSD ; a friend , family member , loved one and our returning soldiers and veterans .

Come visit us , we have wives , soldiers , veterans and mothers writing for us to help you through the Combat PTSD moments i your life . <p> It never ceases to amaze me the stupid crap people say . My dad has told me stories of name calling and spitting when he was coming home as a young man . The man I am dating is a combat vet and currently in a doctorate program and the questions these university students ask him are SO RUDE ! They think his experiences are something out of a movie and not real . I cant imagine the embarrassment of being put on the spot for something so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently he feels safe enough to open up to me now and then . <p> I am a proud " DESERT STORM VETERAN " I was 11 Bravo and earned my C.I.B there . But for the life of me , I can not find anywhere cause believe me I looked ! Is an emboidered cap with Desert storm on it with a CIB ! So , my question is : Do n't  these people who design this stuff realize that we earned that badge ? It really pisses me off ! Do n't  we deserve the same level of respect as everyone else ? Or are we just second class citizens ? Which is the way that I feel most of the time . Has anyone experienced this ? or am I alone here ? <p> I 'm generally not a stupid guy , so I 've never done anything like that kid . I 'm not trying to condone it either . <p> But I wonder ; with military gear/paraphernalia so much in style amongst civilians these days ( at least here in NYC ) , is n't there a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep in mind that civilians cant tell between a real one and a copy . <p> Russo , I personally do not have anything against people wearing military style clothing . <p> I would say that yes , there is a legitimate question as to whether the wearer earned a badge , ribbon , etc . <p> I quote myself ; <p> " If you see a person in public with military clothes on , a hat or something that signifies that they were in the military . Do yourself a favor and do not ask him or her about medals , badges , or any insignia they may have displayed right away , especially in a negative way .

Many of us do not even tell our wives , family or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men or women who have been in combat generally do not want to talk about their experiences . To them it is a deeply personal part of their lives that they do not wish to share , especially someone they do not know . Combat and killing another human being is the most intimate act one can have with another human . Probably more so than making love to your significant other . Do you talk openly to someone you do not know if they ask you do you have sex with them ? Obviously no , the question is taboo . <p> A societal norm is expected behavior when out in public , and talking about your sex life is generally looked down on in polite company , and especially rude to ask when in passing company . The same holds true to asking someone , probably more so , if they earned their decorations or if they killed anyone . <p> My message here is that it is rude and insensitive to the soldier or veteran to ask them if they earned their military decorations . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone , even loved ones who we fully felt fidelity before combat . <p> The answer to your question is that your question would better be left unsaid . If you truly want to talk to a veteran or soldier about their experiences , broach the subject in an empathetic way . First tell them " welcome home " this will probably bring their guard down somewhat . When we come home many of us feel as though we have returned to a foreign land , as though we do not belong anymore . <p> If you come upon someone you fell as though they may not own the right to wear military decorations . Consider this , we have young soldiers and veterans who are 18 and 19 that have been on multiple tours and have seen more combat than most other wars , including WWII . <p> Upwards of 90-94% of our troops in Iraq have been shot at , seen someone killed or have been in a combat situation . 68% have actually engaged the enemy where only 40% of the people who actually have the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have women fighting and killing the enemy , over 100 women have been killed in combat . <p> So , when you doubt if someone is old enough or " looks " as though they did not earn their awards . I would suggest to ask yourself these questions pondered here . <p> Ya know , at the 2007 Rolling Thunder Ride to the Wall , I saw a dude with ribbons on his vest in the wrong order of precedencemade me wonder if hed ever been there and I almost challenged himwish I had ! <p> God , how can I put this ? ? ? First of all , WELL SAID CJ ! ! ! If you could only know how the Vietnam vets were treated when we got home . When my kids ( now in their 30s and 40s ) ask me " What did you do in the war , Daddy ? " I tellem I was in the Navy which , of course , says I was offshore somewhereheh , heh . Nuff saiddont ask a military retiree or former military combat vet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personaly kick your ass ! <p> I like your style my brother . I could not imagine how you guys were treated . When I was in the desert my father has someone tell him that the first Gulf War was wrong that we should not be thereMy dad punched the guy in the face . Hooah ! <p> Joyce , I appreciate your appreciation . I was just talking to one of my sons , he is buying a home for his soon to be wife and child . I am going over there today to help him do some painting . The land of opportunity still exists . <p> It is a gift to have the freedom we have , many people take it for granted and do not understand the sacrifices that our soldiers and veterans have given to this nation and its people .

Some are friendly ; some not so much . <p> Subscribe to proper trail etiquette and greet each one with a warm smile or head nod , no matter how menacing they appear . Looks are deceiving , and someone with a ugly mug could give you vital advice like , " hey , there 's a giant bolder blocking the trail ahead " or " we just ran into a great grizzly a half mile ago " watch out !

Did they just meet in the parking lot ? Let these questions swirl while you bypass them with a friendly wave . 3 .

" But I tend to feel more pity for them <p> As a Mysterious Lady , sans pooch , I concur with Craig . Your intrigue is completely justifiedHa , ha ! In reality my solo jaunts are usually one of two things : either I felt like hearing a little silence for a change or I could n't get my city friends to commit to a weekend in bear-infested waters . Another type Ive seen is the After Church/Sunday Best Hiker . They mince delicately up muddy trails in high heels or polished wingtips , their children in tow in uncomfortable little sport coats and velvet dresses with bows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most often met the hardcore hikers and the sweet older couple . You do need to add the runner / fell runner . One top of one mountain , an old man ran up , in 70s type shorts ( prob bought them in the 70s ) , vest , no bag . Summited &amp; then proceeded to run off to the next peak ! <p> Great collection of stereotypical people you meet on the trail . I 've seen all these kinds of people . I know the list ca n't be infinite in length , but I just want to second some previous suggestions . ( 1 ) " The runner . " I always see them on the trail . Short trails , medium trails , long trails . What the hiker views as a tough days section hike , these guys think makes a great 1 or 2 hour run . And they amazingly do it all with a small little water bottle , at best .

You 'll usually find them holding hands as they walk up even tough , technical slopes , where they should be having both hands free for balance but they risk it for love . = <p> I thought it was funny and mostly applicable . Looking forward to future installments that include the hikers with dogs , the creepy homeless guy , the purists who look down on everyone , the tree hugging hippy etc etc etc . <p> I do n't  " get " the awkward couple . I guess I do n't  because my girlfriend and I hike together sometimes so we are probably in that category because we do n't  hike enough to be #5 . So , what makes people like us awkward ? Because we do n't  fit the prototypical hiker stereotype ? <p> OMG ! REALLY ? ? ? ? People are leaving comments that " Those are cub scouts you have pictured " and " OK so the guy is an escaped convict because he has a beard and he 's by himself ? " COME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gist of the story if the author talked about seeing a troop of brownies and had a picture of a Pillsbury box ? NO ! And the prison guy is pretty scary looking with his arms crossed . Probably hiding a shank he MacGyvered from the bones of his dead cell mate . <p> You forgot the dog people who have 3 large dogs and do n't  believe in leashing them on the trail despite the rule that says dogs must be leashed at all times . The dogs get all muddy and jump on the other hikers , who hate dogs . <p> I miss the jogger . There 's always some hardcore guy or girl that looks at a 12 mile+ hike as a decent length for running . Just as #5 has all the right gear the jogger wears running shoes , tights and shirt , and maybe a little water . <p> Those are n't  Boy Scouts in your picture , they are Cub Scouts . Specifically Tiger Scouts , so they are most likely in the First Grade ( aged 6-7 ) . At age 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts . <p> Granted , 11 year olds on the trail provide a different dynamic that 6 year olds , but they change a great deal over five years . Cub Scouts should remain on trails in local community parks . <p> My sons Boy Scout Troop is hiking the Appalachian Trail this summer and they limit the experience to those aged 13 or over so you are talking about boys who are in High School on the Trail . <p> At that age they pack out everything they pack in , including used toilet paper . So other than a higher level of exuberance than anyone else on the Trail ( except for maybe The Drunk Guy ) , they are are quite responsible Trail Citizens .

If you 're hitting the trail often though , chances are you 'll run those puppies to the ground in no time ( literally and figuratively ) . <p> With Earth Day right around the corner , were all looking for ways to be more resourceful . So , instead of chucking those worn-out boots in the nearest Dumpster , why not get them repaired instead ? <p> Obviously there are cases where a boot is beyond repairable . But most likely your hiking boots just need a little attention . <p> First stop by a local shoe repair shop . You can find one easily by Googling or asking around .

Plus , you 'll get to explain face-to-face the issues and potentially see how it will be fixed . <p> Before you head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Actually , many resoling projects will set you back $60 to $75 . With that said , if you do n't  want to let go of your current pair , it might be well worth it . <p> Ca n't find someone locally ? Mountain Soles offers resoling via mail order . A partner of Patagonia Footwear , the Oregon shoe repair shop can fix any boot with a black sole . Based in Colorado , Rocky Mountain Resole also does repair through the mail , and it covers almost every hiking brand from Asolo to Vasque . <p> Feeling even more resourceful ? Try to resole your kicks all by yourself . According to HowStuffWorks , the project should take one to two hours . Be warned : There are a lot of materials that go into it including replacement rubber insoles , Vibram soles and waterproof shoe-repair adhesive . <p> Before you start the project , peruse YouTube for videos like the one below where a man demonstrates how he replaced the sole of his beloved pair of cowboy boots . <p> Thanks for the mention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not " fix any boot with a black sole " . Changes in the style of construction and consumers habits have lead to many more cheaply made , disposable footwear in the market . These changes have made it difficult to replace soles on all shoes , but there are still shoes and boots out there that are re-soleable . Thanks ! <p> With a size 16 foot I have had problems sourcing hiking boots most of my life . <p> Around 1985 I sourced a pair of leather hiking boots that fitted perfectly . I looked after those boots and had great service from them for over twenty years . In that time I had the boots resoled three times .

Similar in design to MultiCam , the chosen pattern started being used in the field during the summer of 2015 . <p> " The Army is naming the pattern the Operational Camouflage Pattern ( OCP ) to emphasize that the pattern 's use extends beyond Afghanistan to all Combatant Commands . " - Senior Army Spokesperson , U.S. Army <p> After a four-year intensive camouflage research and testing process , this selection could n't have been more anticipated . For more than a decade , the Army has relied on the widely unpopular UCP as the official standard-issue pattern . <p> " The Army has confirmed through testing that the ( Scorpion W2 ) pattern would offer exceptional concealment , which directly enhances force protection and survivability for Soldiers , " the an anonymous Army senior spokesperson said . <p> Speculation about the selection began back in May when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raymond Chandler III had been briefing senior sergeants major on the selection . On July 23 , 2014 Gen. Dennis L. Via , the head of Army Material Command , unofficially confirmed the Army has adopted the W2 variant of the Scorpion camouflage . <h> Operational Camouflage Pattern <p> The Army has decided to call the new pattern Operational Camouflage Pattern ( OCP ) , a name sure to spark confusion considering up to this announcement , MultiCam was known as the OCP . <p> " The Army is naming the pattern the Operational Camouflage Pattern ( OCP ) to emphasize that the pattern 's use extends beyond Afghanistan to all Combatant Commands , " says an anonymous senior spokesperson for the Army in a statement regarding the new pattern on the Army 's website . <p> MSG Benjamin Owen wearing the OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) ACU <h> What We Know <p> OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) ACU was first available for soldiers to purchase on the July 1 , 2015 . The new ACU is worn in garrison , training and home station . AAFES saw huge sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , socks , T-shirts , coats and trousers . <p> ACU coats and pants in OCP are currently selling for around $96 , which is $12 more than the old uniforms at $84 . Other uniform components , such as boots , shirts , socks and caps did not see a significant price change . <p> " We 've got to have the best system possible to make sure our Soldiers are protected as they deploy around the world , " said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno in a virtual town meeting on January 6 , 2015 . " The ACU does n't do very well in camouflaging us and protecting us in multiple environments , and the MultiCam that we use in Afghanistan does a much better job . For me , it 's about protecting our Soldiers . " <p> It will be mandatory for other active duty Soldiers to purchase uniforms with their annual clothing allowance . By the beginning of the fiscal year 2016 , new accessions will have the OCP uniform in their clothing bags . <p> On October 3 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30th anniversary ceremony . This makes it the first unit to wear the new uniform . These uniforms were procured with private funds by unit leaders and not with government funds . <p> According to MIL-DTL-44436B , the specifications used by the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA ) for industry guidance , there are seven colors that make up the official OCP pattern ; cream 524 , tan 535 , pale g reen 526 , olive 527 , dark green 528 , brown 529 and dark brown 530 . <p> The cloth will be dyed to a base shade of cream 524 and the remaining six colors will be overprinted by rollers or screens . Previously OCP has been referred to as Class 9 &amp; 10 in previous versions of the MIL-DTL-44436B , but the new OCP is being called OCP Class 14 . Currently , OCP is being printed on only nylon / cotton fabric . <p> When asked whether the new OCP ACU will be available for commercial use , Army Spokesperson William Layer said , " This issue is still under internal Army discussion . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make OCP uniforms available commercially . It 's possible that OCP wo n't be available for commercial sale , unlike previous Army camouflage patterns . <h> Release Date <p> OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) Acus first hit military clothing stores on July 1 , 2015 . Female versions of the new uniform were available starting September 2015 . By summer 2016 , OCP ACUs and equipment were available for U.S. Army National Guard , U.S. Army Reserve and Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps . The Army expects the transition period to the new uniform to extend until October 1 , 2019 . During this time Soldiers are authorized to mix and match t-shirts , belts and boots . In addition , wet-weather gear and Extended Cold Weather Clothing System items do not have to match the camouflage pattern of the uniform worn during the transition period . <p> " I have asked noncommissioned officers to ensure their Soldiers understand that during this transition period , several uniforms and variations will be authorized in our formations , " Sgt. Maj. of the Army Daniel A. Dailey said . " Presenting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will not inconvenience or burden our troops . We will still be the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known even if our belts do n't match for the next few years . " <p> " If you 're deploying to Afghanistan or Iraq and some other places , you 're going to be issued that uniform as you 're getting ready to deploy , " Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno during a virtual town hall with troops at Fort Hood , Texas on April 2 , 2015 . <p> Some troops are already wearing the new uniforms . Photos were taken in March 2015 of Soldiers wearing OCP while training Iraqi troops at Camp Taji , Iraq . Troops in Europe participating in the Operation Atlantic Resolve will also be issued OCP . <p> The Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA ) converted its contracts for the ACU from UCP to OCP in November 2014 . In conjunction , the DLA converted " bag items " including hot weather , temperate weather and hot weather FR issue boots to coyote brown . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 . On July 1 , AAFES MCS started selling OCP ACUs . Authorized coyote brown boots will be allowed for wear only with the OCP uniform . Desert tan boots can be worn with both the UCP ACU and OCP ACU but have a wear-out date of October 1 , 2018 . <p> The implementation of these new uniforms have been organized into four tiers , with tier one being the most important priority . <h> Wear-out Dates <p> On June 2 , the Army released key dates for the transition to OCP : <p> UCP ACU wear-out date : September 30 , 2019 <p> OCP ACU mandatory possession date : October 1 , 2019 <p> OEF-CP wear-out date : September 30 , 2019 <p> Shirts , belts and boots worn with OCP uniforms are going to be in a darker color than the desert tan shirts , belts and boots worn with UCP . During the transition period , desert tan shirts , belts and boots will be authorized for wear ( as long as all components are the same color ) with both UCP and OCP uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components is prohibited otherwise . <h> The New Army Combat Uniform <p> A new camouflage pattern is n't the only uniform update the Army is making . Many aspects of the Army Combat Uniform ( ACU ) are changing as well . From new pockets to the removal of hook-and-loop ( Velcro ) closures , the ACU is getting a complete makeover . <p> " I 'm very excited about the replacement for the ACU , " SMA Chandler said in a virtual town meeting on January 9 , 2015 . " It 's a much better uniform . It provides much better protection for you . We put a lot of thought into the design . I think you 'll find it 's a much better quality uniform than what you have today . " <p> From new pockets to the removal of hook-and-loop ( Velcro ) closures , the ACU is getting a complete makeover . These changes were implemented with the release of the new OCP uniforms . <p> " The Army is making several design changes to the ACU in response to soldier inputs to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spokesperson William Layer . <h> Changes Approved by Army Uniform Board <p> 1 . The upper-sleeve pocket will feature a zipper closure instead of a Velcro closure for easier access . These new pockets will look similar to those found on combat shirts . <p> 2 . The upper-sleeve pocket will also now be at least 1 inch longer . Feedback on post-combat surveys showed that soldiers require roomier pockets and more room for patches . <p> 3 . The new ACUs will no longer offer internal elbow pads and Velcro elbow patches . Both those characteristics were found useless in the field and deemed a waste of money . However , one feature that will stay the same is the doubled fabric for extra reinforcement on the elbow area . <p> 4 . Say goodbye to the cord-and-barrel lock on the cargo pocket . It will no longer exist on the new ACUs . <p> 5 . ACUs will no longer feature knee pads or patches . There will still be reinforced fabric in the knee area . <p> 6 . The lower-leg pocket has previously used a Velcro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-button closure instead . <p> 7 . The mandarin collar is no more . Instead , you 'll see a traditional fold-down design . <p> 8 . Only two pen pockets instead of the usual three . <p> 9 . After complaint that the drawstrings on the uniform pants ' waistband looks unprofessional , it was proposed they be removed from new ACU pants . <h> Changes That Did n't Make the Cut <p> 10 . The Infrared ( IR ) Identification Friend or Foe ( IFF ) tag will be still be on the right sleeve but would have been removed from the left sleeve . <p> 11 . It was under discussion that lower-leg pockets will be removed completely . <p> Soldiers will get new boots to accompany the OCP uniform as well . Darker coyote brown boots will replace desert tan boots as the official standard-issue . Major military boot suppliers have already started directing the production of new boots that will comply . It 's also expected that gloves will be in this same colorway . Not only will the darker colorway provide better concealment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide dirt and wear better than the current desert tan boots . <p> T-shirts will be also be slightly darker in a tan 499 color . As for all binding components of the uniform , such as loop and hook , thread , zippers , etc. , these will also be in tan 499 . This color is currently used for MultiCam uniforms . <p> The Army also updated the Army combat shirt . The new version , known as Army Combat Shirt Type II , boasts more camouflage coverage on the sides and chest . Currently it 's still made in OEF-CP . No word on when the Type II combat shirt will transition to OCP . <h> Newest Version of the ACU Now Available in MultiCam <p> Tru-Spec is the first to offer the newest ACU construction in Crye Precision 's premium MultiCam pattern . The new Tru-Spec MultiCam pants and coat can be purchased separately and are Army approved and ready for wear . <p> Released summer of 2016 , the pants-and-coat combination features all the design updates from the 2015 ACU reinvention , but is offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place of noisy hook-and-loop , a roomier upper-sleeve pocket and other function-focused updates . <p> MultiCam is widely considered to be the most effective camouflage on the market . Developed by Crye Precision , the same design firm that created OCP , MultiCam is a seven-color pattern designed for use in varied environments . In October 2012 , MultiCam beat out three other patterns in the final phase of the Army 's camouflage field testing . Despite this , OCP was still chosen , allegedly for fiscal reasons . <p> " According to Army testing , MultiCam outperforms Scorpion ( OCP ) in four out of five critical operating environments , " said Eric Graves of , Soldier Systems Daily <p> With OCP ACUs only available in military clothing stores , the demand for the new construction is high.This is the first time the new construction is commercially available . Tru-Spec has more than 50 years of experience of supplying the U.S. Military with uniforms . <h> OCP Name Clarified <p> When Army officials announced that a new camouflage pattern had been selected and it was to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled . The confusion stems from the fact that until this announcement , MultiCam was known as OCP . <p> In 2009 , Congress ruled that the Department of Defense take immediate action to address Soldiers ' concealment concerns regarding UCP . As a result , MultiCam was adopted as the Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage pattern , also referred to as OEF-OCP or just simply OCP . This was later shortened to Operational Camouflage Pattern , also referred to by the acronym OCP . <p> However , from now on the Army 's new camouflage selection , Scorpion W2 , is the Operational Camouflage Pattern ( OCP ) . Is your head spinning yet ? In simple terms , MultiCam used to be the OCP , but now it 's not . Scorpion W2 officially claims the title . In an attempt to avoid confusion , the Army has gone back to referring to MultiCam as OEF-CP . <h> Government Vs . Crye <p> MultiCam consistently tests better than other camouflage patterns on the market and has been a favorite of military professionals for years now . So why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to financial reasons . In a statement to Military.com , Caleb Crye , owner of Crye Precision , says he believes the Army was hesitant to pay the " printing fees " associated with the pattern . Crye also says that Army officials tried to buy the rights to MultiCam but rejected Crye 's figure of $25 million . <p> Allegedly , Crye Precision took the position that it owns the patent to OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) ; the pattern was originally developed by the company in 2002 as part of the Army initiative known as Objective Force Warrior . The original Scorpion patent issued in 2004 indicates that the patent was issued to Caleb Crye . <p> However , in a statement to Soldier Systems Daily , William Layer of the Army Office of the Chief of Public Affairs claims , " The Army possesses appropriate rights to use the Operational Camouflage Pattern ( OCP ) on its uniforms and equipment . " <p> On July 7 , 2015 , The U.S. Patent and Trade Office issued a Utility patent for OCP entitled " Camouflage for Garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States of America . <p> This right only extends to the Army , not to the privately owned mills that print the Army 's uniforms . When MultiCam was recommissioned for use by the Army in 2010 , 11 printers were granted limited-use licenses from Crye to print the pattern . While the stipulations of these licenses are confidential , it 's suspected that these contracts require that the printer does not print patterns that are visually similar to MultiCam . If this is the case , it would legally bind printers from printing the almost identical OCP . There is speculation that printing mills might be paying a royalty fee to Crye for printing OCP under government-awarded contracts in order to appease the company and avoid any legal trouble . <p> If this is true , these under-the-table royalty fees would only offer a solution regarding fabric printed under a government contract for official field wear . If the government were to issue a commercial license for OCP , it 's possible this solution would not stand , and Crye could potentially take legal action . While a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract , they would stand to lose a lot more if OCP were to become available commercially . <p> If the pattern were commercially available , it would become a major competitor to Crye 's popular MultiCam pattern . Because the two patterns are so similar , it does n't seem likely that both patterns would be successful on the commercial market . MultiCam is already easily recognizable and well-received in the market place . It makes sense to assume the brand would n't want any competition for the pattern . <p> Despite that amendment , evidence suggests the Army never possessed the rights to use or alter the pattern . Soldier Systems posted the original proposal from Crye to Natick , the military research complex responsible for research and development of combat effectiveness , for work on the Scorpion project as a part of the Objective Force Warrior Program . In the proposal , Crye mentions multiple projects ( including camouflage technologies ) the brand had already been working on . While the language allows those technologies to be used as a part of the program , Crye makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aforementioned technologies . <h> Commercial Availability <p> A commercial availability date for OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) ACU is currently unknown . The government filed for a patent application in late 2014 and was granted a utility patent on July 7 , 2015 . Despite this , there 's still no word on whether commercial licenses will be granted . <p> The only people issued a commercial license for the OCP pattern thus far are companies who produce nametapes and insignia . ACU manufacturers such as Atlanco and Propper could have their hands tied with respect to a commercially available OCP ACU until licensing issues are resolved . <h> Other Branches to Adopt Scorpion W2 ? <p> By 2018 , congressional language demands all military services should be wearing the same uniforms . The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2014 called for an end to service-specific camouflage patterns . The decision was sparked by congressional committee members ' concerns that patterns were n't chosen with concealment in mind , but instead from a branding perspective . <p> The Army was set to declare a camouflage pattern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent selection of a new OCP indicates the pattern will most likely be adopted by other services as well . <h> Air Force Adopting OCP <p> Air Force spokesperson Maj. Matt Hasson revealed to Air Force Times on June 3 that deployed airmen will be outfitted in the same new camouflage pattern that the Army selects . Now that OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) has been selected , you 'll be seeing certain airmen in it by next year . <p> In 2011 , the Air Force replaced the airman battle uniform ( ABU ) with the OEF OCP ( MultiCam ) ABU for airmen deployed in Afghanistan . Those currently wearing OEF OCP will now be wearing OCP . <p> The Air Force Strike Command ( AFGSC ) security forces will also be gearing up in OCPfirst the OEF OCP then OCP when it 's availableat three AFGSC bases : Minot AFB , North Dakota ; Malmstrom AFB , Montana ; and F.E. Warren AFB , Wyoming . Additionally , those in the 620th Ground Combat Training Squadron at Camp Guernsey , Wyoming , will soon be wearing OCP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterrence . Until now its security forces have been outfitted in the digital Tiger Stripe ABU . The Air Force cites concealment issues as the reason for the switch-over . <p> " If you get in a firefight in the field and you 're laying down fire , who are you going to see first ? Obviously that guy in ABUs , " said Chief Master Sgt. Scott Daigneault , senior enlisted manager for the Force Improvement Program at AFGSC to Soldier Systems Daily . " The difference is almost night and day . Your eyes skim right over the guy in MultiCam OCP and zone in on the guy in ABUs . He just does n't fit in in that missile field environment . " <p> In February 2015 , security forces Airmen began to gear up MultiCam uniforms and cold-weather gear . The uniforms , which have never been worn by missile field defenders before , got a positive reception . <p> " I think the new uniforms are really cool , " said Airman Dean Fedrizzi , 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron Security Support Team to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now that I see them , I 'm really psyched to get them . " <p> While AFGSC Airmen are currently being outfitted in MultiCam , they also plan to update to OCP . After OCP hits military clothing stores in May , it will eventually update to OCP along with the Army . As for boots , the Air Force has made no move to transition from sage to coyote brown . <p> " We intend to transition with the OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) as it becomes available . However , we will not conduct a full re-issue ; we will replace items through attrition , " said AFGSC spokesperson 1st Lt. Christopher Mesnard . <p> Does the AFGSC adoption of OCP indicate a complete adoption of the the pattern by the Air Force ? Not exactly . This announcement will not affect uniforms worn in home station or the current ABU design . Most airmen will still be wearing the service-specific digital Tiger Stripe pattern . <p> " There is no plan to change that currently , " said Air Force spokesperson Rose Richeson to Military.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Scorpion W2 ) is made of beige , brown and green components but lacks the vertical elements found in MultiCam . Currently , there are only a few images of Scorpion OCP available to the public . <p> However , there are multiple images of the original Scorpion pattern developed as a part of the Objective Force Warrior program . How does Scorpion compare to current ACU patterns UCP and MultiCam ? Take a look . <p> Universal <p> Scorpion <p> MultiCam <p> At a glance , MultiCam and Scorpion almost look like the same pattern . That 's because both MultiCam and Scorpion OCP were developed from this original Scorpion pattern . So what sets the two apart ? If you look closely , you 'll notice MultiCam features additional beige and brown slugs as well as vertical elements meant to resemble grass and branches . In addition , MultiCam is a somewhat darker and sharper version of Scorpion . <h> Scorpion History <p> " Whatever we do , we 're going to do in a fiscally responsible manner , " says Col. Robert F. Mortlock , project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office Soldier - U.S. Army Website <p> Scorpion is not a new pattern . In fact , it 's been around for more than a decade . Known as the predecessor to MultiCam , the pattern was developed in 2002 by Crye Precision as a part of the advanced technology demonstration project called Objective Force Warrior , later renamed Future Force Warrior . <p> Made up of green , brown and tan elements , Scorpion looks very similar to MultiCam . Why ? Because it is . Crye created Scorpion under a military contract , potentially forfeiting all intellectual rights to the pattern . In order to capitalize on the hard work put into developing Scorpion , Crye made small adjustments to the pattern for trademark purposes to create MultiCam . <p> The variant chosen as the new OCP is known as Scorpion W2 . Like MultiCam , it was developed and modified in 2009 from the original Scorpion pattern . The pattern still needs to be updated with IR technologies before it can be used for combat uniforms . <h> Camouflage Field Testing <p> In 2002 , the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern for the new Army Combat Uniform . In 2004 , it selected Universal Camouflage Pattern ( UCP ) as the official standard-issue pattern . <p> Soldiers wearing UCP . <p> " To really have confidence in being able to make a recommendation to senior leaders , we need to do field trials , " says Col. William Cole , of Program Executive Office Soldier . " We are looking forward to getting out into the woods , into the deserts , into the transitional areas and having real Soldiers wear these uniforms and have real Soldiers observe them . " - U.S. Army Website <p> The decision has been widely unpopular with Soldiers who claim the pattern yields poor results in most environments . The Army allegedly spent $5 billion on the controversial pattern . However , in a statement to Gizmodo , an anonymous Army official claimed that the amount is closer to several million dollars . The $5 billion statistic refers to uniforms purchased and worn , not to camouflage development . <p> Only a few years after selecting UCP , the Army began looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concealment concerns by passing a bill requiring that the Department of Defense " take immediate action to provide combat uniforms to personnel deployed to Afghanistan with a camouflage pattern that is suited to the environment of Afghanistan . " <p> The army began a four-phase research and testing process to find a new pattern . In the meantime , MultiCam was recommissioned , replacing UCP for troops deploying to the War in Afghanistan . The Army 's extensive camouflage testing includes photo simulation and actual field tests designed to determine effectiveness . <p> In 2012 , the Army entered the final phase of camouflage testing by awarding contracts to five vendors : Atlantic Diving Supply Inc. ; Brookwood Companies Inc. ; Crye Precision LLC ; Kryptek Inc. ; and the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center . <p> " To really have confidence in being able to make a recommendation to senior leaders , we need to do field trials , " says Col. William Cole , of Program Executive Office Soldier in a statement on the U.S. Army website . " We are looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the transitional areas and having real Soldiers wear these uniforms and have real Soldiers observe them . " <p> Instead of looking for just one pattern to appease all situations as was the case with UCP , this time the Army is looking for a family of patterns . The three basic patterns will be a desert/arid environment pattern ; a transitional/semi-arid pattern ; and a woodlands pattern . It 's rumored that the transitional pattern would be the standard uniform worn in garrison and that the present plan is to issue the OCIE ( rucksacks , MOLLE gear , etc. ) in this same transitional pattern . However , the Army has not confirmed this . <p> Currently , the Army is testing in order to settle on the " bookend " patterns to round out the family of camouflage the branch envisioned . Pictures indicate OCP ( Scorpion W2 ) , M81 Woodland and MARPAT Woodland are being tested at Fort Polk . It 's also suspected that TA-50 is being tested . <p> This testing appears to be geared toward selecting a Woodland variant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MARPAT desert camouflage is also in progress , although there is no information available on it . <p> Something notable about these images is that sand T-shirts are worn along with olive mojave USMC-issued boots . This indicates that the coyote brown boots the Army has selected to accompany the new OCP ACUs will look similar . <p> There are no images of the M81 Woodland or OCP uniforms being tested , but Soldier Systems managed to secure an example of green PALS webbing paired with OCP MOLLE . There is no information on what this might mean for the new uniforms . <h> Objective Force Warrior <p> Scorpion was developed under an Army contract as a part of its Objective Force Warrior program , later renamed Future Force Warrior . It was formed October 12 , 1999 , as a part of the Army 's initiative to create an innovative , lightweight combat system . <p> The program was one of many soldier modernization projects started in the ' 90s . The intention was to take the most current technologies and conceptualize how to apply them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magnetorheological fluid ( a fluid that greatly increases viscosity when subjected to a magnetic field ) were all technologies the military believed could dramatically increase the effectiveness of Army forces . <p> Crye Precision , along with other firms , was tasked with redesigning clothing and armor to eliminate many of the issues that plagued Soldiers . Those included , but were not limited to , uniforms shrinking when washed ; boot soles cracking after a few months use ; and standard-issue shirts collecting sweat and not drying quickly . <p> Under this contract , Crye developed clothing and equipment prototypes unlike anything seen before . Crye 's combat apparel was light , comfortable and easy to she 'd in an emergency . Four major military clothing and equipment innovations came from Crye 's involvement with this project . <h> Crye Armor Chassis <p> Crye Precision developed this advanced take on body armor . Specialized , ergonomically engineered armor plates offer increased mobility to the wearer . The style still influences key players in armor design . <h> Close-fitting Modular Combat Helmets <p> Troops consistently complained that ill-fitting , bulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to solve this . Although the helmets produced in this program lack the state-of-the-art design we see today , they paved the way for current high-tech styles that feature a close-to-the-head contour . Crye Precision 's AirFrame combat helmet is a perfect example of a product developed from the foundation Objective Force Warrior provided . <h> Scorpion / MultiCam pattern <p> Crye precision developed the Scorpion pattern under this contract . Afterwards , Crye Precision tweaked the Scorpion for commercial-use , creating the massively successful MultiCam pattern . As well as achieving great results in camouflage testing , MultiCam was chosen for use in Afghanistan as the Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage pattern ( OEF OCP ) . <h> About Crye Precision <p> Crye Precision , originally Crye Associates , started in 2000 as a small design firm based out of New York . The company achieved notoriety when it won a contract to participate in the Objective Force Warrior project ( later referred to as Future Force Warrior . ) Its task was to design innovative apparel , equipment and systems in order to overhaul the way combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Objective Force Warrior contract and afterwards tweaked the pattern to develop MultiCam , a commercially available pattern that consistently achieves good results in government camouflage testing . The company now makes a wide range of commercially available military apparel , armor and equipment . <p> Iowa National Guard wearing MultiCam ( left ) and UCP ( right ) <h> Key Players <p> If a commercial licenses are granted for OCP , who will be responsible for manufacturing the new garments ? We 've got the lowdown on the current key players in the uniform industry . <h> Propper <p> Propper was established in 1967 by William T. Propper , an entrepreneur with a passion for manufacturing processes . Since then , Propper has manufactured more than 130 million uniforms for the U.S. Department of Defense , including garments for the Air Force , Navy , Marines , Coast Guard , Special Forces and the Army . <p> Currently , Propper does n't have a prime contract with the Army for its combat uniform although the company does participate as a sub-contractor for nonsewing activities on an ACU contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would create might give the brand a chance at one . A spokesperson for Propper says it 's possible the company will be awarded a contract for the new ACU . <h> Atlanco <p> Atlanco has been supplying the military with uniforms for more than 50 years . The company was founded by the Zaglin family in 1950 as a small military surplus . Still under the Zaglin family leadership , the company continues to be leading military supplier . In addition , Atlanco is behind Tru-Spec and 24-7 Series , sub-brands that provide commercial gear to military and tactical professionals . <p> The brand says it has no plans to go after a military contract for ACUs . However , if the OCP uniforms are given the green light to be sold commercially , Tru-Spec will certainly be manufacturing them for the commercial market . <p> " We do n't have any official plan on Scorpion W2 as it has yet to gain final approval , " an Atlanco source said in May . Once the conversion is approved , the brand will craft a ' go-forward ' plan .

That 's her clever spiel ! <p> You might want to order a DVD I 'd 178781-1 from C-SPAN .

Every lie is coming out . <p> Thanks for your service in showing us the perspective needed here in the USA . I am so proud of all the men and women who have gone over to Iraq scared , praying for help , and finding out that the politicians at home do n't  have a clue what you are going through .

That book led me to close contact with various branches of our military . NEVER have I been so impressed with any group of people . While I 've always supported our military , I have become even more respectful of what they do for all of us . I feel myself fortunate that I was able to visit with our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed . I will be forever inspired by the spirit of those soldiers .

If anyone wants to know what hell those Iraqis lived through , you might want to browse through MAYADA , DAUGHTER of IRAQ . Its a true story and tells what happened to innocent women in one of Saddams prison . I 'm honestly not trying to push a book , but I truly believe that everyone should know how Iraqis were living under Saddam .

According to Marine Corps Times , it looks like all infantry battalions will be fielding the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle by the end of next year . <p> " Leaders recently awarded a contract worth up to $23.6 million with the maker of the 5.56mm machine gun , Heckler &amp; Koch Defense of Ashburn , Va. , " reports the Marine Corps Times article . " The company plans to begin delivering more than 3,600 IARs to the Corps early next year , said Robert Reidsma , who oversees the IAR program for HK . " <p> Photo by Rob Curtis <p> As part of the experimental fielding phase , 458 weapons were delivered starting late last year . For upwards of 10 years there has been arguments for replacing the belt-fed M249 SAW . While packing quite the proverbial punch , its heavier and not as accurate as the M27 IAR . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fielding . The IAR will replace the M249 SAW for all Marine rifle squads and light armored reconnaissance scout sections . " In conventional infantry battalions , virtually every four-man fire team will have an IAR , with three per squad , 28 per company and up to 4,476 across the Corps , Marine officials said , " continues the article . <p> The IAR will be fielded with 30-round magazines and MantaRail rail guards will be incorporated . While some have voiced concerns over firepower , military officials state that the auto-rifles positives far outweigh the negatives . The M27 IAR is more accurate and " improves automatic rifleman and small-unit lethality , mobility and survivability , " said 1st Lt. Jamie Larson , spokesperson for the Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico , Va . <h> 6 Comments on " USMC To Replace M249 SAW with M27 IAR " <p> As a Marine Infantryman that has both fired this weapon , carried a M249 for a deployment , and teach both weapon systems employment. : <p> I myself was a naysayer , until I shot the weapon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Suppression is defined as:temporary or transient degradation by an oppossing force of the performance of a weapon system below the level needed to fulfill its mission objectives . -In short , deny the enemy the ability to effect friendlies IOT allow them to accomplish their objective . e.g. manuever , bypass , etc . <p> 1 ) The M27 accomplishes this by accuraccy of fire vice volume of fire . Its ability to deliver accurate fire rapid fire at a distance , and accurate automatic rifle fire within 150m , allows the fire team to quickly manuever . Now we have a weapon that allows for our AR to seamlessly integrate with the rest of team . Instead of slowing it by either , lack of ability or the 3 rifles having to suppress IOT allow the M249 to move . 2 ) The Marine Corps does not need to " update " their tactics around a automatic rifle . The fire team in the U.S. was brought about by Col Carlson and his raiders during WW2 , using ideas from China and Marines in the Banana Wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Thompson , and 2 Garands. 1 Garand had the M-7 or M-8 GL attachement ( depending of if he carried a carbine or rifle ) . The combine arms concept at the small unit level was born , and quickly forgetten until after the Vietnam War . The BAR allow for automatic suppression during trench to trench fighting ( within 150M ) and accurate fires at distance . <p> The Marine Corps is simply returning to a true Automatic Rifleman , that achieves suppression by hitting his TGT whether on semi or automatic . <p> I fired the IAR it is a super accurate weapon system . The 5.56 will fire much farther than 500 yards . I 've seen it done . It does lack stopping power and will have trouble penetrating plates but with this weapon you will have know trouble putting several rounds into a small area such as a chest which would brake down the armor and penetrate threw it . I do think it need a bigger mag and from what I hear there working on that . <p> Seems like a trade of suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of rounds down range the IAR will allow for an alternative of one member of the squad to " reach out and touch " the enemy . The Marines will have to update there tactics to accommodate the change in weaponry . My thinking is that we should be more " sneaky Sons o guns " anyway . All in all the bottom line is more control and accountability of each round . <p> the 5.56 is a useless round for urban warfare . it has little penetration power , and the weight is not a factor with competant resupply. the max range is 500 yards , and can be stopped by conventional body armor with plates . In the next battlefield " The Suburban landscape " will require both distance and desrtuctive firepower . that which the 5.56 lacks . Let us not tkink of today but the future battlefield . <p> This is n't a dum idea , in fact , its genious . Heckler &amp; Koch is an amazing firearms manufacturer ; I consider nearly every one of their firearms to be better than all others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . The HK416 is a very good platform , and will be a nice transition because it has M16/M4 controls . Being so , soldiers will only need to be trained with a standard M4/M16/HK416 and they will be able to fully utilize the M27 IAR . The magazine is no problem either . In fact , its better than an ammo belt . Ammo belts tangle and are harder to carry than magazines . M4/M16/HK416 magazines ( I believe they are called STANAG or something along those lines ) can hold the standard 30 rounds , but there are magazines designed to hold 60 rounds , and Beta-C magazines hold 100 rounds . Isnt 100 rounds the amount of ammunition on the M249s ammunition belt ? And with Beta-C magazines , the same amount of ammo a belt would have can be replaced into the firearm many times faster , saving the lives of more Marines . Overall , a more familiar system , magazine feeding , more accuracy , and longetivity and reliability in the gun makes this one of the best calls the U.S. has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard in years ! Replacing a belt felt support weapon with a mag fed rifle is pointless . I agree that the HK416 is a far superior weapon than the standard issue M4 platform and that it would make sense to replace the standard issue rifle with it , but the purpose of belt felt squad weapons is SUSTAINED suppressive fire . Having a weapon that needs to change mags as often as every other rifle negates the support role . This is going to get more Marines killed than saved . Bad call all the way around .

@@96509538 @709538/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Not Another Michael Yon Post ? ! <p> It boggles my mind , really . I 'm open to anyone that has an answer for why Michael Yon , a disgraced former military blogger living in Thailand currently relegated to inane commentary on news stories , cats , food , and bugs , continues to stalk me while claiming that I stalk him . Where have I said a word about him except in response to incessant stream of attacks and defamation ? Frankly , I do n't  even think about MIchael Yon until I get another alert that my name is coming up out of the blue . Just thinking about him conjures up images of him in his OD green onesie in Afghanistan that makes him look like a quasi-camouflaged Staypuff Marshmallow Man . If it were anyone else even moderately competent at life , I would feel the need to be worried , but its Michael Yon . <p> When Esquire Magazine did a profile on me in this months issue ( November ) , Yon took that as an opportunity to try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem in trying to spread his lies on other sites is that he ca n't control the content . After leaving approximately 40 comments on the Esquire link , I went behind him and shared links to this blog with the truth . But , trolling Esquire was n't good enough since he could n't craft his manipulation and lies , so he returned to his clueless lemmings that follow his page ( most of whom are n't  even Americans ) . <p> Once again he is sharing a conveniently cropped photo without context and tying to some story about Sweden . I 've already addressed the photo several times , so click the link for that information . What I have to do with Sweden is still a grand mystery to me . But , its not really so much about how his warped mind sees " Sweden " and thinks " CJ Grisham . " On top of his usual lies which are well documented on this blog , he s adding new ones . When people point them out to me , I like to take it as another opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , principles , honesty , or honor . <p> In his latest attack , Yon makes several new claims : I 'm not a Texan and I was forced to retire early due to mental illness . <p> I was born on March 2 , 1974 ( Texas Independence Day ) , at Scott &amp; White Memorial Hospital in Temple , Texas . Its a beautiful hospital that sits on one of the highest hills in the city . You can see it all the way Salado in spots , especially at night . The hospital is now three times larger that it was 41 years ago . To ensure I was n't living in a Michael Yon-like alternate dimension , I called my mom to ask about my birth . <p> Me : Hey , mom , I need you to level with me . I can take the truth . Am I really a Texan ? Mom : Well , if you consider being born in Texas means you 're a Texan , then yes . Me : So , when you say I was born in Texas , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mom : Yes , and I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering from that birth , so I remember it quite vividly . Me : You werent an illegal immigrant were you ? I 'm not an anchor baby , right ? Mom : You were as heavy as an anchor , but I am a certified American as is your dad . Me : And to clarify , Texas was a state in the Union in 1974 , right ? Mom : I thought you did n't  drink alcohol or do drugs ! ? Me : No , mom , but I think a guy in Thailand is a regular user . <p> And there you have it . My mom even confirmed I 'm a Texan . My birth certificate is filed with Bell County Public Records so anyone can confirm . My father was in the Navy , so I grew up all around the country and around the world . Every year , I would come home and spend my summers working on the family farm here in Temple . I graduated high school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved back to Texas and worked as a DJ and part time at Blockbuster Music . I joined the Army in 1995 from Texas and maintained my home of record in Texas throughout my service . So , not only am I am Texan by birth ( as if anyone with even a gnats brain believes Yons tripe ) , but I was raised in Texas to the greatest extent that military service allowed me to . The Army did n't  accidentally bring me to Texas . I CHOSE Fort Hood as my final duty station so I could retire at home and not have to worry about moving from outside the state back home . <p> Which leads me to Yons next new claim : that I was forced into early retirement . <p> First , I want to address a common refrain that Yon loves to use . He makes great use of the philosophy that " if you say something enough times , itll come true . " Its interesting that he constantly refers to my PTSD and by extension , that of every service member as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connotation all the time . In Michael Yons world , if troops get PTSD , they are weak , must be disarmed , are a danger to society , and must be stigmatized at all costs , especially if he does n't  like you . What Michael Yon does when he attacks PTSD in this fashion and uses it against me or anyone is further the reluctance of troops to get help . He stigmatizes troops who seek help at the combat stress clinics . He stigmatizes the tens of thousands of troops who had jobs that did n't  allow them to leave the FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) . He talks down to troops if they never saw combat , in spite of the fact that a very small percentage of troops in the military ever saw combat themselves ( Ive seen my share of direct combat engagements ) . This is coming from a " man " whose only combat experience involves illegally and blindly shooting a propane tank while hiding behind a wall and almost getting the troops he was embedded with killed or hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgent propane gases . <p> I formally retired from the Army on February 1 , 2015 . This was exactly 20 years and 14 days after I joined the military . In order to normally retire from the Army , Soldiers must have at least 20 years of military service . The majority of Soldiers that reach this point retire . Not many prefer to go beyond their minimum 20 years . I was one of them . One of the overwhelming majority of troops that retire at 20 . And it had nothing to do with " mental illness " as Yon claims , again without any proof whatsoever . In fact , the reason I would n't have been able to stay longer in the military had nothing to do with mental illness and everything to do with my activism in Texas . The Army wants its troops to be quiet and not stir things up , even if they are right . If Yon were correct , I 'd have been MEDICALLY retired and , frankly , I would have gotten more retirement pay that way . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if its fact and the lemmings that he cultivates through his carefully edited and censored Facebook page will eat it up . Posting links to this page that have dismantled literally every lie he s told about me have resulted in deletion and banning from further discussion . Like the Nazis and Orwellian fantasyland , Yon cant have opposition on his page . That threatens his internet scams . Its a great scam he has going , but its a perpetual failure . <p> Michael Yon sees my success in relation to his own failure and it eats him alive . I live rent free in his head every waking moment of his life . That 's the only rational explanation for why he keeps talking me when I have long since turned my back on him . He s no longer a danger to our troops , so I do n't  care what he says . But , I will correct him on his lies about me . He has a history of contacting people in my command or that may know me so I have no doubt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripe . <p> I think my opponents are smarter than Yon . They , like most intelligent people , recognize that many major media sources have interviewed me over the years about my military service : Army Times , Military Times , USA Today , Garry Trudeau , GQ , Esquire , many authors of books , and countless local , state and national news media . Yet , Yon thinks that none of these media entities ever verified any information they wrote about . Apparently , Yon is the only guy that is right and all these media outlets are wrong . There 's a reason that the media has n't  substantiated Yons claims about me : they are products on his imagination .

At the time , Operation Truth was sold as a non-profit ( 501c4 ) veterans organization that sought to " amplify the soldiers voice in the American public dialogue " in order to " educate the American public about the truth of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from the perspective of the soldiers who have experienced them first-hand . Many of our governments policies and approaches to military operations have manifested themselves as problems on the front lines and back at home . Whether the subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of body armor for troops , the closing of V.A . hospitals , or the effects of Stop-loss , the men and women who have served and who have returned to civilian life truly have a unique and politically valuable perspective .

Additionally , American servicemen and women have a distinct and important perspective that can influence the American political scene in a powerful way .

I used to be a member of OpTruth and wrote of my experience back in 2005 on this blog . I was hip to his misdealings long ago and have spoken openly against them . <p> Reickhoff went on to found IAVA possibly in an attempt to get away from overt partisanship of OpTruth and into a more covert partisanship with IAVA . <p> IAVA has its roots in Democracy In Action ( DIA ) , a non-profit organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funding and publicity from DIA to become the supposed " voice of the troops " it is today . <p> But , back to TAH .

" In my 18 years of military service , I cant think of one Soldier that has accidentally put on a medal or patch that he/she was n't entitled to . The uniform does n't  just trip into an achievement pit and come out with a special forces patch accidentally sewn on it and a Bronze Star medal adorning the top rack on his chest .

There are a lot of other people also waiting on the flight , so I moved to an area near the parking lot to just be alone . Havent been in the mood to talk to many people lately . But , I 'm standing here against a short t-wall watching military and civilian aircraft , fixed and rotary wing , take-off an land . Its an awesome sight to behold . <p> I took note that while most of the aircraft have the same starting point on the runway , they each have varying lengths of travel before actually leaving the ground . I was surprised at how much runway some aircraft needed . Some I thought would be shorter and others longer . <p> The idea of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aircraft as they negotiated the runway . <p> We sacrifice a lot of it in the military . Our every move is nearly dictated to us . We are not free to come and go as we please , unlike the people on some of these civilian aircraft . For 12 months , we turn over every aspect of our lives and forsake those freedoms we may take for granted in order to secure them . <p> Back home , if I wanted to drive to Montana or Utah or wherever for a weekend I could just go . As long as I have the financial means to get there , I could just take off . If I were going a certain distance , I would need to inform my chain of command for accountability purposes , but for the most part I 'd be free to go . <p> But , right now , Im stuck here within the confines of a chain-linked fence for the next 10 months of my life . I 'm not complaining since I fought to get here ; just making observations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brief couple of days I had when I went to Manas to receive Soldiers and check up on operations there highlighted the fact that there is no escape by the manufactured controversy it created .

But , representatives from Massachusetts seem to constantly be working to destroy our freedoms , our Constitution , and our God-given rights . <p> Recently , Representative James McGovern ( D-MA ) introduced Joint House Resolution 88 proposing an amendment to the constitution known as the " Peoples Rights Amendment . " Sounds almost redundant , does n't  it ? I mean , the Bill of Rights IS the " Peoples Rights . " <p> Section 1 . We the people who ordain and establish this Constitution intend the rights protected by this Constitution to be the rights of natural persons . <p> Section 2 . The words people , person , or citizen as used in this Constitution do not include corporations , limited liability companies or other corporate entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , or any foreign state , and such corporate entities are subject to such regulation as the people , through their elected State and Federal representatives , deem reasonable and are otherwise consistent with the powers of Congress and the States under this Constitution . <p> The intent of this amendment is to exclude corporations from the rights of free speech . Liberals are n't  happy with the Citizens United decision , the third such decision that recognized the rights of like-minded people to pool their resources to voice their opinions in a collective fashion . Liberals loathe corporations and will stop at nothing to end them , whether it be taxing them into oblivion or using their bully pulpit to pass laws like this one . <p> When I got back from Afghanistan , we bought a new van that came with a free year of Sirius/XM . Every now and then I find myself listening to Sirius 127 " Left . " Yesterday , during the Thom Hartmann show , they were discussing whether or not a corporation was a person . It was a ludicrous discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance . <p> He made the absurd argument about corporations getting married ( when did progressives and liberals respect marriage anyway ? ) or buying alcohol . The problem with this is that a corporation is n't a PERSON , its PEOPLE . Chief Justice John Roberts ( before he completely lost his walnut in the ObamaDontCare decision ) noted in the Citizens United decision that the first amendment " protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer . " <p> If you 're still on the fence about what this amendment means , I have n't quoted the entire text yet . Consider Section 3 : <p> Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the people 's rights of freedom of speech , freedom of the press , free exercise of religion , freedom of association and all such other rights of the people , which rights are inalienable . <p> Liberals are a funny species to watch . Their use of speech and twisting of words is more conducive to a comedy act . here 's the thing : NO ONE thinks that a corporation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This third section seems to contradict the others . <p> The argument is whether corporations or groups , as a COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONS , are allowed to pool their resources to further a cause , agenda , or candidate . The Supreme Court ruled rightly so that they do . The first amendment says " Congress shall make no lawprohibitingthe right of the people peaceably to assemble . " It does NOT say " the right of a PERSON to peaceably assemble . " <p> Today , this collection of people comes in many different forms : as non-profits , corporations , groups , clubs , etc . If the individual does not want to be a part of this collective , he has the right to disassociate himself with it . <p> here 's the thing , those that support this legislation are also shooting themselves in the foot . This legislation not only affects corporations like the NRA and Fox News that liberals love to hate , but also MSNBC , the New York Times , and other liberal propaganda machines . These corporations will no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , this bill already has 28 co-sponsors , one of which is a " Republican " ( I will list those at the end of this post ) and five states have passed resolutions calling for this amendment : Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Hawaii , New Mexico , and Vermont . <p> here 's the good news though : as long as there is a conservative majority in at least one of the houses of Congress , this bill stands ZERO chance of passing . But , its important that you know these types of attempts are at least being made . If these same individuals are capable of passing a bill into law that merely " clarifies the authority of Congress and the States to regulate corporations " in order to explain the meaning of the first amendment , the next logical step in this progress is to clarify " the authority of Congress and the States to regulation gun ownership .

Not sure why they did n't  cover that aspect . According to the law I read when this was signed into law by President Bush , basic eligibility requires a member to have at least six years of service and make a new commitment for another four to transfer benefits . The problem with this is that the militarys hands are tied . This was a provision of the law , not something the services are dreaming up to keep people in longer .

No other boots herald in the winter season like these . They proudly announce to passersby : " Baby , its cold outside . So cold , in fact , I must wear snuggly , snow-white boots while hiking from my Kia to the grocery store . " <p> When its zero below , Snowdonia offers more than good looks . This boot steps up to the icy plate offering a bevy of features such as Thermo-Dri waterproofing , Thinsulate insulation , winter traction and more . These are quintessential elements to a successful winter boot . Honestly , I cant imagine trekking through the snow-packed streets in anything less . <p> Mother Nature was kind enough to dump a few inches of snow in Missouri , just in time for this review . How thoughtful . She also decided to share some freezing rain and ice " a St. Louis specialty . How did the Snowdonia perform ? I 'd give it four out of five stars on all accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed on the ground . That 's pretty much all you can ask for this time of year .

I avoided the ice like sane people avoid shopping malls this time of year . I took baby steps out of my ice-blue car this morning and inched my way to a clear patch of concrete . But do n't  feel too cheated because there are plenty of other features to discuss . <p> The pull-on style of the boot is similar to those of the UGG variety . Typically I do n't  mind a pull-on , especially when your boot is chock full of snow and mud , or snud , if you will . However , I felt like this particular style ran a half-size too big . I kept looking down for laces to tighten . And if you think those fuzzy balls on the pull tab are fun , that they are . They bounce around like tiny tether balls , swinging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too distracting and tucked those suckers inside my boots , where they stayed safe for the rest of the day . <p> As for the faux fur , there is something so inviting about a boot lined with fur . It attracts your foot like a cat to a Christmas tree . It just wants to jump right in there , and check out all the cool stuff . And the Snowdonia will not disappoint . Another area where the Snowdonia excels is its winter traction . While I did n't  sample the ice , I also did n't  slip and slide on soupy snow tracks on tiled floors . <p> At one point I slid on the- St Moritz that I- reviewed last year to compare it with the Snowdonia . The St Moritz fur is fluffier and softer and more plentiful by comparison . Overall , St Moritz are also warmer and cozier in my opinion . So , if you 're deciding between the two , I 'd pick St Moritz . They have that **33;246;TOOLONG feel. - With that said , the Snowdonia still provides plenty of protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these boots listed yet on tacticalgear.com , they will retail for around $84 once they become available . What a great price for boots that promise to protect your feet all season long . <p> Bottom line : The Snowdonia 200 is the perfect boot for trudging to and from shopping malls and grocery stores in the cold and snow . <h> One Comment on " Follow to Win Hi-Tec Snowdonia Boots " <p> Hi , thanks for this review . I got a pair of Hi Tecs recently for treks to Bhutan and Borneo , and they are sturdy pairs without the faux fur and tether balls .

Add to that daily briefings and issues that pop up from time to time and were a very fluid team . <p> However , there are some days that tend to trend towards the more boring and our workload is decreased enough to allow my guys to do laundry , clean rooms and spend more time in the gym .

While folks are trying to eliminate each others bunnies , each player is also trying to collect as many Carrots as possible . " <p> There are all kinds of whacky rules to the game . For example , there is a rule called the Two Twelve Rule which states that " the person who was born closest to February 12th goes first , and the play continues clockwise . " If two or more players were born equally close to February 12th , then whoever has the oldest living grandmother will go first .

So please ladies , do n't  get angry or hit us . " <p> We sort of adopted the Killer Bunnies as our unofficial mascot here . I even commissioned some patches to recognize those who play the game with me in a combat zone . The green bunny patch signifies that a Soldier has earned his Killer Bunnies Combat Patch . But , the one everyone has their sights set on is the Blue Killer Bunny Champ Combat Patch . <p> Every Saturday , we tally up who has won the most games the previous week .

@@96509559 @709559/ <h> How to Make a Kydex Gun Holster Video <p> An impressive video of YouTube user Parlusk creating his own Kydex holster surfaced this week . Now this is something we have n't seen before . That 's probably because Kydex is n't the easiest to work with . <p> Not familiar with Kydex ? Its a durable leather alternative that was first manufactured 44 years ago . When stacked up to leather , it proves to be waterproof , easy to clean and retains it shape . However , some say its less comfortable and can damage the finish of your gun more than leather . <p> To make your own Kydex gun holster , it will take at least 30 minutes or more . You will also need the following materials : <p> Measure the gun from the top slide to the trigger guard and measure the top . Add the figures together making sure its enough Kydex to fold over the gun . Its always better to have more than less . <p> Mark the Kydex sheet for cutting . Then using a bandsaw with a metal blade ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate measurements . <p> To smooth out any rough edges , run the Kydex sheet through the sander once . <p> Place the Kydex sheet in a toaster oven . It might not fit all the way . Watch the sheet warm up because it can get too hot . <p> Be sure the sheet is hot enough to make it pliable . Wrap it around the gun , put it in the press , and clamp it down . Leave it in the press for five to 10 minutes . " I do n't  have any patience at all , so I usually take it out long before Im supposed to , " Parlusk admits . <p> Remove the Kydex from the press , and trim out around the trigger guard using a bandsaw . <p> Use the sander again to remove the rough edges and give the holster contour . <p> Create one or two rivet holes in the holster . Drill straight through near the bottom of the holster . <p> Line up the rivets in the holes , and push them in with a press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holster is a little tighter . <p> Use a heat gun and warm up the Kydex so that its bendable . Do n't  get too close or the edges will melt . " The good thing about Kydex is that if you mess it up , you can always reheat it and try again , " Parlusk says . <p> Slide the gun in the heated Kydex , and put it in the press . Use the press , but do n't  clamp it down as much as the first time . <p> Heat it up around where the trigger guard is and make it lay flat on the trigger gun . Keep the gun in the holster . " I 'm pretty confident its not going to hurt the gun when you heat it up . " Push in the Kydex around the trigger guard with your fingers . <p> Sand it on the sides to make the contours consistent . <p> Use the extra material on the top to make a belt loop . Use the heat gun to warm up the area to bend . <p> Lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece inside to create a small edge . Wait until the bent piece becomes hard again . <p> Leave the wood piece ( which should be the same as your belt loop length ) , and heat up the bottom part of the belt loop below the wooden piece until it folds over . <p> Shape the part to accommodate a belt loop . Push the Kydex sheet in , hold it and wait for it to cool down . <p> Look at the holsters on parluisks website , anyone who has ever carried concealed for any length of time will tell you this guy has no clue what he s doing , the designs are terrible and so is the workmanship . <p> I 've personaly talked to this guy and he is an arrogant jerk , 1st class . <p> Real Men that want to keep their " Man Card " intact , and not have their friends making jokes about them for years to come do not admit to the fact ! Real Men that want to stay married by keeping their wives happy , well that is a different story .

@@96509563 @709563/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Do n't  Blame Me If Trump Loses <p> This is probably the nastiest and most negative campaign season since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were at each others throats in the 1800 election . The difference this year is that instead of two generally respectable people running against each other , there are two despicably horrible candidates . On one side , you have the Republican nominee who still is n't a known quantity on conservative issues who is a vulgar and offensive individual . On the other hand , you have a corrupt , morally bankrupt politician who should be running a chain gang , not the country . <p> In the past , when I was n't happy with either choice I could look further down the ticket for another candidate worth voting for . However , even the Libertarians do n't  provide a viable option this year . As of this writing , I 'm completely skipping filling in a bubble for a presidential candidate . Because of this , I 've been told that if Clinton wins its my fault . I reject this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Clinton wins , the Republicans have no one but themselves to blame . The party chose such a flawed candidate that they ca n't push off their loss on those of us with integrity in voting ( that 's not to suggest Trump voters are n't  voting with integrity ) . I vote for candidates that fit within the views , values , beliefs and morals I want in a candidate . I 'm not a single issue voter . If I were , I 'd probably vote for Trump on the 2nd amendment alone . However , his views on the 4th amendment another issue important to me completely nullify that position . I voted for Ted Cruz in the primary . That is n't why I 'm not voting for Trump . I did n't  vote for Romney in the last primary , but I voted for him in the general . So , do n't  accuse me of having sour grapes that " my candidate " did n't  win and I 'm butthurt over it . Republicans knew about Trumps history cozying up to Democrats and having very progressive views on issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 . So , they knew better . <p> Trumps history with women is well-known , so that should n't have been a surprise . He never knew he was ever going to be a politician so he never covered his ass the way politicians like to do . I 'm not excusing what he says he did , but let 's face it ; he s not alone in his indecency with women . There are a lot of hypocrites in both parties that are using this most recent " revelation " to attack the nominee , but especially in the Democrat party . Bill Clinton needs to simply shut his yap , lock himself in a closet , and not come out until November 9th . Hillary Clinton , the enabler , also has no room to talk for covering for her husband and attacking his accusers . Obama shows off his erections to a fawning media and shouldnt throw his rocks in his glass house . <p> Republicans should n't apologize for Trump . While there 's no way to prove that what Trump says he did actually happened short of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tolerated . We should n't try to waive it away by saying , " its nothing compared to what the Democrats do . " Ever heard of " two wrongs do n't  make a right ? " What were seeing right now is the difference between the Republicans and Democrats . The Democrats embrace sleaze , corruption , and immorality . They rally around it and practically encourage it . They do n't  care how repugnant their politicians . Its all a part of the platform . On the other hand , Republicans typically do n't  tolerate that kind of behavior in its members and will be quick to criticize it . They try to portray themselves as the party with a monopoly on morality . They wo n't tolerate those within their ranks that make them look bad . Bad behavior does n't  make Democrats look badto other Democrats . <p> What Republicans should be doing is criticizing and castigating Trump for what he did 11 years ago , understand that he apologized for his inexcusable behavior and then move on to attacking the much worse candidate without pretending it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the FBI , lied the American people , broke the law in maintaining her private server , threatened national security and broke the law in sharing extremely classified information on non-secure systems , and was responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi . And that 's only recently . There 's also Travelgate and Troopergate . Clinton is probably the only person I can think of who has more dead friends , coworkers , acquaintances and employees than anyone I know including combat soldiers . Theres Vince Foster , Luther " Jerry " Parks , and about 42 others . Granted , this falls more within the realm of conspiracy theories , but name one other politician ( or anyone for that matter ) that has this many suspiciously dead people close to them . <p> As bad of a candidate as Clinton is , that is n't a reason to vote for Trump . No one should ever cast a vote AGAINST someone they despise . How often are the Republicans going to complain about their nominee being the " lesser of two evils . " And it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less and less so . Each has been worse than the last ( though I believe McCain was much worse than Romney ) . In fact , everything that Trump is in trouble for right now adultery , crude language and behavior , etc is everything the Republican Party claims to despise . They were the party of family values , remember ? Meanwhile , Republicans and Democrats are both so bad that each side is reduced to scare tactics about what will happen if the " other side " wins as the most compelling reason to vote FOR their side . " If Hillary is elected , we lose the Supreme Court . " " If Hillary is elected , we lose the 2nd amendment . " Think about that folks . If you can intelligently analyze that statement , you 'll know that 's not possible unless you allow it to be . If Clinton or the Supreme Court want to see another Civil War , mess with our right to keep and bear arms . If you 're afraid that the 2nd amendment is in danger if a particular politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont defend it when the time comes . <p> What if the Supreme Court or Clinton takes away your rights ? What are you REALLY going to do ? Nothing . You 'll whine for four more years to elect another lesser of two evils . I 've found many Republicans fit in this category anyway . Come to think of it , most Americans do . I 've seen it in all the Republicans who attack those of us who refuse to I 'd when stopped for open carry . I 've seen it in all the Republicans that believe in universal background checks and mandatory training and licensing . Its no longer about " I 'm the best candidate " and more about " I 'm not the other candidate . " It does n't  seem many people are voting for Clinton or Trump , but against Clinton or Trump . <p> This brings me back to the original claim that , if Clinton wins , its my fault and the fault of others like me who are justifiably disgusted at our choice of candidates . Even the third party candidates suck . Jill Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete airhead who is worse the rest of the lineup . Johnson is a clown without make-up who is more Republican than Trump is , but definitely is n't a true Libertarian . Constitution Party candidate is only on the ballot in 24 states , so that 's a non-starter . Independent candidate Evan McMullin looks like a great option and is either on the ballot or a certified write-in candidate in all 50 states . <p> There 's this narrative that " not voting for Trump is like voting for Clinton " or " not voting for Clinton is a vote for Trump . " I see it differently . Not voting for Trump is not voting for Trumpor Clinton . And vice versa . To suggest that my vote enables one candidate over another suggests that the candidate automatically had my vote to being with . On the contrary , my vote is earned and not to be taken for granted . Everyone should feel that way about their vote . Too many people focus on the ( R ) or the ( D ) and will vote for a watermelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting for Trump does n't  mean that its one less vote for the Republican nominee that benefits the Democrat nominee . I have NEVER voted party line . Ever . I educate myself on candidates and vote based on the individual . Most of the time that has been a Republican , but many times it was a Libertarian or independent candidate . <p> I would argue that those who subscribe to the " lesser of two evils " or " not voting for x is a vote for y " philosophy are willing victims of media and two-party brainwashing . Each has convinced us that " this election is the most important election ever " because one party may be elected over the other party . Each accuses the other of destroying this country . The irony is that both are actually right . The two-party system has done nothing but plunge this country into virtual bankruptcy , destroyed our monetary system , made Americans more dependent on government , infringed on our civil rights , and passed laws controlling literally every aspect of our lives . Republicans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the party of big government on the left . <p> In conclusion , if Trump loses in November , do n't  blame me . Blame your candidate . Blame those who voted for him in the primary . My vote does n't  matter until I go into that booth and vote for someone . There is no bubble that says , " AGAINST Clinton " or " AGAINST Trump . " When you go into that booth , you are voting FOR a candidate and there is n't a single candidate for president this year that I feel has earned my vote . That does n't  mean I 'm not going to vote . It simply means that I 'm skipping that first bubble and moving on . My refusal to vote is a vote . <p> Let 's face it my vote would n't matter if I voted for either candidate ; were screwed either way . You may blame me for not voting for your candidate , but you cant blame me for what happens for the next four years either , whether good or bad . Perhaps if Trump is elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt it . If I 'm wrong , I 'll be man enough to admit it when the time comes .

He could shoot better that anyone I ever knew . He is a God fearing man who kept his religion to himself , unless you wanted to talk about God . He would jump to help anyone who needed any kind of help , and he was able to do most things . He loves kids and this is easy to see when kids are around him . He does not laugh much , and he does not cry much , but when he does either , you have no doubt as to the reason .

He is respectful of higher authority , but has never held back any questions about decisions made by higher authority . The Sergeant Major is my best friend . <p> I need to add this today .

It saddens me deeply to learn that he has passed away . While a young Sergeant , at Camp David , he was our Guest of Honor at a Mess Night at Cashtown Inn on November 23 , 1993 . That night , he handed me some SgtMaj cheuvrons and stated to me that he knows I will be a SgtMaj in the Marine Corps someday . I have carried those cheuvrons with me throughout my career from one duty station to another , coast to coast .

God Bless Him ! <p> I spent the better portion of 1969 and part of 1970 with then 1stSgt Rockwell and then visited with him at HQMC during his early tenure at Camp David . Never met , other than my father , a better humanitarian for the Corps . Has n't  been a day gone by since we first met that i have not remebered something he shared with me or taught me .

More schools have opened and opened to everyone in the 10 years of U.S. presence than the entire prior 30 years and the literacy rate has more than doubled over that time . <p> Our troops are making a difference here .

Its a more difficult message to convey in a land that is n't as resource rich as a country like Iraq where it was easy to argue that Americans only wanted to steal from the Iraqi peoples wealth . Its pretty obvious that was n't the case . <p> While many folks back in the states have lost sight of our purposes here , the troops on the ground are well aware of our accomplishments here . Sometimes , they are only seen in hindsight , but they are seen . Its also been nice to see such a global coalition represented in country . Anyone who says this is a U.S. operation is sorely ignorant of the contributions of many of our allies here that I get to see every day on the streets .

Ill just say their numbers are n't  few . <p> Things are started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small team of LNO ( liaisons ) with a wide range of responsibilities . To keep it broad , we support the warfighters out in the field . We manage personnel , equipment , and transportation that directly affects the troops outside the wire . We process all new troops coming in and troops who need to return home for one reason or another , ensuring they are properly briefed and trained prior to heading to their front line units . It keeps us hopping and sometimes its a thankless job , but its very rewarding personally . We take great pride with every convoy that leaves having successfully accomplished all their missions while here in Kandahar . Its a quick response , short suspense job that requires a lot of attention to detail and focus to meet time requirements . And , every now and then , we have a day like today where our efforts are noticed and appreciated . <p> Then , we reset , reorganize , and regroup for the next batch of troops arriving on station . <h> 3 Comments on " Wars Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just discovered your site today .

You and all the other military personnels who have done their best to fight all these wars , some who in doing so lost their lives in the cause of it . Even though I am not an American , I do salute you and the troops and their families for the sacrifices . I also saluate those fallen heros who had sacrifices their lives and to their families who will sorely missed them , my heart goes out to them . I know how difficult it is to miss someone you loved alot . Like you says , the troops have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to destroy them but to help them in varies way .

Take care brother ! . <p> I am grateful to you and the many other soldiers past and present . The honor , values and principles displayed at a transfer ceremony is a simple reminder of how we should act here in the states . We have disrespected the sacrifice you and our soldiers have given with our apathetic approach and dismantling of our countrys foundation . Please forgive us for allowing our nation to stumble while our soldiers are fighting abroad . We will do better , I will do better . John Alaniz

Before slapping on some dye , make sure , at the very least , you clean the boots surface .

I was going through some of my pictures today from a Troop Support Rally that myself and my dear friends Angel and Uncle Marty put together in the Aberdeen Proving Ground , Maryland area , the weekend of Memorial Day in 2005 . I ran across one that I wanted to share with everyone . <p> At the time , CJ was stationed at Fort Irwin , California . However , at our request , he took time out of his hectic schedule to come to Maryland and be the MC for our event . The picture here is CJ with the Hero Bear that I presented him for helping us out that weekend . <p> Gosh I 'm not even sure its online anymore Tracy . Back in early 2005 , myself , Angel and Uncle Marty decided we were going to hold a troop support rally in Perryville , Md , near Aberdeen Proving Grounds . We 'd all met CJ through AdoptaPlatoon . WE all decided that we wanted to have CJ come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get orders for TDY that weekend and flew out to be our MC . For the event , we had several entertainers who also volunteered their time and talent . They were Hank Brake , Tony Diana , Sally Mudd and Deltz Haze . All of them came from quite a distance away from Maryland . Because we wanted to thank CJ not only for helping us out by being our MC , but also thank him for his service to our Country , we presented him with the bear he s holding in the picture . This bear is a pretty special bear . He s dressed as a soldier and in his hands he s holding a letter addressed to a deployed soldier . By pressing the bears foot I believe , the letter is read alound in different voices . a childs , a wifes , a mother , a father , a grandparent and an American citizen , thanking the soldier for his service . When that picture was taken , CJ was listening to the letter being read , at my house there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the picture , it was a rather emotional moment for him , hearing that . <p> That 's pretty much the story in a nutshell . I 'm sure if you asked , CJ would share what thoughts were going through his mind as he listended to the letter being read . <p> I was just looking through my pics and saw it and figured that I 'd share it with everyone . I 've got a few more , that I have to find yet . Like the kitten smuggling pics of CJ. hehehehehehe I 'm sure CJ remembers that well , as when we took the pic , he was on the phone with Emily , trying to convince her that she should let him bring kittens home with him . = 
@@96509572 @709572/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Soldiers Angels Walk the Walk <p> AUTHORS NOTE : I am writing this on my own , without request , favor , force or coersion . I am sick of seeing a good organization and its hard-working , humble , and selfless members denigrated and libeled by sad , pathetic excuses for human beings , much less troop supporters . The truth needs to be put out there and that 's what my sole purpose is in writing this . <p> " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " Soldiers Angels an organization I 've supported and volunteered for since about 2005 is again under fire from disreputable sources . Most of the attacks are based on the organizations Charity Navigator rating of 2/4 stars overall , with a 1/4 star " Financial " rating . Ive provided the links to the page so that my readers can see the exact same information I see to write this post . I will only focus on the " Financial " one-star rating since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , they have nothing to hide . <p> The Financial rating is based on the following 7 criteria which I will break down independently : Program Expenses , Administrative Expenses , Fundraising Expenses , Fundraising Efficiency , Primary Revenue Growth , Program Expenses Growth , and Working Capital Ratio . <p> Program Expenses Charity Navigator ( CN ) scores an organization higher when a larger percentage of their donations to go program expenses . This measure reflects what percent of its total budget a charity spends on the programs and services it exists to deliver . Dividing a charitys program expenses by its total functional expenses yields this percentage . Soldiers Angels spends just over 78% of its budget in this area . This is a very good number to have and as such earned them the highest CN score in this area . Obviously , if an organization is spending 33% or less of its budget on program expenses it is n't living up to its purpose and mission . The industry standard is 65% . <p> Administrative Expenses This measure reflects what percent of its total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated costs , and organizational meetings . Dividing a charitys administrative expenses by its total functional expenses yields this percentage . Anything under 15% earns an organization a top score , according to Charity Navigator methodology . Soldiers Angels administrative expenses account for just 6.1% of total expenditures . By contrast , the highest rated military charity , The Navy SEAL Foundation , spent 6.8% of its budget on administrative expenses . So , when people accuse Soldiers Angels of paying its founder , board or others exorbitant salaries , its a flat-out lie . The founder and president , Patti Paton-Bader receives nothing for her role in the organization . No member of the board is paid either . The two largest salaries and arguably the two positions that need to be compensated went to the Director of Marketing and the Executive Director , both full-time positions . As a matter of fact , these two positions are paid as much as or less than the same positions in all the military-oriented charity organizations rated higher by CN . <p> Fundraising Expenses This measure reflects what a charity spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , publicity , mailing , and staffing and costs incurred in soliciting donations , memberships , and grants . Dividing a charitys fundraising expenses by its total functional expenses yields this percentage . Because the bulk of Soldiers Angels work involves mailing care packages , they have major " postage and shipping " and " printing and publications " as well as mail house expenses . So because CN looks at these expenses as fundraising expenses , they took a hit of 5 points in this category . Again , by contrast , the Navy SEAL Foundations spent nearly a million dollars more on fundraising than Soldiers Angels , but also brought in $4 million more in revenue . Getting better than 5 points in this area will always be difficult , if not , impossible based on mission . <p> Fundraising Efficiency The amount spent to raise $1 in charitable contributions . To calculate a charitys fundraising efficiency , Charity Navigator divides an organizations fundraising expenses by the total contributions it receives . Soldiers Angels missed the top score in this area by a mere $.06 . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Primary Revenue Growth &amp; Program Expenses Growth These were the two areas that also hurt Soldiers Angels as far as overall rating goes . My personal opinion is that these two areas are sort of an unfair bias against some organizations just based on mission statements . SA was hit here because it saw an 11.3% decrease in Primary Revenue Growth and an 8% decrease in Program Expense Growth . This is to be expected . After all , all combat troops withdrew from Iraq last year and the need to send care packages to these troops decreased . Since the need to ship care packages has decreased , the money needed to ship them has decreased as well . These areas of scoring wo n't help SA in the future either as the mission in Afghanistan draws to a close . <p> Working Capital Ratio ( years ) Soldiers Angels does not stockpile money like many charities . Instead , it uses the money it raises to " ensure no Soldier ( or service member ) goes unloved . " This is the area in which SA was hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here which determines how long a charity could sustain its level of spending using its net available assets , or working capital , as reported on its most recently filed Form 990 . Charity Navigator includes in a charitys working capital unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets , and exclude permanently restricted net assets . Dividing these net available assets by a charitys total expenses ( including payments to affiliates ) for the most recent fiscal year , yields the working capital ratio . Because SA uses the money it takes in and puts it towards troop support programs , it does n't  have much money left over . Unlike many charities , they do n't  fundraise beyond their need . I 'm not saying this is a good or bad thing . By contrast , the Navy SEAL Foundation took in nearly $6 million , but only spent $1.7 million . So , naturally , they have a high working capital ratio . If funds dried up tomorrow for them , they could still operate for a few years without changing their mission , expenses , or structure . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to support troops almost immediately . <p> In the end , Soldiers Angels got two stars out of four . However , when you look at the areas where a donor should care the most about how their hard earned money is being used the organization earned the highest ratings possible . Personally , I want an organization that does n't  try to hide its expenses so I can see exactly where every penny of my donation goes ( for the record , I have a monthly allotment set up going to Soldiers Angels so I do have skin in the game and care where my money goes ) . I also want my money going where Im told its going , which is to programs that fit the organizations mission statement . <p> Looking at the links I provided , you can see for yourself that there is absolutely NO SANE REASON anyone should question whether or not Soldiers Angels is a worthy organization , meeting its mission of taking care of troops . They have a link up on the main page of their site to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form 990 ( Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax and required reporting to the IRS ) and audit . You do n't  have to take my word for it and I sure hope you do n't  take the word of a zealot either . <p> However , facts do n't  ever stop those with an agenda from opening their mouths and allowing stupidity to flow freely from their mouths . These types of people are known to say things like , " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " And that 's exactly what they do . Unfortunately , they rarely have anything real to go on , so they invent controversy by suckering with their baseless accusations in the hopes those victims say something that can be used against them . <p> The founder and president of Soldiers Angels is Patti Paton-Bader . Shes a great human being and cares deeply about troops . Everything she does she does without compensation , which says more than anything I can write here . The issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because as I 've demonstrated , they 've done nothing wrong . The problem lies in the fact that Patti is such an honorable person filled with unquestionable integrity that she refuses to take credit for something she did n't  do . THIS is really what a certain writer is pissed off about . He s been looking for payback ever since , even if it means tarnishing the character and integrity of a good organization and its leaders . <p> " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " Translated : make stuff up . One of the " truths " being thrown around as fact is that Patti " funneled " over $75k to a company owned in part by her son , Brandon Vorn . In the absence of facts , invent them . So the attack now centers on the fact that her son started his busines , Boodam and the Beav , in Nevada . The fact that Vorn does n't  live in Nevada is somehow noteworthy . One would assume when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a semi-coherent working knowledge of how corporations work . Many companies owned by multiple partners will frequently incorporate in Nevada for privacy or asset protection . Nevada does not require disclosure of share ownership . Therefore , a partner can invest in a business and not have to worry about his personal life being dragged into the business or vice versa . Delaware is another common location where businesses will register their corporations . Over 50% of U.S. publicly traded corporations and 60% of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in that state . The bottom line is that a person organizing a business generally has a choice on where to incorporate it . In the United States , corporations are generally organized pursuant to state law , rather than federal law . <p> " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " I write for free . I 'm not here to make money . I get ZERO from this blog post . Military Gear does n't  pay me a cent . They do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . They do n't  pay me advertising . I do n't  serve on their board . The only thing Ive ever gotten from them was care package support and a few years ago they helped me send over 1000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies to Iraq . <p> The fact is that Pattis son found out that they were about to spend a ton of money to purchase shirts and he was able to produce them at almost half the cost . Let me also state here that while I was in Kandahar , I frequently visited the Wounded Warrior housing to hang out with troops and make sure they were taken care of . There was an entire section of shelves with Soldiers Angels shirts and sweats for the troops that were injured and did n't  have access to other clothing . Frequently , their clothing was cut off them and all they had for a matter of days or weeks was hospital gowns . Those t-shirts and sweats helped make these Wounded Warriors more comfortable while they recovered . And I 'm not talking about ten or twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to ceiling . <p> " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " So the fact is that Soldiers Angels got MORE for its money using Boodam and the Beav than the previous company they were going to use FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURCHASE . The organization did the right thing and reported it as they were required to by law . No laws were broken . No ethics were violated . And no hard-earned donations were squandered paying twice as much for half the product . <h> 7 Comments on " Soldiers Angels Walk the Walk " <p> I love being a volunteer here . There is always a small amount of truth to every lie . I will continue volunteering here . The only concern I have is why the 2012 financials have not been released . Is there a release date set ? I am set up to pay $12 a year which is not an issue if they need to ofset their costs , I just want to know what their financials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who genuinely cares about the troops , and who sees all the stuff other Angels are doing for them as well , I really appreciate your post . We Angels will do anything we are able to do for the troops . We are all avid supporters of the service members . None of the Angels deserve the negative talk . We really do care , and each one of us gives all that we are able in support , time , money , friendship , and resources as possible . Your post meant a lot to me . Thanks ! = <p> Also , as a comparison , Invisible Children , that charity which filmed war children and was lambasted in the news recently , got a 3 star rating . Why ? Because they banked almost $5mil . <p> Yeah , I do n't  have a lot of faith in Charity Navigator when they reward charities for holding back money instead of putting it towards where donors are EXPECTING the money to gointo the charities main focus . <p> Bravo ! I have had my soldier adoptees request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items , for the wounded . The fact that Mr. Yons commenters do n't  know about this need , much less understand it , tells me how many guys they have personally supported . Very few , if any . Soldiers Angels has done a remarkable job of caring for those who are wounded , and in making certain they have the personal items they need . <p> While Mr. Yon is busy trying to stir up crap so people will hit his Paypal account , Patti Bader has selflessly helped thousands of our troops . I did n't  hear about what she 's done due to her bragging about it , I 've heard from the guys who were on the receiving end of hers , and Soldiers Angels , generosity . I 've heard many things about Mr. Yon as well , none of the things Ive heard involve him being generous , or kind , to anyone .

Free speech was made to be free . While I personally detest liars and the lies they tell , I know from experience that people who are pathological liars always end up losing readers and lose credibility get their just deserts in the end . For people and entities that feel they been personally affected by someone claiming to be a veteran or owners of particular medals of valor we have the civil court system . <p> I disagree with the author of the letter about libel and slander . The reason that those are against the law and do n't  violate the first amendment are because there is an injured party . <p> Rights are always limited to the extent that they infringe on anothers rights . For example , I have the right to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

Because speeding tickets are fought in **27;281;TOOLONG courts as crimes or civil penalties . In order for a crime to be committed there must according to legal definitions be an injured party . Who is injured if I 'm doing 11 miles over the speed limit on the highway ? I 'm not going to get into the weeds about traffic law ; I just wanted to give an example of how I SUCCESSFULLY fight speeding tickets . Do n't  use this defense unless you know how to use it ( There are about 40 pages of briefs that must be submitted to the court , so its not a cut and dry example ) . <p> Anyway , libel and slander are not equal to Stolen Valor cases unless the individual perpetrating the fraud ( I sound educated today , huh ? ) is using an actual veterans identity . <p> There are already fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain resources that would n't otherwise be attainable . The Court noted in its decision that the DOD should come up with a database of medals that is available to the general populace . <p> Another way I believe the Stolen Valor Act could be saved in intent is to strengthen existing fraud laws at the state and federal level . They should add clauses that make the commitment of fraud a greater offense if the defendant committed said fraud while posing as a veteran or claiming medals to which he was not entitled . <p> Again , I do n't  believe that anyones valor has been stolen by morons claiming to be something they 're not . Real troops will always be respected and their accomplishments celebrated . No one can prove that the court of public opinion has ever shifted because of these douchebags . A just punishment for these people is public humiliation and castigation.

@@96509586 @709586/ 68529 @qwx928529 <p> The president today awarded the Presidential Unit Citation to A Trp , 1st Squadron , 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment for their actions during Vietnam . This is a big honor . My unit received the citation from President Bush when we returned from OIF1 . Here is the text of President Obamas speech at the presentation : <p> Good afternoon , everybody , and welcome to the White House . And welcome to a moment nearly 40 years in the making . <p> Last month , I was privileged to present the parents of an American soldier , Sergeant First Class Jared Monti , with our nations highest decoration for valor the Medal of Honor . Today , we celebrate the awarding of our nations highest honor for a military unit the Presidential Unit Citation . <p> The Presidential Unit Citation is awarded for " gallantry , determination , and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions . " Since its creation during the Second World War , it has only been bestowed about 100 times . <p> To mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boswell ; Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Jim " Hoss " Cartwright ; John McHugh , our Army Secretary ; and Vice Chief of Staff Peter Chiarelli ; from Fort Irwin , California , leaders of todays 11th Armored Cavalry Colonel Paul Laughlin and Command Sergeant Major Martin Wilcox ; and most of all , the men of Alpha Troop those behind me and some 100 here today . <p> Now , these men might be a little bit older , a little bit grayer . But make no mistake these soldiers define the meaning of bravery and heroism . <p> It was March 1970 , deep in the jungles of Vietnam . And through the static and crackle of their radios Alpha Troop heard that another unit was in trouble . Charlie Company , from the 1st Calvary Division , had stumbled upon a massive underground bunker of North Vietnamese troops . A hundred Americans were facing some 400 enemy fighters . Outnumbered and outgunned , Charlie Company was at risk of being overrun . <p> That 's when Alpha Troops captain gave the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As these men will tell you themselves , this is n't the story of a battle that changed the course of a war . It never had a name , like Tet or Hue or Khe Sanh . It never made the papers back home . But like countless battles , known and unknown , it is a proud chapter in the story of the American soldier . <p> Its the story of men who came together , from every corner of America , of different colors and creeds . Some young just 18 , 19 years old , and just weeks in the jungle ; some older veterans hardened by the ugliness of war . Noncommissioned officers who held the unit together and the officers assigned to lead them . <p> Its the story of how this team of some 200 men set out to save their fellow Americans . With no roads to speak of , they plowed their tanks and armored vehicles through the thick jungle , smashing a path through bamboo and underbrush , mile after mile , risking ambush and landmines every step of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what one member of Charlie Company called " a miracle . " <p> Its a story of resolve . For Alpha Troop could have simply evacuated their comrades and left that enemy bunker for another day to ambush another American unit . But as their captain said , " Thats not what the 11th Cavalry does . " <p> And so , ultimately , this is a story of what soldiers do not only for their country , but for each other : the troopers who put themselves in the line of fire , using their tanks and vehicles to shield those trapped Americans ; the loaders who kept the ammunition coming , and the gunners who never let up ; and when one of those gunners went down , the soldier who jumped up to take his place . <p> Its about the men who rushed out to drag their wounded buddies to safety ; the medics who raced to save so many ; the injured who kept fighting hour after hour . And finally , with dark falling , as the convoy made the daring escape back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded who lay at their feet . <p> The fog of war makes a full accounting impossible . But this much we know . Among the many casualties that day , some 20 members of Alpha Troop were wounded . And at least two made the ultimate sacrifice their names now among the many etched in that black granite wall not far from here . But because of that service , that sacrifice , Alpha Troop completed its mission . It rescued Charlie Company . It saved those 100 American soldiers , some of who join us today . And those soldiers went on to have families children and grandchildren who also owe their lives to Alpha Troop . <p> Now , some may wonder : After all these years , why honor this heroism now ? The answer is simple . Because we must . Because we have a sacred obligation . As a nation , we have an obligation to this troop . Their actions that day went largely unnoticed for decades until their old captain , John Poindexter , realized that their service had been overlooked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so he spent years tracking down his troopers and gathering their stories , filing reports , fighting for the Silver Stars and Bronze Stars they deserved and bringing us to this day . <p> Thank you , John . <p> We have an obligation to all who served in the jungles of Vietnam . Our Vietnam vets answered their countrys call and served with honor . But one of the saddest episodes in American history was the fact that these vets were often shunned and neglected , even demonized when they came home . That was a national disgrace . And on days such as this , we resolve to never let it happen again . <p> Many of our Vietnam vets put away their medals , rarely spoke of their service and moved on . They started families and careers . Some rose through the ranks , like the decorated Vietnam veteran that I rely on every day , my National Security Advisor , Jim Jones . <p> Indeed , Im told that today is the first time in 39 years that many from Alpha Troop have pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you still carry the shrapnel and the scars of that day . All of you carry the memories . And so I say , its never too late , we can never say it enough . To you and all those who served in Vietnam , we thank you . We honor your service . And America is forever grateful . <p> Today also reminds us of our obligations to all our veterans , whether they took off the uniform decades ago or days ago to make sure that they and their families receive the respect they deserve , and the health care and treatment they need , the benefits they have earned and all the opportunities to live out their dreams . <p> And finally , if that day in the jungle , if that war long ago , teaches us anything , then surely it is this . If we send our men and women in uniform into harms way , then it must be only when it is absolutely necessary . And when we do , we must back them up with the strategy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <p> This includes always showing our troops the respect and dignity they deserve , whether one agrees with the mission or not . For if this troop and our men and women in uniform can come together from so many different backgrounds and beliefs to serve together , and to succeed together , then so can we . So can America . <p> I can not imagine a more fitting tribute to these men , who fought in what came to be called The Anonymous Battle . Troopers , you are not anonymous anymore . And with Americas overdue recognition also comes responsibility our responsibility as citizens and as a nation , to always remain worthy of your service . <p> God bless Alpha Troop and the 11th Armored Cavalry . God bless all those who wear this nations uniform . And God bless the United States of America . <p> As a fellow Blackhorse troop for 5 years , I want to add a resounding " ALLONS ! ! " to A-1/11 . <p> In July of 2009 , I joined the members of the 2nd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold joined me , as he had never attended a reunion .

It was my Brother who carried the radio , who called for the assistance of Alpha Co . What the President does not mention was that of the 100 men , only 14 men survived that Ambush . I am very proud of my brother and his bravery . My brother was twice awarded the silver star and still today he carries shrapnel in his body . Welcome home to all you and God Bless . <p> A belated " Thank You " to all members of A-1/11 . C.J. Thanks for posting this . 40 Years have come and gone .

Like the Pledge of Allegiance , every single Soldier officer and enlisted took an help me God . " <p> In the Army , we recognize that loyalty is the thread that binds our actions together , defines our commitment to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It describes our commitment to our family members and the families of our troops . It enjoins us to our communities and citizenry . It also demands a commitment to ourselves as individuals and members of a greater team . Its a two way commitment of both leaders and the led . <p> Its easy for troops to display loyalty to their leaders . Often , they have no choice . We are in a profession that demands loyalty to ensure success on the battlefield and preparing for it . However , loyalty does n't  mean being a " yes man . " There is a delicate balancing act that must be undertaken to ensure that , for example , a Soldiers loyalty to his supervisors does n't  contradict his loyalty to the Constitution . This is why Soldiers are allowed to disobey unlawful orders . <p> When it comes to loyalty , most troops will do anything for the Army . For example , when my unit wanted to create new shirts I leveraged my contacts and asked a good friend and artist if he would create our design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a design was approved . I personally forked over $400 to pay for the second print run of the shirts to be made for the unit . As the shirts were purchased by the troops , I was largely paid back . I 'm probably still in the hole about $100 , but the pride I see when troops are sporting them during PT or off duty makes it easy to forget . <p> Soldiers display their loyalty every day trying to make missions happen . A detail may be tasked to perform area beautification ( read : mow the lawn ) and not be given the tools to " make it happen . " Soldiers will grab their personal equipment from home weedeaters , edgers , mowers , and fuel for them all . Its a rare day that Ive seen a unit with the equipment on hand for these tasks , but loyalty pushes these troops complete the mission . <p> Where I think loyalty is more frequently lacking is the supervisor to subordinate realm . There is sort of an unwritten rule that leaders are always righteven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of action to a leaders decision and the leader ignores it , the Soldier will do what he is told as long as it is ethically , morally , and legally accommodating . <p> Unfortunately , there are leaders that lack the moral fortitude to stand up for their troops when a leaders decision is adversely affecting the Soldiers life , career , or mission . Sometimes the pressure put on leaders trying to stand up for their subordinates causes them to cave or lose principle . They quickly join the pack and pile on the Soldier even when they know he is right . Those leaders that refuse to bend on principle and remain loyal to their troops and fall on the sword on their behalf are marginalized . At that point , the Soldier is forced to rely on other Army Values I 'll discuss later duty , personal courage and selfless service . Standing up to injustices by leaders and subordinates demonstrates a loyalty to the organization as a whole . <p> Thankfully , there are n't  many leaders Ive met that fit into that category . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . They have displayed these loyal qualities of following the orders of their supervisors while ensuring the care of their subordinates . 99% of the time , there is no dilemma . Usually , those in the 1% are eventually removed from the Army for toxic leadership . About 1% of that 1% continue on with the support of those like them and are corrupted by the process . In a way , its good in that younger leaders are able to identify what bad leadership looks like and avoid it in themselves as they move up the ranks . I have had those leaders throughout my career , but they were only small stains on an oversized tablecloth of good leaders . <p> Loyalty is accomplishing the mission to the best of your ability even when you dislike your leaders and your unit . I firmly believe there is no such thing as a bad unit ; only bad leadership . I always look at it as a challenge to make that unit a better one through my example of mentorship and mission accomplishment . I tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my troops about leaders or the unit . I remind them that pain is temporary . If you wait until the pain goes away , it wo n't hurt any more . <p> For me , every day I wake up is a new day . My frustrations lead a Cinderella life they all go away at midnight . Tomorrow is a fresh start with the hopes that those who have problems with me will wake up the same way and see their own mistakes and attempt to turn from them . <p> Loyalty is speaking up when you see something you know is wrong . Soldiers make mistakes ; some do so intentionally . Few are done in complete hiding from others . So , Soldiers need to be aware of and use the tools available to them to correct those actions that violate our values . <p> Most likely , you 've seen the stories that have surfaced of Soldiers posing with the body parts of a suicide bomber . The ensuing public outrage could have been prevented had just one of those Soldiers been loyal to the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it on the spot . We all know the rules about taking photos of enemy bodies for personal use . Because no one stood up and corrected these actions , our troops face the consternation of those that believe these are the values we espouse . <p> Besides being the convenient first letter of our Army Values acronym , loyalty is the mustard seed from which a just and honorable career is planted . My father always told me that as long as you 're doing the right thing , you 'll never have anything to worry about . You may piss off people along the way and it going may get rough , but in the end you 'll be the last one holding your head high . <p> The views expressed in this post are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official views or opinions of any branch of government or military unit . <p> Ih short , my own career observations have been this : . that it is easy to be loyal to the people that you like , giving them your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the true test of character is being loyal to those that you do n't  like for some reason or have nothing in common with , to equally give them your best not because they deserve it or have earned it , but simply because they are on your team , in this moment , at this place . <p> I have met too many of the former , and too few of the latter . <p> But everyday brings opportunities to demonstrate for others what LOYALTY really means by your own example an instantaneous choice you make to give others your best no matter the personal cost , or to give others just the minimum effort because they are not as important as youself . <p> If you ever want to measure loyalty in others , just sit back and observe who they offer their time to most , who they help the most , and who they teach and counsel the most . <p> Wow , CJ . I love your examples . I especially love what you say at the end , " Loyalty is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted . " <p> Your insight as an NCO is the real deal . As you say , loyalty is the starting point for all other Army values . This " code " which basic trainees learn is a springboard for great soldiers . I am looking forward to what you say about the other values .

@@96509609 @709609/ <p> In 2004 the Federal Assault Weapons Ban ( AWB ) enacted in 1994 reached its sunset date and expired without being renewed at the behest of the NRA , and it was curious why an organization that boasted their advocacy for firearm safety and hunting was adamantly opposed to banning weapons created for the battlefield and not duck hunting or home protection . Since then , the NRA actively promoted assault-style weapon ownership and spent no small sum of money paying congressional representatives for their votes to oppose any gun safety laws the NRA considered a direct assault on the United States Constitution Republicans are loathe to acknowledge as the law of the land . Throughout the NRA 's lobbying efforts to arm every man , woman , and child in America , reasonable Americans wondered if the NRA had an extrinsic reason for pushing the proliferation of assault weapons in the population , and if they were concealing a different intent from their stated reasons of protecting the people 's right to defend their homes and shoot birds . <p> First of all , when author Rmuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AWB he is being ignorant and short-sighted . The fact is that the majority of NRA MEMBERS wanted the AWB to expire as well as millions of non-NRA Americans that wanted to own these weapons . <p> The second ignorant statement about the NRA that I 'd like to clarify is the statement that the NRA is an organization dedicated to merely protecting duck hunting or home protection . That 's simply false and completely ignore the very founding of the organization . <p> The NRA was founded by Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate to improve the marksmanship of troops under their charge . In FACT , the primary goal of the association would be to " promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis , " according to a magazine editorial written by Church at the time . Please tell me where in there the NRAs stated goal was " duck hunting " or " home defense . " <p> The NRA is dedicated to preserving the 2A and right of Americans to defend themselves against all enemies , foreign and domestic . The NRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have at their disposal to defend themselves . However , the NRA is also interested in promoting shooting sports and gun safety . The NRA is a multi-faceted gun rights organization that does n't  focus on just one purpose , but in fact protects all lawful uses of firearms . They are a 360 degree organization that focuses first on safety and then the safe uses of firarms . The NRA is committed to training , education AND marksmanship . <p> The third ignorant statement made was that the NRA wants to " arm every man , woman and child in America " with so-called assault weapons ( for what its worth , AR does NOT stand for " assault rifle . " Its an abbreviation of the original rifle design by Armalite , but I digress . ) . The NRA is n't arming anyone with anything . They do host raffles and giveaways from time to time , but their purpose is n't to arm Americans , but to ensure that Americans can arm themselves . <p> Liberals believe in big government . The government exists , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to be told how to raise our children , what to eat , what medical care we should have , what kind of lightbulbs we should own , what kind of cars to drive , etc . The reason they are so opposed to certain types of semi-automatic defensive rifles is because they threaten their desire for nationalization of America under an umbrella central government . Liberal opposition to these guns is not about safety , its about control . If it were about safety , these liberal gun-grabbers would be screaming for less gun control , not more . <p> According to the National Post and based off the Pew Research Center , " gun-related homicides dropped from 18,253 in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011 . That 's a 39% reduction . " Its a 39% reduction at a time when the population has grown as have the number of guns purchased during that time .

Today , just trying to find one of the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and , then , at a significantly higher price . So , gun crime is down and guns in the possession of Americans is up . one can only conclude that the inverse of the liberal argument is true . <p> I understand that Politicus USA is an extremist liberal rag , but its important that when such idiocy is shared openly that it is immediately countered for the record . The NRA , as I mentioned previously , is not some nebulous , autonomous organization . It operates with the support and approval of over 5 million Americans and millions of additional , no-paying supporters . Their involvement in countering gun control laws increases and decreases as the attacks on the 2A increase and decrease . Right now , there are many in government that are trying to infringe upon the 2A and the NRA is working with equal fervor to counter those attacks .

It is not easy to get a PTSD diagnosis , that is the truth . When this same issue was brought up in the Veterans Administration , the government investigation showed that there was less then 1% actual fraud on PTSD diagnosis and service-connection compensation . When we do get that term put on our records as a service-connection , it is not a favor done for us .

Most veterans diagnosed with PTSD carry a 30% rating , not much to live on . <p> The system is overloaded not because of fraud which research shows is under 1% at the VA ; the problem is not veterans or soldiers trying to work the system . The problem is not taking care of our soldiers and veterans when they become symptomatic , its not taking them seriously when they get home .

I 'm not saying just suck it up and get on with life ; certainly that never worked for me , but without ever having had therapy ( and which I 'm better off for ) , I feel that I eventually came to a point where I can move past the pain in a positive direction , even while acknowledging it , and I know I 'll survive because I already have for the past two decades .

Are you saying that their parents should have swayed them otherwise ?

At my school , a political science professor felt the Marine Corps should be allowed to participate in the career day meeting that was being held on campus . However , the other professors as well as the University President did n't  feel that they should . <p> So , anyway , they told the professor that were he to collect enough names through a petition on campus , then the Marine Corps can participate .

He said the recruiters should be permanently banned from the campus . <p> One of the students who had planned to join the Marines a year prior but was too shy and nervous to be open about it , stood up to the professor and said they werent recruiters . Which , technically was an accurate statement . After all , those Marines came all the way from Camp Pendleton to give the presentation at our career day meeting , and they werent recruiters .

The good thing about this is , now he has more time to think about his final decision . In a year , if he still wants to serve , he may do so unopposed .

Also , military service today is much different than it was 10 or 20 years ago . Bushs foreign policy in Iraq has made the military an organization I would not encourage ANYONE to join . So far I have been successful in dissuading two of my nephews from joining the Marine Corps and a third nephew out of the Air Force . <p> Although I vehemently disagree with the state for interfering in this young mans life , he really should wait until he is at least 21 before deciding to become a Marine . <p> We are sad to hear that this young future soldier was not allowed to join the Marines.If that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own opinion about the war.Right or wrong , My Country first .

That person , party or entity gets blogged and the entire story goes viral on the Internet , causing the person or entity who is blogged about to lose pretty much everything , like our hero and pet , Jay Grodner . <p> I just sent my letter of " thank you " to Assemblyman Smyth . I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve in the miitary or not . The guardian of the young person should be making that decision whether they should sign for them , not some judge who does n't  have the interest of the child or the country at heart . <p> There is something is this story that just does n't  add up right . With the story as written , Assemblyman Smyth should stay out of it . Mr. Shawn Sage wants to live a life of discipline , but he is starting it with rebellion . This shows contradictions in motive . The Military has certain guidlines on such issues . This especially true with the " Military Occupational Specification " or sniper . They do n't  really want them before the age of consent . By the way the extra years will make him a better sniper .

The dazzle camouflage utilized in the first and second World Wars maybe making a comeback . Unless you 're a war history buff , you probably have never heard of the military term . <p> The maritime war paint was the brainchild of the artist Norman Wilkinson . While serving in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve , he was pondering what could possibly lessen the accuracy German submarines torpedoes . In the April of 1917 , German U-boats were sinking nearly eight British ships a day . In a light bulb moment , Wilkinson realized that the ships should be painted in a style that breaks up their forms in order to confuse the submarine officer . Indeed it does cause a certain amount of bewilderment . Dazzle camouflage generally consists of high-contrast colors ( like black and white ) and conflicting geometric patterns . See below for an example . <p> Concealment of ships while on the water is nearly impossible . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship , the smoke from the stacks would still be visible and would make it relatively easy for enemy forces to find it . The theory behind the good old " Razzle Dazzle " is that enemies would be unable to tell which direction and how fast the ship was journeying . <p> While the camouflage seems to be an unlikely design , visual rangefinders throughout the world cursed the patterns for making their jobs that much more difficult . At the time , they had to calculate the time and speed of the ship prior to firing the torpedo . They had to aim a little bit ahead of the target , so the torpedo would impact the ship at the appropriate moment . <p> Following testing , his plan was adopted by the British Admiralty . Wilkinson was placed in charge of a naval camouflage unit . He worked alongside dozens of artists and students to meticulously plan out these strategies . <p> Retired to her berth , the HMS Belfast is pictured in London . <p> After extensive testing of each design , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viability of the camo and the British Admiralty " concluded it had no effect on submarine attacks , but boosted crew- morale .

" - via- Wikipedia <p> However effective the dazzle camouflage was throughout the first World War , it was much less useful during World War II as the technologies and techniques of submarine gunners and especially aircraft advanced . <p> Although dazzle camouflage was used in both World War I and World War II , its was never scientifically proven . According to new research from the University of Bristol the dazzle camo is most effective when the object ( ship/vehicle ) are traveling at a high rate of speed .

That 's enough space to save the lives of those riding in the Land Rover . <p> While there are undoubtedly numerous field tests and experimenting still ahead for dazzle camouflage , do n't  be surprised if you see a photos of black and white zigzagged painted Humvees in the future .

Hunters have to compete with each other for game and , sometimes , there just are n't  enough trophies to go around . For outdoorsmen on a budget , hunting on public land may be their only option . Hey , the challenge may make the kill that much more meaningful though right ? <p> Of course owning land for the sole purpose of shooting game is the stuff hunters dreams are made of . Unfortunately , many folks would consider this to not be a viable option or- fiscally responsible . Sigh . For those who have a little pocket change but do n't  own a guesthouse , perhaps scoping out the leasing alternative is in order . <p> The Internet is chock-full of leasing networks . These sites can help you find land to lease , put land up for lease , sell land or even buy land .

Partly because I 'm a huge fan of Braveheart and partly because when we were sitting on the border of Kuwait prior to the US invasion , Gen. Wallace visited our Troop and gave an uber-motivating speech . I wish I had a voice recorder , because that thing would have gone down as one of the most famous battle speeches in history ! Landing and taking off in his helicopter topped the whole experience . <p> And six years later , Gen Wallace is still talking straight . He recently wrote an op-ed that I wanted to make sure you got to read : <p> The U.S. Army today faces an imminent and menacing threat to our national security . Failure to resolve this problem could leave us vulnerable and our enemies victorious . The threat ? The lack of fully qualified young people to serve in the military . <p> Many young Americans are willing to serve , but too little is made of the declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the real story and its a shocking one . Only 28 percent of the 17- to 24-year-old population qualifies to wear a military uniform . The other 72 percent fail to meet minimum standards on education , character and health . Of those eligible to serve , many choose not to for a variety of reasons . <p> Faced with these declining numbers , we have two choices : Lower the military admission standards or raise the health and education standards for our young people . As the commander responsible for recruiting , training and educating U.S. Army soldiers , I believe the choice is obvious : we must declare war on poor education , lack of fitness and poor health and help foster future generations of educated and healthy young Americans . Here is our plan . <p> Encourage education <p> First , we are working to create better educated young people . The Army has always been a vehicle for advancement . In past years , soldiers who served were sometimes given land grants . In todays Information Age , education is the greatest means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Initiatives like the Distributed Learning Education and Training Programs offer soldiers the chance to be in the classroom even while they prepare for the battlefield . <p> Still , we need to reach people at a younger age to encourage educational achievement . While still not optimized in some states , we continue to promote Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps and National Defense Cadet Corps programs . Participating students have higher attendance and greater graduation rates than their peers and are also exposed to 120 hours of physical activity and leadership assessment training . Because most of these kids will go on to careers outside the military , our society as a whole benefits as their discipline and determination will serve them and their country well beyond their high school years , regardless of career choice . <p> The Army is also investigating the opening of the first Army Preparatory School to help non-high school graduates get caught up on fitness while becoming academically eligible for the military . We are taking these simple steps because we believe they will have a profound impact on educating our nations youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working to create healthier young people . The military has always been a catalyst for health care . World War I stimulated efforts to improve nutrition and World War II led to the publication of nutritional information on products . Today , our health challenge with young people is n't lack of food but too much of it . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the number of overweight children tripled between 1963 and 1999 . With poor nutrition habits leading to spiraling health care costs due to high blood pressure , heart disease , cancer , diabetes and stroke , we all suffer . <p> The military ca n't win this war alone . It will take the effort of all Americans particularly those in government , business and education . By coming together to raise awareness about this issue , we can raise the bar for better education and better health . That will lead to a stronger and more capable military and a better America . <h> 2 Comments on " An Immanent and Menacing Threat to National Security " <p> Gee , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would think ( well , in my world anyway ) that they would have seen this problem and done something about it by now .

@@96509660 @709660/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> A Fobbits Life For Me <p> Fobbit . According to the Urban Dictionary , a " fobbit " is " a term used to describe soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan that rarely if ever leave the relative safety of the Forward Operating Base ( FOB ) . " <p> Image courtesy of Mark Baker . Used with permission . <p> Its sort of a joke among combat troops to describe those troops in support roles that are n't  involved in the actual , day to day combat seen in Iraq and Afghanistan . These Soldiers are typically mechanics , administration , and other combat support and combat service support troops . Sometimes , Soldiers are given these duties by virtue of their MOS and positions and sometimes Soldiers seek out these positions of safety . I would argue that the latter is very rare . <p> I 'm writing this to sort of help my readers understand why the " fobbit " perjoritive should n't be applied so liberally . I 've already mentioned that my role in Afghanistan could be easily placed within that label . I wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not consist of troops just shooting at the enemy . But , that is the " end result . " However , to get there it takes an army of " fobbits " to ensure that those troops even have the ability to shoot at the enemy . Someone has to issue the ammunition , track consumption , and order accordingly . That person is a " fobbit . " Without this fobbit , the Joe on the pointy end of the stick is n't shooting at anyone . <p> While Joe is out there shooting at the enemy , his family back home needs to keep paying his bills . There are certain benefits and entitlements that come with combat duty . Joe cant pay himself . He cant set up his combat pay , ensure his tax exclusion status , or set up allotments and family separation pay without the finance clerk . The finance clerk ensures that the Soldiers shooting the enemy does n't  have to worry about his finances AND the enemy . The finance clerk is a " fobbit . " Without this fobbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to liens and late payments fees . Without this " fobbit , " the Joe on emergency leave does n't  get pay advances . <p> When Joe is back on the FOB or out on a mission , he needs to be in top physical health . That includes having the energy that comes from a good meal ( " good " being a subjective term ) . For most people in combat these days , those meals are provided by contractors , but in some locations there are still Army cooks out there keeping the troops fed . The " cook " is a fobbit and without him , the Soldier could go hungry . <p> Before Joe goes out on a mission , he is given information that is collected from various sources . This information is analyzed , interpreted , and disseminated to the troops . This information provides the troops with enemy strengths , weaknesses , locations , historical data , biographical data , and anything else Joe needs to ensure he understands the nature of the threat . The people that collect this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOB . His Soldiers are " fobbits . " And without these fobbits , Joe would almost literally be going out to engage the enemy blind . While the information may not always be accurate , Joe would have something that may be close to reality than nothing at all . <p> Then , there are fobbits like me Soldiers responsible for all the other stuff that is required to prosecute the enemy . Someone needs to get these Soldiers in and out of theater . Someone needs to coordinate their mandatory theater training , provide temporary lodging , and link them up with their units . Someone needs to help them get to and from home on R&amp;R leave . Joe ca n't do that by himself . Someone has to assist in the unfortunate event that a Soldier is injured or killed . It is the FOBBIT that provided the Dignified Transfers of remains and bodies of these troops . <p> And let 's not forget the " fobbits " sitting on the radio in the TOC receiving the calls from the troops in contact and coordinating CAS and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never leave the FOB either . Yet , these are the fobbits that are responsible for sending additional units when the stuff hits the fan . These are the guys responding to RFIs when needed . When you need artillery support , a " fobbit " takes the call and get the appropriate clearances . <p> There is a lot more to a fobbit than meets the eye . And while we all enjoy poking fun at the fobbits even the fobbits themselves have fun with it remember to do it with respect ! Your life may depend on these troops . <h> 9 Comments on " A Fobbits Life For Me " <p> I 'm a firm believer that it takes everyone cooperation to get the job done . Being SOF you plan , resource and action your own mission and without finance , our mechanic or flight crew it will take a lot longer to get into country . <p> July 16 2009 , rocket/mortar attack kills three Soldiers at COB Basra , Iraq . Fobbits/REMFs die too . There are a lot of those with big mouths on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what your job . <p> I agree with C. J. However , and there is a however . There were so many FOBBITs ( as we called them in Vietnam REMF , use your imagination ) that had such a big mouth about how bad bad they had it there . OMG , I was shot at and mortered every night and had to kill so many VCs , but this soldier ( s ) never left the mess tent or orderly room , oh do n't  forget the PX managers and the club managers . Never even pulled guard duty much less fire a shot in anger . Now do n't  get me wrong ; Thanksgiving 66 , Outpost Oscar in the Central Highlands , A chopper came in with mermites and cooks from basecamp with turkey mashed potatoes and gravy . All class " B " rations , but was great , and these Cooks did not have to come with the food but they did . The same with the mechanics that had to go out get a brokedown at night with minimal protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big mouths should sit down and shut-up . I have seen it so many times . Remember , back then we only had three ribbons when you came back from Vietnam . Some would strut around showing off to their superiors , that had not gone yet . <p> I was a FOBBIT in Nam , along with thousands of others . In my case , I was a personnel clerk , then the battalion/group personnel staff NCO . As you pointed out , what we did back in base determined what the folks back home received to live on . We made sure promotions came when they were deserved and orders to go back home got issued . In my case , I was with an outfit that provided the beans and bullets the guys on the front lines needed to do their job . I will never put myself on the same level of those who jumped into filthy rice paddies or got into firefights with Charley or the Regulars but I served my time and did my job .

He is real good at what he does , the teams know he has their 6 .. even if he hates sitting in a chair .. he is there for them .

@@96509661 @709661/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Honor <p> Its the " H " in our " LDRSHIP " Army Values . Of all the Army values , its the probably the most difficult to define . It means honestly . It means integrity which is another Army Value in and of itself . I denotes respect . Its really an abstract concept . But , I think another concept contained within " honor " is fairness . <p> The military has become a totally PC force . Our nation has kept us so busy , that even minor distractions easily become major issues . Good leaders can recognize these minor distractions as the ankle biters they are and adjust their attention accordingly . <p> What boggles my mind is how quickly the military can turn on its own simply out of convenience . When I was at Redstone Arsenal and involved in a bitter , public dispute with the Huntsville City School system , I was literally told by the Garrison Command Sergeant Major , CSM Ricky Cooper , that they would " rather sacrifice their relationship with one Soldier than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a little bit sense . But , where is the honor in throwing a Soldier under the bus that has n't  done anything wrong except stand up to , along with 50 other parents , an out of control school system ? <p> I would actually argue that this statement was a strawman anyway . No one was asking the leadership to choose between " one Soldier and an entire community . " The honorable thing to do would have been to simply stay out of this legal dispute unless the Soldier was doing something illegal , immoral , or that violated regulations . <p> The leadership at the time threatened me with an Article 15 and I demanded a Court Martial . CID had cleared me , but the pressure from the school board to get me to back off was too great . Eventually , all the threats went away and I was told that I was being reassigned to get a fresh start . I was promised that this issue would n't follow me . The honorable thing to do would have been to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ahead to my new command and ruined my chances for an honest fresh start . I only know this because someone did the honorable thing of telling me it was done . I was told it would n't be held against me and that my actions would speak for themselves . I was put in charge of a travel and TDY program that was in severe disarray and turned it around . No one has been able to complain about my work ethic or professional results . I 'm frequently the last one to leave from the HQ each day . <p> Because I was NOT given a clean slate as promised , there was already an obviously pre-determined impression about me . So , when independent journalist and blogger Michael Yon used his active duty readers to comb through my AKO files for information about my unit ( something I 've NEVER publicly discussed or released ) and called my division command in June 2010 to complain that I was harassing him by email , members of my command found the allegations easy to digest having been tipped off already at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without asking my side of the story first , I got a nice little ass chewing about telling a civilian to " eff off . " To add to the hyprocrisy of being counseled for using a lack of professional language , every other word was the " f " word . When I was able to tell my side of the story , I went and printed out the entire email chain to show that Yon had actually contacted ME first with a wild accusation that I had created a fake Twitter account to ridicule him . I do n't  answer to Yon , so I told him where to go using , yes , colorful language . <p> Recently , I was accused of communicating a threat by the same individual . Not only that , but he also accused other people I 'd never met of being part of some fictitious " cult " I was supposedly the leader of . Yon defamed this other senior NCO for daring to speak out in support of me even though we never met . He then defamed a Captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with defaming MG Scaparotti . <p> So , the fact that Yon was busy attacking anyone in the military that stood in his way of a good story and a few Paypal donations , members of my command took the opportunity to once again chew my ass . I can take ass chewings . Its a part of Army life . There are all kinds of people that just do n't  feel good about themselves unless they 're shoving their rank or position in your face . <p> In my experience , there are two kinds of leaders that get stuff done in the Army . The first kind of leader is the one that you follow because you respect them so much you do n't  want to let them down . You will go the extra mile because you want them to look good and do n't  want to disappoint them . <p> The second kind of leader also gets stuff done , but the difference is that they lead with fear . You will do what youre supposed to do and accomplish the mission because the alternative is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell , use profanity , and will levy all sorts of threats to keep you in line . He/she will employ intimidation and throw UCMJ around like its going out of style . You can always tell this type because the most frequent charge is Article 134 . <p> Article 134 is the general article of the UCMJ , also known as the " catch-all . " Its what leaders will revert to when they want to get you on something , but ca n't pin anything on you . The most common charge is the first clause which covers " disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces . " Interestingly , this article also covers the charge of " indecent language " which seems to be the fallback of these types of leaders . <p> In a recent interview with the website Politico , Fuller characterized Afghan leaders as erratic , ungrateful and isolated from reality . The interview quotes him as saying Afghan leaders do n't  fully recognize Americas sacrifices on their countrys behalf . <p> Referring to Karzais recent assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war with the U.S. , Fuller was quoted as calling the comments " erratic , " adding , " Why do n't  you just poke me in the eye with a needle ! Youve got to be kidding me . I 'm sorry , we just gave you $11.6 billion and now you 're telling me , I do n't  really care ? " <p> Fuller said the Afghans have at times made unreasonable requests for U.S. assistance . <p> " You can teach a man how to fish , or you can give them a fish , " Fuller was quoted as saying . " Were giving them fish while they 're learning , and they want more fish ! ( They say , ) I like swordfish , how come you 're giving me cod ? Guess what ? Cods on the menu today . " <p> I do n't  think most people would disagree with these statements . Were donating billions of dollars in monetary and military aid to a country that would turn on us on a dime . Were over here building up a military force that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . <p> Last year , General McChrystal was fired for almost the same thing ; only he did n't  personally say anything at all . I know that some writers would like to take credit for the firing to add a few more duckets to their Paypal slush funds , but the truth is that political correctness killed this career . <p> But , I digress . <p> Where is the honor ? Where is the duty to accomplish one of the basic responsibilities of every NCO to provide for the welfare of their Soldiers . <p> When my friend , Brian Cowdrey , was killed a few weeks ago . I sent emails asking to attend his memorial and got no response . I sent emails to attend his ramp ceremony and got no response . No one called to specifically ask how I was doing as I was wrestling with the guilt of losing another friend with unfulfilled promises made to him . No one called to check on me as I dealt with unsubstantiated allegations of supposedly wanting to murder an unarmed civilian writer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made . I DID get a response when members in my command were asked about the allegations by someone of higher rank . I DO get responses when someone complains that I sent them an email that did n't  stroke their egos while I complained about either them not doing their jobs or their actions affecting my ability to do mine . Anything that can result in an ass-chewing is a PERFECT opportunity to engage in a conversation with me . Even doing what should come naturally to a senior NCO is a great time to engage in chest pumping and ass chewings . <p> The other day I sent an email to a select group of fellow First Sergeants and E9s . The subject matter of the email : a roll-up of Sergeant Major of the Armys briefing to troops while he was here in Afghanistan . It was n't anything private , close-hold , classified , or even out of the ordinary . It was the SMA talking to NCOs about stand by NCO stuff . I sent this roll-up to these individuals who were peers or superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't  send it to every peer ; just those that I wanted to engage in conversation with on the subject matter . No opinion was injected into the email , just a " here 's what he said " roll-up . <p> In response , I was basically told to shut up . " MSG Grisham .. STOP ! This is not you lane . " <p> In todays Army , a Master Sergeant is n't allowed to share information about the Senior NCO in the Army with his peers and seniors . Never mind that all this information is available through official sources within the military and in the media . Never mind that the SMAs visit took place WEEKS AGO and nothing has been disseminated in that time . <p> The second type of leader leads with intimidation . To the second type of leader , knowledge is power and sharing knowledge is viewed as a direct challenge to that power even when the intent is simply to share information . As a matter of fact , prior to receiving that response , I had already gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent able to hear it themselves . To this type of leader , there is only one trusted source with the capability to " digest " what the SMA said . Other senior NCOs are incapable of thinking for themselves and should be kept in the blind stovepipe of information from just one source . <p> The last time I checked , the Sergeant Major of the Army maintained a presence on Facebook and invites responses and input from EVERY Soldier in the Army . I 've even weighed in on his requests for changing the uniform . So , if its " not in my lane " to talk with fellow Senior NCOs about issues the SMA is addressing in a public forum , am I also not supposed to respond when the SMA himself asks , " Tell me Troops : what equipment is the Army procuring that they do n't  use ( leave in the Connex ) ?

@@96509665 @709665/ <h> Freedom To Display American Flag Act Passed <p> The act was conceived by Congressman Roscoe Bartlett , R-MD , in response to the many home-owners associations popping up across the country refusing to allow Americans to fly their flags on their own property . <p> U.S. House Majority Leader John Boehner ( R-OH ) said : " Every American should retain the right to display the American flag , the very symbol of freedom upon which our nation was founded . Rep. Bartlett should be commended for his leadership on this issue and his work to help preserve the core values of this great country . " <p> The bill states , " A condominium association , cooperative association , or residential real estate management association may not adopt or enforce any policy , or enter into any agreement , that would restrict or prevent a member of the association from displaying the flag of the United States on residential property within the association with respect to which such member has a separate ownership interest or a right to exclusive possession or use . " The bill specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , or manner of displaying the flag of the United States necessary to protect a substantial interest of the condominium association , cooperative association , or residential real estate management association . " <p> While I think this is going to be misinterpreted and still prevent Americans from flying their flags on a daily basis , I 'm glad the act was passed . There is no doubt that the bill will be signed into law . <h> 21 Comments on " Freedom To Display American Flag Act Passed " <p> Well hello , and i enjoyed reading everyones statements and had a blog myself for everyone to contemplate.I live behind a daycare center that has a bad habit of flying an american that is very in need of a sewing or simply a new one , and also flys at night without a light . The flag they fly is shredded beyond belief and they seem to not notice or care . I have asked them once before to take it down and they did at that moment , and have since returned the flag to its spot shredded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my part and feel that going to purchase them a flag is not my responsibility , yet it does bug me when i look off my back porch ; day or night , and see a shredded american flag alone in the dark . give me your feedback and let me know what may be a better approach to enlighten them on why they fly it in the first place . Thanks alot- Camille <p> A.M. , that 's something that the HOA COULD address with regard to flags . But to say that they CANT is wrong . There should be a rule that a flag that is torn , ripped , shredded , maimed , or otherwise disrespectfully presented will be replaced or removed . <p> I , too , get annoyed when I see flags flying on threads . As a matter of fact , I just noticed a small wear in my flag from it rubbing against the brick wall and took it down until I can get another one to replace it . This particular case did n't  involve a HUGE flag or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard myself . <p> I agree with the sentiment of displaying the flag , but at the same time I find many people misuse this right . How many times have you seen poorly displayed ( frayed , sun bleached etc ) flags . Then there are flags which are much too large for their setting . Does a gigantic flag say someone loves our country more than someone else ? Flag poles another pet peeve of mine . How many have you seen placed poorly as to take away from the area ? Oh I guess if they have an American Flag on it makes any location ok . Nope . I fought for the flag , love the flag AND display a clean fresh Stars and Stripes , but a measure of an American is not a flag . Respect for the flag begin with good citizenship and includes properly , tastefully displaying the flag . <p> I have no qurrel with people wanting to display the flag . I am not against the right to display flags either we need to keep in perspective about the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag . I do n't  like seeing car dealers displaying gigantic flags as a marketing ploy . I do n't  like seeing flags or parts of the flags in designer clothes or bandanas . Respect honor and *salute* our Grand Ole Flag ! <p> I 'm glad it passedbut it does not help everyone . Here in Franklin Tennessee in a development called Fieldstone Farms , the HOA has decided that there is a loophole in the law which allows them to tell the homeowners how , when and where they may fly the flag . I have been in a 5 year long battle with the HOA over a flagpole in front of my home . With the passage of the new law , I informed the HOA that I was going to replace the flagpole they forced down 4 years ago by threat of foreclosure on my house . They quickly notified me by way of a letter from their attorney that they would sue me if I put my flagpole with the American flag on back in my front yard . I do not have the financial means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited funds assessed from all the homeowners I would be sued with my own money . This law is a good thing but the HOAs across the country managed to get wording in it which continues to give them unlimited power over your freedom to fly the flag as YOU see fit . <p> Thank you to those who are fighting against the HOA and Condo Associations that frown upon American symbolizm . I was forced to not be able to fly a flag in my Rainflower community in Sparks , Maryland due to strong rules and regulations . I really did n't  have a choice on buying the place because I was forced to buy what I could afford . The neigbhorhood is forced to conform with rules that are anti-american . I appreciate all efforts in this matter . Americans can be proud of the flag once again ! ! ! ! <p> So now people who signed away their rights when they joined these associations want their rights back ? People should think about what they 're giving up BEFORE they give away any rights a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get them back . That is precisely why I would n't join an association , but what about those who want to honor the original contract ? Too bad for them ? <p> Its funny that this topic was put on . Since cj is gone right now , i have been reading his army times again . <p> Apparently there is a discussion going on about each state given the right to fly their nations flag at half mast at the states capitol when a soldier from their state dies . Some think it should be allowed at their governors discretion , others think that they should n't lower the national flag , just the states . Others say that the flags at the homes of each indiviual person should worry about that sort of thing and leave the state and national flags out of it . <p> I guess that 's more food for fodder about flags and when and how they should be flown . <p> Needless to say , they told me " no " . That 's a hard thing for a soldier to take . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , lots of land , and on Fathers Day , finally got my flag pole . My new , patriotic neighbors have ALL metioned how good it looks and a couple even have asked where I bought it . <p> God bless the land of the free ( in this case , Northern Utah ) . You can see a pic of my new flag pole at that blog site . <p> Good ! I just realized my husband brought our flag in ( we are going out of town ) , but I always have a smaller flag in the front window . We have a homeowners association here , but we do n't  have any of those stupid rules like what flowers you can and can not plant , etc.

If we want to , we can get in a car or grab a bus and drive downtown or to the nearest park , relax , and read a book .

We all owe the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are fighting in the war against terrorism our deepest appreciation and gratitude . <p> Move America Forward is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting our troops . To date they have shipped over 110 TONS of packages to the troops ! They will be heading to central post office facilities in Sacramento , California to have more packages sent to units serving in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan with delivery ensured for arrival by Thanksgiving .

All too often , I am asked , " how can I help ? " This is it . <p> If you 're able to help , go to their CAMPAIGN STORE and choose an option . You can support anywhere from one service member to an entire battalion ! ! If you cant afford $29 , click HERE and send what you can . <p> And please enjoy your Thanksgiving in freedom .

I was so angry because I had to take a semi cold shower to start my day . And as I grumbled , I remembered what one of my Marines had told me . Where he was , there were no showers . So they " washed " with the one bottle of water they were allotted for this purpose because they had to ration the water that only came when the trucks could get through . <p> How incredibly selfish of me to be angry that I did n't  have enough HOT water , when he was 7000 miles away and had so little to get himself clean with . Wet Ones are cool but they are n't  a substitute for the wonderful feeling that a shower gives you . <p> And then there is Thanksgiving and Christmas when I get to sit down to a feast with my family , of all the favorite homemade foods , hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they get some Mess hall facsimile of Thanksgiving or Christmas if they are lucky . If not , its spent at the COP , with an MRE , and they get to think about everyone they love at home and being with out them . <p> Support the people who protect the very things you take for granted every single day . Just the fact that you can say what you want on here is something you need to be on your knees for , asking God to protect THEM , for protecting you . But you should do more . There are tons of organizations available to support the troops . Find one and do SOMETHING . The magnet thing does n't  cut it . <p> I do n't  care about your politics , and neither do the guys and gals who protect you . Its about supporting THEM , for protecting YOU . Its not a Democrat or Republican thing , its a human being thing . So open your heart and show some love to the people who have pledged to give all they have , including their lives for you .

Of course , I agreed , but wanted to give CPL Ms tribute some time before I trumped it . The site where she was going to post this is down and I feel honored that she asked to have it shown here . Without further ado , I present Mindys 2,996 tribute to Kevin L. Bowser . <p> Finding the words to write a tribute about a person I have never met is not easy . I+GGve decided that I would write this as if I was writing about a loved one and write from my heart . <p> I remember where I was at and what I was doing on the morning of September 11th , 2001 . I was at work , drinking a cup of coffee and reading my email . Someone got a phone call around 9:00 to let us know that a plane had just crashed into the World Trade Center . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen , what happened to the pilot ? Was it mechanical ? Never did we think terrorism . We turned on the radio to see if we could get any information , and as we did the second plane hit . After that , it was complete chaos . Everyone was getting phone calls , most of them rumors and speculation . I remember that my boss was at a meeting in New Jersey and when he got back to the office he told us that he watched the second plane hit and it was so awful . We closed early that day ; it was obvious that no one was getting any work done . When I got home , I couldn+GGt stop watching coverage of the attacks . It was so hard to grasp the magnitude of what was happening . I remember crying as they showed people jumping from the towers because it was better than burning to death . The first time I heard an airplane after the attacks I felt sick to my stomach , it was a feeling that I+GGm sure most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since then , and whenever I see a plane flying low I always get an uneasy feeling . I+GGm not sure if that will ever go away . <p> Kevin L. Bowser was a 45-year-old Philadelphia native and an Eagles fan from the time he was 5 . He attended Kutztown University where he played football , with his twin brother , Kelvin . Kevin and Kelvin might have been twins , but they rarely used the likeness to their advantage except for when they were kids . They would sometimes pretend they were the other one when in trouble at school . After college Kevin returned to Philadelphia , got married and had 2 children . He commuted every day to New York where he worked for Marsh &amp; McLennans technology division , teaching brokers how to use their computer software . Just prior to the attacks , Kevin was able to secure financial backing by his company , for his brother+GGs community football team in Southwest Philadelphia . Kevin was a strict vegetarian and was well liked by many . <p> On the morning of September 11th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , getting ready for work , thinking about the things he had to get done that day . Maybe he was dreading going to work or maybe he was looking forward to helping someone learn something new . One thing is for sure , he didn+GGt know that as he left his house that morning it would be the last time he ever saw his wife or his children . He had no idea that something so evil was about to take place and he was going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . He didn+GGt think to kiss his wife passionately and tell her how much he loved her , or play with his kids for just a couple minutes longer and tell them both that Daddy loved them and always would . He went about his day as if it was just an ordinary Tuesday and in reality nothing could be further from the truth . <p> At 8:46:40 a.m. , American Airlines Flight 11 was deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center between the 93rd &amp; the 99th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . All on board ( 11 crew , 76 regular passengers , and 5 hijackers ) were killed . 1366 people were at or above the floors of impact in the North Tower . According to the Commission Report hundreds were killed instantly by the impact , the rest were trapped and died later . Marsh &amp; McLennan occupied floors 93-100 in the North Tower . <p> Since I was given the honor to write a tribute on Kevin , I+GGve wondered how I would have felt that morning if it were my husband at the World Trade Center and the same events had played out as I described above . My mind and my heart are unable to comprehend the hurt , anger and sheer terror that Kevin+GGs wife must have felt that morning . I+GGve tried to imagine how I would live without Mark , without him by my side every day . I can+GGt . Kevin did not deserve to die , he was just an ordinary guy , doing what he did every day . I think that+GGs what makes it so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; someone took his life from him . Kevin+GGs wife and family will forever have a hole in their hearts that can not be replaced . His wife has become a mother and a father to her children while trying to cope with the loss of her partner , her best friend , her other half . His twin brother has lost a piece of himself that only other twins would truly understand . His children have been denied a lifetime of memories with their father . How do you get past that ? I+GGm not sure you ever do , but you have to move on , you remember the good times and happy memories that nobody , not even evil , ugly terrorist can take from you . Kevin+GGs family will learn to cope but they will never recover . <p> Today , the 5th anniversary of September 11th , 2001 , I+GGm asking you to remember not only Kevin , but also the other 2,995 people that were killed in the worst terrorist attack ever to happen on US soil . Since these awful attacks , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference by joining the military . Of those 500,000 more than 2,600 have paid the ultimate price to ensure our safety and freedom that we take for granted every day .

For those of you that put your life on hold to help in New York after the attacks I say Thank You . For those of you who have put your life on the line in the War on Terrorism , I promise to continue to support you in any way I can and I pray for your safety every day .

The real perpetrators of 9/11 made a huge mistake in ID+GGing all of those passengers with DNA or other methods .

The first is that it lies smack dab between Vegas and LA . If you 're on I-15 northbound on Friday , the traffic is insufferable as all the weirdos in LA are trying to meet up with all the weirdos in Vegas . On Sundays , you have the exact same problem going southbound . here 's where my first reason comes into play . At some point , people drove up to Vegas to gamble , see the shows , get ripped off , or otherwise squander their hard-earned money . While there , they did n't  think about the return trip home and only realized about halfway home that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stuck in the middle of nowhere their only choice was to create a town . They named it Barstow . <p> The second reason ( again my opinion ) is the military presence . Barstow is host to three military installations : Fort Irwin , Marine Corps Logistics Base , and the Yermo Supply Depot . The military is the largest producer of jobs in San Bernardino County . It accounts the majority of employment in Barstow . The rest of the people work either for the Police force ( whose main purpose in life is to raise revenue through traffic enforcement , sometimes unethically ) , the fuel industry , or McDonalds.or they do n't  work at all . <p> Now , since I 'm so longwinded when I describe stuff , I completely forgot the point of this post . <p> Okay , now I remember . I just had to look at the title . <p> When it rains in the desert , the ground is so dry that the rain just sits on top of it , instead of soaking into the ground . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling one of those ramps you may use to launch a boat into a river . There is no going around it . You either attempt going through it or you go back home .

So , I cant make fun of that . But , I can make fun of our predicament ! <p> My kids love it when it rains there because I love driving through puddles . The more water I can get to fly over the top of the van , the better . Of course , to make that happen I have to be driving through some pretty deep water .

Being in the desert makes you appreciate those rainy days . The other great thing about the rain is the lakes . There in the desert we have lakes . They are n't  like lakes most of you are used to : they 're dry . I remember the last time I was stationed at Fort Irwin before I went to Iraq that we took our motorcycles out on the lakebed for a ride . It was in the middle of nowhere and I felt a strange feeling of freedom . Without giving away too many details , I 'll just say that its a mostly wonderful feeling driving across a dry lakebed in your birthday suit . Its when you hit the bumps that you begin to appreciate the invention of clothing , especially blue jeans . <p> Anyway , we actually have lakes now .

Here is his Google profile : <p> As you can clearly see , Mustafa claims to have been trained at the United States Army Infantry School . He was trained in close quarters combat , explosive ordinance disposal , and as an indirect fire infantryman .

Its quite the impressive resume . And its false ! <p> No one by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , which was taught at least partially at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama my former stomping grounds . However , my sources tell me that its possible he was just a washout from the course . Many washouts still claim that they were EOD even though they never earned the title or completed the training . <p> I then put in some RFIs for any information that PFC Mustafa Kazemi was even in the Army or went to the Army Infantry School based at Ft . Benning . After all , a very prominent photo journalist in Afghanistan has been writing some seemingly good stories based off the information this former Soldier was providing . No one could find any records of him even serving in the Army at all . <p> Having exhausted my leads based on his service , I decided to confront Kazemi directly and ask him to confirm or deny my findings . I asked him a very basic question : " When did you graduate EOD and where ? " Even an idiot could have made something up .

I recieved absolutely no document on the training inspite of insisting neither on employment . It was in 2005 . <p> Because of this I have stopped putting my experiece on Internet because if anyone would ask for document or proof , I have nothing and I will be trapped . <p> Any other questions , I 'm here . <p> I asked some follow up questions about the PFC rank and 11C MOS , which have gone unanswered .

@@96509682 @709682/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> AK vs . AR <p> Most people do n't  realize how accurate if handled and used properly the AK47 is . What makes the AK so dangerous is the muzzle velocity and size of the round using it . At just a 30% difference in accuracy , you get a rifle with the same rate of fire , at a nearly identical effective range , but for over half the price on average . And the weapon will seemingly last forever . That being said , I like my 30% greater accuracy and the AR is easier to customize . <p> When I was in Iraq , I was with 3/7 Cav and we tended to outrun our supply chain . There were times when 5.56 ammo was hard to come by . After one battle , I grabbed an AK from a guy I had killed since there was plenty of 7.62 ammo around . I quickly zeroed it and used it as a secondary weapon . It quickly became my primary weapon when I could n't get ammo for my AR .

He bought a pair of - Danner 8 ? Vandal GTX boots , which are black/brown . We started debating if there is a need to have a camouflage pattern on your boots . After hours of discussion ( and a few frosty beverages ) , we came up with an answer . <p> A point that Bruce brought up was that people spend tons of money to get top rate camouflage patterns like Crye Multicam only to cover a good portion of it with a hunter 's orange vest . So if you are spending all this money to buy gear decked out in camo just to have to put a big flag on your back , he does n't see the need to worry about your boots . <p> Now Bruce is mostly a still hunter .

@@96509689 @709689/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> MasterPiece Arms Protector Pistol ( A Review ) <p> This is my first gun review . I 'm not going to do this review like you read in the gun magazines or most websites . Sure , I 'll give all the technical specs at the end , but in my gun reviews , I 'm going to focus on what I think people really want to know . <p> Is it easy to shoot ? Is it expensive to shoot ? Is it fun to shoot ? Is it comfortable ? Does it clash with my shoes ? <p> The first review is of MasterPiece Arms new MPA380 Protector Series pistol . <p> Being a small .380 pistol , the first thing I wanted to do was test its concealability . The MPA380 is small enough to fit in just about any pocket or ankle holster undetected . I carried mine in my front pants pocket and even when sitting down , it only appeared to be a cell phone or set of keys . If you wear a suit jacket , the pistol fits conveniently in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place in most purses with its 4.4 inch length and barely 3 ? height . <p> Easily concealable ? YES . I actually do n't  think I 've seen a pistol much smaller than this one , even though my wife has a Taurus TCP . Which leads me to the one real downside I found . Because of the size of the pistol , big hands would find it difficult to shoot . My uncle has large hands and could barely fit his finger into the trigger guard . Additionally , the rear grip , right at the base of the pistol , has a sharp lip to it . After firing off about 20 rounds , I noticed that it was eating into my thumb . <p> Masterpiece Arms seems to have noticed this in the time it took to ship me the gun for testing . Theyve already modified newer versions of the pistol for greater grip confidence and trigger feel . The new Protector Grip Extension is an American made magazine floorplate made from durable composite that provides the shooter with a more comfortable grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protector models , as well as , the traditional flat magazine floorplate . With the new Grip Extension , MPA has also designed the magazine catch to manage the additional downward force required by the new grip extension . Another enhancement to the incredibly small and accurate Protector series is the Rev B Trigger made from stainless steel . The improved profile affords the shooter a smoother , more comfortable and controlled trigger pull . <p> So , in the end , it seems like they already knew what I was going to write . <p> The MPA does not have traditional sights , with a front sight post and dual rear sight posts which line up with the front . Instead , the MPA380 has a groove that runs down the length of the pistol . If all you see is the " u " shape of the site and no part of the barrel while aiming , the bullet will go where you point it . Of course , this pistol is n't exactly a pistol you 're going to be shooting at long distances . Pistols like this are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I was still fairly accurate at 30 feet away , at least hitting my human-sized target . Using the right ammo , that 's all you need to do in order to stop an attack . <p> The MPA380 IS fun to shoot . In the hands of a trained shooter , there is n't a lot of jumping around with each squeeze of the trigger , which is substantial . The trigger squeeze is both a positive and negative in my mind . I do n't  think Ive ever shot a pistol with such a long trigger squeeze . It may just be that I 'm not used to it . It threw me off as I expected the firing pin to spring earlier than it did . This is really only important for target shooting since shooters wo n't need to worry much about trigger squeeze when used in self defense . The plus side of a long trigger squeeze is that you wo n't accidentally shoot your junk off while its in your pocket . You pretty much have to WANT to shoot the pistol to fire it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking slow , well-aimed shots proves that the MPA380 is very accurate . I also squeezed out five rounds in quick succession ( the pistol holds six rounds plus one in the chamber ) and did n't  have trouble keeping it on target . While not as accurate , I would definitely feel sorry for anyone on the receiving end . <p> SRP for the MPA380 in black is $322.90 . MSRP for both with a stainless steel upper is $345.90 . The gun is heavier than most of its peers , but also more inexpensive at slightly more than 11 ounces . Without the new modifications mentioned earlier , I would n't take this pistol very often to the range . The rear guard digging into my hand is uncomfortable . However , for customers that have previously purchased Protector pistols and would like to receive the newest pistol enhancements , MasterPiece Arms is offering an Upgrade Kit for $20 that includes a new trigger , grip extension , the newly designed magazine catch and includes shipping . So , there you go . Problem solved . <p> Fun : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the wiser is always fun . Shooting something that looks like a squirt gun only adds to it.Concealable : The only thing more concealable would be one of those belt buckle guns.Expensive : The gun itself is quite affordable , but .380 ammo has been rising quite a bit recently . One box of 25 rounds of Hornady 380 Auto 90 Grain Critical Defense ammo cost me $26.95 at a gun show . A box of cheaper Winchester ball ammo costs about $18 . So , yes , its expensive to shoot . Comfortable : Not if you have big hands and not without the modifications mentioned above . Otherwise , the ergonomics of the grip fit perfectly in the hand.Clash : Offered in both all black or stainless steel , there 's an option available for all occasions . Yes , I know this is a stupid category . <h> 19 Comments on " MasterPiece Arms Protector Pistol ( A Review ) " <p> I 've got a newer MPA .45 Carbine and I love it . Its a reliable accurate brick of a gun that I 've put well over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my bed at night . <p> I never knew that MPA also put out this handy little gun and I really want one , but MPA has apparently stopped manufacturing them . Bummer . With how well they handled their MAC 10 clones and MAC 10 Carbines I was excited to try out one of their concealable pistols . <p> I picked up this MPA 380 protector 2 last week at a gun show . I thought I did enough research on it before buying , but I was wrong . My experience went from bad to worse . <p> First , when I got it home I found that the trigger and slide were locked up . I fixed this after finding a youtube video with similar problem . Apparently the pistol was dry fired with the clip out at the gun show . When this is done some internal pieces disengage with each other . Easy fix , but annoying to know this happens . Take grip apart and reconnect the pieces . After fixing issue , went to the range to test fire . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mag lock would not work . This was very disappointing since out of the 20 rounds I had 3 stove pipes and one ftf . I 've read about issues relating to weak grip , but assure you this was not the case . When I took the grip apart I found that the flat spring for the mag lock had slid out of position making the lock inoperative . I think this will be a reoccurring problem since the spring is just wedged behind a pin . I think the kick of the gun loosens up the spring and if turned sideways after use the spring will move out of position . <p> My final take on the Mpa protector 2 is that it is made with quality materials and feels sturdy and reliable . It still has issues that need to be fixed . I 'm hopeful because of the lifetime warranty and recent improvements that it will be addressed . I just wish this was resolved with the latest release . The materials are excellent quality but as with a new caddi or benz you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . <p> does the mpa , have the porting on the barrel or not and how does it affect the kick , also the website says and shows a 1911 type beaver tail . which i have not seen anywhere . i have sent email to their company with no response from the girl mentioned above <p> i am sorry my friend , the new mpa protector 2 does have a ported barrel , a beaver tail , and will be available with some aluminum new style grips . why do i know this , I HAVE ONE , and used it in my chl class last sunday , all of my shots except 5 were evenly dispersed center mass the size of a paper plate . 2 lower left abdomen , 3 just out at right shoulder joint . accuracy would have been better but the instructor liked rapid fire for some reason more than we needed <p> This is one sweet little SA 380 , it is not snappy and is pleasing to shoot from 3 , 10 , and 15 yards <p> @ between 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries , i am sixty with bad eyes , if i can do it you can . <p> the people at mpa , phil , darah , and brandon , are very gracious and helpful , this is a new and progressive company , THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE w e burk <p> I picked up my new stainless MPA 380 yesterday . I immediately put about 70 rounds through it before even cleaning it . First of all , the little gun was exactly what I was expecting.very small but built very well ! I 've heard a lot of negative comments about the mag release but did n't  find it to be an issue and pretty easy to use . I was expecting at least a few FTFs , but instead it perfectly fired off about 70 rounds including new winchester ammo , reloads , and Corbon hollow points . I 've also read comments about how tough it is on your hand . I do n't  get that . Granted , it is a tiny .380 and has some kick , but I shot 70 rounds with no problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 380 for $283 and couldnt be more pleased with it . I cant wait to put another 100+ rounds thru it to break it in good . I would recommend this little pistol to anyone wanting an affordable , small , well-built .380 pistol . <p> The 380 came back from Masterpiece with the hole in the ramp welded up and I think that they rounded the bottom of the slide off which appears important because this guy had an out of battery discharge before my pistol went back . <p> I tried to join GlockPost but they never confirmed my account so I was n't able to contact the fella with the blowup to see what the rounded slide looks like . At this point I do n't  have enough confidence in the pistol to carry it . <p> Appreciate your comments on the MPA 380 and look forward to getting mine . I came into the game right after MPA decided to revamp the MPA 380 Protector to the MPA 380 Protector II . The " II " will have the added beaver tail for additional slide blow back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II " and hopefully will have by year end . <p> My big question : why havent we heard anything from MPA i.e. , new pictures on their website , etc ? Not sure I follow the reasoning on this . On top of that , I have n't seen any new MPA 380 email streams from the talk forums for quite some time . Most of the information is old ( except for you write up thank you very much ) . Anyway , not sure if I 'm the only one wondering about this but we ( the public ) have literally heard nothing . <p> Just received the 380B through dealer . Ordered 250 rounds today , more than enough for break in . As with all new guns , I disassembled to get familiarised with the pistol , only taking the slide off as far as MPA instructions say . If you do not have good manual dexterity , leave this to your gunsmith , The barrel is fixed to the frame , I like that and the gun feels solid . Have been wanting a 380 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summertime carry that did not cost $800 . When the ammo comes I will do a break in session , am looking forward to this , who would n't ? I will come back and comment about the performance . Hopefully it will be a matter only a matter of time before a company makes some custom grips for these models . <p> I create custom grips in various forms of carbon fiber and Kevlar . Recently purchased some factory grips as a guide but really need someone who can send me some close-up photos of the frame of the gun ( without grips ) to see where I can fill in the thin hollow areas of the grips . It would be a big help if you or anyone else could shoot some detailed photos my way . My site is : http : //www.designergrips.com <p> I recently bought a Masterpiece Arms 380 and took it to the range yesterday .

Has anyone else had a problem ? I thought maybe my fingers are hitting the mag release but I looked at it at home and my fingers cant reach around to activate the button . I am thinking its the recoil that 's doing it . Looking at it , there is a leaf spring metal piece that keeps tension on the mag catch . I can see severe recoil causing it to move backwards and release the mag . <p> I am not using the extended mag piece . I like a flush bottom to the gun and have experienced mags being pulled out because of force applied by the last finger to the mag . <p> Please call or email MPA . It sounds like the issue is the mag catch . The fix is very easy . MPA could either send you a replacement mag catch or you could send in the weapon .

@@96509690 @709690/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Farm Life <p> I came across an absurd USA Today story from last week that I just could n't let pass without reacting to . From the very first lines I struggled to keep my jaw from dislodging from my face and falling to the dirt . <p> Summertime can mean danger for children on farms . <p> An 18-year-old Amish man died from oxygen deprivation and his 14-year-old brother was injured last month as they worked in a neighbors farm silo in Pennsylvania . Also last month , a Maryland man and his sons , 18 and 14 , died of asphyxiation while working in a farm manure pit . <p> The federal government and safety groups are working to build awareness of farm hazards after a Labor Department decision to withdraw regulations that would have restricted childrens work on farms . <p> The first thing that went through my mind is that EVERY day of the year can mean danger . Recently , one of my daughters classmates was killed in a traffic accident trying to cross an intersection . A little over a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 4-wheeler . <p> There is an effort out there to scare the general public a public that larger does n't  have the feintest clue about life outside the urban jungles that farms are these dangerous , child killing places . <p> I grew up working on my familys farm . We are a fairly large operation farming over 6,500 acres for various purposes . We raise thousands of head of free range , pasture cattle . We grow wheat , sorghum , hay , corn , and oats . We are wholesalers of grain seed for other farmers to plant their crops . <p> Because my dad was in the Navy the only time I was able to work on the farm was during the summer . Each summer , I would travel to Texas to help my uncles and Pawpaw and earn a little extra money . It was tough work , but it instilled a sense of discipline , drive , and work ethics I probably would n't have had otherwise . <p> It was also fun . <p> I learned to drive at a young age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Pawpaws lap and driving the little Massey-Ferguson or John Deere tractor through the fields rolling hay to dry . By 12 , I was driving pickup trucks with trailers full of that hay from the fields to the our storage lots . I also helped grind feed , immunize the cattle , and help deliver calves that were in distress . I ensured that the cattle had plenty of food and water in the pastures . I labored HOURS and HOURS in the pee patch plucking black-eyed peas from their bushes that we would later have to shuck . THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE WORSE THAN PICKING PEAS ! ! <p> It was n't easy work and it was n't as safe as working at McDonalds or Taco Bell working a cash register . One time , I was chased up a tree by a protective mother . My uncles got a good laugh at that one . Another time , I had my hand crushed by a bull that decided he no longer wanted me touching his horns . He pinned my hand between the fence and his horns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer was bailing and loading hay . In the 80s , we did n't  have the loaders that we have today that automatically stacked all the hay in neat stacks without ever touching a bail . I would either walk along a truck with a giant hay elevator ( essentially a ramp with spikes built into a chain that would grab the bales as we passed them and raise them to the bed of the truck ) or I would be in the truck taking the bales off the elevator and stacking them on the bed . Each bale weighed about 60 pounds and seemed to gain weight as the day wore on . <p> The media and some morons in Congress want you to believe that our kids are dying exponentially on our nations farms . These places are death traps and need to be regulated . No kid should have to work where death is certain and acceptable . <p> Reid Maki , director of social responsibility and fair labor standards for the National Consumers League , a non-profit economic and social-justice advocacy group , does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind when working their trade . According to the USA Today article , she thinks we simply need more " firm regulations . " This is the fix for all big government bureaucrats . <p> Her statements couldnt be further from the truth . My uncles and Pawpaw always emphasized safety . We wore gloves and other protective equipment . They always made sure I KNEW how to operate the equipment I was allowed to use and maintained vigilent oversight until they were comfortable . They always knew when I tried to cut corners . Because most of the these farms are family owned and run , the " child laborers " are generally sons , daughters and cousins . <p> Today , my 12 and 14 year old cousins work the farm the same way I did as a kid . My 18 and 20 year old cousins have doing it for years and now work full-time . Not a single person has ever been killed on our farm . No one has lost a finger , foot , or follical . Well , maybe we 've lost a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucrats , and " non-profits for social-justice " think they know better than we do about what farmlife is like . I would argue that were it not for our nations farms , many of these kids would n't know the first thing about survival or providing for a family . <p> I learned more than just how to toss a bale of hay . I learned how to keep the equipment functional by greasing important parts . I learned how to change tires on a rim . I learned how to weld . I learned how to use my hands . I learned how to barter and make connections with people . I learned the value of a dollar and the work it takes to earn it . I learned how to maintain the soil and replace nutrients used up during cultivation of crops . <p> When I retire from the military , I want to get back into farming . Not sure if my wife would allow that , but well see . I enjoy working the fields and making them usable year after year . If we allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms or impose cost-prohibitive regulations on farmers the entire country will suffer . <p> How many of the figure heads know the first thing about farming other than what theyve read in books or been taught in school ? They need to get real and recognize that we do everything possible to keep our kids safe while also teaching them valuable life lessons . I learned those lessons growing up and now my kids are too .

On top of having to deal with someone using her sons name to raise money for a personal project under the guise of " charity , " this mother now has to worry about going to court . <p> Ryan is claiming that Lance Corporal Phillip D. Vinnedges mother is harrassing him for demanding that he not use her sons name or image on his fliers . Zulls lawyer is even trying to get Mrs. Vinnedge to agree to back off and stop exposing him in exchange for never using her sons name again .

They paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damning nature of these allegations and my inability to prove them , I wont list them here . My goal is simply to publicize the despicable actions of a man lying about who he is . <p> The Supreme Court ruled rightly in my opinion that the First Amendment protects citizens that lie about being in the military or receiving certain medals and commendations . However , that does n't  mean that we cant ridicule and expose these losers of society through public humiliation . If Ryan Zull does n't  want to come clean about his military history , well do it for him . To impersonate a member of the military and project an image that you 've accomplished something many troops have given their blood , sweat and tears to achieve is one of the lowest forms of perversion . <p> So , since the Stolen Valour Act is unconstitutional , its incumbent upon us to ensure these guys are n't  able to freely use the accomplish of our troops as their own . And I definitely wo n't allow such a dishonorable person to harrass a Gold Star Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , Mrs. Vinnedge goes to court and will need your support , prayers , and encouragement .

He has also filed for an Order of Protection against this Gold Star Mother , saying she caused him pain , slandered him , is harassing him and making false claims about him . He is blaming her for vandalism and harassment towards his family by others . <p> All she wants is for him to stop using the names of our military KIA 'S and making up identities for true Hero 's that have been killed protecting our freedom .

Take a close look at this photo . <p> On Zulls top row of the ribbons he s wearing here , he claims to have been awarded : The Navy/Marine Corps Medal , the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and what appears to be the Legion of Merit . It is nearly unheard of to earn the Legion of Merit with anything less than 20 years of service . But , even assuming he is entitled to this medal , he has the order of his top row incorrect . The Legion of Merit is two medals higher in the order of merit than the Navy/Marine Corps Medal . The Navy/Marine Corps Medal is on par with the Soldiers Medal in the Army . In order to earn that , one must have committed an extreme act of heroism not involving combat . Typically , it is awarded for actions involving the risk of ones own life .

They agree that the efforts by those to stigmatize the red crosses on MEDEVAC choppers is a non-issue . <p> In a recent letter to Senator Grassley posted on Michael Yons website , Secretary of the Army John McHugh confirmed what I 've been educating readers on all along that " Army MEDEVAC aircraft are manned with specially trained crewmembers and are uniquely equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " something that Pedros , Air Force and Marine CASEVAC choppers are NOT " uniquely equipped " to provide . <p> This issue started as an effort to arm MEDEVAC choppers , but the obvious realization that adding guns , ammo , and shooters to these assets would cause medical capabilities to suffer the conversation turned to a ridiculous argument that red crosses are looked at as some sort of homage to the Crusades or that they violated Geneva Conventions . Not sure which is more laughable . <p> The reason that the Air Force , Marines , British , and Army Special Operations Forces do not use the Red Crosses is because they do not have a dedicated MEDEVAC mission . This seems to constantly get lost in the translation as various people easily influenced by the gentle breeze of shifting winds of conspiracy contact Congress demanding answers to a riddle that 's already been solved . Or better yet , a riddle that did n't  need to be solved . <p> As Secretary McHugh rightly noted in his response to Senator Grassley , the truth is that these unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the appropriate level of care within one hour of receiving the MEDEVAC mission . " These choppers do not , as some would try to indicate , sit on the ground waiting for armed escort . As a matter of fact and something specifically pointed out by ISAF in response to this issue a few months ago even the mission that precipitated this irresponsible call to action did n't  wait on any armed escort . <p> Another misleading argument used by the crusaders trying to remove the red crosses from our MEDEVAC choppers is that such symbols are targeted by the enemy . Well , guess what . If the enemy targets our MEDEVAC choppers they are decimated by the accompanying Apache attack helicopter with its 30-millimeter chain gun , Hydra 70 rockets and hellfire missiles . Guess what else . These Apaches have 360 degree visibility of the surrounding area and a longer range than anything a Blackhawk MEDEVAC bird would be armed with . Any added defensive or offensive systems would only have a 90 degree effectiveness on each side and could hinder evacuations or cause additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire of enemy troops . <p> In reality , the vast majority of LZs for MEDEVAC birds are cleared by the time the chopper arrives . So the argument that every single MEDEVAC bird is somehow an enemy target is a farce . No one will argue that the enemy will target support assets , including medical personnel and equipment . But , the irresponsible suggestion that our MEDEVACs are under constant fire is simply inaccurate at best and an outright misrepresentation at worst . Even in the situation that precipitated this campaign to arm MEDEVACs and remove crosses , the LZ was completely secured with ABSOLUTELY ZERO direct fire enemy engagements . <p> No one is " passing the MEDEVAC " buck on this issue . The fact is that everyone except a select few individuals who are losing relevance are keeping this issue alive .

CJ sat in a helicopter once so in his mind that makes him more of an expert than you . In response to CJs earlier post about door gunners taking up space .

However , You do n't  need door gunners , on the Blackhawk they can mount pylons outside the aircraft with weapons controlled by the pilots . Just like on the UH-1C . <p> Unedited direct quotes from a letter from the Joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added by me ) : <p> " The Combined Joint Task Force ( CJTF ) 82 decision matrix on MEDEVAC asset allocation is similar to that of the previous battlespace owner , CJTF-10 , in that a dividing line exists whereby those missions falling to the west would be assigned to the MEDEVAC assets based at Forward Operating Base ( FOB ) Pasab and those falling to the east would be assigned to the assets based at Kandahar Air Field ( KAF ) . <p> Based on run-up times and distance from the appropriate MTFs , CJTF-82 determined that the MEDEVAC is the only appropriate asset for any Category A casualty found west of the dividing line ; Pedro , from KAF , will only be used for the much less urgent Category B ( if PEDRO is first up ) or Category C ( if Thunder is first up ) . Those casualties to the east of the dividing line will be assigned to MEDEVAC or PEDRO based on which unit is first up and which is second up ; the designation of which is alternated each Monday at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already in the air and can quickly divert to cover the mission ; however , if no flying asset is readily available due to mission necessity , an ESCORT will need to be requested from KAF . The latter is the least preferred as it will take more time to scramble the crew and " run up " the aircraft . <p> The incident in question involved a casualty at approximately 0450 on 18 September 2011 in the TF Spartan AOR in RC-South . Since the near entirety of TF Spartans battlespace is west of the dividing line , the appropriate aircraft for any CAT A casualty in this AO is a MEDEVAC . In this case , because the western LZ was considered high-risk the MEDEVAC required an armed escort . Because none of the airborne assets were able to leave their mission to provide coverage an AH-64 was requested from KAF . The crew was scrambled and the aircraft was " run up " and launched toward Pasab ; the MEDEVAC from Pasab then joined the ESCORT in the air as it approached the objective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ESCORT and the atypical situation where an ESCORT capable of diverting from its current mission could not be found . This circumstance delayed the MEDEVAC from departing Pasab and required an AH-64 ESCORT to be alerted from KAF . While it would appear that 32 minutes from the PECC notification to wheels up for the MEDEVAC is excessive , the delay was due to the need to confirm that none of the ESCORTs in the air were able to leave their present mission and then to notify an AH-64 crew to move out to their aircraft , run it up , and fly to meet the MEDEVAC . " <p> end of quotes <p> The reason why the Pasab based MEDEVAC could not launch was the escort it usually relies upon an unmarked , armed UH-60 ( not an Apache with chain guns and rockets ) that sits on the pad next to it at Pasab was unable to accompany the MEDEVAC the 2km to the LZ where SPC Clark lay waiting for evacuation . The PECC was forced to solicit an available chase copter. and finding none to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The MEDEVAC sat on the ground at Pasab for 32 minutes , then had a 13 minute flight to wheels down at the LZ ( to cover 2km ! ) which suggests a delay in meeting up with the Apache . Followed by a load up of SPC Clark and a 10 minute flight to KAF . <p> As noted above in the JCS letter , Pedro CASEVAC is authorized east of the dividing line to handle Class A casualties . So , the Blackhawk flown by Pedro units can sustain life for Class A casualties by the admission of the JCS themselves . <p> If arming the MEDEVACs is beyond the preference of some , then assign armed escort helicopters exclusively to the MEDEVAC units on a 1 to 1 ratio . <p> BTW some MEDEVAC pilots elsewhere state that a mass casualty situation can be called with as few as 3 wounded and then two MEDEVAC helicopters are dispatched . So , there is always some point where even if the helicopter has the physical space to carry more casualties , the medical crew ca n't attend to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint the whole helicopter white and put a red cross on it ? Like the Navy Hospital ships . That way it makes it really obvious it is a medical helicopter . <p> Barring that , they could put pylons on the Blackhawk. on the pylons the could mount miniguns and rockets which like on the Apache would be operated by the pilots in the front . I agree that mounting door guns would take up needed space in the medical bay and necessitate extra personnel to operate . Pylon mounted weapons would be out of the way and operated by pilots who are on on the aircraft anyway . <p> This conversation is so damn stupid ! The red cross on our choppers does n't  serve any purpose . Our enemy targets everything ! Just once , a dying soldier is waiting to be medevaced out while a medevac is waiting for an armed escort is one time too many and its already happened .

You make the Army look like dumb asses to keep supporting the unsupportable position of that 's the way we have always done it , so that 's they we will keep doing it . The Air Force can see the forest from the trees , what the hell is wrong with our Army that cant admit their wrong and implement the best option to do their job and save our best and bravest !

MEDEVACs are an entirely different class of Helicopter and I believe the Army has primary call on this . The USAF relies on the Army for MEDEVAC purposes as we rely on the USAF for CSAR if needed . <p> The Red Cross issue is a NON Issue as has been stated by those who know and not those of us who wish we knew . Furthermore your statement to arm the MEDEVAC helos has been debunked . Scroll up and read the earlier discussion on this particular matter . <p> Frisker even painting over the cross would not remove the requirement to have an armed escort . Short of actually arming the MEDEVAC , which has been proven to be a nonviable alternative , these helos will require an Armed Escort and guess what.the bad guys are not stupid . They will begin noticing how certain helos always have an Apache escort and thus they become a major target and due to no Red Cross being on the chopper they can shoot at it freely with no outcry over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead they can point to us being the bad guys for removing the Red Cross which is not something I would want to tell a soldiers family when that inevitable knock on the door came . <p> " Sir/Maam I regret to inform you that due to even greater ignorance and stupidity on the part of our government your son/daughter was killed when the MEDEVAC helicopter he/she was in was shot down because we painted over the Red Cross and thus made it a lumbering target for the bad guys . I am truly sorry for your loss Sir/Maam . " <p> I 'm wondering what skin a guy whose sign-on ends in " FTN " has in the game ? Why do you care so much ? <p> 1 ) Armament on medevacs takes up space better used for medical equipment . 2 ) They can , and often do , have armed escorts that have BETTER armament than could ever be put on a medevac . Longer range , better fields of fire , etc <p> You know what would make this issue go away ? If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more knowledge and responsibility on this issue than you , or I , have and just LET.IT.GO . <p> Its not changing , and you trying over and over to label it a " fetish " item is n't going to convince anyone that it need to . <p> You mention that the MEDEVACs do not have to wait for armed escort and say that there is no need to arm the MEDEVACs . Yet a paragraph later you say that if they get shot at the armed escorts will decimate the enemy . Which is it ? Either the MEDEVACs have weapons and can defend themselves or you are sending an unarmed asset into an area where they have no means of self defense and must rely on other , limited assets for protection . <p> Arming the MEDEVACs allows them to most definitely go in without need of an armed escort which would save time . It also releases the Apaches to fulfill missions elsewhere . <p> During my time in Afghanistan we performed a number of air assault missions . We did not have Apaches with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is that ? Oh that 's right . so they can defend themselves and accomplish the mission even without additional armed escorts . We also had requests for MEDEVAC not fulfilled because armed escorts were unavailable to bring the MEDEVAC in . So we ended up CASEVAC some 20km through the night along a route known for lots of IEDs . Brilliant . <p> Big Army has a problem . They want to play by rules no one else is playing by . So take the guns off all the UH-60s and CH-47s . They do n't  need them . They are primarily dedicated to just flying in to and dropping troops and supplies off . They do n't  need the self defense capabilities and can rely on the armed escorts to do the fighting . That is essentially Big Armys position on the matter . <p> Or you could just put the machine guns on the birds and they can go in unescorted and able to defend themselves . <p> F it . Its not like its Higher is the one sitting on the ground waiting for Dust Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said there is no need to arm MEDEVACs , meaning the actual MEDEVAC chopper . The armed escort is WHY there is no need to arm a medical chopper . You seem to lack the common sense necessary to fully engage in this conversation . There is a reason that UH-60s and CH-47s are armed . They perform COMBAT missions ! As someone who " performed a number of air assault missions " I truly hope you would understand that . <p> Not having to wait for an armed escort does not indicate the need to arm the MEDEVAC choppers Nevyan . The point is that the case being used for this incessant cry to arm MEDEVACs was because the MEDEVAC choppers could n't leave KAF sooner because they had to wait for their armed escort . This was n't the case . Oft times the Apaches will meet the MEDEVAC in flight because Apaches and MEDEVACs are not always at the same location . I somehow doubt your MEDEVAC request was denied due to lack of an armed escort . Most likely it was due to location and terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus forcing the personnel involved to shift location to a better area where the MEDEVAC could take place . <p> Once again please read my prior response to you Nevyan and tell me if you really think arming a MEDEVAC is the smart thing . <p> I agree BUT bullets flying and people dying is not the end of the story . This is a stressful world and the military have the most stressful jobs on the planet , at least according to our recent research . We 've conducted a research project on the Most Stressful and Least Stressful Jobs of 2012 and two of the top ten positions for Most Stressful Jobs are with the military . Specifically , both Soldiers and Generals are mentioned in the study . here 's the study : <p> Howdy shipmate ! ! ! How about this WIN-WIN for one and all on that there big green team ? <p> Instead of adding weapons , how about just painting over the red crosses to cover those cases where you yourself admit QUOTING BACK TO YOU " the small minority of LZs for MEDEVAC birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Compare your phrase as written " the vast majority of LZs for MEDEVAC birds are cleared by the time the chopper arrives " to what that phrase also means " the minority of LZs for MEDEVAC birds are not cleared by the time the chopper arrives . " <p> Some enlisted will see-through that you admitted not ALL LZs are cleared . Some enlisted will chuckle that you grudgingly admit the enemy will target the red cross . What purpose does the red-cross serve then ? Better targeting ? Some fetish for the good ole days in WWII Europe rather than the harsh reality of WWII Pacific Island hoping ? <p> Paint over the red-cross . Problem solved until peacetime ( coming soon to a national command authority near you ; - ) . Next conflict adapt a wait and see for a few weeks then decide whether or not to paint over again . <p> Its called combat . Bullets are going to fly and people are going to die . Whether there is a cross on it or not , if the enemy can shoot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban is n't just gon na say , " oh , there 's no cross on that chopper so we might as well leave . " Again , its a non-issue . <p> Why would you NOT arm them so they can shoot back ? If my medic in a Rifle Platoon/Company , who is primarily there to save lives , can be armed why not arm the choppers ? <p> People keep saying its not a big deal . Yet we are in a war where EVERYONE is getting shot at but only SOME of them have the means to shoot back . That is retarded . <p> We are not effectively using our limited resources by keeping the birds unarmed . We are requiring 2 armed escorts for every 1 MEDEVAC when we could just arm 1 MEDEVAC and the armed escorts can do any number of other missions which are just as important . <p> Say a MEDEVAC WITHOUT weapons can carry 8 wounded . Thats 8 people on their way to the best Medical treatment available in theatre . OK so now you arm that same MEDEVAC with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use them and the personnel to man them . Guess what Nevyan this drops the capacity for that MEDEVAC from 8 wounded to 4 . That means the other 4 are still waiting to be taken to the facility for treatment . Not only that but you limit the medical capability by limiting the amount of gear the personnel can carry and use to treat , enroute , those same wounded as well as doubling the number of MEDEVAC helos needed thus doubling the available targets the bad guys can shoot at . <p> I will clear this mud up . 1st , MEDEVAC aircraft can only carry at most 6 patients . 2nd the single medic can only really car for 2 at most during flight . The Geneva Conventions DOES NOT protect MEDEVAC aircraft from being shot at , read Article 39 pf the second convention . " Do you think we inform the enemy of when we will fly ? " The weight is not that much , about 50 lbs for guns and ammo . It is about politics and maintaining the traditions of MEDEVAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and space for weapons/ammo . Your comment does NOT clear up any mud , but evades the reality . <p> This post is my personal opinion and not representative of the Army , the Department of Defense , The United States Government , the 82nd Airborne Division , the 3rd Infantry Division , III Corps , the 101st Airborne Division , the 504th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade , the 511th MI Company , the School of the Americas , ISAF , RC(S) , RC(E) , RC(N) , RC(W) , CENTCOM , TRADOC , FORSCOM , Recruiting Command , The United States Marine Corps , the United States Air Force , the United States Navy , The United States Coast Guard , The Boy Scouts of America , the Department of Education , or any other unit , department , office , Section , squad , platoon , company battalion , brigade , division , Corps , any branch of service , rank , MOS , or any other segment of official military or government , real or imagined . <p> Anyway from what your article stated and from what your reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where you come out and say words to the effect that the MEDEVAC Red Cross " targeting aid " serves no useful purpose to the Good Guys . <p> You are close to admitting that the Red Cross " targeting aid " might ( notice the use of the word " might " ) serve an occasionally ( notice the use of the word " occasionally " ) useful purpose to the enemy . You will recall that you basically admitted that occasionally a minority of LZs for MEDEVAC birds are NOT cleared by the time the chopper arrives . <p> Obviously that Red Cross fetish symbol is not terribly useful to us ( good guys ) . Might be useful to the enemy ( you know the bad guys ) . <p> That being said , seems like the quickest way to put the issue in the rack is to paint over the MEDEVAC Red Cross " targeting aids " . <p> Then quicker than announcing " Liberty Call " over a gators 1MC circuit creates an absence of ground pounders , yall with a fetish for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least until yall are back in Europe ( re ) fighting the German Army instead of the Japanese , Norks , or Chicoms where the Corps did the heavy lifting . <p> To use your reasoning removing the Red Cross would thus mean that the helo is less likely to come under fire when in fact that would n't be the case . CH-47s are flying boxcars and yet the enemy knows these boxcars carry combat troops thus they come under fire and on occasion are shot down . The fact of the matter is that with or without a Red Cross the helos are prime targets due to the fact that they are large and noisy . The cross does not make them anymore of a target than without it only matters on the " bravery " of the bad guy as to whether or not he/she wishes to attract the attention of an angry Apache driver and his gunner . <p> MSG Grisham makes the statement that not all LZs are cleared of enemy for no other reason than its the truth . Stating that EVERY LZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lie since even one bad guy with an AK47 popping off rounds would indicate that the LZ is not cleared . <p> The fact that you need to stoop to diminutives renders any argument you make no more influential or worth paying attention to than a 6 year old stomping their foot on the playground . And it pretty much tells us where your home " stomping ground " is and the caliber of your fellow cronies . Please return to it . The grownups are talking . 
@@96509694 @709694/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Is The Army Bi-Polar ? <p> In the summer of 2008 , Sergeant Major of the Army , Kenneth O. Preston , announced at the Association of the United States Army convention that we were transitioning to a new service uniform also known as the Class A and B uniforms . At the time , the Army had no less than three different dress uniforms each with varying regulations on the wear and appearance of awards and accouterments . <p> The old green uniform vs. the new blue one . <p> For my part , I was happy with the changes . There were some minor issues I had with it , but overall I was all in for ditching the ugly green uniform for the more professional and historical-based ASU . So , it was a little surprising to see the following in my mail box after just four years of wearing a uniform that has n't  even survived to its wearout date yet : <p> In an effort headed up by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command , a survey site has been developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uniform ( ASU ) . This survey is for all Soldiers ( Active Duty , Guard , and Reserve ) and you must have AKO access to participate . <p> The ASU survey is part of the Armys effort to solicit continuous feedback on the equipment it provides to the Soldier . The feedback gathered by the survey will be used to determine possible adjustments or improvements that can be made to the ASU . <p> The survey was largely about the placement of patches and combat insignia , but also about the button-up shirt worn under the jacket or as part of the Class B uniform . <p> I personally do n't  have any problem with the white shirt , but I cant stand the gray shirt . The options presented to Soldiers taking the survey include four different shirts white , gray , tan , and khaki . I 've always been partial to the old WWII style dress uniform with the tan shirt . I 'm also a fan of the Roosevelt jacket . <p> The Army expended a lot of energy and money researching and creating the uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep changing it . Were losing the historical nature of our uniform by constantly tooling with it . With sequestration upon us , the military is facing a budgetary scalpel . Yet , we are worried about changing our uniformagain . <p> But , I think there are some changes that wont incur major costs in the long run . In fact , they would probably save troops money . <p> * get rid of the Combat Service Identification Badge ( CSIB ) that is pinned to the pocket and allow troops to sew on the full color combat patch on their right sleeve . * do away with the regimental crest and transition the CSIB into a smaller , unit-issued badge in its place . This prevents the need for sewing on unit patches on the left sleeve , ruining the uniform . * bring back the gold service braids used on the old Dress Blues to denote years in service . Those were classy and eye-catching , especially seeing senior NCOs and officers with over 20 years of service . <p> Other than that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing the CSIB , this allows drill sergeants to retain the historical location of their respective badges . <p> There is also talk again of adopting a new camouflage pattern to replace the much maligned ACU . We went to the ACU to get rid of the need for a Battle Dress Uniform and Desert Combat Uniform . Yet , here we are , ten years later with an ACU and OCP ( Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern yeah , an acronym within an acronym ) . I loved the BDUs and the ACU . They worked . But , since transitioning to the ACU , we 've allowed so many other countries to use the BDU and DCU patterns we can never go back to them for fear of fratricide and confusion on the battlefield . So , I say just adopt the two Marine Corps patterns and be done with it ( removing the eagle , globe and anchor , of course ) . <p> Acronym guide for the layperson : <p> Class A uniform dress uniform that includes jacket with all ribbons and accouterments.Class B uniform dress uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or without a tie ( long sleeve shirts always require tie ) ASU Army Service Uniform ; basically the Armys dress uniformCSIB Combat Service Identification BadgeACU Army Combat Uniform ; the grayish-green camouflage uniform worn 99% of the timeBDU Battle Dress Uniform ; the green , black , and brown camouflage pattern used until early 2000sDCU Desert Combat Uniform ; the tan , brown , and light green camouflage pattern used in desert environmentsOCP Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern ; the current camouflage uniform being worn only in AfghanistanNCO Non-commissioned officer ; " sergeants " <h> 5 Comments on " Is The Army Bi-Polar ? " <p> I always wanted to see a sewn on cloth belt like the old Pinks and Greens on the ASU . Put belt loops on it and it keeps your ceremonial belt from falling down . Dark blue trousers for Pentagon types who wear the ASU everyday . Love the khaki shirt . Would look good with the ASU B ( with dark blue trousers ) . Maybe the white shirt will grow on me in time . My two cents . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to the patches on the ASU . The patches should be handled the same as the Class A. The tabs as well . I do n't  care for the white shirt while in Bs . As far as combat uniform ; I am all in favor of ditching the terrible ACU ( not the brown boats ) but I do n't  see why we cant just go with the Multicam pattern from OEF full time . It works and looks good . <p> Roger that SMG . As an old soldier from the era of the Khaki ( B ) and poplin shirt to the Green and now the ASU , i shake my head . i also went from OD green fatigues ( with the gig line ) to BDUs , DCUs , ACUs , and just a while back OCPs. i 'm tired . and about to be REtired , but i love the army .

@@96509695 @709695/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> The Hypocrisy of Michael Yon <p> I 've remained silent on this blog and in correspondence with the disgraced and dishonorable blogger Michael Yon long enough . It seems Michael is a pro at leveling baseless accusations using fake " sources " , but when it comes to having to answer any questions himself his former Special Forces skin is n't quite thick enough for the heat . He constantly states that I 've been ordered by a doctor not to have guns without providing proof of this ( this is the first I 've surely heard of it ) . And even if it were true , that means that someone is breaking the law sharing this information and Michael is breaking the law publicizing it . It would be protected medical information based on HIPPA . He claims I have " harassed and damaged a large number of people " without saying who and what . <p> Over the past two years I 've ignored this man as he incessantly and relentlessly tried to affect my career in any manner he could . He has used FOUO information contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even posted satellite images of my home causing my family to fear the intent behind such actions ( yes , I have screenshots of all this ) . I have collected over 1,000 screenshots of his libelous and defamatory posts awaiting the moment he stepped foot in the United States to be served with a lawsuit . He has also sent me email after email taunting me and leveling accusations based on supposed " sources " or " tips " . <p> Since my trial , Michael has continued these attacks . Here is a screenshot of just some of these emails ( because I forwarded some of these emails to certain government agencies to preserve a record , I blocked those names out ) . <p> Well , after receiving " tips " and speaking to my own " sources " , I returned fire ( figuratively speaking I had to clarify that because Michael also likes to lie about being threatened and assaulted ) and decided to go ahead and just go to the root of these rumors instead of ignoring them . So , I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for him to respond to the allegations I 've been getting about his conduct . What 's good for the goose is good for the gander , right ? And being the Special Forces trained former Soldier he was ( prior to killing a man in anger in a bar fight ) , surely he can handle a little scrutiny that he demands of others . <p> Apparently not . Michael is good about lying about being assaulted in Afghanistan and refusing to put his allegations under oath . Michael is good about lying about being threatened in Afghanistan and refusing to put his allegations under oath . Michael is good about leveling accusations against a miriad of individuals within and without the military without facts . Michael is good about claiming that people have lied about their service or achievements without providing proof . Michael is good about sending spies and moles into the courtroom to distort the reality of what transpired without having to answer for the inaccuracies , lies and blatant misrepresentations . He masks his libel and defamation by using words like " sources say " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . Instead of responding to these allegations or doing what I do ignore them Michael decides that this is something that Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno and my chain of command need to see . <p> Naturally , I did a reply all with these screenshots and volunteered to provide a CD-R of the hundreds of screenshots I have ( the file is too large to email ) . I literally have over 1500 emails that comprise emails he s sent me as well as all the comments he s left on my blog postings ( under his name and assumed names same IP addresses ) and Indiegogo fundraiser site . Keep in mind that the email in question was sent from my private email during my lunch break . <p> Yon also frequently states this : <p> Interestingly , he s never provided proof of this either . Its an easy claim to make . I could just as easily say Im being stalked by Britney Spears and it would sound just as absurd without proof . Show the proof , Michael , for ALL your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Yon " <p> You know what 's interesting ? He has followers like Phil McKreviss , who is apparently a Phoenix PD Inspector bashing CJ for " mental illness " , yet when you check Mr. McKreviss twitter https : **27;619;TOOLONG the guy is totally unhinged . <p> Again , what I do n't  understand is the idea that his followers do n't  see Mr. Yon for who he is . He s the one scamming people for simply perusing the Internet and posting updates on his blog . He never traveled to Syria or Turkey . He never accounted for his monies ( He s still a US citizen and required to pay taxes on his income ) . He killed a man by blindsiding him in a bar fight , was retained by the Army as a surplus Soldier , and yet he has the audacity to complain about Mr. Grisham . <p> Ive been living in Thailand for 13 years and Yon is over here cyber panhandling the locals out of their cash . He s constantly asking for donations from the locals via his facebook page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former minor media celebrity from the states . Funny thing is he s shilling for the side that is doing everything to undermine democracy . He flies down from the north . Takes a few photos . Waxes on and on about how great the protesters are then asks for donations so he can fly back up north to get his feet massaged . How in the fuck did this guy every get embedded ? <p> JJ made an interesting comment about Facebook , so I went to his Facebook and " quote mined " for some interesting comments . First , I want to make an observation . Do all his donors realize they 're just sending this man on a vacation on their dime ? From what I see he s passing the days sight seeing &amp; noshing in Istanbul ( if indeed , he s there I do n't  see any pics of him there Just pics that you could pull of the Internet ) . He s literally getting an all-expenses paid vacation to Turkey ! Talk about scams ! <p> * Coming from a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight " ( I read on the Internet Michael Yon hit the guy when he was n't looking , causing him to fall and hit his head on a table . ) Anyway , recruiting is at an all-time high . So , no . Its not . Not at all . Seems like some weird wish fulfillment on his part , though . <p> " This encapsulates most of what is wrong with the Army today . I no longer recommend young people to join , and that is sad for me . " In response to a question why the Army has n't  booted MSG Grisham , yet <p> * This is an odd position coming from someone who killed a man in a drunken bar " fight " , yet was n't kicked out himself . The hypocrisy is stunning . Could it be Mr. Yon is simply bitter because MSG Grisham highlighted his OPSEC violations possibly leading to his dis-embed from Army units ? You know What a Counterintelligence NCO has the responsibility to do .. Eliminate the intelligence gathering efforts of the enemy , which were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his OPSEC violations ? Weird that people do n't  see that clearly for what it is . <p> " He is a convicted criminal whose life is crumbling before his eyes . The problem is the US Army who finds this acceptable for senior NCOs . In 2012 an Army doctor advised he should not have military weapons . " In response to a poster wondering if MSG Grishams private emails response was slander <p> * This is an odd statement regarding a Class B misdemeanor ( regarded as a nuisance by the government at best ) by a man who killed a drunk in a bar " fight " . Additionally , he has n't  substantiated the " doctors " claim , but he s still making it . Why not ? It appears Mr. Yon is comfortable with prevaricating . <p> While supposedly traveling to Turkey or Syria to do whatever he does ( besides sightseeing and eating food ? ) Mr. Yon posted : <p> " That is very sad , Ruth Cooperrider . I am sorry to read about it . Some good news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not catch , who is totally wild . " In response to wild dogs eating one of his cats <p> * Again , Mr. Yon is soliciting thousands of dollars in donations so he can travel , but from where I 'm at he s still in Thailand trying to catch those dang wild dogs ( unless he proves he s in Turkey You know With a simple picture ) ! But hey If people want to keep giving him money .. More power to Mr. Yon ( who totally is n't scamming his followers at all ) <p> Anyway . I could only scroll down a few pages on his Facebook profile . Its just comprised of nonsense updates from searching news services on the Internet . Anyone could do that , and make a few comments . I 'm not sure Mr. Yon the Milblogger ist going to be around for long . He s just not that interesting outside of picking a fight with MSG Grisham . Sure , he had a few good dispatches from Aghanistan , but he outed himself pretty quickly when he started criticizing policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  think the man is that bright , but he is clever enough to use the Internet to maintain his lifestyle . So weird that people give him money . I do n't  understand that . He s not insightful , and outside of posting updates of news feeds He s not really that creative , either . <p> Good luck , MSG Grisham . You made yourself a public figure , and I suppose this comes with the territory . Wishing you the best . <p> I went to his poorly written blog , and something struck me as odd . Is he even in Syria ? He claimed he was going there , but he has n't  provided any proof that he s there He s just posting updates that anyone can do surfing the internet . Has n't  he solicited monies to go to Syria to " tell the story that 's not being told " ? <p> These are questions Michael " Surplus Soldier who gets his feet massaged two hours a day " Yon needs to answer or he risks losing all credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that support a mentally unstable NCO that got removed from duty and did n't  complete his last tour overseas . and lied about his medal ( killing how many with a 9mm ? Give me a break ) . <p> I cant wait till you go to jail and get busted out of the Army for good . <p> As for accounting for money . Wheres all the money CJ has collected gone to ? <p> Why do you support the remorseless murderer Michael " I get my feet massaged two hours a day " Yon ? How can you support his slandering of BG Menard and Canadian troops while in theater ? Why do you support his multiple OPSEC violations , and his encouragement of Soldiers to do the same ? Why do n't  you denounce his almost killing a CSM who was engaged in hand-to-hand combat by stealing a Soldiers rifle and firing blindly into a building ? Please provide real proof he s actually in Turkey/Syria in addition to providing tax receipts for the monies he s managed to secure through his for-profit website . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seriously . <p> That was the end of a series , and if you are interested you can just put " Michael Yon " in the WOTN search thing , t here are separate columns with documented proof of everything CJ has mentioned above ( and more ) using YonClowns own words and actions . <p> Oh and as an add on to JJs list above : YonClown maligned the whole Canadian Forces in Tarnak and falsely accused them of dereliction of duty in the matter of a bridge All false , and all provable as false . <p> But as CJ clearly shows , YonClown has never let the truth get in the way of a *good* ( self-serving ) story <p> The Hypocrisies of Michael Yon in No Particular Order &amp; I Havent Even Bothered to Quote Mine His Facebook Page <p> Unhinged posts about General McChrystal ( claims of a " cover up " because he was disembedded followed by a threat to sue for libel ) Posted a Generals email address as retribution Disparaged Canadian troops serving in Afghanistan ( to include slandering BG Menard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bar fight He frequently embellishes his articles , and media posts ( its called lying ) Was assigned as surplus when Enlisted Sent MSG Grisham over 1500 harassing emails , to include accusing him of having an affair , pedophilia , and theft ( MSG Grisham is a long-time devout and practicing Mormon ) Contacted MSG Grishams chain of command multiple times attempting to get him fired Removed from multiple military embeds for violating their rules Has committed multiple OPSEC violations &amp; urged Soldiers to do the same While on embed he picked up a Soldiers weapon and fired it blindly into a shop where an Army CSM was engaged in hand-to-hand combat narrowly missing him Deletes any posts and blocks ip addresses of people who offer a contrarian point of view on his Facebook , website , or Twitter account Gets an Army 15-6 investigation initiated against MSG Grisham , but refuses to cooperate with the investigators ( thus establishing that he s only interested in harassment as retribution ) Often gets simple facts wrong about the military that could be learned with a quick Google search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was handcuffed at SEA-TAC for a verbal altercation with the authorities He himself said , " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear .

I got your back so long as I can hold a pen or pull a trigger . " Pull a trigger he said Accused the Medical Corps in Afghanistan of not wanting to give up its helicopters because senior officers want their own helicopters to shuttle them from here to there . An astoundingly ignorant statement . Has not accounted for the money donated to him ( tax evation , lack of expense reports , etc ) He has used Stolen Valor types as sources for his miblog articles ( Mustafa Kazemi for example ) <p> Michael Yon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him do n't  realize he s just making shit up as he goes along . Lol What a nut job , and how in the holy hell did the military allow this bag of steamed dicks to weasel his way into their units ? Crazy <p> Yon will return stateside sooner or later and will have to answer for his libel and slander . The gravy train will end as readers see through his charade . Its inevitable . I sense he is on his last hurrah . <p> Now that I 'm up to speed on Michael Yon ( it still irks me he deleted my responses on his web site ) , I 've noticed from perusing the Internet he does n't  have a good reputation within the military . Sure , he can get the odd Soldier to say something supportive here and there , but I would venture to guess most military types are very leery of this person , and are well aware of his lapses in judgement . <p> What I find downright scary is his relentless pursuit of you . If I were any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter " at all costs . You 're risking your career if you communicate with him . <p> Also , you make a good point that he demands accountability from you , but does n't  do the same himself . Im surprised his supporters do n't  recognize the hypocrisy and demand accountability from him . <p> I have been keeping up with your ridiculous case involving the tyrannical Temple PD , and I have also seen many of Yons nonsensical posts both on Facebook and his blog . As a quiet observer Ive seen some gusto from you , though justified and never out of line .. but from Yon , I have seen only outrageous unbacked allegations followed by personal , petty insults . I think its clear who the bigger man here is ( well , the only man ) , and I 'm sorry to hear that this has been going on for so long . I guess one can only remain silent for so long when enduring such horrific allegations and threats to ones career . Maybe you 'll get lucky and hell actually figure out how to cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blogger , he s a whiner . <p> Sandra , when he continues to contact my chain of command that has better things to do ( like train and fight ) , I cant keep quiet . While I have been able to prove that Yon has lied over and over again about his allegations , it puts a strain on our relationship because they tire of the constant barrage of idiocy and defamation .

@@96509699 @709699/ <p> The Army has released the following statement reference the MEDEVAC issue : <p> WASHINGTON ( Jan. 20 , 2012 ) " Recent news items about the use of Army medical evacuation , or MEDEVAC , helicopters in Afghanistan contain troubling information . The reporting suggests that putting red crosses on MEDEVACs , and not arming them somehow , is putting injured Soldiers lives at risk . The facts do not support these assertions for several reasons . <p> First , there is no evidence , implied or proven , that the enemy deliberately targets MEDEVAC helicopters , but we know from hard experience that the enemy does try to shoot down any and all U.S. and coalition aircraft . Further , all helicopters in Afghanistan fly in pairs as a force protection matter . Its the way we do business and to suggest that arming MEDEVAC aircraft would result in crews launching sooner is a dubious assertion . <p> Here are the facts : DOD has specifically tasked the Army , not any other service , to provide a standing MEDEVAC capability . The other services , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions . This is a critical distinction . CASEVAC stands for Casualty Evacuation , which is a technical distinction that means they use whatever helicopters are available at the moment to extract the wounded or downed aircrews . However , DOD has tasked the Army to provide evacuation to the MEDEVAC standard , which means our MEDEVAC crews and helicopters are purpose built , manned , trained and equipped to provide advanced trauma care in flight . <p> While putting a red cross on our MEDEVAC helicopters has the added benefit of being consistent with the Geneva Conventions , it also marks that aircraft and crew for no other mission besides medical evacuation . In Afghanistan and other austere environments , where helicopter assets are in very high demand , its important that we dedicate a fleet of aircraft for no other purpose than to provide advanced in-flight care for wounded Soldiers , Sailors , Airmen and Marines . <p> The Army provides the great majority of medical evacuations in Afghanistan . That includes allied personnel and even enemy wounded . The U.S. Marines in Afghanistan , and in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical evacuation of its personnel because they know we provide the " gold standard " in modern battlefield evacuation . No military force in the world is better than the US Army at MEDEVAC . The 92 percent survival rate for wounded in Afghanistan is the highest in history because of the power of our MEDEVAC capability and its battlefield support network . <p> Another important point is that arming our MEDEVACs would significantly impact the capability of the aircraft . Machine guns , related mounting equipment , ammunition and the gunners all add weight to the aircraft . The added weight would hinder the aircrafts ability to work at higher altitudes because of reduced lift , as well as its speed and range . Additionally , MEDEVACs can carry up to four litter patients , but if weapons were added , that number would be reduced , which would in turn require the commitment of more MEDEVAC aircraft , an already low density and high demand asset . <p> Further , arming MEDEVACs would not reduce the need for armed escort . Again , our aircraft travel in pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Army does not dictate how or when it is necessary to use these assets . <p> Finally , its important to remember that the Army would change its policy if battlefield commanders wanted a change . We take our obligation to perform the MEDEVAC mission very seriously . Were a learning organization and periodically we review our policies to make sure they remain relevant . We looked at the MEDEVAC policy in 2008 , but after a review , we determined no change was necessary . <p> Additionally , neither the International Security Assistance Force or U.S. Forces Afghanistan has requested a change in policy ; because our MEDEVAC crews and aircraft provide the best chance at survival ever seen in warfare , and because as commanders in Afghanistan have told us not arming our MEDEVACs and identifying them with the red cross has had no impact on the medical evacuation mission .

@@96509701 @709701/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> A Shiny Badge Does Not Grant Extra Rights <p> When a game warden wants to tag a deer , he makes sure to place the trap on an obvious trail that deer frequent . Deer tend to stick to natural funnels and tree or brush lines . Deer are naturally suspicious animals and tend to stick to areas they know and out of the open as much as possible . Hunters know this and place their traps along those known trails because they know that setting a trap out in the brush with delicious food may be too much work for the deer . Its just easier to travel down the path of least resistance than trample around through weeds and overgrowth . <p> Dealing with government in all its forms is much like tagging deer . For example , take fighting speeding tickets . To most people , its just too hard to fight the system . The easy path is just to pay the fine , take an online class , and go about your business . If you get another ticket , repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that municipal courts are rigged against the motorist or the common citizen . Not only do you have to fight them on their turf , but you go in there already at a disadvantage . Most likely , the officer that ticketed you has been in front of that judge more than once . That prosecutor is the same prosecutor that fights EVERY traffic ticket like a broken record . The officer , the prosecutor , and the judge are all paid from the same pot of city money . They 're nothing more than co-workers since municipal judges are n't  elected , but selected by politicians . And they all want your money . One would think that officers collecting fees that pay their own salaries would be a conflict of interest , but at the municipal court level . <p> Fighting a speeding ticket really is n't that hard at all . You just have to realize and accept that you WILL most likely lose in the municipal court and be willing to take it to appeal . And you do n't  need an attorney . The key is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge will most likely deny to set up grounds for appeal . Municipal courts do n't  really care much about the law because they are n't  there to insure justice . They are there to serve as a revenue stream for the city council . Taxes only go so far in running our bloated local governments and these bodies politic rely on money from unsuspecting fools willing to pay their fine " to get it over with . " <p> I was at the municipal court the other day submitting a few such motions . I was there maybe 20 minutes maximum . In that time , over a dozen people came in to pay speeding tickets . Not a single ticket was under $200 . Think about that . In just 20 minutes , the city was able to raise over $4000 from unsuspecting sheeple just walking down the deer trail to the easy-to-find food trap . <p> The courts KNOW that most people wont fight their traffic tickets . You can walk into a court all day long knowing with 100% confidence that you were NOT speeding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court places more weight in the mere words of an officer than yours . Even though our laws dictate that the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you were speeding , the mere testimony of an officer seals your fate if you do n't  know how to fight it ( but that 's not my point here ) . <p> The same thinking can be applied to dealing with law enforcement officers . <p> Since my arrest this past March , I 've had the honor of meeting so many supporters that understand and appreciate my fight . Unfortunately , I 've also had my share of people eager to criticize my actions that day on the side of the road . <p> " If you had n't  been such a douchebag yelling at the cop you would have been on your way in a matter of minutes . " " If you had just let the cop take your gun , you would n't have gotten arrested . " " When a cop tells you to do something , you do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops . " " As a Master Sergeant , you should know to respect the authority of police officers . " <p> I got much of the same types of criticism after my false arrest at the capitol . <p> " You were only carrying a toy gun to bait the cops . " " It was obvious you sought a confrontation with police . " " You should have left when they told you to leave . " " The cops job is to keep the people safe . When they tell you to do something , its for the good of the people . " <p> The truth is that standing up for yourself defending your rights is like those deer having to wonder into the bush to get food . Its just too hard . By questioning authority , specifically abuse of authority , you open yourself up to the power of the government ( and ignorant criticism ) . They have the power to take away your freedom , take away your treasure , and take away your time . Its expensive standing up for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spiritually costly , and even physically costly ( though I probably should n't complain about the 38 pounds Ive lost since March from stress ) . <p> The reason why its so costly is because more of us do n't  stand up . Do you really think that the abuses of authority we see all throughout our society would occur if more people stood up to the oppression ? What if more people went to school board meetings and held their elected board members accountable for their votes ? What if more people attended city council meetings that are largely unattended and held their council members accountable for their votes ? And what if more people stepped in when they saw a police officer abusing his authority or being overly aggressive in the handling of a citizen ? <p> We are taught from a young age ( and more-so these days ) that people with badges are to be respected . We are told they have tough jobs and may not make it home alive on any given day in spite of the fact that , according to the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of duty each year including getting run over or shot by their own weapon . These are the people that tell us the reason we need invasive patdowns to get on a plane is in response to a few planes that were hijacked twelve years ago . They say that they want to take away your guns because there are a few people who use them to kill or injure others . They tell you that you cant carry a gun into a school because people shoot kids there . <p> These are just SOME of the statistics . Do some serious research on police criminal activity and you tell me if you feel safe when confronted by a police officer . Yet , in spite of the fact that you put your life on the line moreso when confronting a police officer than a member of the general public , were supposed to bend over backwards making THEM feel safer and doing whatever THEY tell US to do ? ! Because of a psychotic shooter at a movie theater , I 'm supposed to allow law enforcement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that the officer has MY best interests in mind when its been proven over and over and over again that officers lie so much so that the courts even had to explain that its okay for them to do so ! <p> Stop walking down the path of least resistance and start actually offering peaceful resistance . We , the people , control and run our government ; not the other way around . We have too many laws that exempt the most dangerous people in our society ( law enforcement officers ) from most laws that restrict what you and I can do simply because the people do n't  speak up . Or simply by virtue of wearing a pretty badge . We , the people do n't  stand up to these authoritarian figures enough and then we complain about it when it gets out of control . I 'm not saying you have to be disrespectful to every cop you encounter , I 'm just saying that its about time we stopped cowering every time one approaches us . Standing up for your rights is not disrespect . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its important that we be educated on the law so we can recognize when the law is not being followed by the very people responsible for enforcing it . <p> If you see a cop car parked in a fire lane , take a picture and call the police . If you see a police officer speeding down the road without his lights on , film it and call the police . If you see a police officer being overly aggressive with a citizen ( that may or MAY NOT be guilty of anything ) , film it and call the police . If you see a cop car in a handicapped spot , take a photo and call the police . Any time a police officer speaks to you regardless of the reason film it ! It may be the only thing that keeps you safe or helps you fight bogus charges . Believe me , I know ! Be kind as long as kindness is extended to you , but film it . <p> Every time you call the cops , get off that beaten path and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photos and video you took . Hold them accountable . If you do n't  think they 're being held accountable , take it to the City Council . If they ignore you , initiate a recall election . If anything , it will wake up them to the reality that they are not Gods , lording over you . They answer to you . Yes , its a lot of work . Its a pain in the ass . There are so many other things you could be doing ( like reading this stupid blog post ) rather than tracking down corruption and abuse of power . But , if you do n't  do it , you 're no better than that deer that just wants an easy mealseconds before getting shot by the hunter . <p> Almost 20 years ago , I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic .

Now from a law enforcement aspect , how about you do n't  speed ? If you do , take the penalty as I would and have . Seems here your acting just like a liberal .

If I committed a crime I 'm sure I 'll be able to confront the injured party , right ? From a law enforcement standpoint , how about you do more to preserve the peace and less revenue raising .

They all need to meet minimum standards and 4 years in the military , three of which was in the military police , does not a good cop make . The Uniform Code of Military Justice is NOT compatible with law enforcement . <p> So if we do n't  pay the city council money to help fund your paycheck , were automatically a Liberal ? LOL <p> Texas has a Preemption Clause Jeff .

As a gun owner and constitutionalist , I 'm concerned that groups like the Brady Campaign use false or incomplete facts to further their efforts to suppress our rights to self-defense . <p> Reading Daniel Gross piece , youd almost want to agree with him . After all , who wants to empower maniacs to kill five unarmed , innocent people . The Gabriel Giffords shooting also spurred gun grabbers into action . <p> In all fairness , authorities should have been authorized to pull Mr. Stawickis permit if there was a legitimate fear and a history of violence and mental health issues . Then again , where do we draw the line ?

Never mind that study after study has linked public gun carrying to increased rates of violent crime like robbery and murder . <p> Whoa ! Sounds like a no-brainer to me . I mean , who wants more people dead ? Who wants higher rates of murder and robbery ? I do n't  think either gun grabbers or gun rights advocates want that . Maybe the Huffington Post is on to something here and the Stawicki story is just one of many anecdotes that leads to a logical conclusion . Or not <p> You see , I believe in actual facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just released its annual Uniform Crime Report designed to " to meet a need for reliable , uniform crime statistics for the nation .

As a matter of fact , crime is down across the country by 4% as a whole compared with the previous year . The report states that " the violent crime category includes murder , forcible rape , robbery , and aggravated assault " ( emphasis added ) . Oops . <p> How can that possibly be ?

I just want to ensure that I meet all my obligations prior to my upcoming Afghanistan deployment . But , the good news is that you 're about to learn about a bunch of great products I had the privilege to test and review . While I was provided with these products for review , I was NOT provided any incentives , payment , or other offers to write positive reviews . For the most part , I wont write a bad review publicly . I 'll send the product back with a negative write-up and hope they fix whatever I think was wrong with it . I only write reviews on products I think are uber-cool and usable . <p> As I 've said before , I 'm not a spec nerd . I write my reviews for the " everyperson " that will use them . If you 're one of those gun buffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plenty of ways to find that information . So , I 'm not going to tell you that my " 11 1/2 inch barreled carbine was initially firing about 1016 rounds per minute ( rpm ) . After installing the MGI Buffer , the rate of fire dropped 271 rpm to a rate of 745 rpm . " <p> Installation was easy for the most part , except for the little " D " shaped ring that is placed over the extractor spring of the bolt assembly . Supposedly , the D-ring eliminates extraction issues and can increase extractor spring force by four-times . While getting it on was easy peasy , getting the extractor back on the bolt assembly required additional tools . I had to use pliers to push onto the bold assembly far enough to get the extractor pin all the way through . By the time I finally had it on , I actually got a little worried if it would extract expended rounds from the chamber . My fingers hurt . And I 'm not looking forward to having to put it back on after cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replacing the buffer requires no additional modifications to the firearm . The rest of the installation took all of 2 minutes to complete . <p> What I will tell you is that I noticed an IMMEDIATE difference in recoil once I installed the MGI buffer . I almost felt as if I was shooting a .22 variant AR instead of a 5.56mm widowmaker of a rifle . The MGI patented buffer is a self-adjusting , completely mechanical buffer with fewer parts to fail and none of the leakage associated with the common hydraulic or pneumatic buffers currently used . With no springs in the MGI buffer system to interfere with feed reliability , more rounds successfully hit the target with greater control and accuracy . While I do n't  have a comparative video , you can see from this video that muzzle climb is drastically retarded with the MGI buffer installed . <p> I know its a little difficult to see with the camera angle , but pay close attention to the muzzle and the background .

This will come into play later . <p> On my way home from work , the news played a clip of a former Army helicopter pilot , Major Mary Jennings Hegar . There was much ado about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three other female veterans , she has joined with the ACLU to sue the Department of Defense over the combat exclusion policy that bars females from going into combat specialties . In an op-ed published today , MAJ Hegar made the following comments : <p> If there is one thing I 've learned about the differences between us all throughout my years of service , it 's this : putting the right person in the right job has very little to do with one 's gender , race , religion , or other demographic descriptor . It has everything to do with one 's heart , character , ability , determination and dedication . <p> That 's the problem with the military 's combat exclusion policy . It makes it that much harder for people to see someone 's abilities , and instead reinforces stereotypes about gender . The policy creates the pervasive way of thinking in military and civilian populations that women ca n't serve in combat roles , even in the face of the reality that servicewomen in all branches of the military are already fighting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they return fire , they drag wounded comrades to safety and they engage with the enemy , and they have been doing this for years . They risk their lives for their country , and the combat exclusion policy does them a great disservice . <p> Its no secret and I do n't  deny that women have been shot at , shot back , and contributed to direct-fire engagements of the enemy . However , that does n't  mean that these actions equate to being infantry , cavalry , or other combat specialty . As a matter of fact , the Marine Corps recently opened up their Infantry Officers Course to women . Two women volunteered to attend the courseand both women dropped from the program . These women were " to complete required training due to unspecified medical reasons , a Marine official told Marine Corps Times . It 's unclear whether she was injured or if she became i 'll , " according to the Marine Corps Times . <p> Women in the military want to have equal treatment while being treated differently . For example , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event with the minimum passing score , he has to correctly perform 34 push-ups . For a female of the same age , she only needs to complete 13 . To pass the 2-mile run , I need to run 18:18 or faster while a female my age can take up to 22:42 to complete the same distance . <p> I 'm not suggesting that there are n't  women that can meet the standards . As a matter of fact , I know there are . Just as I know there are men that cant meet the minimum standards . But , that does n't  matter when males and females are treated differently in regards to physical fitness standards . Its simply a biological fact that women and men are built differently . There will always be exceptions , but it is what it is . <p> Yes , somehow , I do n't  see MAJ Hegar complaining that she does n't  have to do as many push-ups or run as fast as men ( the only physical fitness event in the Army that is equal is the sit-up event ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  required to register with the Selective Service upon turning 18 . I do n't  see women complaining they do n't  have to cut their hair to the standards men must keep theirs . <p> Its obvious that women want equality in the military , but only if it means they can have differently . The Marine Corps , in opening up its Infantry Officers Course to women , did n't  change the standards for women coming through the course . They were required to meet the same standards as the men . I do n't  have a problem with that . <p> I 'm not against women serving in combat roles . I 'm not against women serving in an infantry squad or as a tank commander or gunner . What I 'm against is giving them different standards and somehow calling it " equality . " When a platoon is dropped off at the base of a mountain and is required to hike to their OP , they have to be physically fit and strong enough to complete the task . There is ammunition , weapons , and other gear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped off in a town and performing a simple foot patrol while engaging with the local populace is n't the same as a combat patrol or movement to contact . Its not the same as assaulting or taking and holding an objective . <p> I say that if these women and the ACLU want true equality , give it to them . Standardize the physical fitness requirements for men and women . Standardize the requirements for load bearing equipment . Drop any and all references to gender in every single area and truly treat women equally the way they want . Amend the Military Selective Service Act to incorporate a requirement for women to also register upon their 18th birthday . If women can meet the same standards that men must meet without lowering the standards to make them equal then they deserve to wear the crossed rifles or sabers.

@@96509713 @709713/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> On Banning " Assault Weapons " and " High-Capacity " Magazines <p> I think its about time to sit down and talk with you realistically about the ignorance of those advocating for bans on so-called " assault weapons " ( AW ) and so-called " high-capacity " magazines . <p> First and foremost , I object to the use of both terms . They are nothing more than scare tactics designed by opponents to create fear of inanimate objects . They are used to assume there is safety in less capacity and less menacing characterics . However , I use the terms merely to sync my words with the common media vernacular to avoid confusion . <p> To be honest , I 'm not even sure what constitutes an AW . I know that ARs and AKs fit into that category , but the using the 90s AW ban as a guideline , the possibilities of defining a rifle as an AW are virtually limitless . Take the Ruger Mini-14 , for example . <p> I think everyone , including the gun control nazis , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general population to own . It looks likes a perfectly fine weapon for hunting ( understanding that the 2nd Amendment has NOTHING to do with hunting , as I 've previously explained ) , right ? <p> There is no extendable stock . It does n't  have an evil pistol grip . Its got a wooden frame instead of a black one . The magazine can not hold 30 or more rounds . None of those murder-prone picatinny rails . Its just a down-to-earth , typical American rifle one would expect to see in the back window of a pickup truck . But , it does shoot the standard .223 or 5.56mm rounds that most ARs shoot . <p> What 's great about Rugers Mini 14 is that is highly customizable . There is an endless number of changes that can be made to it to suit the owners likes and needs . Consider the following progression . <p> Uh oh . This is the same rifle , but its beginning to look scary with that collapsible stock and a pistol grip . However , since its still got a wooden frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ok , now you 've gone too far , CJ . This is simply unacceptable . Its black and the magazine is much too large . We need to ban this weapon . Never mind that this one is the EXACT SAME weapon in terms of mechanics , lethality , accuracy , and cycling as the first one above . The problem is that this is the same weapon as the first one above . But , just for giggles , let 's take it one more step then I 'll get into some other aspects of these AW bans . <p> Now , THAT is how you kit out a Ruger Mini 14 ! ! <p> But , let 's get serious for a moment , shall we ? I live on my family farm here in Texas . The farm has been in our family for 4 generations . I live right across the street from the first plot of land my grandfather ever purchased . We now farm over 6,500 acres , much of it leased . We have hundreds of head of cattle . We are also dealers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the same acre of land fertile for growing crops year after year . One of the chemicals we use is called anhydrous ammonia . <p> Anhydrous ammonia is gas you cant see , but can suffocate you with a sharp , pungent odor . Think about the worst smell of ammonia you 've ever smelled and then multiply that probably 10 times . It is a chemical made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen and compressed into liquid form to fertilize fields . As you know , plants take nutrients out of the earth in order to grow . Using the same land to grow crops year after year or season after season depletes the soil of those much-needed nutrients , especially nitrogen . <p> Using anhydrous ammonia in fields replenishes that lost nitrogen into the soil . Its very easy to apply and readily available to farmers . As it is released into the soil it expands into a gas where it rapidly combines with soil moisture . <p> Sounds harmless enough , right ? Wrong . <p> Anhydrous ammonia is also an ingredient used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid easy detection by police and neighbors , and use the resources that are readily available to them . These " resources " often include anhydrous ammonia . <p> Over the years , we have experienced several incidents where we had meth producers try to steal our anhydrous . One such instance that occurred the first year I moved back home resulted in a major chase between the thieves and my cousins . Seeing that we were all well-armed with different AW-type weapons , the thieves thought twice about sticking around . The mere sight of those guns was enough to scare them off and keep them away . We chased them out of the county . <p> Another aspect of living out in rural America that may necessitate the use of high capacity magazines is defending a herd or flock from coyotes . Coyotes hunt in both packs and individually . They are fast , moving targets . While many farmers employ the use of asses to defend their livestock , they are n't  always affective . Yes , there are lazy asses on farms too . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions and cougars as well . Why should we be relegated to just using hunting rifles when we just want to kill the threat to our livelihood ? <p> However , there wo n't always be a time when the thieves are going to be so easily spooked . I have no doubt that a desperate druggie may think he can shoot his way out . In such potential cases , only being able to own a 10-round clip is n't going to help . <p> A criminal wo n't care about capacity bans . If we were to obey the law and only own these smaller capacity clips , we would be at a major disadvantage . <p> There is a reason that Soldiers do n't  use 10-round clips and havent since Vietnam . In the heat of the moment when adrenaline is high and nerves are tense , its often difficult to focus complete attention on the fundamentals of marksmanship , which include steady position , aim , breathing , and trigger squeeze . Its hard to control breathing when you 're repelling an ambush or rushing through an urban environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's face it , the purpose behind using weapons is to remove the threat . Ten rounds werent cutting it on the battlefields of war , so you know they would n't cut it in the criminal battlefields of America . <p> There are techniques to speed loading that many troops and police officers train on . One just need do a YouTube search for " speed loading rifle " to see that a trained shooter does n't  need much time to reload a magazine . Even the untrained person would n't have to take as much time to reload a magazine , providing he had more than one at his disposal . <p> The truth is that your average farmer or ranch owner is n't going to carry around combat load of seven magazines . Most only even keep one magazine for each weapon they own unless it came with additional ones . A 10-round magazine simply wont cut it when the need arises . And even if that person had several 10-round magazines loaded , he probably wo n't remember to grab them when the threat materializes . <p> Besides all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an AW ban still wont work . Just yesterday there was a story about a kid who planned his killing for a year . The shooter did n't  use an AW to target his classmates . He used a shotgun . If not for the brave actions of completely unarmed faculty , the results still could have been deadly . The shooter had 20 more rounds in his pocket and it does n't  take long to load a shotgun either . <p> Keep these things in mind the next time someone poses the ignorant question , " why do regular citizens need an AW anyway ? " Then also remind them about what happened during the LA riots . I more shop owners wish they had one then . 
@@96509715 @709715/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> UPDATE Richard Ruffert : Fraud <p> UPDATE : Its been brought to my attention that the entire kingdom of Saudi Arabia was technically a combat zone . So , I would like to clarify that in terms of being in a country designated a combat zone , Mr. Ruffert is indeed a " combat veteran . " The point of my comment is that it does n't  appear that he ever actually SAW combat or participated in armed action against or by the enemy . My apologies for not clarifying this little tidbit . <p> I would liken this to my service in Afghanistan . I 'm not an Afghanistan " combat " veteran because I stayed on the FOB my entire deployment . Though we were mortared on a regular basis some of which were less than 100 meters from my building I did not see any real combat in Afghanistan . <p> Now , with that out of the way , I challenge Mr. Ruffert to answer all the other claims Ive made based off his records . I 've left messages on his voicemail asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact information . <p> I despise frauds . I loathe them . And Richard Ruffert is a fraud if his records are to be believed . What makes this case so incredibly loathesome is that Ruffert did n't  have to inflate his record . He served 22 years in the military and that should have been enough for him . But instead , he duped people into thinking he was something he was not , as in the video above . <p> I 'm not saying that he duped OnStar . I 'm sure that the contest had nothing to do with his lies . However , I believe his lies led to that moment . I think he lied about his service , which probably got him accepted into the Veterans Court program . Graduating from the program probably got him a job at the VA . The job at the VA paid for his car . His car is why he was able to " push that button . " And , pushing that button got him a Corvette . Ruffert tells me that he had the VA job PRIOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me that he also did not lie to the court to be admitted into the program . However , I have no proof either way that he did or did n't  . Considering all the other lies , it was n't that far of a stretch to wonder if he lied to get into the program . <p> So , what has Ruffert lied about ? First of all , if you noticed at the beginning of the video the tag line was " Disabled Combat Veteran . " <p> The FACT is that Ruffert has NEVER been in combat in the traditional sense of the word in encountering an armed enemy . Yes , he was in a combat ZONE . Saudi Arabia was technically a " combat zone " and even if he were stationed in Jeddah on the Red Sea . But , when you say you have " combat PTSD " the insinuation is that the PTSD was a result of combat . <p> I work with many people and many agencies that seek to verify claims made publicly by veterans . Many times , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone was even looking into their background . However , too often we find that the claims being made publicly are false . Such was the case when the group investigated Ruffert through the Freedom of Information Act . I have access to Rufferts driver licence information , divorce records , criminal records , and official military records that are publicly available . All information was legally obtained through FOIA . Here is what came back relating to his deployment " experience . " <p> As you can see from his records , his only overseas time was to Honduras and Saudi Arabia . Granted , his " TDY " to Saudi Arabia was during Desert Storm , it does n't  mention any combat time to Iraq . If he had crossed the border into Iraq during combat actions that took place between January and February of 1991 , it would be annotated . He does have the Kuwait Liberation Medal and the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait Liberation Medal in his records . <p> The Kuwait Liberation Medal is awarded to troops who served in support of Operation Desert Storm and included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 nonconsecutive days . These time limitations may be waived for members participating in actual combat operations . " The same requirements are present the SA-KLM . <p> So , if its possible that Ruffert participated in ODS , why am I calling him out for being a combat veteran ? <p> During the last legislative session here in Texas , Senate Resolution No. 49 was passed and signed by Governor Perry . The title of that resolution is " Commending Master Sergeant Richard Ruffert on his service to our nation . " I 'll get to the " Master Sergeant " aspect later . <p> Here is a brief section of the bill : <p> There are a number of issues in just this section . Rufferts records do NOT show any deployments to Iraq , Afghanistan , or Bosnia at all . They also do n't  show any Legion of Merit or two Bronze Stars . In fact , Rufferts highest medal is the Meritorious Service Medal . The Senate would have no way of getting this information unless Ruffert gave it to them . He surely did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the information since it still remains in the official records ( do n't  worry , I 'm already in contact with the Texas Senate to have this resolution expunged ) . <p> Finally , the resolution indicates that Ruffert retired as a Master Sergeant . The truth is that he retired as a Sergeant First Class . <p> But , it gets worse . <p> On September 16 , 2011 , Ruffert published the following on the Veterans Courts Facebook page . <p> An inquiry to the Ranger schoolhouse came back negative . Ruffert never went to the school and was never bestowed the coveted and hard-to-earn title of Ranger . This was n't a one-time claim either . <p> Last November , Scholastic Magazine published a story by James Dao called " This Is A Face of War . " It was a moving story about Joey Paulk , who was actually injured in Afghanistan and left disfigured when his vehicle was hit by an IED . Paulk is the real deal and will carry with him lifelong evidence of his sacrifice for this country . I urge you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , Scholastic included a story titled " With Help From a Friend " by Rachel Morris . The supposedly non-fiction story is about " retired Army Ranger Richard Ruffert . " <p> What a sick man ! Here we have a true American hero in Joey Paulk and at the end of his story of resilience and sacrifice we have Richard Ruffert inflating his ego with stories of false grandeur and bravado . He claims that he was in the same war that Paulk was in . <p> In all the stories I 've been able to find about Ruffert , there really is n't anything specific about what exactly led to his supposed claim of PTSD . Here in Texas he was convicted of property theft in 2009 of less than $500 . From all appearances , he seems to have developed his PTSD in response to getting out of trouble . If you look at the above Facebook posting again , he brags about his record being expunged without any mention of the theft and claiming his only run-in with the law was overdosing on pills . <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worthy non-profit K9s For Warriors . <p> What sickens me the most is that programs like Veterans Courts and K9s For Warriors were designed to help legitimate people deal with PTSD . And along come people like Ruffert who lie and fabricate their records to suit their own selfish purposes and egos . This only serves to cast an aura of suspicion on every other veteran with legitimate PTSD who needs real help . The Texas legislature will now be less likely to actually honor a real Texan who has n't  lied about his experiences and service record . <p> I 've always said that I agreed with the Supreme Court about the unconstitutionality of the Stolen Valor Act to a point . I think the Constitution protects people who want to lie about themselves . What it DOES NT protect against , however , is fraud . When those lies are used to get something tangible , whether monetarily or in terms of recognition and benefits , it ceases to be protected speech . In other words , he can go into a bar and lie about being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled veteran to the hot chick at the bar , but once he uses that to get free drinks he s committed a crime . <p> I also believe the best way to deal with these frauds is through public humiliation . This man should NOT be helping other veterans . He should NOT be employed by the Veterans Administration . He should NOT have had his record expunged through the Texas Veterans Courts since he lied to them . He should be held in contempt and I will seek to ensure he is . <p> Retired Sergeant First Class Richard Ruffert is a fraud . And he surely ai n't  a Christian . <h> 20 Comments on " UPDATE Richard Ruffert : Fraud " <p> Well written and researched you should be proud of doing this great public service by exposing this parasite while veterans with real ailments are waiting in line or part of the SNAFU of bureaucracy and draconian regulations . With someone like him working for VA , no wonder it has problems . I understand from the story and comments that he is attending divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in profits . I read once that a minister used $63,000 for clothing expenditure out of church funding . Shame . Recently the FBI won a case against a guy who is now serving time in prison for fraudulently collecting millions of dollars . No wonder programs are running out of money because of frauds . Thanks again for your enlightening report . I am new here and intend to be a more regular reader . Best Regards KAL , served US Army for 15 years . <p> Remember the name of the game would be reducing the principal . You do this by using shorter not lengthening the amount course , and as a consequence developing certainly not lowering how often together with expenditures. frequently , annually , you are entitled to provide bank a big of 10% or perhaps a 15% from your outstanding law . <p> What ever happened to defrauding the government-Federal Lawsand with the help of political influence ? Why is he still employed . What ever happened to the question on the employment application that asks Is all the information on this application true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position ? I cant believe people , so messed up they have to do things like this . <p> Get A JOB YOU ACTUALLY EARNED ! Prosecute his a** . If they can prosecute people that claim they have cancer and do n't  and take money , why not him ! Put him in Lew Sterrett and let him tell his story to the Home Boys . <p> hammer this fake unreal that a so called NCO would lie like this he must have been a fobbit clerk with nothing better to do . take his Car , service dog , and put his a$$ in jail for lying on federal documents . and make him pay back all the money that he has stole from the VA and Service dog people . send him to JAIL ! ! ! do n't drop the soap ! ! ! <p> What I cant understand is that before he could have made SFC his ERB and 2-1 would have been corrected before it went to the SFC Board . I agree something is foul with this guy . Also my 2-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his are . It looks like he made some changes and had it added . Again I cant say for sure because I have had some jacked up S-1 clerks . But this is just too many errors to be dismissed . <p> SFC M Retired I am inclined to agree with you . I looked at the document and noticed that he has only 1 NDSM . He should be have 2 at a minimim due to the time frame he was in the military . Also what is a DVR-BADGE-W/GCMDL ? Never heard of this , I know what a GCMDL is just never seen it annotated as such . If that is the actual 2-1/ERB he used for the E7 board I am pretty sure it would have been rejected . I had mine rejected one time due to my first name was misspelled . It was n't for the E7 board but it was still rejected due to incorrect information . <p> Well the Driver and Mechanic Badge With Driver-W Bar/Good Conduct is kinda confusing and never known anyone to shorten it to DVR . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the FOIA release misspelled Sergeant ? <p> Unbelievable , I go to the VA to get help , get treated as if the only thing I 'm there for is a handout , told there is nothing really wrong with me . Then I read about clowns like this . I want his dog taken and given to someone who is actually suffering , I want him drummed out of divinity school and he needs to be held criminally accountable . <p> Wow .. this jerk sure had me fooled. ! ! ! ! Glad I got out of our friendship when I did .. sad part is I think he truly believes his lies and can no longer distinguish reality from fiction . I hope they prosecute him accordingly if the accusations are true . <p> If someones records are incorrect that falls on the soldier for not ensuring the records are up to date . I 'm not trying to slam any soldier merely speaking from firsthand hard learned experience . <p> In regards to Ruffert his claims are bogus . According to his information he worked full time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an AD soldier and his job would have put him in a position to correct the errors in his record . <p> To LLs credit , one of the people she is talking about is me . You may recall when a certain disgraced military writer tried to use my records against me . The problem is that I 'm still active duty , so my records are n't  public yet . They only went up until my last reenlistment which was in 2002 . <p> However , there are far too many errors in this turds record to chalk it up to just inaccuracies . He has no record of Bosnia , Iraq , Afghanistan , Bronze Star ( x2 ) , Legion of Merit , Ranger School , or rank . There are just too many things wrong with his records that he has n't  seen fit to fix any of it . I 'm more than willing to print a retraction in a new and separate blog post if he can provide supporting documentation . <p> Yes , but those records were also incomplete . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas these records contain his entire career . There are no entires for the time periods he claims to have been somewhere . 
@@96509716 @709716/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Creating Criminals Out of Thin Air <p> Ayn Rand once wrote , " Theres no way to rule innocent men . The only power government has is the power to crack down on criminals . Well without breaking laws . " <p> When talking about the current banter in Washington to " take assault rifles off the street " you ca n't help but think back to Rands quote . After all , there are literally hundreds of thousands of law-abiding gun owners who have purchased so-called " assault rifles . " Many of them own AKs and other similarly mislabeled " assault rifles " ( NOTE : I do n't  buy into the term " assault weapon . " I think its only used to scare the ignorant sheeple and stigmatize a particular category of firearm and its owners . However , for the purposes of this post , I will use the abbreviation AW to appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity . CJ ) <p> One only needs to look at history to find evidence that all this hoopla about how bad AWs are to see that banning them is n't the answer . All it will do is serve to stigmatize those who own them or create a new breed of law-abiding " criminal . " <p> Prior to the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban , only about 8% of crimes were committed with an AW , according to the National Criminal Justice Reference Service . But , what most people do n't  realize is that a majority of those AW were so-called " assault pistols , " pistols that were capable of using large capacity magazines ( LCM ) . In other words , only a tiny , tiny fraction of crimes committed prior to the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban were committed by those scary-looking AKs and AR rifles . The statistics are far smaller today . <p> Its easy to look back over the 10 years that the law was on the books and see that it had no effect on crimes committed with AW . The truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intelligent adults only want to ban something that looks scary . It is n't about safety , but about appearance . Just look at what Senator Diane FrankenFeinstein is trying to introduce in the next week to revive the ban . <p> The new law would ban the sale , transfer , importation , or manufacturing of 120 specifically-named firearms . There is no word on what those are , but in an age when any individual can create a small , mom-and-pop gun shop it seems odd that they would specifically target manufacturers . It will also ban " certain other semiautomatic rifles , handguns , shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic . " What are those " military characteristics " you may ask ? Pistol grip , adjustable stock , thumbhole stock , threaded barrel , bayonet mounts , and other cosmetic features . Nothing to do with safety features and everything to do with how the weapon looks . <p> Finally , according to FrankenFeinsteins press release , she will ban " semiautomatic rifles and handguns . " That means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this so-called good faith effort to reduce extremely rare school shootings committed by criminal-minded people . The only thing that would n't cover is bolt-action and muzzle-loading rifles and revolvers . Nearly every single hunting rifle is a semi-automatic . Nearly every pistol is a semi-automatic . <p> But , do n't  fear . The law would grandfather those of us who already legally own these menacing weapons . Is it no wonder that there is a six-month backlog for new AR-style rifles in this country right now ? Without a threat of a ban , many of these evil , single-minded weapons would still be sitting on store shelves . Now , they are sitting in the comfortable home of their newfound owners drinking cappuccino and sipping rum . <p> At the Dallas Gun Show last weekend , there was more than a 30-minute wait outside the venue in sub-freezing temperatures just to get in . Everyone and their mother was in there buying these weapons at , most often , twice their value ! People were even paying $1000 for a barely decent M1 Garand ! ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview of Senator Diane Feinstein as she talks about the ban shes going to introduce . See how many inaccuracies you can find . <p> Okay , just to name a few : <p> " The assault weapon is developed for military purposes to kill in close combat . " WRONG . Yes , the M4 and M16 were initially created for the military , but like nearly every single military small arm in our history , it was eventually altered slightly for civilian enjoyment and personal defense . What 's good enough for our troops is good enough for its citizens . The M4 and M16 are not " close combat , " though that is why the weapon was shortened in the M4 variant . The pistol is a " close combat " weapon while the M4 and M16 are small arms offensive and defensive weapons . There is reason that we are required to train on targets up to 300 meters annually and not inside buildings , which is what " close combat " is . Sure , they are used in " close combat " but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When asked how her legislation would have prevented what happened at Sandy Hook , Feinstein remarked , " over time that weapon would be much less available . " WRONG . The ban would only make NEW such weapons less available . There are hundreds of thousands of these in homes across America more recently thanks to the Senator . So , just as the 1994 ban did n't  stop such crimes like , oh , Columbine or the Oklahoma City bombing , neither would this one . <p> " It would ban weapons by actual name and then by physical characteristics . " Ok , what " physical characteristics " make a weapon more or less lethal or deadly ? Thumb stock ? No . Adjustable stock ? No . Threaded barrel ( purportedly for a silencer to be attached ) ? No . Pistol grip ? No . Bayonet attachment ? No . When was the last time someone mounted a bayonet and began stabbing people with an AW ? ! This is the fallaciousness of the liberal thought process . <p> " Its the clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to have " firepower " there are several components you need and a clip is n't one of them . You need a firing mechanism usually the weapon . You need the projectile or bullet . And now this is the hard part to get through think skulls of mush buying into gun control hysteria you need someone to combine them and make them function together . There are guns without any clips ( or magazines ) at all . The mere presence of a LCM does n't  make a crime any more or less heinous . And depending on the shooter , it does n't  really slow them down either . <p> Just look at the Beltway sniper incident a few years ago . Those people were all killed by a single bullet fired at long range . A ten-round magazine would n't have stopped those killings . There were ten people killed and three more critically injured before the perpretrators , racists John Allen Muhommad and Lee Boyd Malvo , were captured . So , while the weapon used was a .223 Bushmaster rifle , the shooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and gotten the same effect . <p> " These guns kill large numbers of people very quickly . They are n't  used for hunting . They are n't  hunting weapons . You do n't  need them for defense . They are military-style weapons and they do n't  belong in the streets of our cities or our towns . " WRONG . First of all , semi-automatic handguns are used twice as often to commit crimes and mass murder than AW . Notice I did n't  say that semi-auto handguns kill twice as many people . There is a difference . Remember what I said earlier . A gun is just an inanimate object without someone to create the action that works the firing mechanism . <p> Second , I 've used my AW for hunting numerous times . I used it to hunt hogs ; I used it to hunt coyotes ; and I 've used it to hunt deer ( though I never got to fire a shot ) . Who is the arbiter of what I 'm allowed to hunt with ? Never mind that this whole " hunting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 2A does n't  say a word about hunting . The framers werent talking about hunters when they envisioned the 2A . I challenge ANYONE to find me ONE quote during the debate and/or passage of the 2A that so much as REFERENCES hunting as the reason it was included . Liberals keep trying to further this false premise that if you are n't  a hunter , you do n't  need a gun . Or , if you are a hunter , you have to use a limited number of guns with which to hunt . <p> Thomas Jefferson once said ( emphasis mine ) , " On every question of construction ( of it was passed . " <p> So , its important to find the meaning of the 2A when it was passed . That is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all that it has NOTHING to do with hunting . So , let 's do that . Here are a few quotes that I particularly like that explain EXACTLY what the 2A is there for . <p> " What , Sir , is the use of a militia ? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army , the bane of liberty . Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people , they always attempt to destroy the militia , in order to raise an army upon their ruins . " ( Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts , spoken during floor debate over the Second Amendment ) <p> " to disarm the people that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them . " ( George Mason ) Does n't  sound like anything to do with hunting since we ca n't be enslaved by deer or antelope . <p> " but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude , that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all inferior to them in discipline and use of arms , who stand ready to defend their rights " ( Alexander Hamilton ) <p> " As civil rulers , not having their duty to the people before them , may attempt to tyrannize , and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country , might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens , the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms . " ( Tench Coxe ) If the 2A referred to only government-sponsored militaries , they would n't use the term " private arms . " The government provides the military with small arms . Though I realize that back during the revolutionary times the military was made up of individuals and their arms used . During the Civil War , we learned that it was better to have a universal type and caliber of weapon . <p> And this is perhaps my favorite quote by Patrick Henry : " Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense ? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction , and having them under the management of Congress ? If our defense be the real object of having those arms , in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety , or equal safety to us , as in our own hands ? " <p> Notice a common theme there ? There is no talk of hunting . There is no talk of even just target practice . The common refrain here is that our Founders recognized the perversion that is a federal government ( Thomas Paine called it a " necessary evil " ) and wanted to ensure that the people were properly prepared to respond to a tyrannical government as they had to . This is also why the argument that " the Founding Fathers never envisioned todays weapons " is also fallacious from the beginning . It is imperative that " the People " are just as well armed , if not more so , than the government so that it may be able to defend itself from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and governmental slavery . The restraints on government are unchallenged and people are left powerless . <p> I proved here that , again , Frankenfeinstein is wrong in saying that AW are not needed for defense . They most assuredly are . If such weapons werent good for defense , we would n't be using them in the military . <p> " The people have had it . They have had it in fear . " RIGHT . But for the WRONG reasons she expresses . Why the fear ? Because in every single incidence of a mass shooting in the recent years , EVERY SINGLE ONE was committed in a " gun free zone . " The movie theater . The mall . The schools . Churches . You name it . When people cant defend themselves appropriately , there is real fear and for good reason . She talks about the Colorado shooter coming in with a 100-round clip . It jammed , as every single one I 've ever seen or used tends to do . " It jammed . So , if that drum had n't  jammed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 100-round clip , while possessing potential to help a killer on his mission , usually does n't  work . When was the last time ANYONE used a 100-round clip to commit a mass murder ? Did n't  think so . We can " what if " these issues all day long . What if the new ban was in effect and the shooter had a vest with ten to twenty 10-round clips on his person ? Does n't  really seem much safer , does it ? Fallacy . <p> All these so-called bans do is create a new class of criminal law abiding citizens who otherwise have done nothing wrong but possess a weapon used separately and independently by an unrelated criminal . By that logic , every person that owns a knife is guilty of stabbings . Everyone that has a penis is guilty of rape . Everyone that has a candlestick killed Colonel Mustard in the Observatory . Its that silly . <p> What I take extreme umbrage to is the thought that just because someone has an AW , they should be looked at with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 cult classic , Red Dawn , one of the leaders of the communist invasion force instructs his subordinates to go into town and collect paperwork on the registration of gunsowners . They are then singled out and placed in concentration camps . Some are executed . <p> Now , while that is a movie , it is n't much of a leap to figure out what the government would do with the kind of registrations Senator Feinstein is wanting when it decides to further oppress the people and elevate its tyranny on them . There is absolutely NO reason that people with a particular style of gun needs to be watched , monitored , or in any other way have their 4A rights violated except for sinister purposes . <h> 7 Comments on " Creating Criminals Out of Thin Air " <p> The government has created tens of thousands of " FREE KILL ZONES " by banning firearms from public venues like schools , uniiversities , etc . Think what a " FREE KILL ZONE " the country would be if firearms are banned ! <p> FrankenFinestain should be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban and yet she herself has possessed a Concealed Carry permit for self protection when her own family came under threat of harm . <p> I 'm probably being defeatist but I think this ban will probably become a reality . My friend seems to think that , given historical precedent ( a least in the modern era ) that government will just start making high profiled arrests of " terrorists " ( that would be gun owners ) and finding child porn on their computers etc.dirty tricksand that 99% of the people will just roll over . What say you on this ? I am absolutely right with you by the way . I do n't  own an " AW " because they cost a friggin fortune but I oppose a ban on them 100% <p> Well I think there was something seriously off about that shooting anyway . I 'm not a big believer in conspiracies , but first there were two or more gunmenone pinned to the ground outside , and the only one we ever hear anything else about conveniently killed himself inside the school . Why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! Love the illustrations and examples you give . I think it boils down to the mistaken belief that it is the gun that kills people ; whereas a gun is simply a tool . One does n't  even need a weapon more deadly than ones hand to kill someone , only the intent and knowledge in how to do so . The government can place bans all they want to , but that does n't  prevent the intent , and once the intent is there , then all the bans in the world are not going to stop the act . Guns of all types are readily availableand do not have to be purchased in a store that does a background check prior to transfer of ownership . If someone wants to do something badly enough , he or she WILL find a way . If not a gun , then a bombI think our leaders place their concentration on the wrong things . You do an excellent job of correcting the inaccuracies in beliefs about guns !

My father , who spent 45 years in the Navy uniform , helped me with some of the specifics of which I was unaware . While possible , Zull would have had to be a stand-out Sailor to pin on his anchor . For the record , my father was one of those stand-out Sailors that did just that . <p> When I asked Zull personally about the inconsistencies with his story as well as his own military service , he told me I was basically barking up the wrong tree . <p> look i 'm not trying to be rude but i do n't  know where your getting your information at . Local media and police has already looked into all these FALSE ALLIGATIONS and my official documents have been provided to them all . they have been proved to all be false rumors and lies spread by certain people in the st louis and have been delt with by the court system already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lawyer and blocked any further requests for information . Likewise , his family refused to comment to inquiries about his service . <p> Last week , Gold Star Mother Julie Vinnedge went to court to defend herself against a restraining order filed by Zull . Ryan Zull claimed that Finnedge was harrassing him in her efforts to hold him accountable . Not only did the judge toss out his motion , but the lawyer to whom he referred me filed paperwork to withdraw representation . In other words , the lawyer had more integrity than Zull and wanted no part in his scams . <p> After the hearing , Zulls mother apologized for her sons actions towards Vinnedge and using Vinnedges son without permission . However , Ryan Zull never apologized or said a word of apology to Mrs. Vinnedge . So , there remained some unconfirmed allegations about his service . Well , not any more . <p> Yesterday , the Navy responded to my Freedom of Information Act request for Ryan Zulls DD214 . While heavily redacted for some reason , it does provide proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his military service . <p> According to Zulls DD214 , he only serve a little more than a year in the Navy . He only attained the rank of " SKSA , " which mean Seaman Apprentice , Storekeeper . One of the oldest Navy ratings , Storekeepers are tasked with maintaining ship or company military supply stores . Their responsibilities generally include purchasing and procurement , shipping and receiving , and issuing of equipment , tools , consumable items or anything else obtained through the Naval Supply System . However , the Navy stopped using that designation in 2009 . Now only the Coast Guard uses it . Ryan Zull claimed to be a Chief Petty Officer , which I believe his DD214 would have identified him as CPO . Certainly box 4. b. would have said E7 , not E2 . <p> As for his awards , his DD214 only shows him having the National Defense Service , Sea Service Deployment Ribbon , Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon , and Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon . All these are " throw-away " ribbons , meaning anyone that makes it through boot camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely no room for a Purple Heart or Legion of Merit in there . <p> Ryan Zull is a fraud and should be charged with fraud for using rank and military decorations he was n't awarded to commit fraud . He raised money from people based on the impression , both implied and verbal , that he was a decorated veteran . While the Constitution protects the rights of individuals to lie about themselves , it does NOT protect them to commit fraud with those lies . <p> Ryan Zull is a disgrace to his own service . I do n't  know why he was discharged and I really do n't  care . It is odd that his character of service and reason for separation were redacted . It seems to me that something really bad must have happened that they ca n't share whether it was honorable , dishonorable or general , in my opinion . <p> In the end , I 'm glad that we can give this Gold Star Mother and the people of St. Charles , MO , some closure and insight into this . <h> 11 Comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if a close friend wants you to use their criedt card details , I would recommend not doing it.If some random person offered you this , then its for sure illegal or shady . Stay away and protect yourself and the real victim ( the true owner of that criedt card ) . Besides , if you were to go forward and get away with it , then scammers like the person that sent you that number will just keep on scamming us good people ? Make sense ? Have a good day and Happy Holidays . <p> Ca n't he be charged " stolen valor act " I do believe so and I think he should be .. fraud yes but stolen valor act will be charged also . Sad when we have heros that truly are heros that need help and someone like this is going to burn people to the point that the good people that do dig deep to help will now hesitate . True heros will suffer due to this act of stupidity <p> He s being charged with fraud . The new Stolen Valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this law ca n't be used . The previous Stolen Valor Act was deemed , rightfully so , as unconstitutional . <p> DD214 does n't  lie . This is a true fraud . SKSA is a striker-not a storekeeper . He is under instruction to be a storekeeper . He is n't smart enough to be a good fraud . He has a cover in his hand with the correct CPO emblem but with a gold chin strap . CPOs have a black chin strap . Officers have gold chin straps .

You just need some cardboard , leather , a knife , free time , a smidge of artistic talent and ta dah . <p> But what if you only have one of the ingredients listed above ? <p> Then meet Qasarean . He bought a Glock 27 and could n't find a holster to fit his gun . At least locally . So , he decided to make a poor mans holster or a " bum holster .

Because the pistol outline is easily seen in jeans and can be even more apparent in khakis . <p> And that 's not even the bum holster ! <p> For that , you 'll need to acquire a more substantial block of cardboard . It should be about the size of the gun but not too big because it still has to fit into your pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceals its outline . Make it tight so the gun does n't  jiggle around too much . <p> This might work for some folks , but we think it looks like he s toting a steamy romance novel in his pocket , you know those bodice-ripping types with Fabio on the cover . " It looks like a book or a really big wallet , but you really cant tell what 's in here , " Qasarean observes . <p> So , how does one draw a weapon from that bum holster cardboard cutout mess ? <p> Obviously its not ideal for a fast-draw situation . Now that we think about it , there are plenty of situations where a cardboard holster is just straight-up absurd and a little on the unsafe side . <p> Now if you own a Glock 27 and are looking for a *real* holster , GunHolsters.com hosts a bevy of gun holsters including a ridiculously affordable inside-pocket holster from Blackhawk ( $8.99 ) . <p> What do you think about the poor mans holster ?

@@96509722 @709722/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> SFC Zeke <p> Today , I listened to the advice of more than a few people and finally went to the TMC and Combat Stress hospital . My right hand has n't  stopped twitching after nearly a month and its beyond irritating . I 'm not sleeping , not eating , and highly irritable . Ive been under a lot of stress and feel like many of those above me are just making things worse . <p> So , for three hours today , I sat and got to revisit many issues related to my PTSD , depression , and anxiety as well as some new ones . While waiting to speak with one of the case workers , I had the opportunity of sitting down with " SFC Zeke . " <p> Zeke looked very busy when I entered the room , but could tell immediately I was there for business . He set aside his distraction and gave me his complete attention . He did n't  say a word . Just sat there and listened to me . He did n't  judge me ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 5 minutes , Zeke did what few others could do having just met me he calmed me down and made me feel like I was worth listening to . I want to introduce you to Zeke : <p> " SFC Zeke " is a Vet Dog . These dogs are raised from puppyhood around the military . They are used to the sounds , the business , and the chaos that accompanies military service . They use Labs , which are the most laid back and gentle dogs . <p> When I walked into the room , Zeke was going to town on his bone . He looked up , saw me , and I kid you not placed the bone off to the side in an " its time to go to work " fashion . He was no longer focused on his chew toy , but on his patientme . While it sounds hokey , I can now see the value in having these dogs in a combat zone . <p> Zeke has a busy schedule . He frequently visits other FOBs and checkpoints to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and working dogs . It was refreshing to be human again for awhile and just pet a real dog . We are n't  supposed to mess with the animals around here because of fears about rabies . Dogs have a way of calming your nerves and reminding you what normal is supposed to look like . <p> Zeke did just that and I 'm glad I got to hang out with him today . It was definitely a much better day . And I found a group of troops here to meet with on a regular basis for continued therapy . <p> What a wonderful story to read from a deployed Soldier , and at the same time , what a wonderful story for a deployed story to " have " to tell . I can specially relate to how pets have the unique ability to make us feel human in a world of chaos , loneliness , business , stress , and everything else ( that has and does not have a name ) we experience during deployments . Our TMC had two dogs , and our MiTT had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dogs but wow , did they make a difference in our days ! Thank you for sharing your story with us . <p> God bless you brave soldier ! You are doing such important duty , but you also have to take care of yourself and your family . No one is happy if you turn into a basket case , excuse me . You have to be strong for yourself and family . I would seek out others and you will see that you are not alone , although only soldiers or those in war zones could truly empathize with what you have went through . OK so you know talking about things seems to me like a never ending circle , getting me no further along in life . How about you , it seems like a CD skipping in place , although that is an old analogy perhaps , or even much older a record w a scratch . So to move forward there are many options , reupping , retraining , entering society w so many other military . I have a business idea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . It is strictly legitimate at home or away even through the internet potentially or direct marketing of an incredible product . The company provides instant benefits , plus pays 100% commission , and offers the opportunity for incredible residual LONG ... income through the matrix program . This is no scam the company has been around since 1920s . God bless all of our brave courageous soldiers and their families ! Have a great and please safe holiday ! <p> I am an animal lover as are my three kids they are adults now my daughter is 21 yrs my two sons are 23 and mike just turned 25 . Mike graduated from high school in June of 2004 and enlisted in the Navy . He excelled in his training and loved his job . He also was a patriot Michael was a good kid turned Man.After four years Mike was offered a bonus to reinlist and A very important position in his chosen field.Mike was a CTR petty officer 1st class . He was attached to a teem of eliet seals and did his job very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Afghanistan and he was killed by a RPG that struck the CH-47Chinook that was transporting him in the Wardak Province , Afghanistan . The single most devistating , tragity in my other two childrens and my life ! ! When we were making arrangements for Mikes funeral we just knew that an organization called NEADS was what he would have wanted . In short this charitable org.traines K-9s for solders who come home from war and have tramatic injuries , disabilaties , and so on . It takes aprox Thirty thousand dollars to train one dog then this wonderfull organization Gives the dog to a needy war vetran free of charge ! <p> I do n't  think I could live without a dog in our household . We 've had a pet dog ever since I was born . No matter how mad or sad or aggravated I am I can go pet and sit next to Argos ( our current dog ) and just chill out . I 've heard and read that dogs can sense a persons mood and I would stand by that statement just based on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , they do n't  keep a grudge . You 're yelling at them one minute to get out of the garbage and then next minute they are up in your face , licking you . <p> I never wouldve thought that they trained and had these vet dogs . I think that 's awesome . <p> A big WOW for this . I was touched with your story . This story is unique having a dog or what I call him therapeutic dog . Unlike humans , they are there to listen and sit with you , no negative comments no harsh statements but his presence and a sweet look from Zeke . I truly believe need a dog like him too . You awe Zeke a lot thinking he has a very busy schedule . <p> CJ , I am so happy that someone had the insight to make dogs accessible to u guys out there . For a sec I thought u were back home . I am a Female cop with PTSD and have hidden it from my supervisors . BUT I HAVE A DOG . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitting rabies out there is a fact but I know if I was out there I would not care . Death is so much part of the climate where our troops are they need the unconditional love and interaction of a pet , it also brings them back home and back to being human and so much more . TODAY IS VETERANS DAY , I WANT TO THANK ALL WHO HAVE SACRIFICE SO MUCH FOR US HERE AT HOME . I KNOW YOUR FAMILY HAVE MISSED YOU ALL SO MUCH AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOST TIME . MY WISH IS YOU ALL WHO ARE SERVING COME HOME , BE SAFE , THANK YOU . <p> That 's a beautiful story which brought me to tears . Animals are wonderful in that they 're not caught up in all the mad trappings that life demands ; they 're more " human " than most humans . Glad Zeke was able to help you gain a little peace and perspective . A fabulous animal , man and program best to all = <p> CJ this means so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Blind ( sister charity with Vet Dogs ) and have raised 4 pups so far Zeke was our first ! This was about 4 years ago we raised him for the first year of his life . He was raised as a " future guide dog " but was re-routed to be a therapy dog while in training after he left our home . Reading this blog completely makes it worth all the poo cleaning , shoe-chewing , etc and makes me so grateful to have been a part of helping so many people . Please give Zeke a hug for us , we miss him ! And SFC Albert , if you meet him my sister raised him . They are both wonderful dogs and we are so happy to know that they are so helpful and loved . Thank you so much for everything you all do and thank you for sharing this story . Its the little stories like this that make it all worth it . <p> We are black lab owners and are glad that you enjoyed SFC Zekes special brand of therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we all appreciate everything you do , every day , in every way for your service ! We could not thank you enough even if we tried ! <p> Glad you met Zeke but what did the Doc do for you ? I have hand tremors too and mine started 5 days after my second mastectomy ( I know you never had that problem though ) . Doc put me on Primidone and it caused me to lose memory at times and to have flashbacks . I finally got him to take me off that med and so far I am better but still have the tremors . I can live with tremors better than being forgetful . <p> WARNING ; When something like this works . Its already been proven time and time again , the Veterans Administration will turn it down because of cost . Do n't  get to confortable becaue when not if they cut the K-9 program for us with PDSD your PDSD will come back twice the level it was . Check the history , If something works that well , the V.A . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knows . Hang in there warriors . <p> Americas VetDogs , for whom SFC Zeke " works , " is a nonprofit organization that is not connected with the VA . Therefore , as long as people continue to support Americas VetDogs through donations and volunteer work , there is no chance that these combat stress control dogs and therapy dogs will go away . <p> L.J . the VA just approved that dogs can be used for service dogs and that they are on board with this . Us as Veterans have to fight for the things we want , and not be so quick to just let them take things . As someone else stated Americas Vet Dogs is not affiliated with the VA at all and are strictly for the Veteran . <p> CJ , I only learned about you and this blog when this one was re-posted this morning by Soldiers Angels Germany . I am so glad they did . I am so pleased to " meet " you , and I am so grateful to you for sharing this blog . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for you and how this wonderful dog was able to reach you , touch you , even nurture you in a way that another human being perhaps could n't . I am SO glad you did listen to the advice of a few wise people and go , so that you could have this experience . I hope that you continue to visit SFC Zeke as often as you can ! <p> At my last job I worked with another school social worker who brought her therapy dog to school with her . Clancy was the best , and whenever we had a meeting and he was there , I 'd be sitting on the floor with Clancy . Initially I thought , being a dog person , that I was just petting this very sweet dog . But in reality he was working with me ; in his own way bolstering me up so that I had that much more " stuff " ( energy ? ) to return to my school and do my job . <p> I am so sorry it has been pretty rough for you lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , and soon . I 'm hoping that besides SFC Zeke , you were able to gain other solutions , short term or long term . CJ , like Sharon said I hope you will be able to look into getting your own vet dog like SFC Zeke once you are back home . Meanwhile , hopefully you can visit him as often as you are able ! <p> You have done a lot of good by sharing this with all of us I am going to share this so more are aware . I only became aware of some of what our men and women are actually experiencing since my son was wounded last June . I want everyone to be aware , so that we all can be supportive towards every vet we know and meet . You are doing us all a great service and for that and all of your sacrifices , I thank you . And thank you for this blog site , and this post . You and all the troops are in my prayers daily . Sending best wishes and a good strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Great story ! I hope your okay my friend I have been really worried about you as of late ! I am glad that SFC Zeke was able to give you some of that comfort you needed ! It is true that animals have a way of knowing what we need sometimes . Just know buddy if you need anything I am always there for you brother ! Please Tell SFC Zeke I said Hi when you next see him ! <p> Hi CJ- I 'm sorry to hear that you 've been having an especially difficult time but am very glad that you got to meet SFC Zeke . Dogs are so amazing and as therapy animals , ca n't be beat . What you described is just how sensitive they are . You walked in , sat down and he knew you needed him , so he came over to you . There are programs that train dogs to assist combat vets who struggle with PTSD . Maybe when you get home you would consider looking into applying for one . In the meantime , hang in there and try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . Remember that lots of us back here love you and send you prayers and lots of positive energy . All my best , Sharon <p> CJ , I love this post ! Like LL , I worry about you and am so glad you made this decision . Will continue to keep you in my prayers &amp; now I 'll add SFC Zeke , cause he has an important job , too at which it seems he s very good ! Sending love &amp; hugs . <p> Oh , CJ , that is the sweetest face ! I 'm so glad you took the time to take care of YOU and to allow SFC Zeke love you in the unconditional manner that dogs have . Just reading this post made ME feel better because I &lt;3 you and worry about you . Things will always be up and down , but when you recognize you need some support , your willingness to go get it speaks volumes about you . <p> I am a marine corps gulf war vet .

I 've always tried to counsel junior Soldiers that Ive heard complain about their unit and talk about getting out of the Army . I tell them that the Army is comprised of a number of different people and no one unit is like another . Good and bad leaders come and go . We can learn from both and become better leaders ourselves through watching them . My mantra in dealing with bad leaders is " its a temporary pain . " <p> I feel the same about our country . Were hurting right now , but I know its a temporary pain . Unlike in many countries , we have the ability to change the direction every two years ( four years for the executive branch ) . Many people may be discouraged , but remember that the pain is temporary . I love me some Merica and you should too !

Outside the building , they brought in a Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey to display . <p> The main atrium was converted into a veteran-centered showcase of flags and vintage military items from the conflict . The main floor was packed with every chair filled and people standing in the back all around the atrium .

He s obviously got self esteem issues since he does n't  allow comments on his diarrhetic writings . Troops who have actually been in a combat theater as part of a deployment know about the stresses of these deployments , regardless of their every day mission or whether they leave the wire . Everyone deals with their own version of " norms " and stress . No one can ever understand that unless they are actually deployed . Even an embedded journalist or opinionated writer simply has zero idea about it unless he or she was actually deployed as a Soldier . There are two types of people : those that do and there are those that write about those that do . <p> In order to deal with those stresses , there are various things we do to pass the time or distract ourselves .

I had one of the guys film one of my goes at it and I put the video up on YouTube to showcase the oddball things we do to ease the tension between mortar attacks . <p> Because there are dishonorable and disreputable people out there that try to make things into something they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took the video down because the purpose behind it was being bastardized by idiots . Well , now idiots like " Archslayer " are taking these libelous acts by other idiots and making them known . <p> Jonn Lilyea : American Legion endorsed Mil-kook gone mad or simply a hit man ( his weapona keyboard ) for the Orwellians ( which the American Legion is an intricate part of ) . It did n't  take long for us to figure out just how screwed up in the head this outspoken " poser " with a keyboard was . We saw others speaking truth about him on the internet , and it was n't pretty . A classic case of embedded psychological issues breaking through to the surface with each post or comment he has made . He cant hide his hidden side anylonger . <p> That 's right ; the moron using a screenshot of me from the previously described video is accusing me of being Jonn Lilyea or maybe accusing Jonn of being me ? <p> But , it gets better . <p> While " on duty " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a decorated Vietnam Veteran who is also a victim of PTSD ) . Using the same bundle of lies his Facebook counterparts " the slayers " used to justify their assaults on Dallas . All of them ( the Orwellians ) stand for nothing honorable , they enjoy attacking anyone they dislike , and Dallas was on their hit list , so this jerk joined them with his American Legion endorsed blog " Burn Pit " . Slashing , scratching , foaming at the mouth type of illogical rantings ; with NO basis in fact . <p> What I have always found interesting about people like this " Archslayer " and his role model that I wont name is their obvious hypocrisy . They complain about me ( or someone else ) criticizing veterans while , themselves , criticizing veterans . What 's worse is that they complain that I , a combat veteran , am criticizing another combat veteran forgetting that the person complaining to begin was never and will never be a combat veteran . <p> The entire post is just full of mistaken identity and ignorance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY FROM CYBER-BULLYS " is , itself , basically cyber-bullying meor Jonnor someone else entirelyIm still confused about that . <p> For example , the " Archslayer " says , " Of course money exchanged between them for whatever purpose they may have come up with ( it costs money to order FOIAs ) , it still seems to constitutes a conspiracy to commit a crime . " That 's simply not true . I 've never had to pay for a FOIA . FOIA fees are generally waived for writers and journalists most of the time . <p> We love the fact that scumbuckets like Jonn Jonn and his partner in crime Mark Seavey have given us all we need by their own words in their American Legion endorsed blog " Burn Pit " . Check this out , and tell us that this " person " represents you . Homophobic , hates women , attacks fellow veterans with no concern for truth . Like we said classic case here in Jonn Jonn . <p> Jonn Jonn says " faggots and women are unfit for combat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is actually a very good statement that " Jonn Jonn " can use in a libel suit since he has never expressed these opinions . I 'm pretty sure Jonn never uttered those words . In fact , those statements were lifted from another writer when he posted them about me . Looks like the " Archslayer " is just doubling down on a lie . Instead of identifying the proper person the lie is about , he s now lying about the person to whom the lie is attributed . Yeah , makes my head spin too . Maybe both writers are just completely stupid and ignorant as to what quotations signify and that 's why they bracketed that statement in them . I do n't  know . <p> Lawsuits are the beginning . Warning to all involved even as support , you are putting yourself out there as supporting the attacks on fellow veterans . <p> Methinks someone should heed their own warnings ; the lawsuit game is a double-edged sword . <h> One Comment on " Einhorn is Finkle ; Finkle is Einhorn " <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LILYEA and http : //www.thisainthell.us . This person is mentally disturbed and suffersdaily . Living in Fort Ashby , West Virginia , I have known this nutjob for several years now and can only say that the local State Police cant wait to put him away . I heard and saw that he is now almost crippled and cant walk or drive . He uses a bedrest to go to the bathroom in a portable potty and has several attachments by his bedside to get him out of the bed to his keyboard in the morning . I do not feel sorry for him and wish that God helps him pass quickly and without pain . He has done much wrong in this life and will suffer the consequences later . I hope his lesbian daughter and gay son will forgive him .

They are good for moving about and other tasks where a free hand is needed , like opening open doors , leading people to safety and/or holding a flashlight .

The shotgun is for defense of the safe room , and the pistol is there to move around the house if needed . On my shotgun , I have- a shotshell holder- with extra buckshot and a few slugs .

Each has its role to play . My primary plan is to get everyone to the safe room ASAP and wait there with my shotgun until help arrives .

For 2012 , there have been 131 potential active-duty suicides : 80 have been confirmed as suicides and 51 remain under investigation . Active-duty suicide number for 2011 : 165 confirmed as suicides and no cases under investigation . <p> To be honest , I was a bit frustrated initially that we were going to sit through yet another suicide prevention briefing , only longer ! After all , the Armys solution to every problem is a Powerpoint presentation . What I found was a very well-executed and focused effort to legitimately address the causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several things that Ft . Hood did differently than in the past I think made todays training more meaningful and useful : classes were generally given to groups of no more than 20 troops and the instructors were mostly certified Master Resiliency Trainers . I 'm not sure if this is the way the entire post or the entire Army conducted the training , but this was my experience and observation . There were a lot of open-ended questions and I 'm pretty sure everyone had at least some input to the discussions . <p> Army Chief of Staff , General Raymond T. Odierno , sent out a message to his troops and leaders pleading for assistance in fighting this plague . <p> Today , our Army will stand down to conduct suicide prevention training . This is an opportunity to heighten awareness for Soldiers , Civilians , Families and communities about suicide threat factors , about the resources available for help , and about building resiliency across the force . <p> I can not overemphasize how important this issue is to me . Every life lost to suicide is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our Army . <p> We must work together to create a culture and an environment where people feel comfortable getting the behavioral health assistance that they need . Our Warrior Ethos states " I will never leave a fallen comrade . " I need everyone to take that to heart . Every individual contemplating suicide has a friend , Family member , or leader in the position to help . I need you all to get involved . Intervening requires personal courage and leadership . It is n't easy , but there is no room for bystanders . <p> We are a resilient Army , and we are committed to building our individual and collective strength physically , emotionally , socially , spiritually , and within our Families . You must continue to refine and apply the resiliency skills you learn . <p> Last week I visited Afghanistan , Djibouti , and the Sinai Peninsula where I had the opportunity to talk with , present awards to , and re-enlist Soldiers . I am so proud of and humbled by the dedication and professionalism I see throughout the Army on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important , and we will never waver on providing you the care and support you so rightly deserve . <p> Raymond T. Odierno General , 38th Chief of Staff United States Army <p> The strength of our Nation is our Army , The strength of our Army is our Soldiers , The strength of our Soldiers is our Families , This is what makes us Army Strong ! <p> Ive been very vocal on this blog and elsewhere about the need to take care of our troops and stem the tide of suicides . I 've shared my own experiences dealing with the demons that can torment the minds of combat veterans . And while there are still those that want to use my efforts against to score some sort of ego-driven point , I 've been fortunate that my writings have succeeding in gaining the trust and confidence a more than a few Soldiers I was able to talk away from cliff . <p> Suicide is preventable and I 'm glad that the training today focused largely on the fact that there is no shame in seeking help . Leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they foster an environment of trust and confidence . Good Charlotte has a great song out called , " Hold On . " From the beginning , the band notes that " this world is coldbut you do n't  have to go . " <p> Having been to the decision point of taking my own and making the wise decision instead to pick up a phone instead of picking up a gun , I can tell you firsthand that NOTHING in life is worth your life . There is so much out there that we are n't  aware of waiting for our influence . <p> One of the most important things Soldiers ( and anyone ) needs to really understand is that we have to recognize that when the thought of suicide is going through our minds , we are not thinking rationally . To this day , I look back on that dark night back in May 2010 and I 'm dumbfounded that I was even there . Sure , I can see all the signs leading up to that near-fatal decision in retrospect and I think , " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night seemed to have creeped up on me out of nowhere . It was a last-minute decision that would have probably shocked everyone . I do n't  think my leaders or fellow troops could have looked back and said , " ahh , if we have paid attention to this or that . " <p> There are so many resources available through the Army , each individual post , and the local community to help us deal with our combat traumas and other stresses of military and civilian life . Soldiers and families in need of crisis assistance can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline . Trained consultants are available 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year and can be contacted by dialing 1-800-273-TALK ( 8255 ) or by visiting their website at http : **35;705;TOOLONG . <p> Information about Military OneSource is located at http : **27;742;TOOLONG or by dialing the toll-free number 1-800-342-9647 for those residing in the continental United States . Overseas personnel should refer to the Military OneSource website for dialing instructions for their specific location . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make your life a living hell . Believe me , I get it quite often from people trying damage my reputation and military experiences . The key is not to place any value on those opinions . <p> There 's a catch phrase we Master Resiliency Trainers use called " hunt the good stuff . " One key to this is at the end of each day find three GOOD things that happened that day . Keep a daily journal of just these three events each day . They do n't  have to be stand out or special moments . It could be something as simple as " I did n't  hit a single red light today " or as meaningful as " A Soldier opened up to me about marital problems . " <p> We , as human beings , are experts at what we call " catastrophizing . " That 's taking one bad thing that happened at the start of the day or week and building the rest of our time around that single event . It probably has its roots from back in the days of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to look for all the things that could affect us in our environment . If were werent aware of the threats to our existence we would cease to be . <p> We do n't  have to be like that any longer . We have evolved to the point that most threats are mitigated . The suicide solution is no solution at all . If you find yourself in that position where your brain is telling you that life is just too much to take , call someone . Always keep the contact information of someone you trust with you at all times . If you make that fatal decision , you 'll NEVER know what happiness would have been like ; that happiness that you would have eventually achieved . <p> I truly hope that our leaders , especially our junior and senior NCOs and field grade officers really learned something today . I cant tell you how many Soldiers have come to me for help because they did n't  feel like their leaders cared . The impression was that their feelings would n't be taken seriously or would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraction . When a Soldier comes to you for help , be there for him . At that moment in time , there is nothing more important than the welfare of that Soldier . <p> Its okay for leaders not to have all the answers . Most of the time , they just need you to listen . But , know where to go and what resources are available ( see above ) in case you find that you cant handle a situation your Soldier is facing . <p> General Colin Powell once said , " The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them . They have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care . Either case is a failure of leadership . " Do n't  let that day ever come . <p> " The loss of any life is a tragedy , and this loss is preventable , " said Sergeant Major of the Army Ray Chandler . " As an organization , we 've taken huge strides in providing our Soldiers , Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid in suicide prevention , but our work is n't done . Army leaders will continue to do everything we can to reverse these trends . " <h> 3 Comments on " Suicide Prevention Stand Down " <p> Good post . Ive been to too many funerals as a result of suicide . Civilian or not , the quote that has stuck with me the most , that i find myself repeating was said at a civilians funeral , by his father : " Suicide is the most selfish thing you can ever do . " Its true . I hope help and support for veterans increases and that those who are having the thoughts step forward .

NBC has now set its sights on gun owners , seeking to create more government bureaucracy and instituting more gun control .

This is also the same " news agency " another one of the " news agencies " that fabricated Bush 43s Texas National Guard records . Why the sudden fixation with Remington ? Its just one step towards their supposed desire for more government control over our constitutional rights . <p> You can view NBCs " Remington Under Fire : A CNBC Investigation " story on their website . here 's the hit piece that CNBC aired recently : <p> Think about what Cohn is reporting here .

@@96509753 @709753/ <h> Q&amp;A : Tactical Clothing Designer Dan Bergeron <p> In his everyday wear , one would never guess Dan Bergeron was an accomplished designer of military and tactical gear . Flip flops , shorts and a T-shirt are his usual warm-weather attire . The only tip-off ? His Suunto watch . <p> Recently we chatted with Bergeron via email about his past , present and the future of tactical gear . <p> How did you get into designing tactical clothing ? <p> I happened to be in the right place at the right time . I always had an interest in how gear and clothing was made , but a curiosity more than anything else . In 2002 I was working for Arc'teryx Equipment in Vancouver . The company caters to the outdoor sporting goods market and had almost no experience with the military and tactical markets . That is , until we were invited to submit one of our packs for a Marine Corps effort to replace the failing MOLLE system . I was tasked with the project as I had availability and some military background . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid with our design . Interest in our products from the military community grew exponentially , and we had to fill their needs with specific products . <p> Although we had a huge design talent pool in the company , all of the resources were allocated to other projects at the time . I gleaned what I could from other designers , managed to squeeze a bit of help out of them to get me started , and then got to training myself with patterning and sewing . Initially , I had more interest in and was more proficient with backpacks and other gear , but eventually both interest and skill level shifted to apparel . From the military market , we expanded into the tactical and law enforcement markets . After Arc'teryx , I continued honing my skills as a consultant for BAE Systems , Eagle Industries and Propper , among others . I co-founded 782 Gear with Brian Abrams ( formerly of Adventure Tech ) and Dave Ruiz ( of TNF ) , but the economy was tough for start-ups , and I left to take the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inspiration ? <p> It really depends on the product . Sometimes it comes gradually as I work through the technical requirements and constraints of the product , working through a process of elimination as I try a variety of solutions . I end up with a few possibilities that make sense technically , and I work with that to make it look as good as it can . <p> Other times , I just get a vision of the product and how I want it to look and to perform , often with an amazing clarity of details . The challenge then is figuring out how to build that product from a patterning and engineering point of view . I must say I do spend a lot of time just thinking about products . I guess to an outside observer it must look as if I 'm not doing much , but it 's hard to confine the creative process to a 9-to-5 job . Sometimes the best ideas come during weekends or evenings , away from the distractions of emails and phone calls and endless meetings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment ? <p> The very first step is ensuring that you 're designing and building the product to answer a defined set of requirements . If you do n't know why you 're designing something , it will not have a defined purpose . The designer can define the requirements based on his or her own experience or ideas , or the requirements can come from the consumer side . Either way , by far , the most important part of the process is defining the concept for the product . That part is the hardest to describe . Like I said earlier , it can be a flash of inspiration , or it can be a very mechanical process of elimination of possibilities . <p> Once the concept has been fleshed out , you choose the materials , and in some cases , design the materials to suit your design . It 's important that the materials you 're going to use are selected early on as the supply chain has its own lead time to deal with , and you do n't want the product ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most cases , you also have to pick the factory you 're going to work with to build the production lot . You then decide what assembly method you 're going to use , i.e. the type of seams and sewing equipment . Not all factories operate the same equipment , and if you plan to use any specialized assembly method , you need to ensure there 's a factory ready and able to do it . <p> Only then do you build the structure of the product itself how it fits , the amount of ease built in , the main seam lines , etc . Some of that dictates the feature set , and some is dictated by the feature set . It 's an iterative process and usually takes three or four tries to get it about right . The pockets , waistbands , cuffs , collars that all comes last . I usually wait until the product is perfect in the base size to do the grading to all the other sizes in the range . Grading is just as important as the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold will not be in the base size . At that point production engineering takes over and runs the interface with the factory to get the item produced in large quantities . <p> What do you find most challenging about designing military clothing ? <p> It actually has nothing to do with the product itself . The most challenging part is committing the necessary resources to product development efforts in general , which may or may not lead to a successful bid for military contracts . It 's a risk that a lot of managers are unwilling to take because it 's hard to quantify the return on investment . It makes justifying my job difficult sometimes , but it 's a key part of a winning strategy . Companies need to have a part of the business simply bid on made-to-specification products , and they need a part that takes more risk and develops innovative products that sets them apart . <p> So if you have dedicated resources for product development , and you can start designing well ahead of the actual solicitation for products , the most challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My background and experience is very technical , with high-end fabrics and construction techniques . If I did n't have to think about cost , I could do so much more to the product 's performance , but the reality of a large customer like the military is that cost does matter significantly . It 's not that I ca n't design for a lower cost of production , but I constantly have to remind myself about it . <p> Name a designer who continues to inspire you ? <p> I do n't think there 's one designer in particular , but I 'd have to say I have tremendous respect and admiration for the field of architecture . Good architects are master designers dealing with far more complex products ' then we do in the textile business . The ability to visualize something in 3D and then transform that vision into a reality is both inspiring and humbling . Sometimes I think my job is a bit difficult when faced with a particularly complex backpack frame system or intricate seam work on a waterproof shell . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entire buildings , and I really have nothing to complain about ! <p> What is the most difficult material to work with and why ? <p> I 'm not that great with knits I 'm getting better the more I work with them , but I still prefer wovens . Knits stretch and shrink , sometimes inconsistently , and so finding the right fit with a knit is more challenging . Knits are also generally not as durable , and they 're harder to handle in a manufacturing setting . In the tactical market , it 's not such a big deal though because most of the fabrics are wovens . <p> In your opinion , what is the best product you 've designed ? <p> It 's hard to rank your own work , but I do have my favorites When I was at Arc'teryx Equipment setting up their LEAF department , I designed a backpack that was jump capable with a chute attachment built right into the frame of the bag itself . It was made to carry a heavy load comfortably , which none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't very high , it was a perfect answer to a very specific and difficult problem . We executed it very well , and I really enjoyed the challenge that the product presented . <p> As far as clothing goes , I 'd say it 's the jacket I did about a year ago in response to the Marine Corps ' call-out for APECS parkas with integrated liners . I do n't think the project was fully funded the Corps was simply looking at potential suppliers to evaluate feasibility but I designed a waterproof/breathable parka and liner that was pretty much state-of-the-art . Unfortunately it 's never been commercialized because we were waiting on the Corps ' RFP , which never came . The design is Propper 's IP , and I do n't know what they plan to do with it , if anything . It would be a shame if it just sat on a shelf and never made it to the market . <p> What innovation has you most excited ? <p> Social media and the Internet in general , or more to the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not exactly new , but it 's expanding at an incredible pace , and it makes keeping track of trends and other innovation that much easier . Knowing what 's going on in the market is a key part of the job . It 's essential to product lifecycle management when to introduce a new product or technology , knowing when it 's obsolete , making sure you stay ahead of your competition . It 's all made easier because of the way we communicate today . <p> It also means that things are moving much faster than they used to , and in a way , it 's challenging and exciting . Markets are fragmenting and blending , and products are available from sources worldwide . One has to design with this new global economy in mind . And at the end of the day , it 's the consumer who stands to gain from this because the product offering is consequently a lot better and gets refreshed more often . <p> I know you were probably looking for something to do with garment technology like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but frankly there just is n't that much that 's stimulating out there . There are some material suppliers with new textiles or widgets , but it 's nothing outside the box or trendsetting . <p> What do you think is the next big trend in tactical clothing ? <p> In the military , the current push for better value in fire protection , and the ongoing saga with camouflage and signature management will both continue for years to come . I think the development we 're going to see emerge is for chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( CBRN ) protection at the soldier level . There 's more and more effort with broad scope R&amp;D , and it 's finding its way from the labs to the field . In fact , recent efforts from the military acquisition branches have specified requirements for chem-bio protection in organizational gear such as water management and purification . Eventually soon it 'll affect what the soldier wears . <p> In the tactical arena , I think the move to consolidate into larger players will continue and accelerate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere . Costs are going up with materials and labor , and it 's making it impossible for the smaller companies to compete . We 've seen some important consolidations recently with manufacturers , and I think we 'll see some more with the service providers for the market . Product-wise , I think the diversification and fragmentation of the product offering will intensify as everyone keeps looking for their own , unique style . To position yourself for this new reality , you have to be able to turn product faster than ever and in smaller runs . Companies that have the capital to support a manufacturing component able to meet this demand should find a larger market share , and we should see some brands go out of business . <p> What are some of your favorite products on the market right now ? <p> This list could be pretty long , but I 'll limit it to a few : <p> Benchmade knives for their entire body of work . <p> Crye Precision I particularly like their armor collection . <p> The entire Arc'teryx LEAF collection I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I hope I can find some more projects that could use Polartec PowerShield Pro fabrics . It 's a great technology that could make a real impact on the tactical outerwear market and I 'm looking forward to designing more garments with it . <p> I think the Kitanica collection has an interesting visual component to it . It 's a bold design that balances what I 'm trying to do on the market , and there 's certainly a place for it . <p> I 'd like to see Cloudveil or Black Diamond Equipment get into the tactical glove market . Their products on the outdoors side are truly state-of-the-art , and they could do well if they applied those ideas to tactical applications . <p> What direction are you taking with your own set of designs ? Is there a trend or recurring theme ? <p> I 'm trying to focus on creating unity within collections or groupings of products . It 's very important in most consumer goods markets , but for some reason its importance gets downplayed in the tactical market . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature of a brand , and exploiting this goes a long way towards cross selling products . For example , a base layer line can have the same color blocking as the utility uniform or outerwear layers . If it 's distinctive enough , people will recognize and associate a product to its collection , and by extension to its brand . Another example might be to use a specific style of pocket shape on a military uniform and carry it across to the ballistic vest or the load bearing pack . <p> Another style I like to work with these days is the use of angles on garments . It gives garments an interesting visual element that I try to exploit technically as well . But you know , most designers go through periods using certain design elements and then move on to another style . I 've used a lot of curves at one time . Right now it 's angles . Who knows what it 'll be tomorrow . Certainly one theme that 's been consistent is that I keep my designs to a minimum . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it subdued and simple . I 'm more Apple than PC , more Porsche than Hummer . <p> Do you dress tactical on a day-to-day basis ? <p> Not at all . You 'll usually find me in flip flops , shorts and a t-shirt , weather permitting . Otherwise I 'm in jeans or cords and my beat up Salomon runners . For me it 's about comfort . I do n't evolve in a tactical environment every day , and I do n't need to dress with tactical clothing . For those days when I do need more utilitarian or sturdy clothes , I like to wear my Genuine Gear tactical pants and a light softshell or a zip-neck sweater . <p> What are you working on currently ? <p> I just left my position as Design Director at Propper International , and honestly I do n't really know what 's in store for me next . Most likely I will go back to doing some contract design work for while I 'm already in touch with a few potential clients . Eventually though I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of product development seriously and where I can put my talents to good use . I have a lot of ideas on how to make tactical gear better and certainly more interesting . I 'd like to find a company to work with that 's going to allow me to do that .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post because of the Bronze Star citation that he uses in his own , most recent " dispatch " and yet in 18 months of me proving him a flat out liar and manipulator , he has never ONCE countered anything I 've had to say . That right there speaks volumes . <p> NOT ! ! <p> A couple of the multiple definitions of fiction on dictionary.com are : the act of feigning , inventing , or imagining an imaginary thing or event , postulated for the purposes of argument or explanation <p> I have to say , I think Michael Yon prefers the term " writer " because he covers his own butt by conveniently leaving out the " fictional " part of fictional writer . His imagination and postulations are quite absurd , so fictional writer is the only reasonable explanation . He can not be called a reporter or journalist because those things imply some sort of ethical framework by which the writer does basic research and/or withholds a story until inconsistencies are explained . Only a fictional writer would have us suspend reality for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence " of any kind of misdeeds . <p> Michael Yon recently posted CJ Grishams incomplete records . I have a few points to make , and these may get tedious , but as you know from previous posts that I do about Yon , I prefer the truth to deceit , disinformation , and fabrication , so I will hit as many points as necessary to drive home the point that Yon is full of crap . <p> 1 . On the first page , under Branch of Service and serial/service number(s) : CJ is listed as Army Reserve . <p> BUZZ <p> Wrong , he was and continues to be Active Duty Army . Which is why he has no need of a DD214 . Those are only issued after a soldier gets out of the military . <p> 2 . Dates of Service : January 18 , 1995 to February 2 , 2004 . <p> BUZZ <p> Wrong , as stated above , he is still Active Duty Army . But interesting thing here , and pay very close attentionif you go to page 4 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date listed under Section VII : Current and Previous Assignments , there is the date 02 02 04 . Now , whoever put that first page together must have misread the date as DDMMYY or MMDDYY instead of YYMMDD because if you look at the lines preceding that entry , it is obvious the YEAR is listed first ( 95 01 18 , 95 01 26 , etc ) . And Yon jumped on that incorrect date hardcore because he s looking for " evidence " that CJ Grisham did not earn a Bronze Star with V. Except that final date is February 4 , 2002 , so the Bronze Star award would not show up because the timeframe that CJ earned it was in 2003 . Wrap your mind around that people . 02 02 04 is the date that CJ signed into HHOC , 103RD MI BN , FT . Stewart , GA , as you can tell by the line before , he was " en route " from a school to a new unit . <p> 3 . Duty Status : Discharged <p> BUZZ <p> See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entry : Jacksonville , FL <p> BUZZ <p> That should be San Antonio , TX , and the Place of Separation , again , see points 1 and 2 . <p> 6 . Under Awards , Decorations , and Campaigns , by the time CJ headed to Ft . Stewart , GA in 2002 , he had already earned the MSM . <p> Today , most recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal are field grade officers ( pay grades O-4 to O-6 ) , senior warrant officers ( W-3 to W-5 ) , senior noncommissioned officers ( E-7 to E-9 ) , foreign military personnel in the ranks of O-6 and below , citation needed and individuals who have displayed a level of service that warrants an award of such magnitude . To receive this medal the individual must exhibit exceptionally meritorious service at that level of responsibility . <p> Now I am going to say a few things here . See , CJ Grisham does NOT want to have to put this information out there and I had to ask ( and somewhat beg upon our friendship ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and have about him . He prefers to not go out there sharing stuff willy-nilly as if he deserves some accolades for just doing his job , taking care of his soldiers , bringing them home safely . But I am PISSED OFF that Michael Yon is such a tool that he feels compelled to not only put out this information , he also needs to twist the facts around . But he s a master of twisting the truth . I 've proved it over and over again . You can see all of it here and here and here . This Ai n't  Hell has also covered Yons releasing of this information here . <p> And if you doubt my contention that Yon intentionally misleads his followers and readers , I want you to see what he posted on his Facebook page in the spring . <p> Pay attention to the writing at the bottom of the screen shot Yon posted and his comments and the reaction of his readers ( the few you can see ) . Check the date , 4/19/12 . Then go read his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link to him ) , dated 4/25/12 and you will see how he very conveniently cut off that part of the picture , where CJ indicates on twitter that he s ready for the zombie apocalypse with his Ka-Bar pistol bayonet . There is nothing but intention in that editing , to put CJ in the worst light possible , and even worse , to deceive his readers into believing CJ Grisham is a dangerous man . <p> Not only is Michael Yon so completely incompetent and unschooled in reading military records to such an extent that he can not even see the obvious problems of what he posted , he actively participates in dishonest and malicious personal attacks . That says volumes about the kind of person he is . <p> Finally , with reluctant permission from CJ , I am posting this . It speaks for itself . The only thing blocked out is CJs SSN handwritten in the upper right corner . <p> CJ is , and always will be , a better man than Michael Yon . It has to eat at him that CJ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing he can do to change that . He can lie , he distort facts , but HE will always know the truth , and that eats at him . <p> Either that or he s certifiably insane , because I can think of no other reason for him to lie or harass people the way he has . <p> The question will undoubtedly be , " why did n't  you just give Yon the proof in the first place ? " My answer is simple : why should i ? I have nothing to prove . I know what I 've done and so do my troops and leaders . Mr. Yons constant and insatiable obsession is not something I care to give any attention . Time and again he has leveled blatantly false and misleading accusations againsy me that were unfounded . <p> His incessant stream of accusatory emails to me is evidence of a demented man with projection issues . If I took the time to respond to every single inquiry and accusation from Yon and his sycophantic followers I would never have time for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NCO spends 90% of his time with 10% of his troops because there is always that 10% getting into trouble or needed exfra training . Yon is like that 10% but i wont dedicate any time to him . <p> I do n't  know if my refusal to entertain his obsession has left him feeling jolted and grasping at straws . I told him I would give him all yhe evidence he wanted through his attorney Nd he refused to accept that offer . Instead , HE told ME to stop stalking him and go away . He then began his emailing demanding proof of his false accusations and published known lies about me . <p> If this does n't  once and for all settle the question of Yons credibility then nothing will . After all , there will always be those that fawn over the drug-addicted rock stars regardless of their fall of grace . There are still those that Obama was a great president and the country is better off today . You ca n't fix stupid . <p> So , while I did n't  want to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Oh .. LOOK ! ! ! The date of the action 20 March 2003OHMYGOSHCould it be ? ? ! The SAME day that Jessica Lynch saw her action as well that Yon has harped on and on about like white on rice for months ? Oh myNOW will he stop talking about my husband like he s the one married to him and not me ? I have NEVER in my life seen a man crush as big as i have seen someone like Yon has had on Cj in my entire life . 
@@96509758 @709758/ <p> A six-month investigation by the Austin American-Statesman of Texas ' Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who died after leaving the military found that an alarmingly high percentage died from prescription drug overdoses , toxic drug combinations , suicide and single-car crashes " a largely unseen pattern of early death that federal authorities are failing to adequately track . emphasis mine <p> The age of those Texan veterans dying wasnt due to old age at all . In fact , the median age was just 28 years old , according to the report . If that 's the MEDIAN age , too many Texans are dying too young after serving their nation in combat . <p> The military is trying to deal with the prescription medication issue while still on active duty . Any Soldier in the Army that is prescribed 4 or more medications , one of which is an anti-depressant or narcotic , must see a separate doctor to manage those prescriptions and verify they are necessary and wont put troops in danger . This is not a one-time deal either . Troops meet often with the medication specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these troops are put in the " high risk " category and closely watched . Its nothing to be ashamed of . I fall into that category and I welcome the extra attention to ensure that I 'm not filling my body with anything that may harm me down the road . <p> One of the problems , I think , is that many troops with PTS have it as the result of a traumatic event that resulted in injury . Because of the injury , many troops are on pain killers as well as anti-depressants a potentially dangerous combination . Combine those with sleeping aids and the cocktail is that much more potent . <p> However , I 'm not sure if that is the same course of action being pursued by the VA once troops leave active duty . I 'm also not sure if all services manage prescriptions medications and follow their troops the way the Army is . The article makes it sound as if the VA does n't  really care why troops are dying . <p> The Department of Veterans Affairs , which serves nearly half of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shortcoming that critics say prevents it from understanding the scope of the problems facing those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan . <p> This is the problem . We hear a lot of lip service coming out of Washington about how we need to take care of our troops and more than 11 years after combat action began we still are n't  taking care of our veterans medical needs . <p> Here is what the six-month investigation by the Austin American-Statesman found : <p> " More than one in three died from a drug overdose , a fatal combination of drugs , or suicide . Their median age at death was 28 . <p> " Nearly one in five died in a motor vehicle crash . <p> " Among those with a primary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder , the numbers are even more disturbing : 80 percent died of overdose , suicide or a single vehicle crash . Only two of the 46 Texas veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts with a PTSD diagnosis died of natural causes , according to the analysis . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died since coming home is equal to nearly two-thirds of the state 's casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan . But that only includes veterans who have sought VA benefits , meaning the total number of deaths is likely much larger . <p> This is unacceptable and our elected officials need to hear our voices . When retired General Eric Shinseki took over the VA in 2009 he made promises during his confirmation hearing about transforming the VA into a veteran-focused entity , treating us as " clients " that deserve the respect organizations give their clients . <p> As Senator Wicker mentioned earlier , there are three fundamental attributes for me that mark the start point of framing a 21st century organization for Veterans Affairs . Itll be people-centric . It must be results-driven . And , by necessity , it must be forward-looking . <p> And , first , about people : Veterans will be the centerpiece of our organization , our clients , as we design and implement and sustain programs which serve them . Through their service in uniform , veterans have sacrificed greatly , investing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our nation . <p> They are clients and I use that term particularly not just customers of our services . They are clients whom we represent , and whose best interests are our sole reason for existence . It is our charge to address their changing needs over time , and across the full range of support that our government has committed to providing them . <p> So , has the Secretary kept those promises ; met those challenges ? I would say no . The VA wo n't fund the cost of service dogs for veterans with PTS diagnoses because there are n't  any studies about it . They are n't  tracking even the simplest of data metrics like medications and causes of death . <p> Texas is home to a large population of veterans . I think only California has more , if I 'm not mistaken . This is not just a Texas problem , but its especially alarming that a state with so many military installations cant take care of its veterans . <p> Obviously , the VA ca n't do it alone . Its going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come together and identify its veterans . The VFW and American Legion posts scattered around need to reach out aggressively and extend a hand of camaraderie . Active duty troops should be aware of their surroundings and engage veterans . They 're not hard to find . They usually have a bumper sticker , a t-shirt , or a hat identifying them as veterans . And local governments need to do a better job of reaching out the veteran community through programs aimed at bringing veterans together for a common cause of fellowship and purpose .

@@96509760 @709760/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Army Wives Season 6 ( A Review ) <p> Six years running and I have to say Ive never watched Army Wives . Initially , it was because the name itself just sounded a series about military spouses gossiping or attending tea parties or something . Which is kind of an odd belief since my wife has never attended a tea party , at least in the sense I 'm speaking of here . Later , I just refused to watch it because I 'm very critical of shows and movies with military themes . The Unit turned me off in just the second season , after all . <p> So , it was with a little bit of trepidation that I delved into the sixth season of this popular series . <p> Right off the bat , I sense that a lot of people are n't  going to be happy with the way that ABC Studios is releasing this series . I was sent a review copy of Season Six : Part One . At about $30 for this set , I do n't  think many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part One contains the first 13 episodes of the season and leaves the viewer sort of feeling jilted . Most new series will retail for about $49.99 or so . While the two $30 payments may feel easier on the wallet , I 'm just not sure any fan will fall for it . <p> With that said , I suspended disbelief and dove right in . <p> The first episode begins with change coming to fictitious Fort Baxter . Thanks to defense cuts ( sound familiar ? ) , the base is forced to close and all the wives husbands are getting reassigned . After being together for so long , each wife has to come to terms with the reality of moving again . <p> However , there is a hurricane coming that will affect Fort Baxter in ways that were unforeseen . New faces move to the base and old faces take on new responsibilities . New wife , Jackie , quickly gets on the wrong side of MG Michael Holdens wife , Claudia Joy . Jackie has been longtime friends with Denise , the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claudia Joy and Denise ? <p> Meanwhile , the storm has left Fort Baxter in turmoil and even threatens the life of one of the Army wives . More relationships are tested as Nicole notices a disturbing change in Frank , and Joan and Roland are embroiled in a controversy involving their newly adopted son . <p> Through all the craziness , will the wives ( and one husband ) find a way to be there for each other . I do n't  know . I only saw the first half of the season . Now , I 'm going to have to Netflix the rest . <p> In spite of my objections to the way Army wives are portrayed , I did find myself engrossed in the series . As I said earlier , if you suspend disbelief , Season 6 is a page turner . Complete with hilarious bloopers and deleted scenes , Part One seems to serve as a great jumping on point for new fans .

@@96509761 @709761/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> LaserLyte Laser Training Cartridges ( A Review ) <p> LaserLyte , arguably the industry leader in laser technology for firearms , has introduced a cool new line of training cartridges in most calibers . I had an opportunity to test their .40 S&amp;W version in my Springfield Armory XD 40 this past weekend . <p> I 've got a few laser bore sighters for several of my weapons , so in all honestly I did n't  really think this was going to be much different than those just in a different caliber . But , I asked LaserLyte if theyd be willing to send me one to test anyway and they did . <p> After opening the package , I could tell right away that this wasnt going to be like other bore sighters I 've ever used . For one , I thought maybe I had a bad batteries when I screwed the back on after installing them and the laser did n't  come on . But , when I pushed the button on the back of the " bullet " the laser fired . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to stop being a man and actually read the directions before I broke something . That 's where I learned about the genius of the LaserLyte LT-40 . <p> Unlike bore sighters that are good for zeroing in sights and scopes , the training cartridges are designed to help you WHILE YOU SHOOT . They are n't  meant to be illuminated until you remove the batteries . <p> As a Private , we would always do what 's called " dime drills " to hone our basic rifle marksmanship . We would balance a dime on the end of our barrel and dry fire the weapon . If the dime fell off , we were jerking the trigger to hard . The goal of good rifle marksmanship is steady trigger squeeze . You knew you were good when you could fire over and over and over again without the dime falling off the barrel . <p> The LT-40 is basically the same concept only more advanced . The cartridge is loaded gently into the barrel of the pistol where a bullet would normally be seated . I would n't recommend loading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber rings that assist in stabilizing the round in the chamber . Charging the bullet like any other round risks damaging those rings and ruining device . <p> Each Laser Trainer Cartridge easily installs into the firing chamber in seconds , works regardless of barrel length and does not stick out of the barrel . The Laser Trainer Cartridge activates for 100 milliseconds each time the firing pin strikes the cartridge . The modified cartridge is rimless , so the Laser Trainer Cartridge is not expelled during dry fire , which allows for tap , rack , bang or malfunction training drills . A hardened rubber plunger on the laser also acts as a built-in snap cap to protect the firing pin and two rubber rings on the laser help ensure a proper fit in order to best replicate bullet impact for accurate training . So , you do n't  have to worry about ruining the firing pin during dry fire . <p> There is only one real downside I found in testing the LT-40 . Because the rubber rings do such a good job of seating the trainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a cleaning rod on hand to extract the round after practice to avoid this problem . Remember , there is n't a rim to pull it out , so you 'll have to push it out from the other side . But , this was just a nitpicky thing for me since I was n't prepared and is n't really a downside . <p> According to LaserLyte , the battery life in each Laser Trainer Cartridge is approximately 3,000 shots . With the cost of bullets these days , that equals a ton of savings and trips to the range . Targets can literally be set up in your living room to teach family members who to properly aim and fire . The teacher can be " downrange " marking where the shots are " fired " so that the shooter can adjust their aim on the spot . <p> I had a lot of fun using the trainer . I also figured out why I perpetually shoot slightly low when I fire my XD40 . Other members of my family were quickly able to master their aiming points using the trainer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and .45 ACP , each model retails for about $99.95 . When compared to the cost of buying and shooting training ammunition , that 's quite a steal if you ask me ! And if you get really bored , you can have the cat chase the laser for hours ! <p> Disclaimer : LaserLyte sent me a .40 cal . LT-40 model to test for this review without reservation or promise of a good review . No other offers , promises , payments or favors were given in exchange for writing this review . This review is comprised of my personal experience with the LT-40 and reflects MY opinions only . <h> One Comment on " LaserLyte Laser Training Cartridges ( A Review ) " <p> A fter a hundred or so rounds there is a dent in primer switch that will not trigger switch .

Col. Don C. Faith Jr . of Washington , Ind. , will be buried April 17 , in Arlington National Cemetery . Faith was a veteran of World War II and went on to serve in the Korean War . In late 1950 , Faiths 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry Regiment , which was attached to the 31st Regimental Combat Team ( RCT ) , was advancing along the eastern side of the Chosin Reservoir , in North Korea . From Nov. 27 to Dec. 1 , 1950 , the Chinese Peoples Volunteer Forces ( CPVF ) encircled and attempted to overrun the U.S. position . During this series of attacks , Faiths commander went missing , and Faith assumed command of the 31st RCT . As the battle continued , the 31st RCT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was forced to withdraw south along Route 5 to a more defensible position . During the withdrawal , Faith continuously rallied his troops , and personally led an assault on a CPVF position . <p> Records compiled after the battle of the Chosin Reservoir , to include eyewitness reports from survivors of the battle , indicated that Faith was seriously injured by shrapnel on Dec. 1 , 1950 , and subsequently died from those injuries on Dec. 2 , 1950 . His body was not recovered by U.S. forces at that time . Faith was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor-- the United States highest military honor for personal acts of exceptional valor during the battle . <p> In 2004 , a joint U.S. and Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea ( D.P.R.K ) team surveyed the area where Faith was last seen . His remains were located and returned to the U.S. for identification . <p> To identify Faiths remains , scientists from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command ( JPAC ) and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory ( AFDIL ) used circumstantial evidence , compiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as dental comparison .

So , I 'm going to address the OPSEC issue . He asked me to prove where I think he s violated OPSEC and here it is in the nutshell of ONE post : <p> Need I go any further ? This is proof enough that the military can not trust Michael Yon with an embed . He is a reckless " reporter " who posts whatever will garner readers without checking facts or weighing whether or not that information will harm troops . David Sneakers proved that ! <p> I was going to post other evidence , but in light of the fact that I may need it in a legal case , I picked the most damaging bit of evidence . With this post , Michael Yon has no basis for any fake allegations of libel or slander against me . <p> I , however , have numerous . Why ? Because unlike Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made numerous libelous claims that are void of fact . He has taken actions that , if true , could result in directly affecting my way of life . He has never presented evidence that I 'm insane while labeling me such . He has never presented evidence that I 'm dangerous to anyone , while labeling me such . He has never presented evidence as to why I should be allowed to carry a weapon , while writing such . He has never provided evidence that I have lied about my military accomplishments while proclaiming as much . Michael Yon has a lot to answer for . Because he has too much to lose by telling the truth about me , I doubt he ever will though . <p> And with that , I wash my hands of him provided he ceases with his indefensible attacks . <p> " Doc , " Those are n't  tactics highlighted up there . Those are weaknesses in Base Defenses Yon published for the enemy to see . <p> Frankly , I find it difficult to believe that any Soldier would be stupid enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are few that would have grammar mistakes that Yon could correct . He certainly did n't  correct even blatant mistakes in that one . <p> What is obvious is that the publication of that email would have put that base at risk of serious attacks , costing many friendly lives , assuming it was the actual situation . <p> If one believes instead that some Soldier or other " baited " Yon , it demonstrates that not only is Yon more concerned with his own profits , than the Troops , but also has that Yon has no methods to check his " sources , " nor that he cares to attempt to verify before publication . <p> True COIN does not disallow " kinetic operations , " in favor of soft power . True COIN recognizes the requirement for both , for killing bad guys as well as drinking chai with local leaders . But that is a different subject . One that Yon does not attempt to address , nor is qualified to assess , and not the subject of this discussion . <p> you 're wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the leaders are so wrapped around the idea of " soft power " that they endanger their joes. all the tactics mentioned above are all over the internet in insurgent manuals and videos . just get off facebook and look for them . you 'll be amazed . <p> Doc , so you 're saying its okay to publish sensitive , OPSEC information as long as the enemy has already published it ? Has it occurred to you that maybe you 're patching up Joes because people like Michael Yon are publishing our defensive weaknesses ? <p> It would be good to put the Army tenets of OPSEC up there to compare with the obvious violations of it . In present form , itll scream to those that have sat through the classes , but those unexperienced may not realize the grievous infractions above , and why they are so damaging . 
@@96509768 @709768/ 68528 @qwx928528 <h> Q&amp;A with Hunting Goddess Melissa Bachman <p> It seems more and more female hunters are getting in the gameand we were lucky enough to score an interview with one of the fiercest lady hunters in the country . Melissa Bachman does it all : hunter , producer and outdoor writer . Shes developed an impressive presence both on television and online , paving the way for other female hunters to follow . <p> This down-to-earth girl might be famous in the hunting world , but she remains just a down-home hunter at heart , hoping to score big like the rest of us . <p> Where did your love for hunting stem from ? I was very lucky to have been raised in a family that loved to hunt . My entire family would spend our weekends together duck hunting and deer hunting , but I- wasnt- able to actually pick up a gun or bow until I was 12 years old . For years , I looked forward to my first hunting trip and could hardly sleep the night before . I was so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even drew up little maps of our property and picked which stands we should try first . I was lucky enough to take a doe my first year out . It was years before I ever shot my first buck , but that didnt- matter . I was just thrilled to be out hunting ! <p> What drives your hunting passion ? It 's hard to beat the adrenaline rush that happens when the moment of truth comes , or the feeling of accomplishment when all of your hard work pays off. - I love hunting on the ground , aggressive with a bow in my hand. - I really enjoy making the game come to me either with predator calls , rattling or simply spotting and stalking the animal I 'm after . <p> Do you have a favorite hunting memory ? Definitely predator calling a bear into 18-yards on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska with only a bow in my hand. - I was dropped off by plane with a tent , kayak and a bow for one week. - I had looked over maps , learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera after getting him to charge in from over 150-yards out. - It was the biggest adrenaline rush of my hunting career ! <p> You scored one of the best jobs out theregetting filmed while you hunt . What 's next on your radar ? Right now , I 'm a full-time host and producer for North American Hunter TV and will be producing my own new series which will begin airing in August . I also write weekly blogs for Petersens Hunting , and co-host on a variety of outdoor programs such as : WhitetailSLAM , Dangerous Game , Whitetail Revolution , Winchester Legends , and Whitetail Country along with a few others . Most of these shows can be found on NBC Sports . <p> I 'd really love to someday have my own show that I edit and produce. - That way I could be busy hunting all fall with my cameraman , come back in the winter and edit all the footage together. - I 've produced other people 's TV shows , however someday I hope to produce my own as well . <p> We hear you took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that experience like ? This was my first trip ever to New Zealand , and I wanted to hunt stags on the ground with my bow . - After a long stalk , my cameraman and I were able to get within 36-yards of a huge bedded stag . - We watched him feed and bed , then made our move to get in close . I did n't  want to spook the big stag so instead of making him stand I just waited . - Two-hours later after sitting through a freezing rain and windy conditions the stag finally stood , and I made the shot . - I was shaking like crazy but there were probably two reasons for this : the fact that I did n't  dress warm enough and was soaking wet , and the fact that I had just shot a possible world record stag ! Overall , it was a great experience . New Zealand is absolutely beautiful ! <p> What has your experience as a talented female hunter in a male-dominated sport been like ? I 've run into a few individuals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women belong back home in the kitchen , but usually these types of people are few and far between . In general most people are thrilled to see more women in the field hunting ! Frankly , I do n't really care what people think because I love to hunt more than anything in the world and am just thrilled to be in the field every single day ! <p> If you could give aspiring hunters any advice about making it big , what would it be ? The best piece of advice I could give is just get out there and spend time hunting with people you enjoy . It 's a great time to relax , have fun and it 's not all about the size of animal you bring home . Pick someone in your life that will teach you the ropes of hunting and do n't give up. - Some years will be great some years will be tough , but if you enjoy the hunt it will always be time well spent . <p> And of course we have to ask what are your go-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my whitetail hunts so I choose Muck Boots . I started wearing them about four years ago and find them to be the most comfortable rubber boots on the market. - For western hunts , I like to have a boot that is light , waterproof and extremely comfortable . I have four pairs of the exact same Timberland low profile boot that I wear on all my western hunts . It feels like a tennis shoe when you 're walking but has the durability of a hunting boot . <p> You go girl ! Never mind the negativity of the uneducated portion of society ! It appears that they would prefer mutipul species wiped out due to disease contributed by over population and mismanagement ! Only makes sense in their shallow little world ! We as conservationests know what it takes though science and study to maintain a healthy herd ! Therefore we will always have these fine animals to appreciate for years to come ! I support Melissa and every sportsman and woman around the world who dedicate their personal time and effort to conserving and managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy !

You are awesome , Melissa do n't  let them take your prowess lol . Thanks for all the Great hunts . <p> Geez I cant believe you people ! Get a fucking grip , if it was n't for hunters there would be no human race , its you liberal anti-hunting fucks that 's the problem with this world .

Oh your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , NOT . Try putting that money to good use and conservation you fucktard . I hope this post infuriates you , if you look in your history I can guarantee you , you are a decendent of a hunter . Get a life and do something positive with your time and money . May God have mercy on you ! <p> Anyone that talks bad about her and wishes harm to her , you are the ones that will be judged . And are retarded . It makes me sick that people can think like that . HELLO if it were not for hunters and gatherers the would not be people . Where is your conservation money ? Because us hunter/huntresses pay every year thousands of dollies towards conservation . Get a life and instead of hating on someone go out and actually help wildlife , donate money to the many organizations that actually put back into the animals/environment . <p> Wish I could meet this woman someday .

She is pretty tough to go up against a lion with her power rifle and scope . I wish upon her the type of unhappiness she has put upon the animals she has hunted . Trophy hunting is different from the hunting I truly respect . True hunters use the animals as food and do not fly in a lion to hunt it in a canned environment . She is repulsive , good riddance is right .. I hate this woman and as a Minnesotan , I am ashamed her name is associated with our state and the real hunters who live here . ( tweeted , facebooked , and petitioned . ) <p> FACTS : She is not hunting to surving or feed her self She calls this a sport using high powered rifle ? ? ? ? ? ?

Where would her courage and bravado be if she did not have her little popgun with her or it misfired when a lion charged ! Do not sponsor or let this poor excuse for a human being publish her exploits . She needs to see the beauty of these animals not think of them as a trophy ! This woman is sick and disgusts me . <p> Why do you people think harvesting an animal is such a sin ? All of our ancestors depended upon wild animals as a way of survival ! If they did n't  Kill animals , you would n't be here ! You do n't  see any drawings on cave walls of a caveman eating a salad ! I was raised in a family that hunting was a way of life that was handed down by my ancestors and is still big part of my life .

Its not just killing ! There 's more to it ! This is my last post , I have to go hunting . And No ! I wont kill myself ! I will leave that for God ! <p> Its strange how bunny huggers act is n't it ? I wish someone who let one of these animals loose in your home and see how " beautiful " it is then . We do n't  hate on u for being up tight short sided dirt eaters do we ? Do I start a petition to ban u the owning pets do we or driving ur smart car ? How about eating ur kelp that so other see creature could be eating and now is starving .

Pppfffff please , give us and this world a wonderful gift and kill yourself instead another animal ! ! <p> You cant seriously think people should respect this person ? I would n't even call her her a human being what person kills an innocent animal for enjoyment ? She is nothing but a discusting individual with no sense of morals and definitely NOT down to earth ! ! A good quote I read is the only other people that keep trophies of things they kill are serial killers .. so there you go . I hope she suffers one day for all the innocent lives shes taken , no different to a human life its a life she 's destroyed . <p> She kills defenseless animals so close to being endangered/extinct from a distance with a high powered rifle and calls it a " Great Hunt " . Please ! You look and sound so freakin stupid ! You paid to shoot the lion for its head . What skill was involved ? Unless you kill with your bare hands we are not impressed just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for FUN ! Times are changingtables are turning.best of luck in your future <p> If its okay for her to kill animals in the prime of their lives , then we should also be able to kill other animals , such as pets . Why is one considered " animal cruelty " and the other " sport " ? From the animals point of view there is no difference , but that 's just what you want to avoid , is n't it Ms. Bachman , the " animals point of view " ? <p> Take some time to think about what its like to be walking around your neighborhood and suddenly get shot in the chest by a smiling hunter a few hundred feet away . 
@@96509771 @709771/ <p> The first thing I noticed right off the bat were that these things were rugged and fit perfectly on both my iPad and my S4 . There was no need to make the cases snap properly or put up with a small misalignment . As soon as I attached the Cyclops to my phone , I immediately threw it on the ground a few times . The Cyclops is comprised of two parts : a polycarbonate front plate and a mix polycarbonate/Thermo Plastic Elastomer ( TPE ) . Both pieces snap together and , as far as I can tell , wont ever come apart unless you WANT them to . In spite of the fact that I had just purchased my new Galazy S4 , I took Trident at their word and risked losing my phone . However , my phone was perfectly intact with no scratch or dents to the phone . <p> The screen on the Cyclops works well with the S4 .

I keep my phone in my pocket , with my keys , coins , and other items . The screen has n't  scratched or pitted at all . In spite of it being a Marine Corps style case , it did exactly what I expected it to do and what the manufacturer said it would do . While I did n't  test this case in a field environment , I tried to put it through as much as I could . I kept the phone on a lanyard while mowing and weed eating to simulate dusty conditions on two occasions , both windy . I also accidentally tried to close my car door on it when I did n't  notice the phone fell out of my pocket and my phone ( and the case ) did n't  suffer a single crack or break . <p> After finishing with the yard ( and taking a shower ) , I removed the case to see how much dirt and dust collected inside the case . This is one of my pet peeves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case over time . After removing the case , the phone still appeared to be brand new . There was no dust or dirt hidden in the crevices that I could find . The Trident Case locks your phone in TIGHT ! The case protects power and audio inputs with port covers that snap in place . Finally , it provides excellent protection against accidental splashes and rain , as I found out during a sudden downpour about a week ago . <p> The only negative thing I have to say about the Cyclops is that the ports are inaccessible with certain types of chargers . Depending on how thick the charger it , the case prevents the cable from fully engaging with the phone . This could be easily fixes with a less shallow case width or a wider opening for the cable . Additionally , if you use a card swiper for your business , or in my case a non-profit , it is difficult to plug those devices into the audio jack for the same reason . <p> I have no doubt that the Cyclops case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a combat environment if you have one that works there . I 'm not sure if its indestructible , but its probably as close as it can get ! <p> I had similar results with the Kraken Case for iPad , although I did n't  throw it on the ground . Its not as easy to replace a broken iPad as it is a broken phone . However , I have no doubt , based on my experience with the Cyclops , that the Kraken works just as well . The iPad is securely nuzzled inside the case , swaddled in a protective Trident outer skin . The screen does not interfere with iPad apps or typing at all . It also has special port covers that protect the opening for power and audio adapters . <p> This case Series includes silicone on the inside , with a hardened polycarbonate exterior , making it less susceptible to wear and tear .

Stop looking for one pattern for all environments . The woodland camo pattern was excellent for our wooded areas . This pattern does have its place though . The mid-west plains and dessert areas . Of course neither would work in snow . All I am saying is stop spending taxpayer money trying to find a one size fits all pattern . I do understand though they are seeking a pattern that would work best in the type of environment the military would most likely deploy in for our time .

However , if he tried to sit down , there might be some , er , issues . <p> Blackhawk Warrior Wear Pants <p> A second cargo pocket on the pants offered a less-than-qualified option . This would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chance of falling out . <p> Overall iPad Fit Grade : A <h> Genuine Gear <p> Genuine Gears tactical pants were the only ones from the lineup that fit the original iPad ( and only by a thread , really ) . So , they were the first pants we scoped when looking for the perfect fit . With its near-goldilocks potential , we werent surprised that it felt a little awkward in the double cargo pocket . Interestingly enough , a better fit was provided when using the front pocket with the hook-and-loop flap left open . <p> Genuine Gear Tactical Pants <p> Our main concern with this storage method is that the iPad could fall out if not monitored properly . So , convenient , yes . But truly practical ? Not exactly . <p> Overall Fit Grade : B- <h> Kitanica <p> While it easily slid into the back pocket , the iPad 2 could probably find a more suitable home than Kitanica tactical pants . It did not feel 100 percent secure . Not to mention the snap on the side pocket could prove problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cargo pocket was on the small side and was the least secure place to store the iPad out of the pockets that fit it . <p> Kitanica Tactical Pants <p> Overall Fit Grade : B <p> Bottom line ? You should keep your iPad in a case and use tactical pants for iPad 2 storage in emergency situations only . <p> My butt is big enough , but I wondered whether it was practical to think you could carry an iPad in tactical pants . I think a pocket on the side of the leg is likely the best solution . There 's enough room for expansion to allow a comfortable fit and the iPad wont bang against your posterior as you walk . <p> I had a Kindle before upgrading to the more versatile iPad . I could fit that thing in normal Target Storebrand Cargo shorts , so thered be MORE than enough room for them in tactical pants . Have you looked into the Xoom ( Motorolas android tablet ) ? Has most of the same features as the iPad ( and then some ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , but is a little longer ( I think the screen is set to be widescreen ratio ) . Anyway , just some ideas .

While in the past I only enjoyed collecting and shooting , I 'm beginning to get into the custom realm of making a good gun better . As such , I 've reviewed a few guns on this blog along with parts for them . <p> Today , I 'm going to simplify things a bit . I came across a company called Fobus Holsters . These great holsters are made in Israel primarily for their military and special security forces there . As you can imagine , I had high expectations of the brand even before receiving the review products . <p> Fobus sent me two holsters to test an active retention , rotating holster for a Springfield Armory XD40 ( Model SPDB ) with Thumb release and a passive retention holster for the Taurus Judge compact . This review will only consist of the active retention since I loaned out my Judge to a family member and did n't  get it back until Friday . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good enough review , though I 'm equally impressed with it as I am this one . <p> Right off the bat , I could tell these were high quality holsters . Ill start with the active retention holster for the XD40 . For those that are contemplating getting a pistol of any caliber , you CAN NOT go wrong with a Springfield Armory XD-series pistol . My every day choice that I keep on me is the XD40 . I have shot hundreds of rounds through this pistol and do n't  have a single complaint . The customer service is top-notch too ! Being a left-handed shooter , the company even sent me a free left hand paddle holster when I bought the pistol and got home to find the holster that came with it was designed for right-handed shooters . <p> However , the Fobus paddle holster is different from the stock Springfield paddle holster in several ways . Both provide a perfect fit for the pistol . The Fobus includes a thumb release that the XD model does not have . This is important to any legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun wont fall into the wrong hands . <p> The paddle comes with a beveled lip that clings to the waistband or belt , preventing it from accidentally being pulled during the draw . <p> When I 'm carrying , I like to have my pistol at a slight angle to the front . This helps me get a smooth and consistent draw in a pinch . The XD holsters do n't  allow for that . The Fobus holsters feature the Fobus Rotation Mechanism that allows the user to rotate the way the pistol is holstered . Users can position their sidearm for a straight up and down draw , a forward-assisted draw like I use , or even a cross draw if that is your style by simply using an allen wrench to loosen and reposition the holster . <p> Another great aspect of this holster is that the guard that covers the trigger housing is deep enough so as to prevent accidental trigger pull . While this is n't a problem with the XD due to its own inherent safety features , some gun owners will appreciate the added safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow for a natural draw . The user wont have to worry about learning new muscle memory just to unholster their sidearm . I tested the holster with both a regular magazine and extended magazine and did n't  have a single misdraw . The motion of the thumb release is natural and fluid as you can see in these two photos . <p> The Fobus active retention holster is a level 2 retention holster . A Level 2 holster example is one where a thumb-break is released then the pistol must be moved ( rocked forward or rearwards ) in the holster to clear some form of internal locking device before it can be drawn . A level 1 holster would have something like a leather or plastic snap as the only thing holding the pistol in place . A level 3 holster is one where three separate retaining devices , both internal and external must be undone or bypassed . Most police officers and military personnel use a level 2 , as this provides a good balance between quick draw and security of the weapon . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the paddle thickness and concealability . To be fair , the Fobus active retention holster is n't designed to be used as a concealed carry holster . Because of the retention system , the weapon sticks out from the waist 2.5 to 3 inches , whereas the XD holster hugs the pistol close to the body with a little less than two inches of distance . Again , Fobus did n't  design this holster to be used for concealed carry , so I cant really hold that against them . <p> While I never had any issues putting the holster on or taking it off , I do worry that the thickness of the bridge between the paddle and the holster itself is too thin . The XD bridge is very thick and rigid giving me the impression of being more durable . <p> A friend of mine also has a Fobus holster , so I asked him about his experiences with it . His went through a catastrophic motorcycle accident at 65mph and nothing happened to the pistol or the holster . He called it an " ass over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holster ever left his side ( though I bet it left a nice bruise ! ) . <p> All in all , the Fobus holster is much more comfortable than the XD holster as well . It forms to the hip which prevents it from digging into your side . Because the paddle is so lightweight , it can also be used in the small of the back without hurting too much . They seem to have thought of it all . <p> I now have a new range and farm holster in the Fobus active retention holster . I like the durability , comfort and ease of use . I like that I do n't  have to worry about someone trying to disarm me from behind or in a skirmish . The design is sleek , elegant , and lightweight . Since Texas is still not an open carry state ( WHATS UP WITH THAT ? ! ) , Ill have to continue using my XD holster for concealed carry in the meantime . But , I cant recommend Fobus highly enough . The Israelis have a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $39.99 each and you cant go wrong . <p> Here is a video the company produced that better highlights the features of this holster : <p> Disclaimer : This review constitutes the opinion of the author and does not assume endorsement by any branch of the government or military unit .

@@96509778 @709778/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Gun-Free Safe Zones are Anything But <p> Did somebody forget to tell University of Texas shooter Colton Tooley the UT campus is a gun-free zone ? I have been wracking my brain for the last few weeks trying to figure out how he was able to physically bring a gun onto the campus when the stated policy of the University is that students simply are n't  allowed to have guns . <p> This is how Phillip Harris begins an op-ed in the student newpaper at UT , The Mercury . Harris goes to explain that its time to get real ! <p> How many tragedies have to happen or almost happen , like on the UT campus a few weeks ago , before we wake up and realize that gun-free school zones make absolutely no sense ? Never before have I heard such foolish statements as when discussing gun policy on a university campus . Statements so ungrounded in logic as to be absurd . <p> " I just feel safer on a campus that does n't  allow guns , I like knowing that the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How on earth is this a possibility ? We do n't  attend a school surrounded by fences and metal detectors . Anybody who pleases can waltz onto campus armed to any degree they choose . <p> In fact , the only thing that gun-free school zones guarantee is that all of the law-abiding , responsible students at a university , and there are many , wont have a weapon . The people who break laws are the people we least want to carry a weapon , and those are the only ones who would carry a gun in a gun-free school zone . Besides the Police , who are legally allowed to carry a gun , of course . <p> Gun control is n't about guns ; its about controls . The laws make no sense at all . How quickly could this have ended had even ONE student exercised his rights to self-defense and ended the rampage earlier , even though the only death or casualty in this instance was the shooter himself ( he shot himself ) ? <p> The purpose of the 2nd Amendment is n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps but against a hypothetically tyrannical government . The military is responsible for the outside threat . <p> There are always going to be stories here and there about a " legal " concealed handgun carrier using his rights to commit a crime , but that does n't  mean all gun owners fit this bill . There 's a story in Roanoke , VA about a moron who shot himself in a restaurant . Did n't  hurt anyone . Did n't  damage anything . Yet , a judge thinks he has the authority to confiscate his money , suspend his permit , and take away his gun a .45-caliber Glock pistol ! He suspended a jail sentence . <p> This is insane ! I would fight this to the hilt . What crime was committed here ? Last I checked , stupidity was n't a crime ! Yet <p> We need to resist efforts at every opportunity to restrict our freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution , especially the one that most defends the rest ! <p> Its clear , after several school shootings in the last few years , that gun-free school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . Its nice to pretend that if a University says students cant have guns , nobody has one , but it is n't reality . Universities have harsh policies against drug and alcohol possession , but students trample all over these rules on a regular basis . <p> Getting back to gun-free areas , this just does n't  make sense . In the past , I have gone into numerous so-called " gun-free " zones with my concealed carry permit and no one ever knew . I did n't  commit any crimes and never once , thankfully , had to use it . But , had something happened in one of those locations , I would have been the only one present to do anything about it . Not because I 'm a criminal , but because I refuse to become a victim regardless of where I am . Harris concludes his brilliant and simple piece this way : <p> The more important conclusion is that simply banning weapons on a campus does n't  work . There have been enough school shootings to show that no matter how firm a universitys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postings show pictures of guns with a circle around them and a line drawn through them , students still bring guns onto campus and kill other students . New solutions must be discussed . Whether this means concealed carry , more police officers , or preventative measures to help troubled students not resort to violence , something must be done to ensure a safe campus for UTD students . <h> 8 Comments on " Gun-Free Safe Zones are Anything But " <p> I was with you until the Accidental Discharge . I certainly agree with everyone being armed everywhere . The more people that are educated about , the responsible usage of firearms . The less people get shot . I certainly , do n't  agree , with some fool shooting himself in a public place . Stupidity , is definitely illegal when its my family that is catching stray slugs. or anyone/thing , for that matter I cant believe any decent person would dismiss the part about random unpredictable firing , anytime , anywhere . " Oops , I accidentally shot you in the spine . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable . I imagine the OP , is actually against any form of carry . I hate to dredge an old thread but , this is a top three result of a google search of " anything but guns " . I came here because , my future wife does n't  share my interest in firearms . So " one thing led to another " . This is absolutely ridiculous . No wonder , inexperienced people think firearms are evil . I hate to break it to you . But , i have had firearms laying around for many years . Never have I seen any mechanical device , become animate , and go about inflicting any type of action on anything , or anyone , ever . <p> Statements so ungrounded in logic as to be absurd Anybody who pleases can waltz onto campus armed to any degree they choose The military is responsible for the outside threat New solutions must be discussed Statements so ungrounded in logic as to be absurd .

Looks like we wont be seeing it any time soon : <p> To our valued customers : <p> As the inventor of the DoubleTapG pistol and owner of the design and utility patents , along with other intellectual property including the DoubleTapG name , I am issuing this press release to inform our loyal customers of the current status of the production of this new innovative pistol . <p> Since we introduced the DoubleTapG Tactical Pocket Pistol in November of last year , we have been overwhelmed by the industry reception ; the popularity confirmed by literally tens of thousands of orders placed by consumers to their dealers , through our distributor partners . <p> Unfortunately , with the deepest regret , today I announce that we have terminated our relationship with HEIZER DEFENSE , our manufacturing partner , due to their inability to manufacture the DoubleTapG pistol . I can not comment further on this subject at this time , under advice from legal counsel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immediately license the design to a leading firearms manufacturer or to align with another manufacturing source to produce the DoubleTapG . We intend to accomplish this as quickly as possible to satisfy the huge demand for the DoubleTapG pistol . I will make a further announcement as soon as we have established a new manufacturing agreement . <p> One of my favorite guns is the Derringer pistol . Its a cool little , double-barreled pistol that shoots both .45 caliber and .410 shot rounds . Well , now Heizer Defense LLC , a firearms company producing a new paradigm of pistols for the responsible-citizen and law enforcement markets is proud to introduce their first model for the concealed carry market ; the DoubleTap the pistol that may supersede the Derringer as my favorite . <p> The DoubleTap is a tactical pocket pistol , loaded with 5 patents pending , built on a titanium or aluminum frame ; the slimmest and lightest on the market today at only .665 inches wide and 14 ounces . I mean , look at how sleek and slender this thing is ! Its like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Available in a show-stopping .45 ACP or the more popular 9MM , this no-snag , hammerless designed pistol is completely designed , engineered and manufactured to the highest degree of precision and tolerances in an aerospace facility using aerospace technology and equipment . The DoubleTap carries two rounds in the chamber and the integral grips house two additional spare rounds . The break-action features a patent-pending progressive barrel porting option that cuts muzzle rise and recoil . The ambidextrous thumb latch releases the action and automatically ejects the spent rounds . <p> Unlike any firearm , the DoubleTap features a truly revolutionary double-action trigger system that utilizes ball bearings for a smooth action and crisp trigger pull . The DoubleTap is available in a titanium or aluminum frame and is finished with a MIL-STD finish , the same used on military aircraft , for corrosion and wear resistant finish . As of this writing , a retail price for the pistol is not available . <p> Im allowed to buy a gun when I get home from this deployment . I think I figured out which one it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heizer Defense Unveils the Doubletap " <p> I used to work for Heizer . This is an engineering failure . I saw this gun go from design to design for over a year ! Yes , I said a year ! This company has little to no real engineering expertise . Everything on their website is exaggerated . I am amazed people are even still interested . Besides , everyone at the company who fired one lost the use of the hands after the first shot for hours . At this point , I 'd be surprised if they even bring it to market , because theyll never break even <p> This has got to be the coolest the little gun Ive ever seen . Its got great futuristic styling and from the companys video ( heizerdefense.com I think ) does n't  look like it kicks as bad as most derringers do . If I were a low drag clandestine type and I could take this gun apart and conceal it in a computer casing or a luggage compartment , itd be spot on . Having said that , the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For $499 I can get a Kel-Tec P3AT .380 which is about the same size as the Heizer and carries 6 rounds , and I can also get another Kel-Tec P11 with 10 rounds of 9mm . So I 'm not sure what the upside is to this gun except for the WOW factor which I admit is pretty darn cool . <p> Novelty item at mostinteresting how none out in circulation for a real review . Let 's see a u-tube review of it ACTUALLY being fired . LEIGHT WEIGHT and 45 acp should be pretty much uncontrollable with MASSIVE NOISE to match . Also why would n't manufacturer at least show it being fired on their web site ? OVER HYPED NOVELTY ITEM ! <p> 14 ounces ? That 's almost twice the weight of the Kel-Tec P3AT , and 6 less rounds ( of .380 ACP , with +1 extension ) . And its only .11 inches less wide than the P3AT . I mean its cool that its a simple gun , and it looks nice , but are you supposed to use a safety on it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heavy as a safety . <p> Gun of last resort for sure . Would get the job done . Probably best to carry in an ankle rig . WAY too expensive . At these lofty prices , I 'll stick with my Kahr Micro 9 ( or in .45 caliber if you prefer ) It is almost invisible as a CCW but with many more bullets . Kahr with Tritium Night Sights its a better gun at those prices . <p> I too have a Bond ( 6 extra barrels ! ) and think you have to be a derringer aficionado to fully appreciate the many features of the DoubleTap . But I never carry my Bond because it is a huge lump of steel in your pocket and just does n't  fit into my wardrobe or lifestyle ( not a cowboy or snake hunter ) . The DoubleTap would and you could drop it into any pocket without the need for a holster . It is half the thickness of a Bond and even thinner than many .380s . AND it is a double action without any need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Bond in the aluminium model . Yes , the DoubleTap is a huge turnon for me . <p> I still thing the DoubleTap is one of the most innovative guns Ive seen in years and you cant really compare it to a 9mm or .45 cal . fully functioning pistol because if your lifestyle allows you to carry a Kahr , KelTec or Glock , great , you should do so . But for me the only guns that fit my pockets and lifestyle are the .380s and .32s and I have a few problems with most of them . My everyday carry is a KelTec .32 and I would gladly trade it for the DoubleTap and yes , unless you are a Bob Munden of Impossible Shots , it is a very short range weapon . But for the non-interventionist civilian who is way more likely to get into a car wreck than a gunfight , it will be a weapon of last resort with the surprise factor being the major element in self-defense . <p> This is the weapon you are relegated to when your G19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main carry weapon from my perspective . This is a stick it in their side and pull the trigger deal . For up close and nasty , the " last stand " so to speak . .45 ACP would be the caliber of choice for me but 147 grain 9MM loads would get it done and in a way might be a better choice as it is the main issue military caliber world wide . From an ergonomic point of view it " looks " good but I 'd need to run some lead through it to see for sure . Like RMH said , ballistics ? Velocity ? But specs would be nice to see . Price point will make or break this in the concealed and LEO market . At $400-$500 its not a player , too may other choices with more fire power and just as easy to conceal . Somewhere in the $350 range and you 've got a ton of product rolling off the assembly line . Look forward to seeing one up close and personal . <p> ballistics ? muzzle velocity ? recoil ? really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . it is a GTFO ME belly gun . it is a gun of last resort , in case of total failure/loss of your primary weapon . it is for when your attacker is at contact range and you put the muzzle against his neck and dump two 230 gr hollow points in his carotid , trachea and cervical spine . game over ! i won ! and i will buy at least one for my wife to carry so i get my glock 27 back . <p> love the idea as an easy carry , personal defense weapon however the size and weight may make handling a problem with the recoil of a 45 cal weapon . Suggested price qoutede on these sites is way to high . <p> Its simply different strokes for different folks , EH . I 've never understood why people buy new cars , but that 's no concern of mine . I like an " everwhere gun " that 's not going to have an unseated magazine should I desterately need it , and the Double-Tap is more invisible than a J-frame . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should become very understandable . <p> I like the gun a lot , but the price is a bit high One can purchase a whole lot of gun otherwise for 500 700 dollars . I 'm thinking that given the 2rd capacity and the fact that shots will tend to be at very close range , that the Lehigh Defense MP ( multi-projectile ) load in .45acp would be a good choice for this gun . Or else use the reduced recoil Federal Hydra Shok , PNW arms low recoil .45 HP match load , or the Gold-Dot short-barrel loads to tame recoil . <p> where is the nearest dealer and how can I aquire one of these pistols , it looks like the best pistol ever to carry in a ankle holster or in your pocket . I would be interested in purchasing on of the first available <p> If you have to fight more than two people you would be better served with a hatchet or a machete. rather than this overpriced pistol . I own two derringers a 22mag and a 38 special so I know whereof I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough rounds for practical carry . Shot placement is critical , but CPL holders prepare themselves for a situation when they need to protect themselves . 2 loaded rounds really handicaps you in a scenario where you would face multiple attackers or , god forbid , a shootout . <p> Its true I would feel more comfortable with more rounds but if you are in a firefight no less than a full size duty weapon with multiple spare magazines would suffice . The gun is made for self defense and should be considered a last resort . Derringers do not have storage for an additional 2 rounds so this would seem to be a step up from that platform , at least . <p> But typically you shoot one and the other will flee . As a self defense weapon or back up for a police officer I think I would be great . Is it a Glock 22 ? No . Would it be good to have in you pocket if some disarmed you or approached you is a parking lot . Hell yeah . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 2 be glad to test market one for the company .

It is an entire brand developed around one simple yet functional item " 5.11 tactical pants . <p> But that 's not where the story really begins . Those now-famous trousers were the creation of one woman named Liz Robbins . As the brains behind many Royal Robbins classics , she set out to design a practical hiking short in the 1950s . <p> LR : Uh-huh , uh-huh . Hmmm . Well , that 's very interesting . It just never occurred to me that there would be something simply devoted to the tactical pants category . <p> TPB : How did the 5.11 pant come about ? <p> LR : The predecessor to the 5.11 pant was the Blue Water . Based on the Billy Goat shorts , the Blue Water was made from heavy canvas . Its purpose was to be more rugged and more multi-functional . We were interested in something that would also apply to sailing because climbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the features in the 5.11 came from . I do n't even know if 5.11 tactical pants still have the strap across the back as it did originally " does it ? <p> TPB : Yes , it does . I believe its called a buddy or rear strap <p> LR : When I originally put that on the Blue Water , it was a winch handle strap for sailing . And I liked the idea of it , because it was a place where you could easily put your winch in your pocket . It would hold the handle . Another aspect of design I enjoyed was the ability to put forth my very practical side , which was interested in function , together with my esthetic sense . <p> So , that strap had functional reasons as did the pockets , the depth of the pockets , the fabric the pockets were made of , the reinforcements and so forth . Everything was very purposeful . Carpenters loved that pant . The 5.11 was first really picked up by builders , - in terms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling to the military and to the police departments . Builders just loved it . You can secure whatever " a winch handle or a hammer " on that very useful little strap . <p> TPB : What is your relationship with Susie Tompkins ? Did she help design the pants ? <p> LR : I can understand where you might have gotten something like that . But no , she did not help in the design of the tactical pant whatsoever . Susie and I were friends when we were both starting out as clothing designers . She was creating little dresses and things for the younger generation . We were just good friends . <p> Susie and I did work together , which was way before the 5.11 pants . The Billy Goat Short was the first thing I ever made that required a pattern maker . A pant is a tricky thing to create . I had no idea how to design the fit on a short . I used to go over and work with Susie and her pattern maker to get the pant/short fit correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) developed the original 5.11 pant for hikers . <p> TPB : The pants were originally developed for hikers ? <p> LR : Well , the shorts were . Actually , yes , the short and the pants were for hikers . They were not really climbing pants . People kind of got confused about that because Royal was a climber , and the company was kind of climbing oriented . It was mainly a rugged , outdoor , multi-functional pant that could be used for a lot of things . <p> There was basically no outdoor industry at the time when we started as such . The first trade show we attended had a small annex in the back dedicated to the outdoor- apparel and such . That area quickly grew and became what is now the outdoor industry . <p> TPB : You said that you paid a lot of attention to the pockets , the location , the depth , the material " is there anything in particular that you remember ? <p> LR : Anything that was reinforced , whether it was a pocket or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fabric , the type of material For example , the first prototype I ever had made in Hong Kong , which was probably at one of Susies factories , they put a false piece of fabric in the knee that looked like a reinforcement , but it really was n't a reinforcement . Factories that were sewing pieces just for fashion would n't have used two heavy layers of fabric because of the expense . <p> When the prototype came back , I said , " Oh my gosh , it just never occurred to me that would even be done . " When my garments were produced , every detail needed to be clearly outlined because it was for function and not fashion . From the bar-tacking , the double stitching , the weight of the thread , the weight of the fabrics that were used for reinforcement , all of those things had to be made very clear on our production notes . Factories were not accustomed to doing anything that way . Nowadays factories are very familiar with it . It was a learning experience for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you werent working with any military standards <p> LR : No , not at all . Our pants simply got picked up by that community , which was a really wonderful thing . We had a really good , healthy business before we sold and produced it in black . But , of course , the 5.11 was n't designed in black . It was designed in khaki . <p> TPB : Who were the first wear testers ? <p> LR : It was n't tested by the military or anything like that because it was n't its purpose at the time . We did n't  have the technical people out there testing and sending feedback initially . It just happened " whether it was all of our friends or Royal . We would be modifying and getting this feedback . It was just a natural thing because the company was so intimate . At that time , we had a very close relationship with anybody who sold our brand . <p> An image of Liz Robbins from her husbands second book Fail Falling . <p> TPB : Since you guys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market the pants ? Was it more of a word-of-mouth thing ? <p> LR : Yes and no . Sure , there was word-of-mouth , but by that time we also had our own catalogs and our own sales force . I cant really pin down when our national or international people began to sell our products relative to where the 5.11 began . It was not too long after we were in business that we found ourselves really in business unexpectedly , so to speak . So , it was our own sales people and promotional materials that promoted the 5.11s . <p> TPB : How did you stumble upon Dan Costa , and what was it like working with him ? <p> LR : I think you 've got to get the date exactly from him . I cant remember the date . Its been five or six years , and I ca n't comment on what it was like to work with Dan . <p> TPB : How do you feel about the direction that Mr. Costa took Royal Robbins ? <p> LR : He did n't  really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun off the product that he saw a future for and ran with it . And that 's the 5.11 Tactical . <p> TPB : And this was something that you had n't  envisioned at the time when you were making the Billy Goat Shorts in the 1950s " that it would become this big industry of tactical gear . <p> LR : It was neither our focus nor our purpose . We really enjoyed working with the people who bought the 5.11 that werent part of our industry . However , we were focusing on the outdoor community . It was very , very different than the focus now on specifically the 5.11 . I mean , he named the company 5.11 . Its certainly an interesting concept that I had never imagined . <p> TPB : I mean , its kind of crazy that one company can be based off of one pair of pants . <p> LR : It is . Its particularly crazy to me . <p> TPB : Now tactical pants are worn not only by SWAT teams and FBI agents , but computer geeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today ? <p> LR : I think fads are fascinating . You just never know when something is going to be a fad . I think that cargo pants , which are probably the general category , are something that will come and go . And , in terms of tactical , I honestly do not know . I do n't  keep up with the " tactical " world . Its a pretty foreign world to me , aside from the FBI with whom we initially worked . We loved their feedback , and we worked very happily with them . <p> In fact , our customer service rep who handled just the FBI accounts at the time ended up marrying the 5.11 purchaser for the FBI . We had great people , and they made relationships as we did business . That one was just very sweet . <p> TPB : A lot of females complain about having trouble finding a good fitting tactical pant . What advice can you give them ? <p> LR : Laughs . Good luck ! No , you know that will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately when we were designing outdoor clothing , women in that industry were not so fashion-oriented . Nowadays its a little bit harder to separate who it is buying an outdoor pant strictly with the function in mind and who 's buying it because its fashionable . <p> It 's just a really interesting thing when you go into the clothing business , especially if you start with pure function like we did . So , no , I do n't know what to say . I think that its always going to be a tricky thing for women to find pants . Our hips are different ; our waists are different . The rise always changes from something around your waist to something that is practically half-way down your hips . I 'm really glad I am not making those decisions now ! <p> TPB : Because you asked about the 5.11 rear strap , I 'm going to guess that you do n't  own a pair of tactical pants today . <p> LR : I wear the Royal Robbins 5.11 that I 've had for years . They do n't  wear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , I do n't  have a pair of tactical pants . I do n't  even think of them as tactical pants . I have to rethink that . I think of them as 5.11 . But I have no reason to change from the 5.11 I wore 15 or 20 years ago . It still serves the same purpose . <p> TPB : What keeps you busy nowadays ? <p> LR : Royal is writing , and he has books that need to be printed , published and promoted . We are very busy with his writings along with the other things that I do daily just to keep up with our life at home . <p> TPB : He s going to have seven installments of his book ? <p> LR : Well , I do n't know .

Its the same with climbing , basically . <p> I just hope that a lot of the other pants that are tactically directed are doing well . This tactical world is completely new and foreign to me . I have to tell you because it really is . Even though the company is still in Modesto , we have no connection with it . Sure , - a few people we 've known work there , but I had no idea that the tactical pant had become a category in itself . I had absolutely no idea .

They were so durable and comfortable . They would last for years . The seams and stress points never gave out . Eventually the fabric would wear out from being washed and worn so much . I wish I had bought a truck load of them . The 5.11 pants of today do n't  compare to the originals . I 've tried several different ones but they all fail in quality , comfort and durability .

At first , I did n't  mind this because there are n't  too many defense contractors who can handle the massive task that Halliburton was hired to do . Weve been finding out little by little that even the mighty Halliburton is n't God and cant do it all . <p> Under the deal , Halliburton had exclusive rights to provide the military with a wide range of work that included keeping soldiers around the world fed , sheltered and in communication with friends and family back home . Government audits turned up more than $1 billion in questionable costs . Whistle-blowers told how the company charged $45 per case of soda , double-billed on meals and allowed troops to bathe in contaminated water . <p> This is n't the least of Halliburtons problems .

They are n't  helping either , leaving this brave American providing support to our soldiers out cold . <p> There more stories like this out there . <p> John Merchant has a site up called My Iraq Page that details all the trouble he s been having with Halliburton .

Those guys and girls are the reason this project has survived as long as it has . <p> Maybe I missed something when I went through Houston in 2003 , but I do n't  remember hearing anything about the DBA . I did n't  learn about it till I went to work for IAP in 2004 . What gets me are those that have come home to get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient paperwork to prove that they were injured in combat/Iraq/on the job . Then , how many of these guys even know about the DBA . Course , then there is PTSD . Even some of the soldiers have problems getting help with that one . And many are afraid to report it because they catch crap from others that think they are weak because they say that have PTSD . <p> It is my belief that if AIG is handling the Workmans comp claims for Halliburton/KBR then Halliburton/KBR should provide them with the paperwork needed for the claim . My 2 page incedent report has not been given to my driver . That report details the ambush and my driver being shot . Why do n't  he have that report ? Why should he have to fight to get AIG to approve his claim ? He is going to a lawyer that deals with the DBA now .

I have been looking for him since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fate and God the brought us together that weekend . With my having been his CC I feel a responsibility to help him if I can .

Yes , I may not have all the facts of his case , or any of the other guys that I know that are having problems , it was n't me that it happened to , BUT we do have to make sure these guys and gal are taken care of and not tossed aside like so much trash . As I said in my book , I was taken care of when I injured my knee and sent home . Roy , a guy in my crew that was shot about a month earlier on one of our missions was taken care of as well . But this guy has not been . Why is that ? Why is there a guy living in his car ready to blow his head off because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he saw and did over there , and it is driving him crazy ? I just do n't  understand . <p> You wo n't find anyone harder on somethings than I am . I feel very strong about if you cant handle it go home . But if you are injured , what choice do you have now ? <p> Sandy , thanks for giving another side of the story . Let me say in addition to this , that I personally never had a problem with KBR . I 've worked with other soldiers who have , but not me . I ate well in Iraq . As a matter of fact , when KBR took over I had never eaten better . <p> With that said , Halliburton is a multi-billion dollar business . The whole " occupational " injury stuff is bogus . The company should recognize that there are lapses in coverage between workmans comp , Defense Base Act and AIG . The bottom line is that they do n't  . <p> Look at what the " Defense Base Act " gives you . My gosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked for your sacrifice with $7500 ? ! Soldiers get paid more than that . We get medically retired . I think defense contractors , nay , multi-billion dollar defense contractors could afford to come up with something that takes care of those employees willing to put their lives on the line in combat zones . I can understand the ones back home losing an arm on a buzzsaw or something , but were talking about combat . <p> No hate mail from me as I really WANT to be enlightened and educated on points I 'm not fully aware of . And thank you for all you do to keep us fed , fueled and supplied . <p> Ive been a medic for KBR for over 18 months and it seems that a lot of the stories i hear are from people who only know " half " of the story or who are simply misinformed when it comes injuries or to the coverage of the insurance carrier AIG in which the injuries that are occupational in nature are covered . I work with them on a daily basis when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classifies these injuries as occupational is not by KBR or Halliburton , but OSHA . Employees that are hurt in theater also have the option to file for workmans compensation . It is to the descretion after the investigation if these will be paid out . These employees also have the option to file a DBA claim ( Defense Base Act ) which if they are not covered by workmans comp , will be covered by this act . This act allows people that are hurt on a military installation , however not occupational in nature , to be covered and assisted . Now before i get all of these " hate " replies , let me tell you a little about myself . My brother drove tankers for 19 months between cedar and anaconda . He arrived there a month prior to my arrival back in 04 . I love truck drivers because they are the reason that people have what they do in theater . Without them , there would be no Logcap III . We would not be able to function without the supplies they deliver daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I continue to hear are from individuals that are misinformed or who speak from emotion and not from fact . People who hear one peice of information or read one story and then blow it out of proportion so that all they accomplish is to scare a few people . Why is it that this occures ? Because we are all human . All that I ask is that people try to get the whole story before believing anything that they heard or read . Media hype is unbelievable these days , especially when it comes to anything dealing with Iraq , Halliburton , or KBR . There also have been a lot of cutbacks , however I would be willing to bet that many of the people that are saying they got " screwed " are probably the ones who were let go due to the RIF ( Reduction in force ) . Let me ask them a few questions . 1 . When you were sitting in that room in Houston before you signed your " agreement " what was the one thing that they told you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the company . You can be terminated without any specific cause at any given time . You were given a two way plane ticket . If you decided to leave before the agreement you signed had been filled would you pay them anything back for not forfilling you part of the agreement ? 2 . How many hours are you actually guaranteed ? Answer : 40 hours . Ever wondered why they only paid you uplift for the first 40 hours ? 3 . For those who got caught in the tax crunch because you were either laid off or were hurt prior to making your time , What kept you from allowing your check to be taxed monthly on what you made and collecting it at the end of the year ? <p> There is one commonality for all of the questions . What is it ? Decisions . We all made the decision to go and how we performed while there . I have been through the orientation twice through Houston and have to say I was thoroughly informed with alot of information . Almost too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed " decision . And with doing so will accept any responsibilty from that , if its paying taxes on a specific amount of money if i chose not to have my pay taxed or whatever . Main thing about this is that it is all contract work . And anyone who has done this type of work knows that it is " feast or famine " . <p> I do not agree with some of the decision making made by the up echelons of KBR / Halliburton , but we all got into where we are by making the " decision " to go . We all knew what our jobs were when we signed the agreement . If you chose not to read it " thoroughly " prior to signing it , then who can anyone blame than themselves . I think I 'm just getting tired of people not accepting responsiblity for there actions and want to blame others when it does n't  go the way they want it to go . <p> Thank you for this opportunity to give you my feelings . I know my ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas were coming to mind .. lol .. Thank you all for what you have done or will do in the future . <p> I have been informed that one of the guys has now been put on a gag order while he talks with AIG . They have decided to listen to him now . He has had to take his story off his web site for now . When it is back up , I will let ya know . <p> Let me make something clear here . Not all former Halliburton/KBR people have had trouble in getting their medical bill paid for , but some have . Just like with some Military guys sometimes having problems in getting things paid for it is wrong for all , soldier and civilain . We all served in the war/combat zone . If injuried , that person should be taken care of . <p> I 'm sorry so many have had problems with KBR/Halliburton . During my 1+ year in Iraq , I never once had a bad experience with them . I never lost clothing . The food was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pumped . Shower trailers were cleaned several times each day . I had access to the internet and phones thanks to them . <p> Simply put , they served my division , brigade , battalion , company and me fabulously . They went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed as we ran the jail on post . I am sorry to hear not everyone has had the same experiences . <p> For all those that cant read our email , no one is deleting Blue Barns comments . We recently installed a new program that " eats " spam instead of bothering us with approving or disapproving it . What appears to have happened is that the program was eating Blue Barns comments . <p> We here at ASP have a proud tradition of not deleting dissenting views . A search of our comments will show that the two times we DID delete comments , the individual was given numerous warnings about his attitude and language . Only after exhaustive " diplomacy " did we delete those comments . <p> I was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appear to be back up . He was somewhat gentlemanly in his email and we worked through the problem . <p> CJ and all , thank you for posting this and helping these guys . I know some of them personally and have heard their stories . It breaks my heart that they are loosing everything they have because they were injured trying to support the troops and Halliburton , KBR and AIG are refusing their claims . One guys is living out of his car , another is on the brink of a divorce . I could go on , but I will let them tell their stories themselves . Thanks again for your help ! Cindy

The Army recently launched a new recruitment tool recruiter named SGT Star . I went to GoArmy.com and decided to check it out for myself . Since I 'm already in the Army , I sat down and conducted an interview with the virtual recruiter . <p> CJ : Sorry about that . People are just curious , you know ? SGT STAR : Thats ok , what else can i help you with ? <p> CJ : Do you drink ? SGT STAR : Alcohol use is permitted on post , provided you are 21 or older . However , during training , alcohol is not allowed . While the Army does allow use of alcohol , it does not tolerate abuse and Soldiers are held accountable for their actions . <p> CJ : how old are you ? SGT STAR : I started my new assignment on August 2 , 2006 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to help you learn how you can become Army Strong . What can I answer for you about the Army ? <p> CJ : What do you do in the Army ? SGT STAR : My name is Sgt. STAR which stands for Strong , Trained And Ready . I 'm an artificial intelligence agent created for the U.S. Army to provide you with information about Army life . <p> CJ : Artificial intelligence ? Isnt that the same thing Marines are made of ? SGT STAR : I can only tell you about the Army , which is the largest and oldest of all the branches of service . Its self-contained , well-equipped and can be deployed anywhere in the world . As the largest branch , the Army offers the most competitive enlistment options , incentives and guarantees . <p> CJ : Naw , do n't  worry about it .

All Soldiers must be strong , trained and ready upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including training exercises , humanitarian missions or combat operations .

SGT STAR : I 'm here to help you navigate though goarmy.com and answer your questions about the Army . I 'm not here to discuss politics . <p> CJ : Have you ever been deployed yourself ? SGT STAR : In times of war , deployment is likely . The possibility of deployment depends on your MOS and unit of assignment .

The Army prides itself in training of all Soldiers to ensure they are prepared for any situation . In the event of injury , Soldiers are treated by some of the best medical professionals in the world on the Army healthcare team . <p> CJ : What if I 'm killed ? SGT STAR : Unfortunately , some Soldiers do die during combat . The possibility of death exists in every profession . In the event that a Soldier dies , the Army provides compensation for the family . <p> CJ : Cindy Sheehan is an idiot . I just have to get that out.SGT STAR : I 'm sorry you feel that way .

I just got so caught up in other things that this sat in my draft folder and was forgotten about . <p> My friend John Ferguson recently started his own firearms company called BlackJack Arms . He s about to retire after an honorable career in the Army . He and I both have a fondness for firearms and its been his dream to start his company and build guns . As John told me recently , " I like guns and shooting and always wanted to get into the gun industry . " Well he has fulfilled that dream . <p> A little over a month ago , I had an opportunity to check out Johns shop and test fire some of his customized guns . The first rifle I shot was his customized , Russian built AK-47 . On the model I tested , he replaced the trigger group ( 3 parts ) , the stock , pistol grip and muzzle break . The result was a beautiful and surprisingly smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expected a lot more recoil with each squeeze of the trigger . He also installed a bullet guide and adjust the length of the magazine catch to be able to use high capacity magazines that most shooters prefer . The Tapco Side Folding stock added a little more class to what is an otherwise boring rifle , aesthetically speaking . The iron sites were on target and the customized parts made the rifle a bit less weighty than your typical AK rifle . If I did n't  already have two AKs , I would have bought this one on the spot ! <p> The second gun I shot was a customized Saiga 12-gauge shotgun . At first glance , you would think this is just another AK-47 assault rifle . In reality , the Saiga 12 is a sporty looking , man-candy of a shotgun . The banana clip holds ten rounds in the semi-automatic shotgun . In order to force the heavier bolt of the gun back to reload another shell , John replaced the buffer spring and

I do n't  share this to pump myself up but to warn again that if Michael Yon ever steps foot back in the United States I will slap a defamation and libel suit on his ass faster than a Thai take-out place can read back his order . Yon has not merely suggested that I am a case of Stolen Valor or stated he " thinks " I 'm a case of Stolen Valor . He states such as a matter of fact . He also states as fact that I lied about helping with the capture of 8 of the top 55 Iraqi leaders in 2003 . He also claims I never saw combat . He has reported these and other false claims ( like threatening to kill him ) as fact both on his public Facebook page and his personal blog . I have screenshots galore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references , I have them . So , I offer this up to again discredit a man that has little or no credibility left . He should be shaking in his Thai sandals with this realization . <p> He has interferred in a police investigation by contacting Temple Police Department and County Prosecutors and passed these lies on to them .

I saw Michael Yons comment and citation and he comments that the award should have a specific date . I will tell you mine is for a specific date but it just gives a general range of dates . It has to do with who wrote it up . The BSM/V was earned by MSG Grisham . <p> DC , and like me I 'm sure you do n't  go around parading your narrative where everyone can see it , right ? I have nothing to prove to Michael Yon and his sycophants just as you have nothing to prove . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military dating scamming is all new to me . So I have spent quiet a few hours on this website . Wow , talk about finding the info I had been looking for . Okay , the question is who in the world is this Michael Yon . Or perhaps you should n't answer that for he might get his panties in a bunch . lol . Okay , in all seriousness . I see a connection that might or might not be . So maybe you can help me out with this . <p> Okay , the scammer I was so lucky to meet was named , " Micheal Harris " just a few weeks ago . I have a strong feeling it is the latest " Jackson Adam " make over . I was very happy to see you 're commitment to disclose this fraud . Now that was back in Feb of 2010 , just curious are you still sticking to this commitment or have you come to your senses and realized that such a low-life like him does n't  merit your time and effort ? Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'll let you answer it for me . <p> The connection I think I see . the following are some of the fake military lover boys : Michael James , Michael Boers , Michael Dimeo , Michael Farris , Micheal Harris ( too originallol. a change of a letter , really ? ) , and then there was Newman Michael . He must have ran out of letters to change so he got really creative and switched his first name for his last name . Goodness , you got to be kidding me . So , the big question is this Michael Yon just another one of this Michaels multiple personalities ? One thing that stood out was his comment to the effect of " to what gain should I provide the proof " . Well this Mr. Micheal Harris responded with similar words when I first told him I had figured out he was a scam . First he responded with , " do you evening know what fraud is ? I have n't asked you for nothing . " When I asked for proof by emailing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of his deployment base , and his squadron . He said something to the same effect of , " for what gain ? " Coincidence ? I met a Martin Jackson back in Nov 2012 when I first got on this crazy roller coaster ride . His grammar was very rough , so I made a comment about how English must be a second language . Well needless to say he never answered back . Crazy part is that I thought nothing of it until now . So basically this guy new he was messing with me specifically . I also met one other military guy on eharmony stationed in Hawaii but serving in middle east with a little girl with his mother . Shut the front door .. I am at this very moment putting all the pieces of the puzzle together . Nah , it couldnt have been the same jerk . You do n't  think this sicko gets a kick out of setting a target and doing all he can to reach it ? If so , he s mental and its not just about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more question , I really think more needs to be done about this . Being a veteran of the USAF , my four years of service helped tremendously in recognizing this jerk of a fraud . But what defense do these other woman have ? I do acknowledge that a human being should have the sense to not send money to a complete stranger they just met . But I consider myself educated , finishing up my masters degree this December , yet I still fell for the smooth talking for a while there . The crazy part is that I showed many of the texts to my co-workers ( in education ) and no one including myself found anything suspicious about it . Until the last few messages of , " oh , I got to go for now because I need to email my best friend Jeff for money because Mimi ( the 3 yr daughter ) is sick and I have no means to send money to my late wifes sister who is caring for her in Australia . " Now , I must say my co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it sounded suspicious . Lol . I felt like a big enough fool without them thinking the same thing . <p> I really think these dating sights should allow postings of such stories available by a click of a button their websites . Especially the big players like Match.com , Eharmony.com , and yes , also Christianmingles.com . Now if site members decide they do n't  want to click on the button then they do n't  have to . But it should be made available for those that do want to play it safe . Do you have any suggestions where I could get the ball rolling on this ? Pretty sure they will turn a deaf ear because its all about the money . But it has to be worth a shot . Will it help if I compose a list of past reported user ids , names , emails , phone #s , etc ? I am willing to put my actions behind my words . And if this message wasnt posted quiet yet , I am pretty confident that I can reel him back in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fraud , he was still persistent on keeping me hooked . He sent me messages , with I still love you . And you fell in love with me not the people in the picture . The last , " I love you " was November 7th . Just an idea . <p> Well , I have rambled on long enough . I do hope I hear back from you . If not , well I do understand you 're a busy person . At the very least just let me thank you for taking time to read my long message and mostly for providing a place for so many victims to voice their stories . By doing so , you gave them ( us ) a means to start putting this undeserved disappointment behind us in the past . Hopefully making each one of us , just a little bit more wiser . <p> I did a FOIA request which was a simple e-mail . Ms. Cynthia Blanch from the Armys Human Resource Command ( directed from FOIA ) stated there werent any other documents uploaded with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Michael Yon , a man who killed another man in a drunken bar fight and who took another Soldiers weapon and blindly fired three rounds into a shop where a CSM was engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy , I 'll stick with MSG Grisham . His actions were nothing short of brave that day . Mr. Yon is not a smart man . <p> Well , I see my posts , which I took quite a bit of time to research and compose have been deleted from his site . I can only presume he deleted my input . <p> I think I see now what you 're talking about . He wants to control the narrative , and isnt very professional about his conduct . I 'm sorry to see you 're a target of Mr. Yons unsubstantiated assertions , and character assassination MSG Grisham . I wish you the best , and hope people see Mr. Yon for what he is . <p> nm121244 , thank you for at least taking the time to research , look around , and ask pertinent questions . It is unfortunate that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CJ knows he has nothing to prove . CJ has given me a lot of leeway over the years to document Yons lies , against his better judgement , because CJ knows it is like Don Quixote tilting at windmills , but for open-minded individuals like you , I have always felt it was important to set the false record straight . Thank you . I have despaired for a long time that his lies and censorship went unnoticed . You restore my faith a little . <p> Thanks for taking the time to respond . From the links you provided , it looks like Mr. Yon should post multiple retractions , and offer an apology . I 'm sure that wont happen since most people have a hard time with admitting error . I see from the link the BSM narrative is available via a FOIA request , too ? <p> Its a shame Mr. Yon is intentionally attacking Mr. Grishams service . From the outside looking in its fairly obvious Mr. Grishams record is truthful , and its Mr. Yon who is fabricating untruths . <p> nm121244 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper thing to do , but as you can see from the first link where I had to use the Wayback Machine , what Yon does is just hide/delete stuff after he is caught out in his lies and then he tries attacking from a different direction , changing the story slightly as he goes along . This has been an ongoing thing with Yon for 5 years or more . At this point , the evidence of his lies as I linked above should be sufficient for people to understand how that man works , and yet , here we are , with people like you who do n't  know the whole story asking CJ to " prove " things . Any new FB followers Yon gathers , he drags out the lying " dispatches " and posts them up on his page and his followers are shocked and stunned at CJs perfidy . Since he deletes and bans anyone who argues that these are not truthful posts that Yon shares , its pretty much one-sided lying and people just lapping it up as Word From on High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not willing to provide the citation to respond to Yon because I have no desire to respond to his every false accusation just to make him feel good about himself . " , but that 's not really the case . In fact , you 've spent a lot of time rebutting what he has said ( as evidenced by multiple posts here , on Twitter , Facebook , and various other venues ) , to include posting a copy of your evaluation here a few days ago ( looks great , btw ! ) . Your evaluation has never been a point of contention ; its the citation . By posting your evaluation instead of the citation you do yourself a disservice because the action looks at best like misdirection , and at worst that you have something to hide . <p> I do n't  think its a matter of you not wanting to spend the time to simply upload your citation , because you 've demonstrated , and will continue to demonstrate an endless stamina to sustain this feud ( as he will too ) , and to protect your reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citation ? What good reasons do you have to put in the time consuming effort of posting pictures , evaluations , and other things as a rebuttal , but you ca n't be bothered to post the very thing that would end this silly point ? <p> nm12144 , I would add to CJs comment that a year ago , Yon tried posting this as " evidence " that CJ did n't  have a BSM-V . So I wrote a post countering all that bullshit . Included in that post is a jpg image of CJs certificate . Then I wrote this post because Yon had to steal the image and write a bunch of other crap . So at what point do we just say ENOUGH . Yon will continuously make shit up , just as shown in this post , where one of the updates shows he will take even a joking hack post on CJs FB page by CJs wife and say shit about how she was using money in the indiegogo account ( which was not even available at the time ! ! ) for some big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Yon and ask him for primary evidence , as in someone who served with CJ at the time he earned the medal , to prove that it either does not exist , as his original post stated a year ago , or that the V device was not earned in combat . He will say , as he always does , that he has already " proved " it was n't earned , which I can only assume he means his " dispatch " where he tied in Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman into some sort of weird ass 7 Degrees of Separation justification for all his claims . Isnt he supposed to be some hot shot " writer ? " Can he not do simple research , contacts , and due diligence or is that beyond his skills ? <p> See , the way it works is that if someone claims another has " stolen valor " through deception , it is HIS burden to prove it , not the other way around . <p> I am not willing to provide the citation to respond to Yon because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusation just to make him feel good about himself . It would n't stop his incessant attacks against me and frankly the more he continues to defame and slander me the worse it will be for him if he ever comes back to the states . Ive provided the citation to several media outlets in the past as part of their request for due diligence in reporting provided they do n't  release it publicly . Why ? Because I do n't  like talking about that day . And Yon is not a reporter . He has n't  even been with troops for over two years after being kicked out of Afghanistan for lying about being assaulted and having his life threatened . I did what I did that day to survive and protect my troops. - they know what i did and that is all that matters to me . Yon is not worth much of my effort . I 've largely ignored him over the past two years in the hopes he would just go away . He has n't  . Instead he keeps publishing lie after lie and his sycophants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will continue giving him rope with which to hang himself . Every now and then , as I did with this post and the other that is linked at the end , I will provide some facts with proof that Yon is lying so people can see that they CANT trust what he says about me . Contrary to his narrative nearly everything he says about me is completely fabricated because he s jealous of my success .

Because who wants someone carrying a slicked up deadly weapon that could very well slip right out of their hands . <p> Then there are those who understand handguns need care and maintenance to run like a well-oiled machine . While cleaning and oiling a gun go hand in hand , its particularly important to use that oil or grease to maintain superior functionality . <p> Do wipe off any access lubrication before getting started . During this process , its a good idea to look for signs of wear and tear on the gun or any developing issues . <p> Do clean your gun before oiling it.Actually , most folks clean their pistol after every trip to the range to prevent rust . <p> Do n't  over oil your gun.If you do , it will have an opposite effect and collect more debris than if you would n't have oiled it at all . Think less is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do use Q-Tips for accuracy in oil application . This will help prevent getting too much oil on the gun . <p> Do oil the areas where there is metal-to-metal contact . Since you 've read the instruction manual , you should already know where not to oil . Be sure to keep the feed ramp oil free , unless you 've been instructed otherwise .

There are a dozen ways you can conceal your weapon while remaining your stylish self . <p> As YouTube user Faliaphotography demonstrates in the above video , a new wardrobe is not required when you pick up that CCW license . As an advocate of on-body carrying , she does n't  think women should put a gun in a purse or car because someone could easily snatch it up . The 28-year-old dresses in a completely innocuous manner . And being 54 " and 120 pounds , she does n't  have many places to hide her Ruger LCR . <p> With most outfits , she recommends wearing an IWB holster , even in the winter . The other options listed below come in handy when pants are either too tight or lack belt loops . <p> Dresses &amp; Skirts " Some of the most feminine outfits prove to be the most difficult for concealed carry .

The holster hangs out from underneath the shorts . To top that , she has to unzip her pants in order to draw . Distracting ? Yes . Tactical ? No . <p> Tight Pants " What happens when there 's no room ( or belt loops ) for a holster around the waist ? If the bottoms of your pants are baggy , try an ankle holster . Youll have to use both your hands to lift up your pant leg to draw , so be sure to practice . <p> Jeans " Time to break out the ankle holster again .

She has an easy time maneuvering in an ankle holster while wearing a long skirt . <p> Short jacket " This works best with an inside-the-waistband holster . Tuck your shirt in , and let your jacket drape along the outside . <p> Boot cut or skinny jeans " When your pants are both tight at the bottom and the top , she suggests you strap on a shoulder holster . She confesses is her least favorite type of holster . Nevertheless its a good winter-carry holster with poufy jackets . She recommends- OWB holsters ( on the waistband ) as well for skinny jeans .

@@96509823 @709823/ 68528 @qwx928528 <h> Snakebite Prevention : Snake Boots 101 <p> Snakes are to my wife what work is to Homer Simpson . And after finding the first snake of the year in my backyard this weekend , it just seemed like a perfect time to talk about snake boots . Snakebite prevention starts with having the right gear , and wearing an 18-inch snake boot sure does help give you peace of mind while walking around in venomous snake country . <p> What exactly does it take to be considered a snake boot ? The first obvious feature has to be the height of the boot . Covering most , if not all , of the calf is important , as this is where most unsuspecting hunters are bitten . The ability to absorb the force of the bite while not allowing the fangs to penetrate is another important element . Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes have 1-inch long fangs , so the thicker the fabric , the better . The last major feature does not even deal with bite prevention but rather comfort . If the boots are not comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to wear them . <p> TERRA FORCE technology provides exceptional boot support and stability without the traditional weight . The four components in the exclusive TERRA FORCE system combine to form an extremely rigid , stable platform that 's also comfortable and supportive . <p> Hyper-Dri- is a highly engineered , waterproof , scent-free barrier that lines the entire boot for 100% protection . Not only does Hyper-Dri- block water from entering the boot , it also transfers it away from your foot . <h> 2 Comments on " Snakebite Prevention : Snake Boots 101 " <p> I wish there was a way to have antivenin on hand when out in the back country of the west . I believe it has to be refrigerated to last . Lots of the times I find myself 5-10 miles from the nearest road . What does a guy do if he gets snake bit in an area like that ? I guess snake bite prevention is the best method . For now I guess I will just have to stick with my snake proof gear like snake boots and snake glovessnake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of snake protection . I coon hunt and in certain areas I wear the new TurtleSkin snake bite protection pants . They are light weight and easy to wear . I did a lot research on these before I got my first pair .

Right away , looking at his profile I could tell we were dealing with a first-class douche nozzle . <p> The 19th Infantry Division of the Army has n't  been active since 1944 . So there is no 2nd Battalion and no 19th Infantry Division . He also shows that he graduated from Grafton High School in Grafton , Wisconsin , in 2011A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO . Ok , I know that in a year its possible he joined the Army . So , let 's look at his Army picture real quick and take a look at this patriotic American high school graduate . <p> WTH ? ! ? ! I got promoted pretty quick to Sergeant First Class , the rank this tool is wearing here . It took me about seven years to get and I was cruising ! This guy somehow made it in a year ! ! That 's one hard charger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have accomplished something big . I 'll ignore the fact that this guy is unshaven wearing his uniform , has no rank on his hat , is wearing an Air Force combat patch , has a flag patch on his left sleeve , has a gray t-shirt on under his uniform , haircut is n't within regs , and generally looks like a tool . <p> Let 's see how he did it according to one of his photos . <p> Dayum ! That looks like one hell of a resume . But , it leaves more questions than answers . Again , what 's with the Air Force patch ? That flag patch is n't worn on any Army uniform I 'm aware of . I have seen a version of it on some SF civilian headgear , but never on a uniform . The only ribbons I recognize here worn by Army troops is the Iraq Campaign Medal , Afghanistan Campaign Medal , National Defense Service Medal , and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal . The rest of the medals looked familiar , but I could n't place them . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JROTC medals from high school that I still have . Voila ! Eureka ! Okay , at least the top one in the middle made sense to me . I was the captain of our Honor Guard during my senior year and got that ribbon for being on the teamin high school . But , again , what about the rest ? <p> Well , then I noticed that the bottom right ribbon with four oak leaf clusters means this guy is a certified badass ! He has earned a total of FIVE Air Medals . These are awarded to those who have distinguished themselves " by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight . " I almost missed it because it was so low on the totem pole . <p> In the Air Force list of accomplishments , he s got the Air Force Good Conduct ribbon thrown in there . The rest are anyones guess . I have no idea where they came from . I scoured JROTC , ROTC , and every services ( including the Coast Guard , Merchant Marines , and Public Health Service ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and I was just going cross-eyed . <p> Either way , this guy did n't  even try to make it look good . I could be making something out of nothing . Maybe he wears this getup when he s playing Call of Duty with his friends to get into character and did n't  intend for his poses to get leaked out . Perhaps , he s on a super secret paramilitary team no one knows about and those awards are all classified . I 'm sure one of them is the Bin Laden Burial at Sea Medal . <p> I 'm more convinced that Mr. Josh Kueffler , high school graduate ( suspect ) , is just a liar and braggart pretending to be something he is n't . Do n't  get me wrong , I 'm sure there are real Soldiers who still take pictures of themselves in the bathroom mirror and use it for a profile picture on Facebook .

@@96509832 @709832/ <h> 13 Ridiculously Tactical Items <p> This question , posed on Kel-Tec Owners Group forum in February , further proves that " tactical " is indeed the buzzword darling of the gear and guns industry . Therefore , its only natural for that word to be applied to some traditionally non-tactical products , which has created a recent- onslaught- of the most ridiculously tactical items in the world . <p> And at the other end of the spectrum ? OK , some included on this list are truly tactical products that will blow your mind with radical ingenuity . <p> With that said , we 'd like to give a special shout-out to one of our favorite bloggers- Say Uncle , who pointed to many items below and always keeps an eye out for tactical insanity . <p> 2 . Tactical Paper " What exactly makes paper tactical ? Good question . Firstly , the paper must have a green or desert-tan tint , because white sheets would certainly alert enemies to you location . Secondly , it must be able to withstand any inclement weather . And for just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . <p> 3 . Tactical First Aid Kits " During a medical emergency , its best to turn to a tactical first aid kit rather than some old run-of-the-mill kit . The difference ? Absolutely nothing . That is , unless you step up and spend the big bucks for a Tactical Medical Solutions R-Aid Bag . For $265 , it includes materials for hemorrhage control , airway management , penetrating chest trauma and more . <p> 4 . Tactical iPhone Case " And you thought having a 3G or 3GS still was completely untactical . Beef it up with a MagPul Field Case , which appears to be back ordered until infinity . <p> 5 . Tactical Car " For a toootally reasonable $295K , you can own the most luxurious and tactical car ever created . Its bulletproof , biofueled and built by hand . Oh , and there are only 100 out there . <p> 6 . Tactical Bacon " The Internets love affair with bacon does n't  end at tactical . If you have n't checked out this canned bacon or viewed the taste testing videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balls " Say what ? ! Designed specifically for police officers , these tactical balls roll on the ground to distract and disorient criminals " because who does n't  get flustered when they see bright blinking balls ? Do n't  answer . With 20 hours of light , the mobile- illumination device comes in a three pack along with a handy storage belt . <p> 9 . Tactical Golf Cart " This is probably something you would n't use during a regular 18-hole game . That is , unless someone invites a terrorist . The $45,000 armored golf cart developed by MetalTech was built to endure grenade blasts and gunfire . <p> 10 . Tactical Contacts " While a little demonic looking , performance-enhancing contact lenses have been compared to wearing sunglasses without having to actually do so . It also assists athletes in picking up extreme visual details like the seams of a baseball while at bat . If it can do all that , imagine how these contacts could help while on patrol . <p> 11 . Tactical Corset " Featured in such high-brow publications as The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tactical community . But for fashionistas ? Theyll definitely give it a shot . <p> 12 . Tactical Toiletry Bag " How do you tactical up a toiletry bag ? Simply add 1050-Denier water- and abrasion-resistant ballistic nylon , mix in some Dupont Teflon , a touch of Duraflex nylon , stir in some bar-tacks , and tah-dah its tactical ! <p> 13 . Tactical Cheese Holster " At this point anything can be tactical , right ? This one looks real , but we truly doubt its authenticity . And if its not ? Well , that just stinks . <p> Did we leave out your favorite tactical item ? Leave a link in the comments section , and well be sure to post it . <p> For the record the we had that very Tactical vehicle in Iraq and they were recalled due to the manufacture taking short cuts on the Armour !

In an effort to be responsive , Tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue , and the union agreed to do so . The union membership voted overwhelmingly Thursday to reinstate Labor Day as one of the plant+GGs paid holidays , while keeping Eid al-Fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only . This means that in 2008 only , Shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays . <p> For the remainder of the five-year contract period , the eight paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Day , Memorial Day , Independence Day , Labor Day , Thanksgiving Day , Christmas Day and a Personal Holiday , which could either be the employee+GGs birthday , Eid al-Fitr or another day requested and approved by their supervisor . <p> This issue concerns only the plant at Shelbyville , Tennessee . Labor Day has always been celebrated , and continues to be , at the other 118 Tyson plants across the country . <p> The Shelbyville complex employs approximately 1,200 people . Approximately 1,000 workers are covered by the RWDSU union agreement at that location . <p> Food workers at the Shelbyville , Tenn. , plant for Tyson Foods , which boasts on its corporate website that it strives " to honor God , " will have time off for Eid al-Fitr , the Muslim holiday closing the month of Ramadan , instead of the American tradition Labor Day . <p> Keep in mind that Tyson Foods is n't ADDING another day for Muslims to take off work , instead of REPLACING an already existing holiday . So the issue is n't that Tyson catering to providing Muslims with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ones . I could care less that 700 of Tysons Shelbyville plants 1200 workers are Muslim . They live in AMERICA ! ! If they want to take Labor Day off and call it Eid al-Fitr in their own homes , they 're free to do so . Just as non-Christians are free to take Christmas off and call it a " winter break " are free to do . It does n't  matter its still Christmas ! <p> Tyson just took the first steps necessary to install something that the Islamists have as a major goal of theirs with respect to American : install Sharia principles to American government . It begins with 700 Muslims in Shelbyville . Once other Muslim dominated unions within or without Tyson realize what has transpired , they too will demand equal benefits . Again , I do n't  have a problem with a company giving its employees time off for Eid al-Fitr . My problem comes when they rename an historic American holiday to do so . <p> So , what 's next ? Well , it just so happens that there is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Eid ul-Adha . It is celebrated in honor of Abraham who intended to sacrifice his son Ismail as proof of his loyalty to God . Both Muslims and Christians believe in the prophet Abraham . Adding 70 days to Labor Day puts us at about November 9th . Anyone want to venture where I 'm going with this ? <p> Americans , real Americans , celebrate Veterans Day on November 11th of each year , just two days after the approximate start of Eid ul-Adha . One cant help but wonder if Tyson Foods has a plan in place to ( or if the unions are already working towards it ) to replace Veterans Day with the Muslim holiday . After all , with the majority of Tyson Foods Muslims coming from Somalia , what stake do they have in a holiday meant to celebrate our nations veterans ? It would be no skin off their leather bound Korans to replace another meaningless American holiday with something they REALLY care about ! <p> This is where multiculturalism goes awry . A nation can not exist and continue to honor its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those traditions are . I cant imagine Canada giving up Canada Day on July 1st because a bunch of American emigrants found it offensive and would rather celebrate the 4th of July ! Isnt it bad enough that the completely non-American holiday , Cinco de Mayo has somehow crept into becoming an official US holiday ? What do we care about the victory of Mexican forces led over French forces in the tiny battle of Puebla ? Cinco de Mayo is celebrated more in THIS country than it is in Mexico where it is only a regional holiday in the state of Puebla ! ! <p> But , here we are giving away our American traditions and holidays freely to Somalis . Am I the only one that finds a problem with that ? Am I such an extreme nationalist that I 'm overreacting to this ? Maybe , but I do know that at least in this home , our money will not be spent on Tyson Foods products . When I was in Iraq and Kuwait and Ecuador and Panama and Japan and other places , we honored their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . Or we celebrated our own American traditions on our own time and in our own homes . <p> Ive CCd Tyson Foods public relations team with this post in the hopes that perhaps they can issue me ( and me my readers ) some sort of explanation beyond their empty " all Team Members will still have eight paid holidays , the change will not affect production " excuse . Perhaps they can begin to convince us that they are an AMERICAN company . I 'll let you know if I get a reply . <p> As an American , all I can say is that this was a vile and damaging decision on the part of Tyson . Joining a network of supporters and adding to this movement , we WILL boycott all of your products . You are an outrage and a disgrace to this country ! ! ! ! A NEW YORK CITY GIRL <p> It has taken us several days to respond to your recent series of %u2018decisions%u2019 regarding honoring Islamic holidays . Initially we were totally appalled at your decision to eliminate a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday honoring that religious cult . Immediately my spouse and I agreed that no Tyson products would ever again enter our home . Late this past week we learned that your decision had been somewhat modified and that you would now intend to observe both . We remain appalled ! And we remain committed that we will no longer be consumers of any products generated by your company or processed on the behalf of other food companies by your enterprise . Let us explain the basis of our position . <p> This is a so called religion that has the intent of world domination and under Islamic law . They are sworn enemies of our culture and our society and are driven by a deep belief that they are working on behalf of Allah . This is the far from the truth . Islam has declared a holy jihad against the western world and are attempting to spread their form of religious hatred in Europe and the US and it all begins with what appears to be simple and innocuous demands %u2013 like recognition of their holidays . Tyson Foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our culture is one of an open and democratic republic founded upon and grounded in the principle of the Christian Faith handed down through the Hebrew people . On the contrary , the Islamic belief system and laws have created a culture born in violence by violence and chaos with the intent of utter and total destruction of any individual , state or society who does not accept their way of life and their belief system which is far from benevolent and caring . Their stated objective is world domination through the use of the open societies/democracies of the %u2018western world . <p> To substantiate the above statements , I quote from the Koran , the %u201CHoly Book%u201D of the Islamic cult : <p> ( Surah 5.82 ) %u201CCertainly you will find the most violent people in enmity for those who believe to be the Jews and those who are polytheists%u2026. ( e.g. Christians ) %u201D <p> ( Surah 9.5 ) %u201CSo when the sacred months have passed away , then slay the idolaters wherever you find them , and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %u201CO does not guide the unjust people. %u201D <p> ( Surah 4.56 ) %u201CThose who disbelieve in Our communications , We shall make them enter fire ; ( Sound like a towering inferno of 9/11to you ? ) We will change them for other skins , that they may taste the chastisement ; surely Allah is Mighty , Wise. %u201D <p> With this institutonalized hatred that is propagated upon their children from birth is it any wonder that we are now confronting the most treacherous enemy in America%u2019s and the western world%u2019s history ? Our survival is it stake from an enemy within . And you %u2013 an American company are honoring this so called religion ? ! Your company%u2019s decision to honor a holiday of this murderous cultic religion whose objective is world domination is an abomination and we will not tolerate it nor will we patronize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products will ever enter this home and our goal is to spread the word about your treasonous policies that open the door to a people spewing venomous hatred and spiritual destruction upon America ! <p> The Catholic , Jew , Seventh-day Adventist , Baha%u2019i , Buddhist , or Hindu says I want the same deal the Muslims have . If you don%u2019t give it to me , you%u2019re guilty of religious discrimination under Title VII . I%u2019m not sure what a court would do in a situation like this , but we may find out if a lawsuit is filed . <p> Springdale , Arkansas %u2013 August 8 , 2008 Tyson Foods , Inc. announced today it has reached a new agreement with the Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Union ( RWDSU ) , an American union , reinstating Labor Day as one of the designated paid holidays under the contract for covered employees in the Shelbyville , Tennessee , plant . <p> Tyson made this request on behalf of its Shelbyville plant employees , some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue , and the union agreed to do so . The union membership voted overwhelmingly Thursday to reinstate Labor Day as one of the plant%u2019s paid holidays , while keeping Eid al-Fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only . This means that in 2008 only , Shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays . <p> For the remainder of the five-year contract period , the eight paid holidays will include : New Year%u2019s Day , Martin Luther King Day , Memorial Day , Independence Day , Labor Day , Thanksgiving Day , Christmas Day and a Personal Holiday , which could either be the employee%u2019s birthday , Eid al-Fitr or another day requested and approved by their supervisor . <p> This issue concerns only the plant at Shelbyville , Tennessee . Labor Day has always been celebrated , and continues to be , at the other 118 Tyson plants across the country . <p> The Shelbyville complex employs approximately 1,200 people . Approximately 1,000 workers are covered by the RWDSU union agreement at that location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not 700 , as was previously erroneously reported . They were employed at the plant via the Tennessee Department of Employment Security . <p> Given all other prayer mat/rooms made where Muslims are inevitably get taken over by them , you have to realize that this is n't about giving them space for their religion . Its about infiltrating a society and subverting it from the inside out with its own rules and foolish naivety . <p> For those that have never studied , thought about , or participated in overthrowing a government , this may not make much sense to folks . But it does exist . <p> Okay , I have read every last comment . I will no longer eat Tyson products . Not because they are giving a large population of their workers a religiuos holiday . But instead , because they decided to punish the other workers by taking away a holiday usually spent with family ( which in the rest of America will have Labor Day off ) I do n't  really understand why they could n't just add the day . You cant tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that one plant . Come on ! So no I will not eat or buy their product . As far as the prayer room goes , I think that is a nice jesture towards that religion as long as the other half of the workers are getting the same amount of breaks even if they are n't  praying . It is only fair right ? <p> America WAKE UP ! We are handing over our freedom by allowing what is happening at Tyson and I 'm sure at other places we just have n't heard about ! It is satan pushing our buttons and we are n't  responding ! We need to get bold and go against this . When Americans quit buying their products they will soon find out they cant pay their employees . Its all we have to do besides pray to God.very simple .. <p> Jesse , you 're new here but obviously you seem to have missed the point . The point is n't " the spirit of Labor Day " . The point is replacing traditional AMERICAN holidays with religious holidays especially at the behest of NON-Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiates an agreement with a labor union that seems to benefit both the company and the workers in the union , and everyone here is offended because this is against the spirit of Labor Day ? Is that right ? <p> " I just think that if a company makes a decision to accomodate the majority of its union members , who is anyone to object ? " <p> If a company is accomodating a majority who 's goal ( whether theirs personally or those they are affiliated with ) is to take over the world and force their religion on everyone , then everyone who values their freedom and way of life &amp;@# well better object ! <p> Its a tidal wave coming this way that has already changed much of Western Europe . There is absolutely no assimilation of muslims in any other culture . Their culture will be yours . Tyson foods no more . <p> Hi Ty , You are absolutley right . If you do n't  agree with Tyson , certainly exercise your economic vote . I just think that if a company makes a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anyone to object ? Tysons North Carolina plant brings in illegal help for its plant . Which would you rather have ? <p> I am an American . America has its holidays . When you live in America our holidays should become your holidays . I am a Christian and I think everyone has a right to their own religion but I feel we are catering to people who come to this country because of its freedoms . The first thing they do is to try and change our country into what they left behind . Go back to your country , if you can not appreciate ours . <p> I am the person in my family who does the grocery shopping . I can tell you that I have bought my last Tyson product . I would hope that any true American would boycott Tyson products . <p> In many ways , Americans have no one to blame but themselves for the lack of respect for our beloved holidays . Do n't  misunderstand , I love this country , I have two boys in the Military , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute and think , Did you go out and celebrate Cinco De Mayo ? Did you do anything to commemorate Pearl Harbor day or Memorial Day ? It breaks my heart every Veterans day when I see the sparse crowd at our parade , then read about the multitdes that can find the time to go the Thanksgiving Day parade . We as Americans need to get our own priorities straight . <p> I already emailed Tyson myself and i am waiting for a response . I am outraged that they will have their own prayer room at work . Are n't  they supposed to be working . And what do you think would happen if Christians demanded a prayer room . Well i can tell you the liberal unions would not fight for them . Middle America its time to stand up . " If you do n't  stand for something you 'll fall for anything " and we have become a country of fall for anthings ! <p> I have to ask the question , since when we get in the business of telling someone how to run their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Please remember , liberties , freedoms and rights are mostly bound by personal/corporate responsibility . Tyson certainly has the rights and resources to do this , but the other side of that liberty coin is our right to object and their responsibility to accept the outcome . In my case , that means not buying Tyson products any more . It is the very principle of micro economics , or the free-market economy for that matter , people vote with their feet and wallets . Sounding boards like this site , while being a great tool for verbal expression , offers little in the arena of results . If you do n't  agree with company X for whatever reason , do n't  buy their products or services and let them know why . <p> I know this is touchy subject , but the point of this Tyson boycott is NOT to punish Muslims , its to punish a company replacing American values with religious ones . I wont tolerate disrespectful comments towards Muslims , Mormons , Minnonites or any other religion here . I 've already deleted many comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion in an intelligent and respectful manner . If all you can add is " towelhead " , " raghead " , and other such idiocy , I 'd rather you just do n't  comment here . <p> I not only have bought my last Tyson product , but the first thing I will do when I enter a grocery store is go check the meat counter . If the store has one Tyson product , I will leave immediately and inform the management why I am leaving and I will not return . Get those Muslims out of this Christian country and throw their Union out with them . <p> Tyson says bye-bye to Labor Day . What next ? Will the Muslims thru their union want to eliminate Memorial Day , Independence day . Christmas ? ? ? Shame on the employees of Tyson who ratified the union contract . Course many of them were probably fearful that they would be be-headed if they did not vote what the muslims wanted . Anyway , Tyson. none of your products will enter my home . <p> Last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not Federal Holidays and no one gets off for them , unless they schedule themselves a personal day . This is n't a matter of just taking a day off . This is the bastardization of an American tradition . This is a precedent . One which can be pointed to and be used to take over other things down the road . When things get twisted and bent in one place they begin to bend and twist in others , till the original law or intent is no longer recognizable . Tyson products will no longer be a part of my home as Mr Mickelson has been informed . <p> This is getting ridiculous . There are people who claim to fight for religious freedom but do n't  claim to practice it at home . I used to work with a Mulim guy on the night shift . I would answer his phone while he did his prayers and hed sub for me during the holidays . David <p> You are right , I do celebrate St. Patricks Day with my family as a religious holiday . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July with St. Patricks Day . <p> I take PTO on this day . I have a Jewish girl who works for me , I give her her high holiday off and do not charge her PTO . Tysons could have gave everyone at the plant one or two floating holidays instead of eroding the values of this country . <p> Perhaps you should go work in Somali and ask for Christmas off . Maybe they wont sever your head . <p> This is AMERICA you effing dolts . If people from other countries want to live and work here they should learn to embrace AMERICA and our holidays . NOT the customs of the throwback hellhole from which they came . <p> There will be HUGE repercussions from this . <p> Whoever the idiot lib-tard " administrator " that came up with this crap should not only be FIRED IMMEDIATELY but TARRED AND FEATHERED in front of the plant . <p> This is America . We have our American holidays . When you are in American you have your right to practice your religion the same as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change American holidays to suit someone who comes to America . You come to America to enjoy our freedoms do n't  try to change us to suit your own ends . <p> I am the one who purchases the groceries in my family . I can guarantee that I have purchased the last Tyson product . I am making it my business to look at everything purchased . I hope all Americans do the same . <p> Steve , your analogy is either dishonest or uninformed . Those other holidays you mention are not official American holidays and they werent started by people who came here with the intention of taking over our country . Nothing wrong with immigrants celebrating their own holiday . Something is certainly awry with hostile cultures replacing our offical holidays on our soil . This is just the beginning . Are we foolish enough to think this is comparable to Halloween ? At Halloween they only pretend to cut off peoples heads . <p> You are correct , in your essay while I do think its okay if they want to close for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close 8-4-8 . Tyson man up , Labor day is Labor is Labor day , end of story when we try to be pc and close for a Muslim holiday and we cant even say Christmas , we say winter break in this country the last time I checked , This one of the core values is that we came here was for primarily religous freedom , Christianity . Not to turn this into a modern day crusade but its time Americans remember Labor day Mermorial Day , Veterans Day The Fourth of July these are American holidays we founded and need to keep if Tyson foods cant figure it out maybe they ought to pack up for Somilia. and see how the Evil Satan , Amercian business owner is revered my guess not to good . also footnote how did all those Tysons workers making 7500.00 dollars a year contribute 2500.00 a year to Bill Clintons election fund . PBS Nova ran this story over 10 years ago we do n't  seem to remember that fact or do n't  care we care more about peoples shoes " crocs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So its no surprise this crap happens . Thank you for bringing it home . <p> God bless are men and women in combat who protect us and give me the right to write this down . God Bless the U.S.A. <p> In closing what Amercian Holidays are celeberated in Somilia my guess none . <p> I am going to Iraq in January . I first enlisted in 1972 served till 1984 then re-enlisted last year after 23 years as a civilian . I grew up north of Boston in the 60s , not technically Jewishmy mother is not Jewishbut Jewish enough to be beaten by several Catholic boys when they learned I killed Christ at first communion . I love America for so many reasons . My parents escaped Russia in the 1890s and came here instead of eastern Europe . They raised six boys and Grandma lived to 101 . If they had moved to Germany or Poland they would have been ashes . Our country welcomes people like my grandfather who trapped furs to pay his way to America and Somalis who spend the whole day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families . Let the Somalis have their holiday . What the Hell is Labor Day anyway ? Those Somalis covered ripping apart chickens are exactly why I am so proud to serve . <p> I have to ask the question , since when we get in the business of telling someone how to run their business ? This was a union issue and applies only to a specific subset of their employees . NY Times union made them spend $110k on a bus to bring employees from a parking lot to the front door ( two blocks and in a very safe neighborhood ) . Much to the chagrin of the many ride the subway in . Having said that , they may be in violation of a state law ( which agrees to support all Federal holidays ) . NY-David <p> Shelbyville was my birthplace and hometown for 23 years . I was always proud of where I came from . In my eyes , Tyson Foods has tarnished the image of Shelbyville with their actions . I can only hope that the people still living there feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider is helping destroy America from within . <p> And the wet backs can dig their graves and be buried right along side them ! <p> Disrespectful comment deleted CJ are the garbage of the earth and the worst immigrants this country has ever opened the doors for , invited in and allowed to start dragging our culture through the mud ! Rather than adding to America their goal is to destroy her from within and the liberal pathetic bastards spawned today in our country are placing these people in the fast lane to screw us and turn America into a pathetic 3rd world country with no balls of and no future . <p> " immigrants have observed our traditions and tried to become Americans . " <p> Really ? I was n't aware the founding fathers celebrated Halloween , St. Valentines Day or St. Patricks Day . I know of some plants where the employees were overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Catholic so the employees would take off for Orthodox Easter . In the public school district where I lived the Jewish employees were permitted to take off on the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2008 %u2013 Contrary to recent reports , Labor Day is still a holiday at Tyson Foods . This issue concerns only the plant at Shelbyville , TN . The majority of employees at the Tyson plant in Shelbyville , TN , are represented by the Retail , Wholesale and Department Stores Union ( RWDSU ) , an American union that asked for and received Eid al-Fitr , as one of their eight paid holidays , in place of Labor Day . This applies only to the Shelbyville plant and resulted as part of the union contract negotiated last fall . This change does not apply to Tyson Foods other 118 plants . This is not a religious accommodation , rather , it is part of a union-initiated contract demand . <p> This change came about as a result of union demands brought to the negotiating table , and was agreed upon by Tyson in an effort to reach a contractual agreement with the union . The contract that calls for this change was unanimously recommended by the 12-person union bargaining committee , which included three Somali employees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank and file membership of the union at the Shelbyville plant . <p> The Muslim population at the Shelbyville plant is primarily composed of approximately 250 Somali employees , who are political refugees , most of whom came to the plant as a result of refugee resettlement efforts based in Nashville . They were employed at the plant through the Tennessee Department of Employment Security office . <p> The Shelbyville complex employs approximately 1,200 people . Approximately 1,000 workers are covered by the union agreement at Shelbyville . <p> I sent the link to the article to some " people " serving in Iraq . Here is the resonse I just received via email from one of them who has had multiple " vacations " in Iraq : <p> " I think it is way past time that they start looking at the Islam-icaztion of the U.S. I could tell you stories from the job that would make your hair stand on end . The outrage needs to be at home , that is why we are over here is to keep the fight over here . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our time finding them all over the U.S. to kiss their butts so they will be nice . It is time for the people over there to get mad and see what is happening . " <p> As I understand it , this is happening in one specific plant , and was requested by the union when negotiating the new contract . <p> As far as the prayer rooms , my impression is that Muslims are expected to pray several times during the day . I 'm not aware of any other religion with a similar requirement . If there is , I would hope that Tyson would make similar arrangements for them , especially if their numbers at a given location was large enough to make other potential gathering areas inconvenient . <p> Tyson basically favored the 600 ( close to 700 stated in article ) Islamic workers over the 500 non-Islamic ones out of 1,200 workers . Not a real big difference in the numbers of each group . So why take away one groups privilege to give another group their privilege ? <p> The slightly fewer non-Islamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Day holiday , a day which is normally spent with family and friends , are being forced to change from taking their holiday on September 1st , to taking their holiday on Eid al-Fitr . According to the Islamic religious calendar , this happens to fall on October 1st this year about a month after everyone else they know has had their Labor Day holiday . Is that fair ? <p> We are in a nation that has agreed-on official holidays . One of the reasons for this , is so that the type of thing we see happening here does n't  start to happen . Once we start making exceptions for one group , another group wants preferential treatment too . It does n't  take much time for chaos to set in , because everyone wants to have things their own way . <p> Those workers knew about the holiday schedule when they signed-on to work at Tyson Foods . If management wants to accommodate them in the different holiday , that is great . But the other workers do not need to suffer in losing their traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it is great that they are wanting to help Islamic workers be with their families on a holiday that is very important to them . However , I do n't  agree with taking away the Labor Day holiday from those non-Islamic workers who want to be with their families and friends . <p> If they really are wanting to accommodate everyone , why did n't  they work the shifts out so that the non-Islamic workers could take Labor Day , like just about every other American , and the minority group , who happens to have marginally greater numbers at that one plant , could take their holiday ? <p> I propose that they rearrange the shifts on those two holidays to accommodate the separate workers holiday choices . <p> They also created two prayer rooms for the Muslim workers . They may be doing this under the umbrella of the Tyson Core Values . One of the statements is that Tyson Foods strives to be " faith-friendly , " which is great in and of itself . How far is Tyson willing to go to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair and treat all faiths similarly ? <p> To put this in perspective , we are talking about nearly 700 people meeting together in two rooms , 350 per room , to say their prayers . Most churches around these parts run 150 to maybe close to 1,000 , if they are larger . We do have a few really large churches in the area . So we are talking about Tyson Foods building , or setting aside , two large rooms , which are big enough to handle enough people to fill most churches . Sounds like Tyson is building Islamic churches to me . <p> I have n't heard of Tyson Foods creating places of prayer for the high percentage of Christian workers that have been working at various Tyson facilities all these years . What 's up with that ? And are they now planning on creating places of worship for every religion represented at Tyson Foods facilities ? How about at Tyson Corporate in Springdale , Arkansas ? <p> Shouldnt they be fair and accommodating to every religious group represented at Tyson Foods , or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  they building chapels or rooms for the Christians , and for the Jewish worshippers , and Catholics , and Seventh-Day Adventists , and Satanists , and so on ? <p> Also , if Tyson Foods wants to go down the slippery slope of providing rooms for religious activities at their various facilities , that is their business , but it is not a cost-effective use of investors funds to build rooms for every religious group present . <p> So , not to just harp on a problem , I also propose a solution : <p> There should be one multi-purpose , religious room built at each Tyson facility ( including Tyson Corporate ) , which is large enough to handle either half their work force at that facility , or at least large enough to handle the largest religious group present . <p> They should also hire one or more full-time , heavily-armed security officer(s) , who is pro-religion , and who is not biased against any religious preference . To maximize value for their shareholders , and help increase employee efficiency by providing for these religious activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each religious group in their prescribed religious activities . This person should also be highly skilled at event scheduling , facilities management , counseling , metaphysical and spiritual issues , conflict resolution , diplomacy , politics , riot control , hand-to-hand combat , spiritual warfare , detection and deactivation of biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons , and should also be excellent at telling non-offensive , politically-correct ( and religiously-correct ! ) jokes . <p> Just a short comment on the above statement about muslim hollidays replacing AMERICAN hollidays . Well let 's see , is n't obama muslim ? Work in progress . Its not a question of the union suporting the holliday but the fact that they " think " we owe them someting . here 's a news flash- they need to go back where they belong . We have alot of displaced workers that are AMERICAN why brinig them here anyways . Look at all the sea ray plants that laid off in knoxville. over 300 since october last year . why should we give them anything extra . if they want to come here and work here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are set forth by the company at time of employment . that includes holliday schedules . however iv seen where companies would allow the employee to take off on a particular holliday that was not a company paid holliday and all it would affect was their pay . not their attendance . the next thing they would want is ramadan ( however its spelled ) . all i can realy say is if they do n't  like it they can all go back where they came from . <p> I am just one person , but I am outraged by the fact that you have decided to grant " muslim " ( sp ) extremist a day off and there own prayer room . This is the United States Of America , not Iraq . When you come to the US you are susposed to abide by out culture ; and our rules and laws not the other way around . If your employees want there own culture send them back to where they came from . I know this is a matter of money you can probably hire them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there culture . So since this is a matter of money with your company I WILL NOT BUY PRODUCTS THAT TYSON SELLS AND MANUFACTURES . I WILL NOT BUY IN ANY STORE THAT SELL YOUR PRODUCTS . I WILL ENCOURAGE ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO BOYCOTT TYSON AS WELL . This is America ( ( for the time being ) and I am proud to be an American . <p> You really have to ding Tyson on this one . Since they want to appeal to their cheap labor force , they do n't  want to pick up the tab for the extra holiday . This is actually against state law , since its a federal holiday that all 50 states ( or as Obama would say , " 57 states " ) . Many companies make it a floating holiday for logistical reasons , which is probably the case here . If they want to move the day , they should ante up and absorb the cost of the extra day . My kids school mentions Ramadan in the same mannor they do the Christian and Jewish holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That said , if Tyson tries the same thing for Vets day , I will not buy chicken from them . NY-David <p> The Thunder Run has linked to this post in the Web Reconnaissance for 08/04/2008 A short recon of what%u2019s out there that might draw your attention , updated throughout the dayso check back often . <p> I do n't  know if it was an incorrect quote , I 'd say it was Tyson trying to make it sound like the Shelbyville plant had a majority of Somalis at that plant when Tysons has 700 Somali employees at all their plants . My story was from the local Shelbyville paper vs Nashvilles channel 2 . <p> We open our country to all walks of life to offer up a better quality of living , if people do not respect Americas holidays then I suggest they go back to their point of origin . Tell them to take Tyson leadership and union traitors with them . No more Tyson food for this family . <p> Another reason that keeps me from buying anything marked " Tyson . " Prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **30;1010;TOOLONG outfit . <p> Somalis in our midst , the result of the ill-fated , botched Clintonian Somali venture , are demanding more and more American knuckling-under to their ideology ( Islam ) . <p> Whether its Somali cab-drivers demanding footbaths at airports , these same ingrates refusing to carry passengers packing alcoholic beverages , or the demand for prayer-time-off at Dell computers and special rooms for these everywhere they work , Somalis ( as as well as all followers of Islam ) are an unwelcome addition to our population . <p> As has been said ad nauseam , until Moslems silently invaded this country , immigrants have observed our traditions and tried to become Americans . Moslems are always Moslems first , and in their mindset will become Americans only when our Constitution is replaced by their shariawhich can happen only after massive bloodshed . <p> If the Tree of Liberty has to be watered by blood to keep it strong , let it be the blood of those who would deprive us of our freedoms intead of that of patriots . <p> I agree with you whole heartedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of the Koran and have read it and use it for reference . I actually worked for the Saudis many years ago training their customs officials here in the US . They gave me the English version of the Koran . I was a bit amazed the first time I read it . Sure did bring a different light to what I had " thought " Islam was all about . <p> So I 'm on the same page with you about this not being so much an issue about Islam and Muslims wanting to celebrate their holidays so much as it is about this being AMERICA and us having our own established traditions and holidays . And I have to say I wondered about how they could make Eid al Fitr a " static " holiday when it moves each year . <p> As for the idea that they might consider " replacing " Veterans Day , Memorial Day or 4th of July with a muslim holiday oh heck no !

In order for our customer relations team to better serve our customers , each and every one tried on all the boots we carry in our warehouse . It was such a huge undertaking that we reserved an entire Friday evening to get the job done . <p> The end result ? <p> A better informed team ready to answer any question that comes their way. - A special thank you goes out to FoxRiver for supplying socks for our boot try-on party . We are happy to report that the party was a blister-free zone . <p> Keen <p> While someone wearing leggings felt like she had duck feet , everybody else loved the Keens .

" A former city girl who worked on Wall Street , this classically-trained chef now spends her days out in the field hunting wild game and concocting new recipes . In her latest book , she travels across America and overseas in search of everything from quail to boar to javelina , and along the way learns new life lessons and the joys of self-sufficiency " plus she shares some mouthwatering wild game recipes . We sat down with Georgia to learn more about her cooking , her views on food and how she shares her love of the outdoors with others . <p> How did you come to embrace foraging and hunting ? I grew up in the same land that my great-grandfather lived on in the Hudson Valley in New York . I used to forage and garden a lot , and we had chickens . There was a very holistic view on food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll up our sleeves and get involved in nature and food and where it comes from . I grew up living that lifestyle . <p> The hunting did n't actually happen until I became a chef , and I was working at various farm-to-table restaurants . One of the restaurants I worked at was very hands on and part of that was killing the turkey for the kitchen . That was my watershed moment where I realized I wanted to participate in that part of the process as well . <p> Why do you think it 's important to think about the food we eat ? I think the idea is just to pay attention to what your body needs at any given moment in time . That 's the thing about food " people approach it a lot differently than we used to . It used to be that humans ate a great variety of fruit , seeds , nuts and protein . There was a lot of diversity in our diet once upon a time . Now there 's not much diversity at all . It 's mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grain . That 's the source for a lot of our health problems . <p> Do you feel like there 's been a recent movement toward a more natural approach to food ? There 's definitely been a movement of organic over processed . I also think it 's taken a bigger step than that . People are looking to experience things more viscerally now , the way our grandmothers did . They 're really participating in some way , whether it 's weeding , digging , hunting or gardening . It 's that idea of being more involved in life and being more in touch with things the way our ancestors were . <p> Why only hunt for the food you eat ? It 's about knowing your source . There 's a growing movement to get more involved in that way , to know your source and where things are coming from and to know the animal did n't have a horrible life or a horrible diet before coming to your plate . There are even farms now that will let you come and partake in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paying the full price of the meal . <p> What 's the most unusual animal you 've killed and cooked ? I would say probably squirrel or javelina . That 's definitely something you ca n't get in the grocery store , so they 're probably the most exotic types . Though javelina is common in Arizona and West Texas , it 's not where I grew up . Squirrels , which most people think of as tree rats , are actually delicious . <p> What 's been great for me as a chef is that I 've been given the opportunity to try new flavors that are not available in the grocery store . It 's sort of a culinary adventure that we do n't get to have anymore because our diets have become so narrowed down to very specific meats and flavors . Wild animals are wild " they eat whatever they want . So each squirrel will taste different , whereas in the grocery store , each chicken will taste the same because they 've had the same diet . It 's been a fun adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game recipes as you create them ? Pretty much everyone who 's been willing " family and friends . The book is part of my journey to different states and to England , and it talks about different cultures and parts of society that approach food differently . When I 'm on the road in various places , I 'll often cook for the people I 've been hunting with . They get to try and experience a meat that they 've been hunting their whole lives in a new way . <p> What your favorite wild animal recipe ? I do n't know that I have a favorite ! It really varies . I love cooking a whole hog with my friends in the South . They do it really well down there . I have a great recipe for cooking a hog in a smoker barrel , which entails draping strips of bacon and pouring on jars of molasses and cut apples , and it captures the fat and the sweet . It smokes for over twelve hours and is pretty delicious ! <p> If someone was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest starting with ? I have a lot of wild game recipes in my book . A good entry point is venison tenderloin . Venison is a pretty accessible meat for people to try as a starting point . <p> Any meat you would n't eat ? I do n't think so . As long as it 's sustainable and done in a humane way , I 'm happy to try everything . <p> What 's Girl Hunter Weekend and how did that get started ? It started out as a way for me to introduce people to the outdoors . A lot of people had never tried it before , and I wanted to introduce them to it . I got so many requests for more that I 'm actually planning another one this coming September in Montana . It 's going to be fly fishing , hunting , horseback riding , taking an ATV ride up in the mountains where you can see wildlife , and tons of food and log cabins . It 's instructive " some of the guests have hunted , some of them have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about the fun of enjoying the outdoors together . It 's a fun way to bond with other people . <p> And since were HuntingBoots.com , we have to ask ! Favorite hunting boots ? For me , it 's all about protection from the elements .

AR-15 " <p> I can settle this argument simply by Quoting The Bard of Avon " The proof of the pudding after all is in the Eating " allow me to explain the Russians developed the AK47 with its ammo 7.62+39 in 1947 and this was they 're standard issue until 1974 when they changed to the AK74 which is also a round they developed 5.45x 39 . Now I will make my point this ak74 has been the standard issue since 1974 if you will notice it is a round that is smaller then the American standard of 5.56+45 M16 round care to know the reason OK I wll tell you , The Vietnam war was a proxy war between Russia and America as such there were Russian soldiers in Vietnam and some were wounded some Killed and the Russian government realized the immense wound damage that the 5.56 was inflicting and how efficiently the round killed and how bad the wound damage was that they understood why the the Vietnameese Communist called this the poison bullett . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they found to be much more effecient then the 7.62 for so many ballistic reason they ca n't be explored here.One last comment I have foreever seen the test that pit an AK47 vs AR15 they are shooting cement blocks these test are completley BOGUS MAN how many Cement Blocks have ever participated in an Ambush or Comabat Answer NONE . <p> This argument will always come down to preference for most diehard weapons guys , however they both offer an operator great advantages depending on what your targets and missions are . Most AK lovers will always site the fact that the AR does not like dirt . This is true . They also will quickly bring to light that the Ak does not care about how dirty it gets while still capable of shooting . This is also true . If you have to take a side in this battle , and most folks think they do , I will have to go with the AR . The AR is more of a surgical weapon its more refined then the AK simply put it has better manners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not get me wrong as I stated earlier the AK has venues where it is a better weapon but in the long run you have to go with the AR . Do n't  mistake the fact that because its cheaper to make , and buy and that most of the 3rd world countries in the world can get it ( which is why its so " popular " ) that this makes it a better weapon . Accuracy will always beat out the spray and pray . Either way a highly trained marksman with either of these weapons is going to be a problem for anyone . By the way I 'm Steve a former U.S. Army combat operator and veteran of desert shield , and desert storm . I am a federal agent with one of our countries largest agencies and I bring 20 plus years of law enforcement experience to this conversation . I hope this helped and did not further confuse anyone .

The 5.56/.223 is a smaller bullet compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 5.56 may not have the knock down power or penetration of the 7.62 but the smaller bullet will fragment and tumble once it hits a target causing better internal damage , where the 7.62 round may just go in one side and out the other not producing as much damage internally . Their is a reason our military and our allies use the 5.56 round . The AK vs . AR is a battle that will never be decided . I do not believe one rifle is superior to the other . Both have strengths and weaknesses . <p> I had a bushnell 223/556 AR-15 and also a longer barrel AK-47 762.39mm . I figured I did not need both weapons so I decided to keep the Ak because of its larger caliber and farther travel distance . In my opinion the Ak-47 is not 30% less accurate than the AR-15 for I firmly believe if you are a decent shot , you can lay the rounds of the Ak-47 anywhere you wish !

Its amazing how he just somehow comes up short in the reality department every . dang . time . I swear , youd think God or Allah or Yaweh or the Flying Spaghetti Monster had a serious hard-on for Yon or something by the way he fucks up and steps in it constantly . Or maybe Yon has an ulterior motive and purposefully disseminates incorrect information . Nah , it couldnt be the second option , I mean , that would be UNETHICAL or something . Why am I taking up the banner against Yon , yet again ? Well , see , back in April , I predicted Yon would go after the B5 crew .

Weirdly enough , I have a copy also . But not the same copy . Not even close . <p> Which makes one wonderis it some grand conspiracy against Yon , that I ask for proof and he ends up putting out such jacked up stuff ? That 's neither here nor there , but Im amazed how first , the Facebook Elves messed around with his timeline and hid some stuff that may make Yon look bad , you know , like publishing CJs unit publicly or whatever , and now this weirdness . <p> So let 's take a look , shall we ? See , I have a different version of that document , and it makes WAY more sense than Yons . <p> The version I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch of service , dates of service , whether he was active or not , the whole shebang . Also , as Yon points out , in his version , Matt is just a captain when he s done and in mine , he s a major . Hrrrmmmm . <p> Maybe more information will help . Yon posts his version of current and previous assignments . I 've highlighted a few areas you might want to look at . <p> I got ta tell ya , that very top box troubles me greatly . Why ? Because , on the Yons DD214 version of first date in service , Jan 1986 , Matt Burden was an E-5 in that red box . For a top notch journalist , one who prides himself on being out front , researching and pontificating on deeply hidden meanings in all things military , I have to wonder why Yon did not question this . Why did n't  Yon ask the National Archives if the records are incomplete . Or did Yon think Matts military birthing was like Venus from the cut off member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sea-foam ? <p> Botticellis The Birth of Venus <p> But Matt Burden , unlike sweet Venus , Matt the stud that he is , he spilled from the throbbing parts of Mars , the god of war , and even arrived bearing Lucille , ready to wreak havoc upon the world , and he was already a SGT so he did n't  have to screw around with silly stuff with which PVTs are tasked ! ! <p> The birth of The Paratrooper of Love <p> Oh , and if you 're wondering why I call him the Paratrooper of Love ? Well , you know , he went to jump school and he also jumped with the Brits ! ! <p> I cant even do elevators so I do n't  understand how people can do schools like Airborne , Jumpmaster , and Freefall ! <p> What is that SFQC ?

Apparently CJ and Uncle Jimbo and Matt Burden are all pretty dang gay cuz they mention penises a lot . <p> So this war correspondent , Michael Yon , a former soldier himself , he does n't  think to dig into exactly what happened in the time up until this DD214 shows Burden in the military ? He does n't  question the holes ? Or maybe he does but he sucks so badly and has so few skills , he ca n't even track down the correct information , which is readily available by FOIA , exceptwell <p> Annnnnnyway , I cant get over how Yons version does n't  match mine . <p> The version of assignments that I have <p> Amazingly , mine takes into account that whole silly basic training things that most soldiers have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this post is that Michael Yon has YET AGAIN put out faulty information without checking its validity . He gets a bug up his ass about certain people and he will use whatever he can get his hands on , even obviously incomplete records , to " support " his point of view and he will put it out there as if he s The King of Insider Information . He s the all-knowing , all-seeing guru of military matters . I would feel sorry for his followers but there are damn few of them who bother to question his words , motives , and actions , so they get and accept whatever bullshit he throws out there and unfortunately , they also have the right to vote , which scares the ever-lovin heck out of me . <p> Hopefully , this post will get into some of their hands and they might question his posting of clearly fragmentary documentation . If even one person who is an ardent Yon fan chooses to walk away from that man , I 'll be a happy camper . He is venomous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butt . HARD . And I hope I 'm around to see his final fall into the disrepute that he deserves . <p> Oh , and I hope you enjoyed all the " male reproductive appendages " references . I certainly enjoyed making them . <p> CB , yes , thank you . I was being silly &amp; sarcastic because Yon is questioning Matt Burdens claim that he was with special forces . His version of the documents do not show SFQC , but mine do . Its bewildering how his docs &amp; the ones I have are so different , especially since Yon hates Burden so much and his set magically supports his accusations that he has been ranting about for a couple of years . = <p> I guess the National Archives are in collusion with the Milkooks or something , to give Yon such easily countered incorrect information . Or something like that . *shrug*

@@96509853 @709853/ <p> In an effort to clarify the WWP position , Professional Outdoor Media Association reached out to the organization for comment . After multiple request by phone and email , they finally responded to POMA . In typical fashion of organization caught red-handed with policies they obviously did n't  want exposed , WWP attempted to convince the public that is was all just a huge misunderstanding . <p> Thanks so much for reaching out to Wounded Warrior Project- ( WWP ) and for providing an opportunity to clarify matters . Let me start off by saying that we have seen through this process that the language on our website and our response to Mr. Gresham was n't clear and we are working on clarifying our approach . There is now much inaccurate information about WWP being anti-gun rights , an issue as an apolitical organization we do not take a stance on . We understand and appreciate that many of our Alumni are gun owners and we facilitate multiple hunting and outdoor opportunities for our Wounded Warriors throughout the year . <p> The response goes on to note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on guns , knives , etc . WWP representative Ayla Hay claims that " were not going to offer our logo to appear on weapons anymore whether they 're guns , knives , bows , swords , or any other type of weapon " and that " this is purely a business decision based on a review of a return on investment , especially when compared with other types of cobranding ventures . " <p> That 's interesting . Let 's go back to what WWP said to Gun Talk Radio in refusing to come on their show . <p> WWP does not co-brand , create cause marketing campaigns or receive a percentage or a portion of proceeds from companies in which the product or message is sexual , political or religious in nature , or from alcohol or weapon companies . <p> Notice in that response that they merely quote a disclaimer verbatim from their site . The invitation to come on the show clearly had nothing to do with co-branding , but to highlight a supposedly-great organization that supports veterans during , um , Veterans Day ! ! <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget what they originally told Tom Gresham as a reason for denying the interview request . <p> Regarding the question of donations and events , we do permit fundraisers that are shooting- and gun-related , such as gun raffles , shooting competitions , etc. , and were incredibly appreciative of those who are willing to give their time to host or participate in an event . Likewise , we gratefully accept donations from companies and individuals connected with the gun industry . <p> However , this directly contradicts their policy of receiving " a percentage or a portion of proceeds from companies in which the productfrom alcohol or weapon companies . " I mean , its pretty clear here what Wounded Warrior Project is saying . So , does WWP accept donations from " individuals connected with the gun industry " or not ? <p> here 's my analysis of the situation : the administrators of WWP that rely on the 55% of all donations that go to them instead of the wounded warriors they are purposed to support are afraid of losing that money . Not because it will affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of donations go to them but because they need to protect all those six-figure salaries . There has been an overwhelming backlash from donors that are upset with their position and their status is threatened . I think it should have been threatened nearly six years ago when they decided to start suing smaller organizations dedicated to also serving wounded warriors . Those actions alone told me everything I need to know about Wounded Warrior Project . <p> So , now WWP wants to go on Gun Talk Radio , but not to talk about their policies . " I hope the above provides some clarity , " said Hay . " We welcome the opportunity to have a warrior on Mr. Gresham 's show to discuss how hunting or events of the like have supported their recovery . We responded too quickly to his request and should have delved a bit deeper . " <p> The problem now is that this is no longer about how WWP does or does n't  support wounded warriors ( and I argue they do n't  more than they do ) . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearms . And Tom Gresham is n't biting either . <p> This afternoon I issued a new invitation to WWP , though an email to Leslie Coleman , to be on my radio show to clarify your position on firearms . I note in your email your interest in being on the show . While it would have been appropriate last week to have a warrior on the show to talk about his or her activities with the WWP , at this point , the story is about your policy . <p> I would welcome any spokesperson from WWP on the show to talk specifically about the policy about firearms . I certainly will give you the floor to clarify your position . There are many questions , as you know . Nothing in my email exchange with Ms. Coleman was about cobranding . It was clear that the WWP would not appear on my radio show because we talk about firearms . That certainly is your prerogative . There is , however , much confusion with those who have donated to the Wounded Warrior Project ( individuals and corporate donors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear at events or talk to media when its about firearms , but WWP is okay with taking those donations . <p> Keep up with this interesting saga on the Gun Talk Radio Facebook page where updates are shared as they arise . I whole-heartedly support GTR here . <p> I am a member of the National Rifle Association board of directors . I have been made aware of the WWPs policy of not associating with firearms companies , or the firearms industry . <p> I find this policy absurd . I want to inform you that as a member of the NRA board it is my intention to introduce a motion at our January board meeting to assure that the NRA does not promote , support , or in any other manner support the WWP . I will also request that the NRAs 4 million members and their families are made aware of your anti-gun position . <p> Thank you for your time . Todd Rathner <p> Keep in mind , this is n't the official position of the NRA , just Todds opinion right now . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . <p> If you were once a supporter of Wounded Warrior Project and have decided they will no longer receive another cent from you , may I recommend two organizations that are worthy of that money instead ? The Semper Fi Fund has created a second organization called Americas Fund and at the moment , they are focusing on family assistance grants so that family members can be at their servicemembers bedside and not worry about a mortgage , lost pay , childcare , etc . Americas Fund is for all branches of the military whereas when Semper Fi fund was started to support wounded/injured and i 'll Marines , Corpsmen or any servicemember from any branch attached to a/ or in support of a Marine unit . Both are worthy recipients of money you would like to earmark towards helping wounded veterans and their families . <p> If you really want to stick it to WWP for their oppressive actions , may I recommend donating to Wounded Warriors Family Support ? This is the organization that was started by Retired Marine Corps Reserve Colonel John Folsom as Wounded Warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name . Both Wounded Warriors and Wounded Warrior Project were started at about the same time . However , WWP had aspirations to be a big organization and quickly went after big corporate sponsors . Wounded Warriors was more of a grass roots organization at the time . Eventually , John felt compelled to change the name of his organization to Wounded Warriors Family Support . This great organization provides support to the families of those who have been wounded , injured or killed during combat operations . The families of our casualties suffer in many ways : some financially , some psychologically . <p> Photo credits : An injured soldier receives help to change his shoes for the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride , New York , July 23 . The bicycle ride through Manhattan is part of the organizations goal to raise awareness for those who have been injured while fighting overseas . Photo by Sgt. Randall Clinton . <h> 23 Comments on " Wounded Warrior Project Backpedaling on Gun Stance " <p> The fact of the matter is charitable giving is systemically broken . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run it . The talent that it takes to run something this big needs a big salary . That is why my friends and I put together a grassroots organization called The Fanatical Change Foundation and what we are changing is the way charities work . I have a job and so does everyone involved with our group . Therefore Fanatical Change offers no salaries , benefits or even fringe benefits other than I get to be the guy that does Fanatical Change . We have raised and distributed over $500,000 to families in need . This is what a charity should be . Small , grassroots simple . We throw a huge party , when donors come to the event they see who the money is going to go to from a write up on the families that have just been identified and then the next day all of the money is distributed and within a couple of days video of that delivery is posted on our website . Every city should have a chapter . If you are going to get together with your friends for happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge event and help some people ? That is what we did . The funny part is the name Fanatical Change was supposed to be about changing the way charities work but what happened instead was it changed us . There is nothing else on this earth that can equal the feeling that comes from bringing a smiled to a woman who has just buried her first born son by letting her know that his funeral , a funeral she did not know how it would be paid for , is now a burden she no longer has to bare . <p> I have always been a supporter of our Vets and Wounded Warriors . They have sacrificed so very much for our freedom . I have provided complimentary hunts to assist them with filling their freezers with meat . I was contacted by the WWP to provide additional hunts , but was told they could not support the use of weapons . I was shocked . They trained our troops in the use of weapons , sent them into a war zone where they were injured , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the warriors , but they do not support weapons of any kind . I do not approve of talking out of both sides of your mouth . Logically , they know the warrior must use a weapon to conduct the hunt . This organization is funded by the public that truly wants our warriors to receive all they so justly deserve , but the public needs to know the truth . I will always continue to assist our Wounded Warriors and Vets , but I will no longer support the WWP . <p> One of the most painful parts of this discussion on the WWP is their rejection of our Second Amendment Rights . Most of us have come to expect some " skimming " from many organizations , but not honoring an oath is akin to leaving a buddy on the battlefield . When people take donations under the guise of doing good things for veterans , and then wont stand for rights those men and women died for , and were maimed for , they show their true character , or lack thereof . They should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with twenty of those years in uniform . It always disturbed me that , with reenlistments , or change in jobs , I had to swear again the same oath , a portion being ; " I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; " You see , the " Oath , once taken , is a lifelong obligation and it has no expiration date . It only expires when one gives his or her life for this country , and while honoring that oath . My initial oath of enlistment has served me well lifelong . Those of of us whove taken the oath stand ready to honor it every day of our lives . Increasingly now , our enemies are domestic . Never forget ! <p> The most important consideration in deciding whether or not to donate to a given organization should be a review of their philosophies . As far as Im concerned , the WWP is on the same level as the dirtbag who left a buddy on the battlefield . Anyone leading the WWP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic dishonorable discharge papers . What could a man not possibly understand about a duty to preserve the Bill of Rights ? <p> Here in Alaska , we have a very low tolerance for " PC bullshit " like this latest shot from WWP . I am a veteran , a long time NRA member , and until now a contributor to WWP . Good luck to them when this becomes widely known . <p> I am very sad to see such a fine organization stand on the backs of the wounded to make a great program a politcal one , shame on you . I was wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan , when I woke up in Afghanistan the clothes shaving kit they gave me were WWP , i was very proud of all the WWP items and still have them . I believe fully that WWP is being run properly and the staff is getting what they deserve so why turn it into a Anti gun organization ? <p> Why ? Because of the money that goes into the pockets of the people that are running this organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has benefited from the VA.and all they have to offer wounded Vets . I would suggest that anyone.ANYONE , who takes money OUT OF the donations of citizens to pay extreme salaries to their board members , is NOT interested wholly in the success of the returning Veterans . A Proud Vietnam Vet ! <p> As a former soldier and officer of the Army Infantry I find it disturbing that we are sending our soldiers off to fight wars for corporate profit and greed and then call them warriors when they come home maimed or dead.We then complain when some greedy tax exempt corporation makes a profit off of them.I guess when you 're fighting wars of conquest for the bankers you are called a warrior like the Roman soldiers were called.It makes me sick and there 's no way I would donate a dime to this outfit.Welcome to the new unholy Roman Empire . <p> Since you are opposed to the Wounded Warrior project , as am I , due to their hypocritical stance concerning their relationship with gun manufactuers , and , by extension , gun ownerswho support these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your part to accept advertising money from the Wounded Warrior Project ! <p> As a 15 yr US ARMY MEDIC , Wounded Warrior , VA Healthcare Employee , WWP Alum. , recipient of their Programs and Services , donator , and organizer of a fundraising event . I will agree that the WWP could better focus on the veterans they serve by continuing to remain neutral , and not cater to the calls to become a " principled " charity . If the public wish to honestly donate to help combat wounded , they could not find a better organization that has developed working programs and life-changing services that go unmatched . The breadth of their reach is enormous , take presence in Landstuhl for example . If we could relax with all this BS about defining a stance on gun rights , religious affiliation , an other inconsequential matters hyped by articles and media , only looking to stir the pot , and return our focus to the real issues , do what they offer work ? Ask a Wounded Warrior . <p> A warrior is just thankful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through transition , I was thankful for the support I found in the WWP , I did not care whether the Org. was Pro-Gun , Pro-Same Sex Marriage , Anti-abortion , Anti-cute lil puppies , in fact , I cant remember a time any fellow warrior taking time away from their personal struggle , to ponder such matters . I was happy to feel the support , and know that my fellow battle buddies were offered the same outstanding opportunities . To try to goad the WWP on a radio program , or through an article , is in reality , a disservice to the very warriors you claim you think they should focus on . Cmon man , you know full and well , the radio show would try to get them to define their policy , which truly is of no consequence they are not that naive , and neither are we . Shame on you CJ , tsktsk . <p> There is no shame I stand in need of owning . The WWP numbers speak for themselves . The fact that over $.40 of every dollar goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do they help wounded warriors ? Absolutely ? Could they do more ? Absolutely ! <p> Did you know that the organization you are supporting charged anyone that wants to raise money on their behalf a $100 fundraising fee ? ! They have at least ten officers making over $126,000 . The Executive Director makes over $300,000 . This is money that people are sending to the organization to help Wounded Warriors and its going into the greedy palms of board members . They spent over a million dollars just in lobbying . <p> When you remove the income claimed by WWP as donations-in-kind , their percentage of money going towards program plummets from 86% to less than 50% . <p> WWP has made it clear they were anti-gun and they 've made it clear they do n't  want religious donations either . Just because you 're one of the few people that WWP has touched in a positive way does n't  make WWP a positive organization . They have other self-interests they are trying to protect . <p> I have been reading all the comments here I published an poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme salariesand give very little to the vets my suggestion is if you want to give to support veterans do so in your home town and state organizations like the VFW , American Legion , and many like them exist near you and are strictly volunteer and pay no salaries all the money goes to the veterans Check them out they all need help to carry out their ongoing programs . thanks for reading <p> First Disabled Veterans and now WWP ! This is outrageous . I want to help our returning vets , esp . those who have been severely wounded , and their families . It seems that there are no truly honest organizations that rasise funds and used those fund primarily to help our veterans . As far as being PC , my feeling is that they should be neutral on politics and focus on their MAIN objective of helping our wounded miltary families . <p> Look into Bill OReillys charity that he promotes on his show on FOX News .. they do great work , giving these " track type " wheel chairs to wounded Vets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these terribly wounded Veterans get back out in public , even in the woods with these chairs . Do a little research and see what you think . A Proud Vietnam Vet . <p> I have a real problem with their response . If you 're not willing to stand with us , then why should we give you our money ? In lieu of being a principled charity ( one that stands for certain values , i.e. pro-Constitution ) , WWP is a politically correct charity " one that makes every effort to be as non-controversial as possible . I 've found other charities to give to so the WWP is off my list until they show some principles , character , courage , etc . As of now they are just another PC charity shilling for $$$ . <p> Ive been an engaged alumni with WWP for many years now after being injured in Iraq and can tell you personally the many healing moments I 've both seen in person over the years of other warriors as well as myself . I will continue to stay engaged with WWP no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better since being involved with them . Theyve done a lot in legislative areas as well as various other programs and those of us that have benefited from it will be forever grateful . Theyve doubled the amount of alumni in less than a year and serve over 24,000 wounded warriors now . That is not a small crowd . <p> There is no doubt that there are wounded troops that are served by WWP . No one has said here or anywhere else that WWP does NOT take care of them . There will always be stories of troops that have been well served by the organization . However , I stand by my criticisms of the organization that I think can do a lot better if they focus on their mission . Thank you for your service and sharing your story . <p> It is time to have the CEO of WWP lookng for a job that does not prey on those that have given so much to protect our country . I remember so well how WWP had no funding to get the project started ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In considering adding a monthly contribution to WWP. $19.00 times 43% = $8.17 to veterans $19.00 times 55% = $10.45 to WWP administation maybe 2% or $0.38 to fundraising costs ? If these numbers are close to accurate , maybe I should cancel my current contribution and find a better organization to do what WWP claims to do . <p> All of the WWP Properties in Texas are legally posted 30.06 ( No carry of firearms by Licensed Holders ) . I suspect all their Properties Nationwide are posted with similar signs . <p> They are a lying , two faced organization that although they do some good for our Veterans , they roll in the dough themselves ( $320,000.00 yr for CEO ) and do not support or agree with the 2nd amendment rights of individuals .

CJ is busy being active with his new non-profit , Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . <p> Also an OIF and OEF veteran , Sgt type . Would have been glad to have you for a boss .

Keep us posted . <p> CJI am sure you are aware and youfr attorney is alsobut after this is overhave this " arrest " removed from your record.never happend .. you will have a clean record . I was falsely charged when a person criminally tresspassed into my house ( ex girl friend ) and tried to remove my property.then smashed my property . I called 911 and I was arrested because she said I had hit her ( lie ) and she made marks io n her neck and said I did it . The case was nol prossed by the stateI should have never been charged , I broke no laws but it cost me 5 K that I did not have at the time and I did get the arrest record removed . Alsogood answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done is called Record Expunging . Which I 'm sure CJ will probably request . <p> Oh and I hope your Ex-girl friend was charged with False reporting to law enforcement . I do n't  know were you are from but were I live(Arizona) that carries a maximum 6 Month Imprisonment term and $2500 fine . If she was n't charged and processed , file a complaint with your District Attorneys Office . They love that kind of stuff . <p> I strongly suggest that MSGT Grisham and his attorneys do an open records request and see how may complaints of misconduct have been filed against the police department in question . I STRONGLY suggest they do this and i can almost gurantee they will be pleasantly surprised . Especiallly in the past couple of months ! ! <p> Good luck in your upcoming trial .

Thank you for your service to our country and once again good luck from Mississippi . <p> Why do n't  we have a look at what he did(CJ) . He broke the law as soon as the officer said something to him . By CHL law we are required to identify that we have a CHL license and carrying a concealed handgun , why is that not stated by everybody talking about the law . <p> The officer has the right to secure the area when asking question , I have family that are police officers I would like the to come home at night , not get shot because of a man standing with a AR that is in position to fire in a moment that 's why its slung in the front . I live in the area he was walking for the past 18 years and Ive seen 2 coyotes in that time , but you have a right to carry out here , but think how you would feel with a man you do n't  know with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also asking question that the man felt you did n't  have the right to ask . He was within city limits and other people have a right to feel safe in their home also . <p> I 'm for the 2rd Amendment and leave my guns alone ! But others have rights , this could of gone completely different if all concern would of taken a moment to see it from the other side instead just thinking of me like most do these days . OH ! I 'm a veteran also I twenty-two years in the army from 72-95 , that does n't  give you no right to act like your above the law or your better than anybody else . We did our job for the people of this country so they could feel safe here and go about their lives without fear . <p> He broke the law as soon as the officer said something to him . By CHL law we are required to identify that we have a CHL license and carrying a concealed handgun , why is that not stated by everybody talking about the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the duty to inform . According to Government Code -411.205 , " If a license holder is carrying a handgun on or about the license holders person when a magistrate or a peace officer demands that the license holder display identification , the license holder shall display both the license holders drivers license or identification certificate issued by the department and the license holders handgun license . " Let me put this into 2nd grade language I think you 'll understand . If an officer does n't  legally ask me to identify myself , I have no legal obligation to display my CHL . <p> The officer has the right to secure the area when asking question , I have family that are police officers I would like the to come home at night , not get shot because of a man standing with a AR that is in position to fire in a moment that 's why it 's slung in the front . <p> Wrong again . There are numerous Supreme Court precendents that protect an individual from illegal search and SEIZURE . In Brown v. Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification unless the individual is suspected of committing a crime . In Terry v. Ohio , SCOTUS noted that officers can not search individuals unless there was probably cause that a crime was committed , is being committed , or is about to be committed . Delaware v. Prousse also requires suspicion by the detaining officer that a crime is , was or will be committed before detaining an individual . The FACT is that less than .001% of officers are killed in the line of duty by guns , so your fears are largely unsubstantiated . <p> I live in the area he was walking for the past 18 years and I 've seen 2 coyotes in that time , but you have a right to carry out here , but think how you would feel with a man you do n't know with an AR and you did n't he had a concealed handgun also asking question that the man felt you did n't have the right to ask . He was within city limits and other people have a right to feel safe in their home also @ @ liberty nor safety . " The fact that someone does " feel safe " because a person is committing lawful acts and exercising his rights to carry a firearm is no concern of anyone else . The problem does n't  lie with the individual carrying a gun , but with the individual who has an irrational fear of the mere site of a gun . As for the coyotes , you obviously do n't  live where I live . We have coyotes on our property every . single . night . I think we 've successfully killed most of them . I did n't  carry a rifle because I was afraid of being attacked by anything . If I was afraid of being attacked , I would have only needed my pistol . However , because we were hiking through and along pastures that are largely owned by my family , if I had the opportunity to shoot a feral hog or coyote at distance , I would have loved the opportunity . I also carried because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm for the 2rd Amendment and leave my guns alone ! But others have rights , this could of gone completely different if all concern would of taken a moment to see it from the other side instead just thinking of me like most do these days . <p> When you say you are for the 2A and then say BUT , you lose your credibility . I did not infringe upon anyones rights when I exercised mine . As a matter of fact , our rights cease to be legitimate when they infringe upon another individuals rights . For example , I have the right to yell " FIRE " anywhere I want . But , if I 'm in a crowded building or movie theater , doing so would infringe upon anothers rights to safety and free enterprise . That is why I can yell fire at home , but not in a movie theater . <p> I completely agree that this could have gone differently had the officer respected my right to free travel and keep and bear arms . When he attempted to steal my weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he infringed on my rights and I responded as anyone should . <p> OH ! I 'm a veteran also I twenty-two years in the army from 72-95 , that does n't give you no right to act like your above the law or your better than anybody else . We did our job for the people of this country so they could feel safe here and go about their lives without fear . <p> Congratulations and thank you for your service . The only person acting like they were above the law was the officer on the scene . Then , his supervisor when he showed up . I will , however , deign to admit that I am a better person because I knew my rights and the laws better than the officers . I also have more integrity and honor than those officers . If Americans are fearful at the mere SIGHT of a weapon , this country is more lost than I thought and your service and mine has been in vain . <p> I like the way you use your brain and not give in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a free country . We no longer have rights . We the people gave them up . We gave them up to let other tell us how to live . We give them up because we fell safer with goverment telling us what is right and wrong . We have be come what we where told would happen by past leadders . We got to much in to home life and not in to standing up for what we all really want . We have had smoke screen after smoke screen . <p> We need to understand one thing knowledge is power . We have got lost from the path . We need to get back on befor it is to late . We need thinkers not people just to follow . We now look like trains . We follow we lisson we do . We fo not thing for ones self any more . Open your eyes we are sheep and the wolfs are winning . <p> Look around everyone running there own race but not winning because you can when you fo not understand the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if you just stop this way of thinking . The rich do not run a race they have us to do it they just act like a leach . We the people . Hu .

If he needs donations for a defense fund please publicize that fact and how to get $$ to him . Thank you . Retired SFC <p> The prosecutor should resign . He has already breached the peace of the community . He has already proven he is a public menace . He should be allowed to peacebly remove his belongings , that of his familys belongings within 24 hours and be dumped at the county line . The prosecutor is a criminal and public menace . The city has no right to complain . They did n't  fire the man , the phones should never stop ringing until the prosecutor gets a job at McDonalds in another jurisdiction , sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the problem with hiring pettifoggers , shysters and vermin . Lawyers begging their clients to knuckle under because of the threats coming from the city is a serious " defense " mistake . Lawyers are the scum of the earth , and should be required to go to re-education camps . We need to abolish law licenses and their holders . The reason this case exists is because LAWYERS are out of control . Lawyers are banned from seeing the Kingdom of Heaven . The gates of heaven they shall never see . What ignorant man told the cop and encouraged the cop to act like a thug ? Lawyer . What rebellious man goad cops into violence ? Lawyers . What criminal syndicate drums up false charges to bring business to their syndicate ? Lawyers . What criminal mob does the defense attorney work for ? It ai n't  Mr. BoyScout . The licenced confidence man works for the criminal syndicate ; Bar Association . He serves the " law " ( romanism ; civil law ) , he does not defend Gods right order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town , or , after given a trial , found guilty of being a public menace and horse whipped in the town square . 50 lashes , minimum . <p> In one post it was mentioned he lost his right to carry concealed everywhere . When he wins his case , will those rights be restored ? <p> Also , when he wins , will all records , files , fingerprints , etc related to his arrest be destroyed ? It is bad enough he was violated like this without having his " file " pop up any time he gets a speeding ticket or applies for a job that does a background search . <p> I would think a smart city manager would be putting some police officers on administrative leave , or firing them , or requiring them to take additional courses and training in both law and decision making in stressful confrontations . The heck with the DA who is probably seeking attention for a political office run , anyway . If an employee of any company was hired to do a job , and subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused their position or were incompetent to handle **26;1100;TOOLONG decisions they would be fired . The higher level city officers could smartly show how skilled their leadership and support of the common man is by taking administrative action they have the right to exercise . <p> Anyway , I was more curious about the aftermath consequences of a citizen standing up for their rights . <p> Yeah , too late for me too , email already sent . Maybe you should put this on the main page of your site , because I am new to your site and just now seen the " news " section that this is listed under . I am a little confused , because CJ was the one calling for the police involved to lose their jobs . I do n't  see how people emailing the Temple police department requesting the same thing CJ did is problem to the effect of quote " but the community of Temple , which CJ loves , has to deal with " . What is this causing the community of Temple to have to deal with ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels , but how does this effect the community of Temple ? <p> Dwayne , the big thing is that people are threatening the lives and families of the officers involved and the city council . That is just not what CJ wanted . Even he himself has received death threats . There are people who do not understand civilized discussion and he asked me to put up a post asking people to stop emailing the PD and the coucil so that hopefully , those who are the ugliest and most threatening would also stop . It is unfortunate that people can not express themselves in a civilized manner without resorting to name-calling and threats . But thank you for your support . <p> Oopstoo late . While I appreciate the fact that you would rather your supporters not inundate temple pd with calls and emails , you have to admit they are just reaping what they have sown . Two years ago I faced law enforcement on an out of control ego trip , and even though it was n't as egregious as this instance it still cost me significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the system . While I respect that you ask us to leave them beIm glad they have felt our disgust for their actions . <p> Sir , you can donate to CJs legal defense fund here at indiegogo . He explains that he is way over his goal and some will be used to refund SSG Nate Sampsons funds he spent in fighting charges like what CJ is currently going through and I think the rest of the legal fund will go towards a lawsuit . <p> Also have your attorney look up Texas Penal code 9.31(c) ( 1 ) If before any resistance is offered a peace officer uses or attempts to use greater force than necessary a person is justified using force even deadly force to resist that arrest ! When the officer walked up and grabbed you without any justification whatsoever he was violating your rights ! <p> Unfortunately , more often than not , this type of situation happens when the cameras are not rolling . Fortunately with more cameras out there than in previous years this type of nonsense is being documented . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take offense to being video taped or you might have lost your video camera as well . I 've always been a law abiding citizen and in most of the random interactions I 've had with Law Enforcement Officers I have found them to me rude , intimidating and closed minded with an enormous ego . Its as if they have an Us ( Cops ) versus Them ( Citizens ) attitude . I used to have great respect for the law enforcement community but as I have grown older and accumulated more experience , my respect continually diminishes . At one point my son had considered a career in law enforcement , however , an interaction between myself , his mother and a local police officer while he was present changed his mind . The actions of the police officer were horrible . I 'm happy to say that due to the actions of this particular police officer my son is now starting his third year of medical school and doing quite well . On occasion I have entertained the thought of sending a Thank You note to the police officer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career in law enforcement . <p> As a former soldier , and police officer , I have to say that the police today are out of control . I was shocked by your video and I support you 100% . I 'm not sure if your attorney advised you but please make sure you sue the peace officers individually outside of suing the county , city or police department . Even thought the officers do not make much money they will have to endure the stress and cost of defending themselfs outside of the governments help . That was the one aspect of being a police officer that me and my co workers always feared . Good job on your part and thank you for your service . <p> I attempted to send a message to the youtube account chcknhawk with the following message , but the account refused to accept it unless I had friend requested them . I am confident that the attorney for the case is in complete control of the situation , but as a concerned and proactive viewer I wanted to dig in through Texas law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and try to help in whatever way I may . That being said , here is the message I tried to send : <p> I was inspired by your video , and it prompted me to search through a substantial amount of Texas law in order to try and assist you . I 'm not sure what your lawyer has advised you of , or if any of this information is new to you , but I figure I 'd send along my findings to try and help in any way I can . <p> Texas Penal Code Section 46.15 . Nonapplicability ( a ) Sections 46.02 and 46.03 do not apply to : Text of subd. ( b ) ( 1 ) as added by Acts 1997 , 75th Leg. , ch. 1261 , - 28 ( 1 ) is in the actual discharge of official duties as a member of the armed forces or state military forces as defined by Section 431.001 <p> Sections 46.02 and .03 are as follows <p> Sec. 46.02 . UNLAWFUL CARRYING WEAPONS . ( a ) A person commits an offense if the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her person a handgun , illegal knife , or club if the person is not : ( it then goes on to list a large number of places ) <p> Sec. 46.03 . PLACES WEAPONS PROHIBITED . ( a ) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally , knowingly , or recklessly possesses or goes with a firearm , illegal knife , club , or prohibited weapon listed in Section 46.05 ( It again continues to list the places where firearms are not allowed ) <p> As for an arrest under the charge of " resisting search . " Let 's have a look at the most basic set of laws our nation has , the Constitution . " The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . " <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then police must obtain a warrant in order to search your possessions . Stating " I do not consent to searches " Is not an offense . You did not use physical force to try and stop a search , so their " charge " against you is bogus . <p> Please , PLEASE fight this out in court . You have hundred of thousands of people backing you in this . PLEASE teach these criminal pigs a lesson for all of us ! 
@@96509856 @709856/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> EXCLUSIVE : The Real VoteVets.org <p> Ive been critical of VoteVets.org for quite some time . Initially , I supported them thinking that their true intent was to get veterans elected to the chambers of Congress . It was founded during the run-up to the 2006 elections and immediately began endorsing veteran candidates . <p> Immediately , I noticed the true intent of this organization . They did n't  really want to get veterans elected to public office ; they wanted to get LIBERAL veterans elected to public office . It was n't until 2007 that I finally woke up to it all . After listening to Marcus Luttrell debate Brandon Friedman at a Texas bookstore , my mind was made up . It was obvious that there was something devious behind this organization . <p> After following this organization for over two years , Im convinced that VoteVets.org is a veteran front group for the liberal , America-hating organization MoveOn.org . While this is merely my opinion , my research does n't  lie . <p> In 2006 , they launched an ad campaign targeting Republican ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our body armor . They blatantly lied about the type and quantity of the body armor we use in the military . They were misleading about the type of weapon being used and lied about the armor " being left over from Vietnam " . In 2008 , they did n't  endorse ONE non-Democratic candidate on their website . When I confronted Brandon on this during our March 12 , 2008 show Brandon claimed to be a " policy based organization and not a party based organization . " <p> " What that means is , " he explained , " we have our agenda and platform and support candidates who agree with us on that . " <p> When I confronted him with the fact that all the candidates they endorsed have been " cut and run " candidates , Brandon had a hard time coming back with anything other than " that 's absurd " . <p> I think that VoteVets and MoveOn have worked very closely to ensure that only liberal veterans are elected to Congress to destroy the war effort and bring our troops home without victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of VoteVets and their specific agenda , he demurred and refused to answer . <p> The organization even teamed up with MoveOn.org for a " Bring the Troops Home " video campaign . The VoteVets website is registered to an anonymous third party organization who refused to talk to me about who owns the URL . For an organization trying to be a legitimate voice of veterans , being owned and operated as a MoveOn.org front group does n't  lend much credibility . <p> And suddenly it all makes sense . More on my posts about VoteVets.org HERE and HERE . <p> I do n't  know much about VV , but a few clicks of " research " leaves me with the impression that they are an agenda-promotion group rather than an advocacy organization . The difference I see from IAVA is that , while Paul Rieckhoff is not shy about his own politics , the organization is focused on caring for veterans . ( Post 911 GI Bill , Tricare for Reservists , mental health care , creatin social connections between vets , etc . ) That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vets for Peace , IAVA , IVAW , VoteVets , same same . All ya had to do was ask me . They tried to oust the rep from Captain Baileys district in NC in 2008. 13th District I believe it was . Iraq Vets for Congress is the one we 've been pushing since Eric Egland tried to run in Arizona in 2006 . Now if we could just get Bellavia interested in NY-26 , and get you to run in Alabama ( or Texas with Marcusheheheh ) , Coby in VA-03 , we 'd have something . Oh and Jimbo could replace Elanore Holmes Norton in the District of Columbia ; and CV could replace that a$$hole Moran in NoVA .

Watch gun and holster reviewer johniac7078 explain the difference between three types of gun belts . His points are summarized below . <p> 1 . Leather belts " This type of belt can be picked up on the cheap at places like Wal-Mart . Some see this as a less adequate way to hold your holster as it is more flimsy than other belts on the market . If you wear an inside-the-waistband holster , it will rotate often and will not be comfortable to carry . As for an outside-the-waistband holster , its even more unstable and uncomfortable . Proceed with caution . <p> 2 . Wilderness instructor belts " These belts are a little bit more expensive than regular leather belts . There is a device built into the buckle that is heavy steel and could aid in rescue operations if need be . Its not the best choice for everyday carry , and definitely do n't  try to wear it to a fancy dinner . <p> 3 . Custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spend , the higher quality you get . This is the stiffest of the bunch . Why does stiffness matter ? It gives support to a heavier gun and holster . Additionally , it keeps your gun in the right position .

@@96509865 @709865/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Simpsons New Duds <p> The title is a double entendre . Does anyone else here remember Goldie Hawns movie , " Private Benjamin " ? It was a pretty funny movie for the time . After watching Jessica Simpsons new movie " Private Valentine : Blonde and Dangerous , " I could n't help but notice the comparisons between the two films . Even with the many differences between the two films , I could pretty much tell you what was going to happen by the end of the film in just the first few minutes . Emily and I were giving each other patent-pending Obama fist bumps as each of our prognostications came to fruition . <p> In " Private Valentine " , due out on February 3rd , Jessica Simpson stars as an adored movie star who decides to enlist in the U.S. Army after her career has slipped to prove to everyone that she is more than just a pretty face . Supported by a star-studded list of actors , including Cheri Oteri and Vivica Fox , this modern day girl-power story is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic lives . <p> Do n't  get me wrong , EVERY military age male will want to purchase this DVD if for no other reason than to watch over two hours of Jessica Simpson ! If you 're looking for something that will help you forget your terrible day , this is the movie for you . Its campy , forced humor will leave your jaw in your lap as you are reminded that your life is n't really that bad after all . You could be forced to watch this movie as part of an " enhanced interrogation " technique not covered in the Army Field Manual and now illegal . <p> If the movie were coming out in theaters , I 'd say do n't  waste your money . But , if you are a hardcore Jessica Simpson fan ( or closet one like me ) , this is a movie you may want to buy , or at least rent , or at the very least use one of your free Blockbuster Online rentals to watch for free . If you decide you 're going to buy the movie , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better about yourself two hours later than you will when the credits start to roll . <p> On the plus side , Simpson is a HUGE military supporter . She has done a lot for our troops and the 15-minute " making of " featurette on the DVD showcases that love . Her awe in what our troops do is a major contributor to her wanting to make this film . Believe it or not , those scenes in which Simpson can be seen walking out of a swamp straight out of a Ranger documentary are real ! The scene actually takes place in a swamp in Louisiana and the mere fact that she braved the croc infested waters and bug infested swamps of the state should be proof enough that she really respects what we do and deserves to at least be given a chance . I also found the farting dog to be extremely humorous . <p> Finally , those of you looking for a film that tells its audience what its like to be a Soldier in todays training environment keep looking ! The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the uniforms look familiar . If you 're one of those that gets annoyed with the inaccuracies in movie portrayals of military life will find themselves launching their 47 inch LCD screen televisions through the living room window . <p> You 're not a real man if you do n't  want to watch a movie with Jessica Simpson and a farting dog in one place ! ! And just look at that DVD cover ! ! A must have for any deployed Soldiers collection .

He s just not that important to me . I have better things to do like ensuring that he never gets embedded with another military unit again . If there is anything I 'm adamant about with respect to Yon , its that and that only . But , I 'll play his stupid game and responded to him . Here is the email I sent ( minus my lapse in verbal profanity filtering ) back to him : <p> Mikey-boy , <p> First of all , I have to say " bleep off ! " Actually , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to say for being a complete douche bag tool ? Are you insinuating something or just trying to get me to fellate you ? Do me a favor and stop infesting my inbox with your drivel . It would be far more productive for you to spend more time at http : //www.photography.com/ or maybe LONG ... I 've noticed that you seem to come to me ( or at least mention me ) when things are looking bad for you ! You should probably get a girlfriend . Your insatiable appetite for CJ Grisham conspiracies is getting creepy . If you keep this up , you 'll be hearing from my lawyer . <p> CJ <p> P.S. I was almost sad to see that things did n't  work out for your in Japan , or Afghanistan , or anywhere lately . ALMOST . <p> I get fed up with Michael Yon DADT-style attraction to me . Every time he sees something he does n't  like on his Facebook page , he blames ME for using a fake profile . The man is losing it and purely mental . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps required to create fake profiles all over the internet . I 'm much too busy writing here , You Served , and Flopping Aces . I 've got a weekly radio show I do n't  even have time to host as much as I used to . I have a deployment I 'm preparing for to Afghanistan ( and did n't  even have to beg for an embed to get it ! ) . Im focused on my pre-deployment training so I can help find , fix , and destroy the enemy . My goal is for tomorrows Afghanistan to be todays Thailand a place where Michael Yon can call home away from REAL Americans . I hear you can see the moon from Afghanistan and there are endless possibilities for blurry photos of it there . <p> Well , Yon did n't  like my response to his email . For all I knew anyway , it was the same person spoofing his Twitter . <p> Mr. Grisham , <p> So you do not deny that this is you who set up this Twitter feed , and that you are the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I say this Twitter feed is by writer CJ Grisham , you will own it . Yes ? <p> If this is not you , it is very important that you deny it now . If you do not deny ownership , you are admitting this is yours . You understand this . Yes ? <p> You understand that you are a writer and a public figure by your own hand , yes ? You owe it to your readers to deny that this Twitter feed is yours . If you do not deny it , you are admitting the allegation that it is yours . <p> Again , the link : http : //twitter.com/MikeYon <p> Deny it now , or its yours . <p> Thank you . <p> Michael Yon <p> Before I continue , let me set something straight . My name is CJ . My father is Mr. Grisham . I know you do n't  like using my rank any longer because it reminds people that , unlike Yon , I 've actually succeeded at this military thing you could n't hack . Unlike Yon , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoted to merely photographing and he ca n't even do that very well . Embarrassing , I know , but his decision . Just think I could have been his 1SG ! At least until I chaptered his ass for DADT violations with sheep . But , I digress ( a LOT ) . <p> Hey , dumbass , are you a lawyer ? No . You 're not even a good photographer . I do n't  confirm OR deny its me . But , I can tell you that if you publicly declare that it is me without proof , expect a lawsuit . Now , if you 're able to provide proof of whom the author is of your Twitter Feed , by all means do so . I would admonish you to be 110% correct and confident in anything you publish publicly . <p> I 'm not going to play your stupid pet tricks and tinfoil hat games . I also caution you against trying to portray me as a " public figure " . And YES , I am a writer . I 'm actually surprised you recognize what good writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so falsely doing so will only lead to you begging for more money to pay for your legal fees . Judging by your recent actions , I 'm sure your funding stream is drying up as it is . I can help if you 'd like to purchase advertising space on my blog to sell more books , but you 'll need to ask a little nicer . <p> I got an email from a Soldiers Angel with this Twitter link . This Twitter feed does not belong to me . Indicators are that it belongs to a writer named CJ Grisham . Mr. Grisham , in response to my privately inquiring if this is his work , threatened a lawsuit if I mention this . The writer CJ Grisham refuses to deny this is his work . <p> A few issues here , the first being the enigmatic " email from a Soldiers Angel " as if Michael is the only person in the world that is supported by the awesome troop support organization . I doubt that the email , if one was indeed sent , was sent by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SA , but I doubt the email was sent from an official of SA . Under his definition , I 'm a Soldiers Angel too ! <p> Second , Mikey talks about " privately inquiring " while making that " private inquiry " public on his FB . There was never an intention for the email to be private . Yon has a habit of sharing " private inquiries " on his page . And notice that he does n't  mention exactly who my lawsuit threat was in reference to . But , he got my message as evidenced by the way he framed his FB posting as coming from " indicators . " But , did any of his drones ask , " what indicators , Michael ? " " You 're close to slandering a Soldier , Michael . What proof do you have its CJ ? " He does n't  say that I also refused to CONFIRM it was me . Why should I ? It would be a full time job for me to respond to every absurd accusation that comes from the tin hat wearing Yon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evidence and proof are mere trivialities as long as the words come from the sensuous lips of Yon . <p> Timothy R. Perren I thought this ass jockey had moved on and started focusing on his own reputation and work instead of yours . Jeez , does he have a crush on you or something ? ( Heh ! At first , I thought he was actually talking about Yon . I was like , " YEAH ! Oh wait " ) <p> I sent a few of these people emails that said the following ( or some variation thereof ) : <p> Only one person actually engaged me with something other than " do n't  bother me again " or similar . Yons fans do n't  care that Yon is distorting the truth and slandering a Soldier . What Yon says is gospel . Seriously : <p> Gregg Longworth Is this Grisham character a child ? Or does he just act like one ? I hope he realizes those tweets are permanent and can be used in a civil action . Ignore him Michael Yon and keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your name is credible . <p> John House sue ( No , his name is Michael . But , I can see how you got confused . ) <p> Charles Pergament Whoop his ass , seabass . ( Heh . I sent this tool an email asking him to ask Yon for proof I did anything and I think I made him cry . His response was " do n't  bother me again " I enjoy being ignorant . There 's nothing worse than someone accusing someone of being indicative of the downfall of the military , but being unable to back up such claims . ) <p> Finally , the last two words of MYs status update are " his work . " He tells his little Yonions that I did n't  DENY being behind the Twitter feed , but makes no mention that I also explicitly did n't  CONFIRM it either . I do n't  understand how Michael could ever doubt my integrity . I 've ALWAYS been open and honest to him even when I was deceiving him . Case in point is this email I sent Yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish anything without research , proof or validity : <p> My name is SSG David Sneakers and I was given your email from a friend ( please do not use my name ) . He suggested I contact you about a situation because you are the only one that cares enough to write about what 's really happening here in Afghanistan . You recently wrote about how we are patrolling with weapons on amber status , but I 've got a worse one for you . <p> We are assigned to a small FOB ( well , it should n't even be considered a FOB more like a ROB remote operating base ) also in the Logar Province . Were an infantry platoon whose mission is overwatch and containment . The problem is that in addition to the other issues brought up to you , were so short on supplies we do n't  even have a full basic load of ammo per man . When a squad goes out , we loan them ammo and just hope that our base is n't attacked while they 're away . We have plenty of rockets and grenades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When our squads go out , they 're sitting ducks . We call ourselves the Talibans shooting gallery . Unless we get full on ambushed , we do n't  return fire because were afraid of running out of ammo for when we really need it . I did n't  join the Army to run from the enemy but that 's what we do . We have n't had a resupply in nearly three weeks and I 'm afraid the Taliban knows were running short because they 've gotten more and more brazen in their attacks . <p> No on in the chain of command is listening to us . McChrystal is trying to pretend that we are doing well and refuses to send reinforcements . Our BN and Bde leadership does n't  seem to be listening and tells us to " suck it up and make do with what we have . " Reminds me of what Rumsfeld said about Iraq . <p> -David <p> Now , does anything stick out to you almost immediately ? Its in the first line of the header . Why does an email from " David " have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my intent was to deceive Yon with a completely bogus email to prove a point , I left plenty of evidence that the email was from me . Hell , I LEFT MY NAME ON THE FROM LINE ! ! ! And , predictably , Yon posted the email contents . <p> Now , to any REAL reporter , journalist , blogger or whatever he s calling himself these days , a few things would stick out immediately ( other than the from line ) . I would have followed up with a few questions : <p> Which FOB ? What unit are you with ? Why do you think you are n't  getting resupplied ? Is there a supply line problem or funding ? Are you at least getting food/water ? <p> Those are simple follow-up questions that I would ask before making a case out of this and mobilizing my masses . Instead , his only response was " Will get on this ASAP . " To give him an itty bit of credit , he ran the accusations but said he was suspicious . Did n't  matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my point . Yon has no compunction about making our military look bad and revealing sensitive information . He had also published an email from another Soldier about FOB security weaknesses ! ! <p> Yon forwarded the email to me and asked if I was behind it . <p> Mr. Grisham , <p> Received this email today the one above and it traces straight back to you . Was this you or not ? If not you , let 's get this straightened out now . If you say its not you , will tell me readers such . <p> If its you , are you in Afghanistan using a different name ? Are you running missions over there ? Truly short on ammunition ? <p> Thanks for helping clear this up . <p> Michael Yon <p> Because my integrity is beyond reproach , I answered him : <p> Its no secret that David Sneakers is my alter ego , hence the reason I left the CJ in the email header and did n't  use a completely fictitious name . I use David to expose real issues dealing with our troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point is that you are carelessly publishing information as if gospel and I sought to prove that on my own . It worked . Call it a sting operation . Call it investigative blogging . Call it what you want , but you exposed yourself . You did n't  ask for follow up information , did n't  ask for my unit . Nothing . <p> No , I 'm not in Afghanistan yet , but training up for it and you are putting me and my troops in danger with your irresponsible " reporting " . <p> Ive been interviewed numerous times by real journalists who refused to run stories or headlines because they could n't be confirmed , yet this is what you do . <p> No , I wont tell your readers anything , but feel to post this email in its entirety . Feel free to continue labeling me as unhinged , unstable , whatever keeps your conscience clear . But , maybe its you who needs to reevaluate his purpose in life . <p> I 'll give you a nice little post to link to shortly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first and last time I used a fake profile and it was one Ive been using for years on here . Just click the " Nigerian Scammers " category to see what I use the name for . <p> Now that Yon has hung his junk out on the chopping block , allow me to apply the hammer . I AM NOT BEHIND THE FAKE TWITTER ACCOUNT OR ANY FAKE ACCOUNT THAT INTERACTS WITH MICHAEL YON ! ! Facts are n't  important to Michael Yon , only accusations . He understands the fundamentals of information operations and the fact that people believe the FIRST story they hear , regardless of whether its true or not . It does n't  matter than I have nothing to do with those pages to his fans . Yon already said I did unequivocally , so to them that is gospel . Yon wont apologize , wont correct his readers or followers , and they wo n't hold him accountable . Theyll just keep shoveling money to pay for his flights to places where hell just link to stories other people write and take blurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy his book without asking why they have to pay twice for it : once to send him where the stories are and then again when the book is released . <p> If I were a donor , I 'd demand at least an at cost copy ! ! They do n't  even know they 're funding his worldwide photo vacation AND funding his poor book writing . They kinda remind me of the Star Wars drones . Roger , roger . But , they have no problem disrespecting a Soldier who has served honorably and courageously , standing up to bullies like him for years ! <p> One final thought . Yon has no problem talking about me all day long on Facebook . But , he has a problem with me being able to call him on his ignorance and stupidity . He will not allow me to comment on his page . Ive been banned . You will NEVER see Yon banned on this blog ! I encourage him to defend himself . Ill put my integrity up against his any dayand twice on Sunday ! ! <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I ca n't comment on his page and they merely regurgitate it like a pelican feeding its young . They crack me up how willingly ignorant they are . And if the person I happen to DM is a Soldier , they immediately try to pull all the rank card as if I care . Its called Facebook , not formation . <p> By the way , the " soldier in Afghanistan " is the Soldier that is commented right above Yon on his post , but he wants his readers to believe its someone important . My entire purpose for even sending messages to his followers are so that I can engage Yon one on one . He s just too afraid to mentally spar with me . He s unarmed . <p> CJ , I already knew it was not you and I actually said so on Yons post last night only to be chastised by Yon because I misspelled the word sergeant as sargeant . I also asked him why he would disrespect you by lying about you not being in the Army and he replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier that you just took money from the Army and that totally ticked me off . I sent him a message where I told him that when I sided with him about the twitter thing was because of the respect I had for him as a veteran and that he should have that same respect for all veterans and active duty personnel . I am still waiting for an answer . God bless ! <p> Good stuff 1SG . I met Yon in Japan the other day and he is certifiably insane . ( Look up the definition of insanity , Mikey you will see that I am right . ) <p> I never served but have covered our nations finest as they have taken the fight to our enemies . It was an honor to do so and I would love to do it again . <p> Yon should get up with Chuck Holton from CBN News and Fox News and see what a REAL Ranger/Journalist is like . Perhaps some of Holtons integrity will rub off on Mikey . ( Well probably not integrity does n't  stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have now been officially blocked at Mikey Yawns page on Facebook . ( Wait for it .. waaaaait for it ) Ok you can laugh now because I am by no means hurt at all that Mikey feels the need to block those who might actually disagree with him or call him out for the spineless worthless failure that he is . <p> Brendan your pathetic castrated hero Yawn has predated this little hilarious game with his own brand of worthless garbage directed at the 1SG . He has tried and failed to discredit and disgrace 1SG Grisham and yet the 1SGs blog followers continues to grow while Mikeys continues to plummet . You keep sending those donations to Yawn Brendan and then pray to god that nobody you know is killed in Afghanistan by Michael Yawns lack of integrity and professional ethics when he violates OPSEC once again . <p> CJ , Yawn is a coward with an ego bigger then a Top Gun instructor . I enjoy sitting on the sidelines watching the fight although its pretty much a given who is winning . What amazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Where is my money going that I send you ? " " Are you living in Thailand on my dime and taking pictures of the moon there to avoid paying taxes ? " I have to wonder if he really flew to Afghanistan a few weeks ago to only pack up and take off for Japan to cover the earthquake . I mean , that is n't a little hop , so was he even there in the Stans ? It would n't be a big trip from Thailand to Japan though . I cant bring these questions up because last time I did , I was banned from his FB feed , so I just think them , hoping this Jedi mind trick will work on his masses but alas they ignore it and go back to eating their canned unicorn meat treats . Hope you are n't  too dirty from wrestling with pigs CJ , you are a REAL Soldier and fantastic writer , keep it up brother ! Semper Fi , Taco <p> That panorama in Yons dispatch today was taken in February , and it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you just filled in something that was nagging at me . Just what has he been doing ? Combat Journalist below said he met Yon in Japan , but a few of us at work following the Yon garbage wondered why there was no dispatch from Japan , why suddenly after 2 days in Afgh he hopped on a plane and flew into , where , Tokyo ? and the welcoming Navy . Suddenly the Navy is hiding things from him , they are n't  telling the truth , and then he got out of there FAST . A students father was there checking on a refinery for a client , and was there for 10 days , no problems with anyone . He wrote home , he wrote the company , took his time , the Navy helped him out , sooo , what was going on with Yon ? Where was he on his minions dimes ? <p> This bit about " even murder " is nothing less than a set up on CJ . My husband told me to shut up , but I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creating his defense . I do the same thing . <p> Even if you are right in what you say ( of which I know nothing either way ) , your ranting here is so unprofessional and such that would turn off any reasonably minded person and makes you come off sounding like a raving lunatic . <p> Yeah , cause publicly blaming someone of making fun of you on Twitter without proof or knowledge is the professional thing to do . I agree . I need to be more like your hero , Yon . Thanks for setting straight with your superior ethics lesson . <p> CJ , I have to admit that I expect a bit of decorum from an employee of mine , and as an active duty soldier , well , that 's what you are . I have n't the slightest idea who is in the right here , but if you and Yon came into my office , and you chose your verbage in the way you have on your blog , at the end of the meeting , you 'd be out of a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there , but I 'll tell you this much he presents his information in such a manner that , if nothing else , tends to promote intelligent discussions amongst civilians who really do n't  know or understand combat ( you know the people you work for ) . The he-man route works well if you want to preach to the choir ( and the disaffected living shallow lives in their absent moms basements ) , but if you are trying to educate and inform the general populace , well , its not the best profile to adopt . <p> You are indeed welcome and free to say and publish what you wish , and I respect that , but I 'd prefer to get my field intel from someone who displays a bit more intellect than Duke Nukem . <p> Its easy to present lies to " promote intelligent discussion " is n't it ? Its hard to believe lies when you pepper them with sharp words . he s good at that inventing his stories and then you all come over here and pretend the anti " Yon worshipper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you were my employer and had a say in my employment , I would n't be working for you . I expect respect from my supervisors as well ! <p> I 've said this before , but it bears repeating : My respect for you grows daily . It makes me beam with pride that you and men of your caliber wear my countrys uniform . <p> I have to be honest and say I 'd never heard of your or Michael Yon before I started reading Blackfive . Consider this , after reading and observing you both , it took very little time for me to realize Michael had well earned the name , Yawnbo the Clown and that you were a man who had things to say that were well worth listening to . Yon has behaved like a mentally disturbed bafoon and disgraced the uniform he so briefly wore . You , on the other hand , have done it proud . I 've learned a great deal from you and the other legitimate , respected milbloggers . You enrich my life daily .

Did n't  you need to try them on first ? <p> Then the opportunity to review a pair came along , and I threw caution to the wind . Although I 'm typically between a size 8 and 8.5 , I chose to order a size 8 in the Womens Hi-Tec Altitude Glide WP . I picked this pair because it seemed to have all the right qualities " perfect height , features and color . It was n't until the boots were out of the box and on my feet that I truly became a believer in buying boots online . <p> What impressed me the most was the break-in period " mainly because there was n't one . I literally unboxed the boots , laced them up and went on a hike . I took my new Hi-Tecs to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky and Devils Elbow in Missouri . To be completely honest , I had never really heard anything about this brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to expect . <p> After owning pairs of Vasques and Merrells , I was prepared to get at least one or two blisters along the way . With the Hi-Tecs , I experienced no hot spots whatsoever . - I hiked up cliffs , scrambled across rocks and hiked for miles with a heavy pack . How many times did I think about my feet ? Not once . <p> Although I did n't  cross any rivers while wearing the boots , I like that the waterproofing would allow it . And the boots medium height was perfect on my ankles . Also , the traction was excellent . While trying to climb a pretty steep hill , I fell about 12 feet . But I cant blame the Hi-Tec boots on that one . It was a steep hill , and there were leaves covering the entire area . <p> Really , the only detrimental attribute is its sizing issue . I would say these boots are not true to size .

The front had images of all the NCO ranks and the back said " The NCO IS The Army . " NCOs are the backbone of our military . The problem is that this particular shirt was only geared to the Army . I do n't  think they ever made similar shirts for the other services . They have rectified this with a new NCO shirt called " NCO Backbone . " <p> History tends to tell the stories of Generals , Admirals , or the officer that happened to be in charge of a particular important battle . We like to think of these people as somehow being military geniuses who outsmarted , outmaneuvered , and outhustled the enemy . <p> The truth , however , as anyone who has ever spent a day in the military knows , is that even if these guys were amazing on any given day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were 2LTs and Ensigns and a grizzled NCO who had been there and done that took them by the ears and taught them how to be leaders . <p> And during those battles , it was n't the officers ' amazing plans or leadership that won the day . After all , no plan survives first contact anyway . It was the technical and tactical proficiency of the most educated and disciplined NCO Corps the world has ever seen leading squads and platoons to victory . And before the battle even started , these same NCOs were taking care of their men " ensuring proper food and sleep was provided , weapons were clean , ammo was available . <p> In short , it is the NCO that does all the work , that takes care of and disciplines the troops , that educates soldier and officer alike .

He found it hard to believe that anyone that came from anything other than a noble upbringing would have the intelligence , discipline and skill to excel as a military officer . <p> After only one campaign his worldview started changing drastically and by the time he took charge of the Continental Army , he broke all convention elevating his best troops rapidly through the ranks to Colonel and General despite the fact that many of them came from simple families . <p> He found that the true measure of a man was his capability , his integrity , and his courage .

They 're here to serve your country . <p> You 're here to serve them . <p> Serve them to the best of your ability , as if they were your own sons and daughters because ultimately , they are just that .

He just ca n't stand that I am capable of going on with my life while he wallows in his own self-pity in the third-world nation of Thailand . Its just not fair that he is a failure and others can be more successful . Since he s attacking me again with false claims , I 'm bumping this post to the front of the line again . So , read on and also take a moment to read LLs post here for even more information about Michael Yons defamatory and libelous claims . But , do n't  expect him to respond if you ask him to explain any of the facts below . He ca n't and wont . <p> UPDATE 4/16/13submitted by CJ Grisham , Emilys husband : One can only guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means . <p> UPDATE 4/13/13submitted by Emily Grisham , CJs wife : ( as with all images , click on it for a larger view ) <p> If anyone knows Cj and I , you know that he leaves his computer up at home a lot , and I used to regularly post stupid things on Facebook under his name . Usually , it would be something along the lines of " Dance , midget , DANCE ! ! " Or some reference to Oompa Loompas . Since I am home , and his computer is unmanned MOST of the day , its not so fun anymore . <p> Last night , our two older kids were at a party , Cj was working on a website for some friends , and it was about time for him to go and pick them up . He showed me what he had come up with so far , i gave him my input , asked if I could look at stuff on his laptop while he was gone , and then he left . <p> While he was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his FB . Cj was visiting with the parents of the home that was hosting the party , with no access to his laptop . He was gone for about 30 minutes . I thought it would be funny if I put something that no one could tell that was an obvious hack . Oiy .. If Yon had showed the comments in the thread , it would have shown where cj and I joked about it being hacked later on that night . <p> If you have been to Cjs Indigogo page , everyone knows that you cant have access to the money until you raise it , or the time period is over with . <p> The rest is a moot point , but I will explain it anyway . We have a bank in a X state that is our joint account . When the legal funds get transferred , which would take days anyhow , it will go to a bank in Texas , not the joint one that we have together . <p> If you look at my receipt , you will see what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale for $20.80 ( yay me ! ) . A $16.99 tee-shirt on sale ( yay me ! ) . A black skirt for my other daughter , since we are church going people and she has a lack of skirts since she happens to still be growing , you got it , ON SALE , for $19.99 ( yay me ! ) . Then , the main purpose of the " spree " to begin with .. the shoes . On sale . Thirty-seven dollars and ninety-nine cents . yay me . <p> Further looking at the receipt , you will see I had a coupon for 20% off , which was great . I also had a gift card for thirty dollars . You got it , yay me ! Thus bringing the spree to $52.93 . <p> Now , if this is the kind of spree you all like to go on , with coupons and gift cards , and going to five different other stores to make sure you have the best absolute deal , then , yes . It was a spending spree . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no say in that , and he can and will not take that away from me or my husband , no matter what jealousies he projects into our lives . <p> These , AGAIN , are the facts . What all the ignorant folks that read Mr. Yon as a religion , because , " trust " him , he " knows " need to know , is that , no . He does n't  know . He never will know . He and my husband are n't  connected in some intrinsic way that makes him the keeper of all that is CJ Grisham . He is a sad , old , man with.nothing . <p> <p> Originally published 4/10/13 <p> I 've remained quiet and silent about Michael Yon for nearly two years now . I have n't said much of anything because , to be honest , he s not worth my time . If I responded to every hollow allegation he made , I would have to rename this blog . But , because he is trying to interfere with my case here in Texas from his secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no choice but to set the record straight . When he is trying to spread discontent by contacting people within the Army , Pentagon , local media , and Temple Police Department , he ca n't be ignored . <p> I appreciate that LL has largely taken care of handling him so that I could continue to remain focused on my troops , my family , my mission , and other things . My goal here is not to get into a pissing match . Again , I do n't  have time for that . My goal here is not to verbally spar with Michael Yon either . I am also not going to discuss my ongoing case here in Temple , Texas . It is still an open case and once everything is resolved , either through court action or dismissal , all the facts will be on my side in the end . I am simply going to take his accusations point by point and refute them for the record . Some areas I will NOT address specifically because they have already been flushed out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started . <p> 1 . Mr. Yon frequently accuses me of stalking him , while providing no proof of such " stalking . " The fact that I have n't so much as breathed a sigh of his name in nearly two years while he has averaged mentioning me several times per month should be proof enough about whom is stalking whom . <p> Even prior to the point I decided Mr. Yon was not worth responding to any longer , his claim that I stalked him is dubious and unsupported by fact . Ask him for proof . Ask him for screenshots . He says I plague his email , when the fact is that he writes me quite often demanding answers to his questions while refusing to answer any himself . He has tried to comment on my blog . <p> In other words , when Mr. Yon does n't  have the facts , he will just invent them . LL discussed his obsession with my awards and decorations here so I wo n't rehash that in depth in this post . I do n't  have to explain myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to anyone . In Mr. Yons world view , absence of evidence is evidence of absence . The stalking claim simply does n't  work and is n't supported by facts . <p> Look at any story that mentions my name , and you 'll probably find a comment from Mr. Yon on it . In fact , he spammed my legal fund site with nearly 1,000 comments after donated $1 to my compaign and was eventually banned by Indiegogo for terms of use violations . I provided screenshots of all these emails to LL upon request for her post . He has gone through great lengths to keep track of the units I 'm in . He has TRIED to triangulate where I live ( wrong-o ) . He has shared my cell phone number , my email addresses , and other identifiable information . <p> 2 . Michael Yon frequently uses one of my photos without permission as a way to further his narrative that I 'm a crazed psycho . This is the picture that he recently posted on his latest defamatory screed directed towards me . <p> Since April of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of my request for him to take it down as he did n't  have permission to use it on a site he uses to raise money . <p> Well , I do n't  have the time or inclination to deal with an absurd back a forth argument through email . My attorney was CCd on each email I sent . Michael Yon loves to complain about people using the lucky photo that made him famous , but ignores others that want similar treatment of their intellectual property . Mr. Yon knew that the photo was mine because he lifted it from my Twitter account . What Mr. Yons readers see is what looks like a deranged photo because he recognized early on that he could use it to suit his agenda against me using his bully pulpit of 60,000 followers . However , he intentionally removes the context of the photo entirely . Here is the photo with the caption that was originally under the photo . <p> Notice the caption underneath that says : " @LaserLyte new pistol bayonet . The last line of defense against the Zombie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poking fun about the need for a pistol bayonet . In fact , my Tweets and feedback to the company actually influenced them to create a Zombie Apocalypse version of the pistol bayonet , as you can read here . Every time Michael Yon uses this photo , he uses it as some kind of proof of his constant stream of defamatory statements that I 'm " unhinged , " " crazy , " or " mentally i 'll . " And his readers buy into it as well because Mr. Yon does n't  provide the context of the photo . <p> 3 . Michael Yon claims that I was sent home because of mental health issues . This is another libelous and defamatory comment . Mr. Yon is trying to connect comments I made about a separate issue ( namely constant stream of mortars launched against the FOB at the time ) with the reason I went home . He is very good at word games . Mr. Yon constantly mentions that I did n't  " complete my tour " in Afghanistan . <p> This is a key statement because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks " I was sent home , but passes off the information off as fact . The truth is that I was sent home to deal with more skin cancer . I still have the signed release letter signed by my Brigade Commander saying as much . Michael Yon claims that this was an after-the-fact reason I invented for coming home as a way to hide the " real " reason . Prior to my deployment , I put up this photo of post-op stitches after having some skin cancer removed . <p> Because of the procedure and subsequent recovery , I was unable to deploy with my unit on time and had to fight a non-deployable rating to join my unit later . However , during a check-up in theater , the doc found another spot on my scalp that they could n't treat . It looked invasive and he deemed it necessary to take care of as soon as possible . So , I was sent home to deal with this problem . Here is a photo the doc took for me immediately after it was removed in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sent home , I sure do go through some great lengths to get out of a deployment that I fought to go on in the first place . By the time my surgery had healed and I was cleared for duty again , my unit was already beginning to siphon back home . So , for me , my tour was complete . I actually came home along with a bunch of other troops that were to prepare the Brigade for the return of the unit . Did they not " complete their tours " either ? Michael Yon plays word games when he makes these claims . <p> 4 . Michael Yon claims that I threatened to kill him while I was in Afghanistan . He frequently says that the Army should do something about me for supposedly threatening him . Mr. Yon has misled his followers for such a long time and told the lie so many times , I have no doubt even he believes it . <p> While I was in Afghanistan , Mr. Yon made several complaints against me through several venues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was trying to do my job supporting the combat troops that flowed through KAF , I had to endure investigation after investigation into these supposed " threats " I made . While my leaders were busy trying to make RC-South safer , they were sidetracked dealing with several nonsense complaints and accusations . Mr. Yon claims to have felt threatened and has written over and over again that the Army did nothing to me . Once all the investigations were concluded and I was cleared of any wrongdoing , I filed a FOIA request through my attorney for copies of the investigations . What I found was shocking . <p> If Michael Yon truly felt threatened , why did n't  he cooperate with the investigations against me ? Why did n't  he defend his allegations ? And it was n't just the MPI investigation he refused to cooperate with . <p> I already discussed in some detail these " threats " that were made in a post on the subject back in September 2011 . I wrote that post to try and set the record straight , but Mr. Yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened his life . <p> In reality , I 've never killed a man in a bar fight . I 've never lost control to the point that I took another human life in anger outside of combat as Michael Yon has . I just continue to find it the epitome of irony that a former Special Forces-trained individual who has DEMONSTRATED and CARRIED OUT an act of fatal violence actually takes a known statement of hyperbole from a popular movie and supposedly takes it personal as a direct threat . Regardless , if he truly felt threatened , he would have cooperated with at least ONE investigator trying to nail my butt to a cross . Instead , he blames the Army for not doing anything about me . These statements ring hollow and have contributed to his persona non grata status within the military . <p> 5 . Michael Yon likes to compare me to a myriad of unrelated people to make his points somehow sound valid . These individuals range from Jessica Lynch to Pat Tillman to Bradley Manning to Nidal Hasan to Robert Bales . I 've also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The list is exhaustive . <p> In this quote , he says we both got our Bronze Stars during the " same timeframe . " However , he oscillates between that and getting it on the same day as Jessica Lynch , as he did hundreds of times on my Indiegogo fundraiser page ( his spamming of comments resulted in his ability to comment taken away ) . Michael Yon also claims that we were in the same Division . <p> Jessica Lynch was a part of the 507th Transportation Company , 2d Battalion , 7th Air Defense Artillery , 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade out of Fort Bliss , Texas . I was assigned to the 103rd Military Intelligence Battalion , but attached to 2nd Brigade Combat Team , 3rd Infantry Division ( Mechanized ) a completely DIFFERENT unit altogether out of Fort Stewart , Georgia . Jessica was awarded a Bronze Star for actions that occurred on March 23 , 2003 , in An Nasariyah , Iraq . I was awarded my medal for actions that occurred on March 29 , 2003 , near Al Hindiyah while conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ! I kept a very detailed journal and began posting it two years later in 2005 when I started up this blog . Again , Mr. Yon cant even get his facts straight about easily researchable things like this . <p> I do n't  understand the Pat Tillman reference in the least , only share the same branch ( Military Intelligence , though different MOS ) as Bradley Manning who is a stain on the term " Soldier " or MI professional , and have absolutely nothing in common with Nidal Hasan . Again , Michael Yon is king of taking completely unrelated matters and forcing the puzzle to fit together into a blurry image , like most of his photos . <p> I do n't  talk much at all about my medals . They have been mentioned in numerous stories when I have been asked to provide what awards I have , but I do n't  go around poking my chest out in spite of what Mr. Yon proclaims . Again , he should provide proof that I am constantly sticking my medals out there for attention or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Yon is also wrong that it was awarded to me by an MI unit . As a matter of fact , I was put in for the medal in question by the commander of the Tank Company himself that I was attached to during the battle . Naturally , we were still involved in combat and no one was able to submit awards while we were still involved in force on force engagements . So , I had no idea I was even submitted for something until just before we were sent to Fallujah . <p> My entire combat tour is encapsulated in that ONE medal because my MI Battalion would n't allow anyone to submit a deployment award for me since I got an impact award . In other words , my five months of fighting up to Baghdad and then over into Fallujah were boiled down to one 15-minute fight and the rest was unrecognized except in my NCOER . I was n't recognized for any other battles I was involved in throughout OIF1 or any of the intelligence from my team that resulted in the capture or kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck of cards ) . That is what happens when an MI unit takes over the admin of a combat arms submission . I was just happy to be going home with my life considering I should have died on at least three separate occasions . The fact is that my Tactical HUMINT Team saw the most combat of any THT in theater and the 3rd Infantry Division Museum at Fort Stewart still has an AK I was able to bring back from one of the ambushes I survived and had to use to keep fighting due to ammo shortages . <p> 6 . Michael Yon states that I should sue him if I think he is telling lies about me . He claims the reason I have n't sued him yet is because he s been telling the truth . Why would I sue him ? What would I stand to gain ? It would cost me tens of thousands of dollars to prosecute and if I won , what would I gain ? Mr. Yon has nothing to give . In the end , I would get a judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out every penny I have to prove something most people already know . I do n't  need a lawsuit to prove that . I cant garnish any wages because he gets all his money under the table through donations that probably are n't  tracked by the IRS . There 's nothing in it for me at all . I think the above examples are proof enough that there is a crucial lack of integrity and obsession when it comes to Michael Yons writings about me . <p> 7 . Michael Yon claims that I " boasted " about going to a concert when I got home from Afghanistan on Twitter . While I was in Kuwait for a few days waiting on a flight home , my wife sent me an email that she got me tickets to a concert of two of my favorite bands , Godsmack and Staind ( with Halestorm ) . In Michael Yons twisted sense of logic , Soldiers with PTSD are n't  allowed to go to concerts . <p> The fact is that I was coming home shortly after my birthday to deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it turned out I would back by then . Mr. Yon then questions how it could be that a guy with PTSD could bring himself to go to a crowded concert . While she got me tickets to the floor section , I sat in a nearly empty section of the surrounding arena far away from the crowds , just enjoying the music . Here is a picture I took during the concert from my vantage point at the concert last April . <p> This is , once again , an example of Michael Yon inventing facts about something of which he has zero knowledge . As a matter of additional fact , there were MANY combat veterans in attendance at the concert and I 'm sure some of them were also diagnosed with PTSD . It is common knowledge that music is a great treatment for dealing with the anxiety issues that are attendant with those suffering from PTSD . Music has always been a part of life and helped me through difficult times , so why wouldnt it be okay to attend a concert to get my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? <p> The more talented troops with PTSD actually deal with their diagnoses by CREATING music . Guys like Mylon English of 7 Years Today and SGT Leo Dunson have written songs to deal with their issues and hopefully provide an outlet for others in their situations . Michael Yon seems to think that those efforts are fine as long as you have headphones on . Troops are n't  allowed to actually feel the music that impacts them in a live setting . Its an ignorant and dangerous supposition to make , but one that he makes frequently . Going to that concert greatly eased my mind and I wo n't ever pretend that I should be ashamed for it . <p> Honestly , I could go on and on . I have literally hundreds of screenshots of Michael Yons constant stream of libelous and defamatory comments about me . Much has been deleted because he has been proven false by so many others so many times . When things do n't  go his way , he either deletes or tries to bury his actions under tons of fluff links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I already wasted entirely too much of my time I 'll never get back just writing about Michael Yon here . It does n't  interest me and it wont change the minds of the people he s duped for long with his constant stream of accusations , innuendos , and fictional story telling . I 'm done and have other things going on that are much more important . <p> As a gun owner , i find it interesting when someone questions the need , or purpose of carrying a particular firearm . It shows that person does n't  know anything about firearms , or the law . So , Gregrey , with all due respect , if you have to ask , you are not qualified to understand the answer . What you should be able to understand is that the law says he does n't  have to justify what , or why he was carrying , as long as he was carrying legally , which he was . <p> Heres what I do n't  understand . Mr. Grisham is willing to go online and ask for money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit against the officers that he says illegally arrested him . So , if what Mr. Yon has said are outright lies and defamation , and the reason why Mr. Grisham does n't  sue Mr. Yon is a question of money , why did n't  he start a fundraising campaign for that purpose ? And since I 'm here and asking questions , I really would like to know the purpose of carrying an AR-15 AND a concealed side arm while taking ones teenage son on a hike . Ive read it was because of " rattle snakes and coyotes " but for one , the location , at least at the point when the video was shot , may be considered rural , but I watched several vehicles drive past while the incident was occurring , so its not like its some backwater dirt road he was on . And second , if he felt the need to go strapped with that much firepower just to go on a hike , maybe he should have considered hiking somewhere safer . <p> First off , the reason why CJ does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its a total waste of time and energy . Yon is in Thailand , has been there for at least 2 years , since he was disembedded in Afghanistan by the Army , and what is the point ? To get a judgement that says , " Yes , Yon lied , continues to lie , and you can do nothing about it because you can not enforce US judgements in Thailand ? " Really ? Its better to just tell the truth and someday , if he ever comes back stateside , serve him THEN , when he can be held TOTALLY accountable . <p> Secondly , addressing your second part , everyone should come to you to determine what is best when hiking ? I thought this was a free country , and the state of Texas allowed open carry of long guns ? Do you have an office where people can apply so as to get determinations as to what is reasonable in YOUR mind for carrying ? I 'm just asking because I was under the impression that we do not need to ask the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission ) , based upon the 10th Amendments determination on what a STATE considers legal to carry , considers ok or not . Let us know where to apply for your ok when carrying . Thanks . <p> Gregory .. yer a dicktard lol. to carry , no reason needed , how about , BECAUSE HE CAN ! ! ! And he was on a hike during his encounter with the corrupt TPD , Ermis resembles a FAT doughnut macking mitchelin tire lol .. i 'm kinda tired of BS gun haters posting everywhere , if not for our guns and gun rights , even the dumb asses would be speaking a different language gun haters .. suck it up n deal with it ! ! ! <p> Friend of Wendys here . Thank you and your family for your service and sacrifice . You deserve better than to be hassled by FMY . He s one weird dude being fixated on you like this . I wonder why people believe anything he says when he sounds so much like a scorned teenager lashing out over unrequited love or something equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or him , but anyone with half a brain can see he s gone over the edge where you 're concerned . Anyway , my other motivation for writing besides to thank you for your service and to note FMY is one twisted and angry individual , is to say I 've seen the videos of the arrest and offer moral support . <p> Its clear you broke no laws and the officers stepped over the line , especially with your son . I know if this happened to my son and I , I would be take the high road and let them off the hook for my arrest and then crucify the motherf*ckers for messing with my kid and giving him the wrong impression , not to mention a solid reason for not trusting law enforcement in the future-that is unforgivable that they broke their trust with a child . <p> Whatever you do , I respect that you 're taking a stance against what has become a more and more common approach to gun owners and perhaps more importantly the more common occurrence in recent times of law enforcement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi I just recently read of the unfortunate happenings , and wanted to wish you luck . One of the things I myself know is in order to better understand an opposing force you must know how such force works . This quote here is from Michael Yons biography and is as follows . Yon has stated , in general , that " If a writer wants to make money , he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear . " It just amazes me how such fraud of a want to be writter , and disgrace to prior service men would so blatantly show how much of a fraud he is and people still follow and believe his non-sense . I wish you the best from one service member to another . May god bless you and semper fidelis . <p> Bob , all of those are counters to Yons lies with proof backing up CJs position . Have you seen any proof of Yons position other than edited photos ( as in that Twitter picture with the bayonet gun ) or has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent home for mental reasons ? Because all I 've ever seen are edited pictures and his words , words , words , but no proof . CJ has shown PROOF of his cancer going all the way back to 2011 , which he still gets treatment for up to today . And yet Yon is the one who is correct about why CJ came home from Afghanistan ? <p> Who are you to say in fact whether or not a person deserves to be ripped from their home and placed in supervisive care just because you might have spoke to him for less than an hour , or because of history that does n't  even provide enough details for reasonable cause ? I 'm no expert in this , but i can clearly see that Cj here is just as sane as anyone else . I 've met several military vets that DO belong in custody . I would hate to see further implications or opinions from you based on very little knowledge , because its extremely embarrassing to the efforts made to show these proofs , yet you spit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome . Perhaps its best to hold your tongue on matters you know nothing about , lest you have the actual proof that implies that Cj is in fact lying about all his issues to make a quick and large impression , because as of now , I see you as a fool , one I refuse to even consider listening to . <p> Bob go drink someone elses kool aid dude . Cj is a stand up man and soldier . He has more integrity in his pinky finger than most anyone has in their whole body and would n't doctor photos to make him look good . Cj will stand up for what 's wrong and makes things happen . How do I know ? Ive known Cj since 2004 and he stuck his neck out for me when I needed it because my chain of command was failing me . We need more people like Cj to help show the corruption and abuse in police departments and in our government . I 'm outraged at what has happened and will stand beside him if needed . His is a brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow soldiers if needed . <p> I think the coinage of a new acronym is appropriate after reading this TMD Too Much Drama . Good grief its like watching Mean Girls Military Edition . Yon is a turd and this has been known for a while . His antics have been the talk on sites such as PF and SOCNET . When the SOF community openly rejects one of their own this says something . He s well known throughout theatre for being a huge PITA . And its sad , because I think he was doing a lot of good at one point , but he s certainly overshadowed that memory . And also worth pointing out he s had plenty of opportunities to about face and correct course . Admit your wrong , apologize , and STFU , were happy to forgive , but instead he digs deeper . He has no way back at this point . As a side note , from my time in theatre Ive come across a lot of contractors who lived in Thailand , extreme weirdos every single one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals that have ever lived , or were ducking legal and/or debt issues back home . Without fail they all had huge problems and were hugely dysfunctional with managing their lives . <p> Tried chatting with the guy from a grey standpoint . The dude really does refuse to offer any level of primary sources for his views on things . <p> All I know is what I see with my own eyes , and on that video , your rights were taken away from you . I 'm rooting for you in that sense . Anything more is a he says she says that I wish to stay out of . But with the refusal of co-operation that yon seems to show , I 'm leaning more towards your side at the moment . Have a good one . <p> Don , thank you for at least looking and reading with an open mind . I know for my part , it is n't even a matter of being on anyones side but I want people to think about whether Yon just makes declarations and people believe it to be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to ask him to provide evidence of his claims . He only tries to get people to read his " dispatches " where , again , he claims a lot of things , but never provides things like 3rd party , impartial evidence , such as the MPI investigation document . Even with the second document , it shows how Yon tried to get the investigator to go to other sources that he provides but he never gives a sworn statement himself . He claims to be a primary source in his responses to you on his FB page , but if that were the case , why not just provide a sworn statement to either investigator back then ? ? <p> Actually , its NOT easy to reproduce all the evidence that cj has come up with . All the e-mails , certifications , photos , screen caps , receipts , holes and scars in his head , etc . He s not a photoshop savvy guy . Cj has provided the paper trail PROOF to MYs ( and from here on out , I shall refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyhow . You can guess what the f stands for. ) accusations and rants . All FMY has ever come up with are WORDS . Thousands and thousands of words about a man he claims is stalking him , and yet the facade is falling on who is stalking whom , here . And his sheep just lap it up like they are wanderers in the desert . No questions asked because if FMY said it , it must be true . After all , FMY tells you to just trust him on all things Cj . <p> Very easy to reproduce all the stuff you posted to make you look like a hero and Yon a Zero . <p> Get some soap on a rope because your attitude towards authority will clearly get you at least one good contempt of court charge .. 30 days locked up would be a good thing for you . Perhaps then you will get the counseling you need and the boot from the Army . <p> And Yon cant edit and lie to make it seem as if CJ is a zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not read the post at all and did you not look at the images or follow the links on how Yon lies , lies , edits , prevaricates , and LIES ? <p> ts always so astonishing to me that people will believe the most ridiculous things just because someone they like says it . I think little Yonnie does n't  get enough of the attention he craves , so , he has to create " situations " to get it . Sad . So sad . <p> Mr. Grisham , I agree , this old granny would n't waste anymore time on him either . And Mr. Grisham , I thank you so very much for your service to me and these United States of America ! God Bless the Republic ! <p> Mrs. Pierce Granny Extraordinaire <p> By the way , I LOVE the " crazy " looking picture of you too funny ! Guess Yonnie has no sense of humor . <p> That weapon he s holding is actually kind of a running joke in the Armya pistol with affixed bayonet is the ultimate self defense weapon from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss our Dawn of the Dead survival plans . <p> Like honorable Vietnam veteran Mike Sarkisian ( just now saw his post here ) , CJ Grisham serves on our all volunteer nonprofits Board of Directors . http : **36;1128;TOOLONG No one serves on our board who did n't  EARN their way there . Grisham has always stepped up when duty called to assist a military family in time of crisis or a critically injured returning service member the VA or in some cases , the military itself has failed to assist . <p> The Good Lord has blessed us with an opportunity to serve real heroes ( military and law enforcement ) . Service members come to us from military caseworkers after large well funded " charities " found excuses not to help . CJ was never " too busy " to lend a hand in getting the case exposed so we could meet the need . <p> Thanks to CJ and his pals we 've worked in many ways to advance support for all branches of the military in ways I cant begin to chronicle here for lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to their own personal agendas . Some of Yons pals have gone so far as to say I should remove CJ from our board . They receive a polite but firm rebuff . Attack my friend ; you attack me ! Better leave your Swiss Army knife mentality at home because MacGyver wont be there to spare you the agony of embarrassment . <p> CJ , keep doing what you have been doing the right thing . A person can only take so much before they must stand up and protect the most important thing they believe in . This issue had gone way out of control . I do n't  know why he can not go on and do his job without taking take to mess with you . I have seen some good one on the net but this tops them all . Due what Johnny Cash states in one of his song . http : //youtu.be/ZMycFu4esas I wo n't back down . HOOAH Rick <p> Its a shame Yon is fixated on you , CJ , and that you have to expend time and effort defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solicit for donations , which are still on a rapid decline . Michael Yons active FB fans are no more than few hundred , and soon he will have to find employment . The gravy train is pretty much over for Michael Yon .

A holster needs to tightly hold onto your firearm , but it also needs to be taken out relatively easy , so users must decide what balance they want to strike between security and accessibility . The simplest holster is a pouch that fits close to the gun . These simple pouches give a fair amount of protection and security , depending on material , and provide much more protection than clip-on holders , which can sometimes be flimsy . Pouch holsters can have a spring-flap closure to keep the gun inside the holster but also keep it even more secure . <p> A wide range of shapes , materials , and retention/release mechanisms are available on firearm holsters , and some even cover the entire gun . Because gun holsters are used in a wide variety of situations , a lot of options exist .

But here a balance is necessary , too : if the material is too stiff , the holster might break when pressed between the users body and another object , like a wall . Most handgun holsters are made from leather , but nylon and molded plastic , such as Kydex , are also popular choices . Holsters can be worn a number of ways : attached to a belt , clipped to clothing , or inside a pocket . The holster is usually kept near the chest , waist , or upper thigh for easy access .

Just want to let everyone know I 'm doing well if you do n't  see me around much online . Ive picked classes that wont interfere with my radio show , but it may impact my blogging initially . I 'm so close to a degree I can almost see itwith a good set of binoculars . <p> CAN Afghanistan become an other Iraq ? A few years ago , that wouldve been a question full of foreboding . Now , it expresses an aspiration . <p> The Afghan war has , as any US officer will tell you , long been " under-resourced , " a word that in a counter-insurgency war is almost always a synonym for failure . While Iraq had 15 US combat brigades before the surge and 20 during it , Afghanistan was in the low single digits and will only reach six brigades with the addition of the 17,000 troops President Obama just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the relative priority of the two wars over the last seven years : " If you needed it in Iraq , you got it ; if you needed it in Afghanistan , you figured out how to do without it . " That has changed , but by how much and for how long will be defining questions for the Obama administration . <p> The challenges in Afghanistan bear an uncanny resemblance to those in Iraq prior to the surge : insufficient coalition force levels , making it impossible to secure the population ; a population that 's sitting on the fence , waiting to see whether the insurgents or the coalition has more staying power ; an indigenous army that 's too small , and a police force plagued by incompetence and corruption ; a weak political leader at the top who is triangulating between the coalition and its enemies . ( President Hamid Karzai is both unpopular and likely to win re-election in August . ) <p> On top of all of this , Afghanistan is a broken country , shattered by the Soviets and by years of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complex patchwork of ethnicity and tribes even without the serial catastrophes that have befallen it . <p> In the Pashtun areas of the south , where the insurgency is strongest , 25 percent of children live less than five years , average life expectancy is 45 and half of men and more than 80 percent of women are illiterate . The opium trade equals more than half of the GDP of Afghanistan , with as much as $500 million a year of the illegal largesse going to the insurgency ( and the defense ministrys operating budget is just $58 million ) . <p> All of this calls for realism about what can be achieved here , but does n't  justify despair . Afghanistan is not about to fall to a revitalized Taliban . The capital , Kabul , can go weeks without an attack . Even with civilian casualties up 45 percent over the last year , they 're still half the current level in post-surge Iraq , and Afghanistan has a larger population . <p> Yet Afghanistan is n't susceptible to quick fixes , either . Scaling back our commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets risks a generalized collapse that would make much of the country a safe haven for terrorists and empower the extremists across the border threatening the Pakistani government . A regional meltdown would become all too possible . <p> Reconciling with elements of the Taliban is another fantasy , since there are no moderate Taliban with whom to reconcile . Less-committed local fighters can be pulled away from the insurgency , but only if the insurgency is first beaten back . <p> No , the only way we can succeed in Afghanistan i.e. , create a government minimally competent and decent enough to sustain itself is by undertaking the hard work of counter-insurgency , as we did in Iraq with the surge . <p> That means deploying the troops necessary to protect the population and either forcing extremists to fight ( and be killed or captured ) or to flee . It means continuing to build the Afghan National Army , the nations most respected institution .

But the implicit message from American commanders is that the Afghan war has n't  failed , it has n't  truly been tried . <p> US commanders are confident that the Taliban does n't  have much inherent popular appeal ( opinion surveys bear them out ) and that widespread war-weariness makes the establishment of order possible . <p> Afghanistan is n't the inevitably ungovernable basket-case of popular imagination . It enjoyed relative stability through much of the 20th century , before its agony commenced in the late 1970s . <p> But nothing will be possible without a fight .

My wife is going to drive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maine to finish the Appalachian Trail . Then my wife , who is very nice lady as you can tell , she is going to drive to Maine to pick me up . Then she will drive me back to Missouri , and I will immediately hike the Ozark Trail . I am not going to take any breaks . I am not even going to spend the night in my house . <h> So , this will not be a solo thru-hike ? <p> I am going to be solo on the Appalachian Trail . When I am in Missouri , I had planned on being solo . However , there are people who said , " Hey , I will come hike two days with you . " I had a guy yesterday on Facebook who offered to hike the entire Ozark Trail with me . He said , " I was already planning on hiking it in March , but now that I hear about this great cause , I will wait until you get back . " I 've never met that guy , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have more company . <p> McLaughlin soaking up the scenery on his charity hike. - <h> What is your hiking experience ? <p> Until I decided to do this ? Very little . The most I 've ever hiked was 40 miles over a weekend . <p> I have been training for this for a few months now . The Mastodon State Park in Imperial , Mo. , has one trail in particular that is straight uphill and then downhill . It is about 2.25 miles . My wife said that this was the best trail that simulated the uphill and downhill trials of the Appalachian Trail . So , I have hiked that trail so many times . I will get my pack and all my gear just as if I 'm on the real trip to simulate the actual experience of the hike . <h> Has training for this hike had an impact on your daily life ? <p> At the beginning , I weighed 233.6 pounds and now I weigh 210 pounds . I 've lost quite a bit of weight . I have changed my diet , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more salads . I guess it has been like two and half months . I just have had rapid weight loss . <p> I have also been sleeping in the woods behind my house in my hammock . I am going to use a hammock instead of a tent . And I have been sleeping in there just to get used to the idea of using it . There was even one night a couple weeks ago where it got really cold " it was a low of 16 with a wind chill of 4 . It was one of the coldest nights we 've had . My wife said , " Are you sure you want to go out there ? " I said , " If I ca n't deal with it now , what am I going to do out on the trail ? " Nothing I do now is going to prepare me for the real experience , but I am doing my best to get ready for that . <h> What gear do you plan to bring along ? <p> My backpack is from REI , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have a set of Vasque hiking boots . They are specifically called Vasque Breeze , and- they 've got Vibram soles , Gore-Tex lining and everything . My wife picked them out . I 've got a rain jacket and a skirt . Since I am going to have gators , my wife said I do n't  really need rain pants . So I got this rain skirt that is really lightweight . <p> In terms of my house , I am going to be using a hammock . I am going to use is the Warbonnet Blackbird Hammock . When there are wintery conditions , I have an underquilt that is also from Warbonnet . Its called the Yeti , and its supposed to keep you warm down to like zero degrees . The underquilt is something that I have in the bottom of the hammock . It is made out of down . Inside the hammock , I was going to originally bring a Marmot sleeping bag , but I have decided against it because I am really going to go lightweight . <p> McLaughlin shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How heavy will your pack be ? <p> My pack is going to weigh in the neighborhood of 20 to 22 pounds , including food for four days . Instead of the Marmot sleeping bag , I decided to go with the top quilt , which is a sleeping bag with no zipper and is open on one side . When you use a sleeping bag , your body weight compresses whatever it is sitting on . So it will compress the down and then the bottom of you is n't getting much insulation . So , why do we need that part ? That 's why the top quilt is open on one side . It is almost like a blanket . <p> I am also going to use the Warbonnet Super Fly . Basically it is more than a tarp . It almost makes the hammock look like a tent . It makes it so the hammock will not get wet if it rains , and that you can get out of the hammock and not get rained on . I can get out of the hammock , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . My hammock is 29 ounces , and my top quilt is 30 ounces . <h> At this point of your training , do you feel pretty prepared ? <p> All my life experiences , as bad as they were , they kind of helped prepare me for this hike . My wife has told me about people who have quit the trail . She said that people just have a hard time outside night after night . I said , " Well , that 's kind of an advantage for me because that used to be my life . " I used to be homeless and stuff . In a way those experiences made me who I am today , and they helped prepare for this . I know I can live outside for six months because Ive done it before . And I know I can go without creature comforts because I know I can eat the same food day after day , and I can deal with all of that hardship . <p> One of the most recent pics of McLaughlin he took after hiking 10 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think you will gain from this experience ? <p> I really think that by spending so much time alone , it is really going to help me figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life . I have an idea . I have lots of things I am working on , and I have plans . But to spend that much time just in the woods , I 'm really going to have a lot of time to think about who I am , what I stand for and what I want to do with the next 30 years before I retire . <p> I am really looking forward to a peaceful hike . Sure , it will be a pain in the butt , and my knees will ache . At the same time , I will get a lot of time to think about my life and my plans for the rest of it . When I come back , I will be centered , and I will probably be in the best shape of my life . I also think mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be an adventure . It is going to be one of the adventures of my life . I will remember all the days when it was raining , and I pushed on . I am going to be really proud of it and cherish this memory <p> UPDATE : McLaughlin- sent us an update saying : " I 'm very close to the halfway point at Harpers Ferry . I 'm so excited ! . " Were also excited for him ! We were curious to see how the journey was going and asked him a few more questions. - <h> What 's been your biggest challenge so far ? <p> Ankle problems. - I sprained my left ankle twice in the first few weeks of the hike. - It hurt both times but the pain the second time was excruciating. - I tried several ankle braces but none of them prevented my ankle from rolling when I stepped on rocks or tree roots. - It was very dispiriting as I constantly worried about spraining or breaking my ankle. - I eventually got an Aircast and havent had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most memorable moment ? <p> Tough call. - I think about the night I hiked into Mountaineer Shelter a lot. - I hiked 24 miles and spent at least an hour hiking in the dark. - There was a thunderstorm so lightning would occasionally light up the forest around me , which was kind of eery. - When I finally reached the shelter , people were shocked that I had continued hiking through those conditions. - Many people are afraid to hike alone at night , much less during a storm , so they were really impressed and very kind toward me . <p> To track McLaughlins- progress , be sure to check out his Facebook page .

@@96509884 @709884/ <p> So , can- enemies- really hear it when you pop open a hook-and-loop-sealed pocket ? Should manufacturers mirror the Vertx tactical pants and do away with it all together ? Should it be replaced with magnets ? Or do you even notice that crinkling noise ? <p> We want to know what you think . Take our readers poll below . Final results will be posted next week ! <h> 6 Comments on " Readers Poll : Is Velcro Too Noisy ? " <p> I am a sniper for NYPD . Last week when we were on a stake out , it was getting close to 3 hours of extreme focus on an open window about 25 feet away . The order was to take the guy down if he went to open a drawer in a cabinet at the back of the room . His AK47 was in there . Suddenly the street light was shining off the top of something in my SNIP-EZE tactical pants side cargo pockets . Damn , it was a donut . Of all the days to find a spare donut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way I could get the velcro undone to get at the little bastard in the pocket . I thought about trying to undo it one little velcro hook at a time , but each little hook opening sounded like Little Bills whip crack I swear . I rammed my finger right into the donut and got some of the sweet doughy goodness on my finger without disturbing the velcro . After a few plunges it became out of reach . By this time I was starting to panic and hyperventilate . I had to have it . I knew that I had a pair of scissors in my jacket and that I could cut the pocket off my pants and get to the donut . I just bought these pants last week on Ebay . Brand new $180 , $50 cheaper than the local Copstore , so I had to think about whether it was worth damaging the pants for but , hey , a donut is a donut . Right , I grabbed my jacket and reached for the pocket I knew the scissors were in . Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place too . And these hooks sounded like a steamroller running over some bubble wrap . What the hell am I going to do . Anyway , I swear that I saw , out of the corner of my eye , the guy in the room was heading for the cabinet with the AK in it . He grabbed the drawer handle so I put 3 shots in his head before he heard my gun go off . Man , that was the sweetest donut I ever tasted . It went down like a velvety milk shake . Incidentally , it was just the regular , Krispy Kreme glazed donut . I had sneaked it into my pocket when I was in the Sergeants office this morning . He had 4 left of his morning dozen and I was sure he would n't miss one . By the way , the guy in the room was found lying on the floor , with the contents of the drawer he was opening , all over him . That was where he kept the donuts , baked goods and cookies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hostage told us that he had just offered her some coffee and donuts and was going to let her go in 5 minutes . Oh well , you win some you lose some . It could have so easily turned out bad . Later <p> For a city cop who uses either an inside outside vest carrier velcro is great for securing the vest to your chest . But buckles in tandem with velcro are good for backup when you are wrestling with someone . <p> However for during shift work , the times an officer needs to be tactical you have to think about what he is going to need and out of which pockets is he going to get what he needs . <p> Example would be he may need to pull out a pair of leather gloves to go hands on with someone , however he is less likely to need to pull out his latex gloves . <p> If he is running to a car to cut a seatbelt off of someone when a vehicle is smoking , he does not need to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just wants to knife to be secure in a velcro style pocket but easy to get too when needed . <p> Without trying to type more examples , a good rule would be someone pockets are great for having velcro because they secure then items inside very well and they are easy to access . Other items needed in tactical situations it would be much better to have either just a normal pocket or maybe a button pocket . <p> Brand spanking new Velcro that is 4x bigger than it needs to be , like the angled chest pockets or shoulder pockets on ACU/TRUs or LAPG tac pants , is too loud . Well designed and placed velcro like 5.11 &amp; Tru-Spec pants and most of my Condor MOLLE gear strike a good balance with reduced complexity and weight . I will take a bit of noise over fumbling buttons , or two handed snaps or zippers . <p> Its only too noisy if you need to get at that candy bar in your pocket when the bad guys are right around the corner . Or better yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool new " haji do n't  surf " morale patch out on the airsoft field .

Hints of those past styles can be seen in the outdoor footwear specialists new line for spring 2012 . <p> The Talus WP is an update to a waterproof boot that still emanates that old-world hiking vibe . With details like leather eyelets and no toe cap , the new Talus is much more lightweight and durable . Its nubuck leather is fully waterproof to keep out any unwanted moisture you might meet on the trail . <p> At Outdoor Retailer 2011 , we spoke with Jay Kovacs , Vasque product development manager , about the upcoming style . In addition to the boots lightweight appeal , he also mentioned the boots aggressive tread and traction . <p> " The most important part about this boot is the call back to our heritage , " Kovacs said .

Of late we have heard much on the common symptoms of Post-traumatic- Stress Disorder or PTSD in the media and the soldier or veteran , you wo n't hear me talk about that much . I deal mostly in the chronic nature of Combat PTSD and its many flavors and identities as it relates to me. - I 'm all about talking about the mental , physical , social and spiritual aspects of where going to combat can take us . <p> Along with the mental health issues where I perform the equivalence- of- aerial- acrobatics- in a paper airplane with an- elephant- pilot .

Or I get to be first again , leading the way with taking new- medications- where hundreds of thousands of veterans will go ! <p> The year 2011 was a year of grieving and mourning ; I went into an inpatient PTSD program in Memphis , TN . Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) is a- tremendous- tool I was able to learn and apply to novel ways of processing my war trauma . Long story short , I was able to reconcile and mourn 5 marine deaths . In doing so it unblocked a flood of mourning for my grandmother , mother , father and friends who had died since 1991 . The year 2011 was the year I took my soul back . <p> Other symptoms of the Combat PTSD Veteran ?

However , it did n't  seem to get any better . Glad to see that CPT worked for a fellow veteran . <p> The media has really been focusing on PTSD lately in a bad way and automatically labeling any veteran coming back from Iraq and or Afghanistan as a threat . With the last two recent OIF veterans committing murder(s) and a number of Marines video taping disturbing activities involving detainees , I see the media reporting more on PTSD in a negative light . Its nice to finally read some positive progress others have made . <p> I also suffer from acid re-flux and chronic bowel problems . I 'm taking two pills daily for the acid re-flux , which the VA refuses to acknowledge medically other than sending me pills for it .

Have a wonderful day &amp; may gods peace be with you .. <p> Thank you , the media reinforces the stereotypes we battle everyday , it profoundly effects whether we seek help or kill ourselves .

Instead of making us feel guilty for fast-food stops and lethargic behavior , some pants manufacturers are feeding into this behavior . <p> Since North America does n't  enforce U.S. standard clothing sizes , those who produce clothes can easily fluctuate sizes as they see fit . This made us wonder : Have tactical pants manufacturers followed this very trend ? <p> We took a cloth measuring tape , slung it around our neck like a tailor and made our way out to the warehouse .

Moreover both 5.11 Tactical and Genuine Gear sizes were dead-on . The only sizing we found incredibly interesting was Woolrichs , which turned out to be 1.5 inches smaller . We attribute this to its mostly elastic waistband that proved difficult to measure . Plus the pants stretch significantly when worn . <p> The only pants that truly appear to suffer from vanity sizing are 24-7 Series mens and womens pants . Both were bigger than average . Perhaps this is why their womens pants are so popular ? <p> Either way , tactical pants have n't fallen prey to inflated sizing . At least not yet . When compared to various brands out there , they might be the most honest pants around .

Its something sought after by long-distance hikers and runners worldwide . Its also something to which Jeff Brown has dedicated his life . <p> Its an idea that sounds both futuristic and insane . Yet two decades ago Brown decided to implant powerful magnets in boot heels as a way to reduce heel strike . He believes this technology will keep soldiers on their feet for longer periods with less physical strain . <p> He said his prototype - DAMPS Technology Smart Boots - have been tested during combat by Special Operation Forces- in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan . Last week he answered some questions for us via e-mail about his dedication to the technology behind magnetic boot heels . <p> In a proprietary advanced suspension/propulsion design , the like poles of DAMPS super magnets repel each other . These magnets are 30 times more powerful than your typical refrigerator magnets . That means soldiers are walking on the magnet polarity field created by these super magnets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Instead of hitting the ground at two to three times your body weight per square inch , DAMPS reduces that impact by 68 percent . Heel strike injury , plantar fasciitis , is the No. 1 injury seen by podiatrists . <p> In addition in normal walking gait , the DAMPS suspension systems actually adds real time propulsion , as the system returns to the starting unloaded force position . <p> When will your technology be picked up by mainstream manufacturer ? <p> Jeff Brown and his magnetic boots <p> We are talking to and reviewing several companies for DAMPS Technology licensing partners . <p> Will our soldiers ever wear this technology ? <p> Most definitely . Our soldiers , in fact anyone who has ever had an opportunity to wear DAMPS Smart Boots , have told us : " When you build it , we will come . " <p> What made you think magnets would work ? <p> I did n't  at first . But after 22 years and 20 prototypes , we have the finest shock mitigation technology boots the world has ever seen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny thing is your body- adjusts to the boots . And you are reminded when you take the boots off how hard the ground really is . <p> How did you think to use them to begin with ? <p> I was in a motorcycle accident in 1988 and was laid up for nearly a year . In a weekly brain storming session with my brother , we saw a marketing angle for using magnets in footwear . Two decades , 80 investors a five-year legal battle with Adidas , a three-year battle with General Motors and 20 prototypes later , we have a one of a kind technology that allows soldiers , anyone , to walk 10 miles and save the shock of 7 miles . I am working on a movie script re the 20 year story of making DAMPS . Working title : Shoe Grit . <p> How is it proven to work ? <p> We call it " the DAMPS One Step Difference . " Ask SORSE ( Special Operations Research Development Test and Evaluation ) . They used and evaluated the boots for nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both fast rope them and conduct a HALO jump with them in the last two months . The evaluation said the boots were excellent for field wear , especially while under heavy loads . <p> No doubt ! I know with all the marketing out there it can get a little confusing , but DAMPS is the real deal. - In fact , I have a standing offer to the footwear industry . If someone can beat DAMPS Technology shock mitigation , I will eat my boots . I not only stand behind my product , I stand on it . The world will follow because the world follows the best . <p> I have had extensive foot reconstruction on both feet . I walk , but not without a lot of pain in the metatarsal areas , and my lower back and hips are starting to feel the damage .

I 'm 46 and have been dealing with the stresses for 30 years , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself as a test case ! <p> Good question . In an overload event , i.e. a soldier jumps off a roof , the DAMPS suspension/propulsion system compresses to a conventional composite outsole at max load . Please note that the advanced shock mitigation benefits are still realized during and up to those max overload events . In addition our proprietary outsole material has the highest resilience of any boot outsole material I am aware of , currently on the market . If one would drop our DAMPS Smart Boot outsole by itself , it will bounce .

After I put them on and got to wear them for a while , I realized these werent like other pants . As a graduate of New Mexico Military Institute , I spent quite some time in the U.S. militarys version of tactical pants . <p> U.S. mil-spec BDUs do not measure up to the 5.11s . <p> The first thing that I noticed was the cut of the pants . They are not long in the crotch . This was a problem with standard BDUs . These pants are cut just right for a woman who has any kind of shape and likes to do heavy ass-kicking . Even with a small torso , the 5.11s do n't  come too high up my waist . <p> Comfort is my biggest thing , and these pants are comfortable . They fit better on me than even the new BDUs the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.11s hold up to the DS-Girl challenge . This winter they have kept me nice and warm . I would say , if you have to do a night mission in cold weather , you might need some thermals to ensure you do n't  get cold . But the 5.11s are 100-percent cotton , so they keep the temperature right . Under BDUs , you always need an extra layer to stay warm . <p> Women 's 5.11 Tactical Pants <p> The reinforced crotch and knees of the 5-11s make them nice and durable . I can even do Aikido technique in these pants . They move , they stretch , but they do n't  stretch out . They also are n't  bulky , so things like having to drive a car with speed and skill , or ride a dirt bike through the desert , are n't  hindered by the 5.11s . The best part is that ass-kicking ability is not hindered . <p> I feel like a hot chick with these pants . How often can you say that about tactical pants ? My butt looks great in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit a woman . I just recently got a set of the new mil-spec BDUs . They suck " and are taking up room on a shelf " where they will stay until the sun flames out , or I stop at the Goodwill . I am not happy with the way they fit . <p> The 5.11s have the hip room that the BDUs do n't  . They look better and feel better than a lot of pants Ive worn . The 5.11 tactical pants are a great pair of pants . I would recommend them to any woman who kicks ass on a daily basis . If you want to look like a girl , feel sexy and still be comfortable " and tactical " then the 5.11s are the pants you need . <h> 2 Comments on " Review : Womens 5.11 Tactical Pants " <p> I 've tried the " new " womens version and could n't disagree more about the fit being great . I 'm 59 ? and have a longer rise . The old style used to sit at my waist " where it should for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style was the pegged legs , so ankle holsters were not an option . The new , slightly flared leg is good , but the rise is entirely too short . For shorter stature women , this is probably a good thing considering there had been complaints the old style fit like mom jeans . While I understand this complaint , when manufacturers shorten the rise , they make it impossible for taller women to wear them . You can always tailor the rise to shorten it , but you cant add to a short rise . And remember , these are " tactical " pants " its not about how great your butt looks in em . Its about their functionality and 5.11 is putting fashion over functionbut , alas , they 're not the only ones . <p> We FINALLY got the womens 5.11 BDU pants up here in Canada ( rip stop material ) and they fit like a dream . <p> Now I 'm waiting for them to make the womens uniform in the summer weight material , as the guys I work with have the summer weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever worn .

As you know , the guns of that battle had to be charged and loaded separately . More than 12,000 muskets ( out of 27,500 recovered ) contained two charges in them . Another 6,000 contained between 3 and 10 charges . There was even one rifle found stuffed with 23 charges .

Not only that , but for two hours prior to the charge ( called " Picketts Charge " after the General who led three of the nine brigades ) both sides hammered each other with cannon and artillery fire .

@@96509931 @709931/ <p> During the interview , Costa- described- a " perfect storm " that led to the $10 price increase of 5.11 Tactical pants . Why did prices increase ? Costa mentioned a combination of reasons , including the rising cost of oil , cotton , labor and the dollars declining exchange rate in the world economy . <p> DC : Weve had the same price on our product for the last 10 years . Weve seen price increases continue , but weve always figured out how to offset that by creating new products in our line and new categories to keep the prices in line . What happened this time is like the perfect storm . <p> First of all , you 've got oil . Oil prices are up , so transportation costs are high . All of our goods come from the Far East , so that 's a big trip and a lot of gas . The other thing is a lot of the products are made with oil . The nylon products are oil based and so are the shoes . <p> Secondly you have the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , and it used to be 50 cents a pound like a year and a half ago . So , the fabric price is up " the cotton crop was bad , the planting of the cotton was low and the consumption was high . <p> And then there is another thing that was thrown in , and this is like a two-edge sword . Asia is so big , and so powerful that they can kind of move markets when they want to . So they either buy up the commodity , or they do n't  allow that commodity to come into that country . Like they would n't allow India to import cotton into China , so that created a price increase on the product you could use in China . Well , that 's where the sewing was done . So they raised the price of their own cotton because they are so big , they could do that . <p> 5.11 Tactical Pants <p> And then there 's the second edge to that sword , and that is Asia again . A good example is Taiwan . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 15 of the top shoe manufacturers in the world , they are all Taiwanese . Their factories are not in Taiwan ; their factories are in mostly China and are moving out of China and into other countries . But they all started in Taiwan , and for some reason , Taiwan just became the shoe guy . Then they went to China because the labor in Taiwan became too expensive . Taiwan got more educated ; they started making computers , and they started making software . The jobs paid more , and they were better jobs . Instead of working in a hot shoe factory , you are in an air conditioned lab " and you get paid twice as much . All the workers moved over to the computer companies and did n't  want to make shoes anymore . The shoe companies moved to China . <p> So , the same thing just keeps happening in the garment industry . It just kind of hopscotches from third-world countries that need the jobs . When that labor moves and people do n't  want to do that type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else where jobs are needed . Now the product is moving further east . And then you have the dollar versus the Chinese Renminbi . There is an imbalance in the dollar as well . <p> So you 've have the dollar , you 've have labor that went up in price , and the labor that is moving . Youve have the price of the materials , and you 've got the price of the transportation of those materials . Nothing else could come into play . The only other thing that could come into play I do n't even know what that could be . I do n't  know how it could get any worse . <p> TGB:Were there any other options explored before you decided to make a price increase ? <p> DC : Well , our only other option would be to lessen the quality . We would have to cut back on the weight of the fabric , go to B-class factories for better pricing or cut the amount of stitches . That 's not even an option for us . Again , when we look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durability I mean we were selling 5.11 TacLite and tactical shirts for $39.99 . If Patagonia was selling that shirt , it would be $80 . And we were selling it for $39 . <p> TGB:What has customer feedback been like so far ? <p> DC : The customer knows . The customer understands . The customer reads the paper and sees what 's going on with oil prices , cotton and labor . I think we have a pretty good trust factor with our customers at 5.11 . When we talk to our customers , many of them said , " I was wondering how long you could sell your pants and your shirt for $39 " it just seems so inexpensive . " Sometimes we even have customers in other parts of the world saying , " You know , you should raise your prices because I think people think your quality is poor because your prices are so low . " <p> We work on a certain margin , and we try to keep that very tight because our law enforcement customer and our public safety customer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to keep those prices intact . We have a mission statement : We make product that exceeds the needs of our customer for function , innovation and durability , and we deliver it to them at a value . That does n't  mean a low price . That means a value . <p> TGB:Is this the first time 5.11 has raised prices on the original 5.11 Tactical Pants ? <p> DC : When I bought the company in 2000 , the 5.11 Tactical Pants were $60 at Royal Robbins . I decreased the price to $39.99 because we sourced the product better , we bought more fabrics , and we did more things to get the product priced lower " mainly just eliminated a lot of the middlemen they were using in Asia . We opened our own offices in Asia . Rather to pay people to do it , we did it ourselves . We decreased our prices from $60 to $39 , and its been $39 since . <p> TGB:Twenty-five percent is a rather significant price increase . How do you think the market will react ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November or December , and we just got back from a big trade show and made sure all the consumers knew that prices were going up . And again , most of them looked at us and said , " Hey look , Im surprised you are able to keep the price the way you have been . " <p> TGB:Whats the reasoning behind a $5 difference , as opposed to the standard $10 difference , between MAP and MSRP on tactical pants ? <p> DC : Again , I think the goal was to keep the prices as close as possible " give the consumer the price that they need . Its all about the consumer for us . If we take care of the customer , and we have that loyalty and that trust between us and the end-user , then we really do n't  have to worry about anything else . If we take care of our customers , our customers will take care of us . <p> TGB:Are you concerned with undermining your wholesale business by having such a minimal difference between MAP and MSRP ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges MAP . I think MSRP is kind of like out there . It probably means more outside of the United States than inside . Duties and tariffs outside of the United States are really the reason for MSRP . The people in Europe will charge MSRP instead of MAP . <p> TGB:You sell your products at MSRP on your official website . <p> DC : Thats right . We are always above the retail price . If someone has to get the product , like tomorrow , we have so many products . There is n't a dealer anywhere that has what we have . We have $40 million worth of inventory " every size and every color . If someone needs a size triple-X OD green tac vest , and they need it tomorrow because they are going to the Middle East , they know they can get it . <p> For them to pay $5 more or $10 more , they are OK with that . We need to offer that to our customer . That is why we have our website , and that 's why those prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do take care of our dealers . On the other hand , we need to make sure we do n't  forget the hand that feeds us " and that 's our consumers . <p> TGB:With the difference between MAP and MSPR on tactical pants cut in half , is this a new strategy to do more online business on your website ? <p> DC : No . Our online business as a percentage is a little bit less than it was in the years past . I think that is because of the broad distribution of 5.11 . You can get 5.11 online now at so many good retailers , and they are holding lots of inventory . Many of our big dealers have tons of 5.11 inventory , so that decreases the need for consumers to have to fall back on 5.11s website for those items . <p> We are actually doing less business online ourselves as a company than we were in the past , which is fine with us because that is not the biggest part of our business . We do very small percentages in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is going crazy . I would say anybody who sells 5.11 online " its their largest product they sell . <p> TGB:Not to name names , but there are certain dealers like LA Police Gear who have introduced private label tactical pants to the market . They are 5.11 dealers who have made a name for themselves by selling your product . Does it bother you to see this type of activity ? <p> DC : I think it was good that they did it because they found out it was n't that easy . In fact , now they are not making the pants anymore . LA Police Gear just purchased massive amounts of 5.11 pants in huge bulk buys , and they are discontinuing their private label pant because of inconsistency , fit issues and delivery issues . Actually , they cant even get the goods right now . They cant even get a factory to make their product . <p> Making a garment is not easy . Making something that fits well , forms well " they just do n't  pop out of a bag . Youve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality control measures , factories you have to make sure the fabric is coming from the same mills and the same partners . I think Sean at LA Police Gear found out that it was n't all a bowl of cherries out there . He came back to us not too long ago and said , " OK , Im done with this . I 'm ready to buy more 5.11 because everything I bring in , I sell like crazy . So , I am just going to bring in more of it . " <p> TGB:Thats a huge compliment to you guys , because you make it look that easy . <p> DC : We actually helped him with his private label in the beginning to make sure that he did n't  get hurt , and I think it was great that he learned its not what they should be doing . He said , " Our focus is selling products and selling brands , and that 's what we are going to stick to . " <p> TGB:Do you foresee other manufacturers changing their prices as well ? <p> DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are doing research on price increases , go online to Nike . Its impossible that prices wont go up with the perfect storm we just talked about . <p> It would be different if cotton prices just went from $50 to $65 or $70 , and that if they were going to go back down to $50 when the crop comes out . This is not that . This is a five-star perfect storm . All the stars have lined up on this one . Nobody is able to absorb these increases . <p> TGB:Do you think the price will ever decrease ? <p> DC : I do n't  know . I do n't  know what 's going on in the world . I see what 's happening in the Middle East with oil , and oil might even get crazier . I mean , I would say there is a better chance of the prices going higher than lower in this world today . There is a better chance that a year or two from now , the prices would be even higher than lower . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells me it could decrease . There are lots of things that tell me it could happen the other way . <p> TGB:Word on the street is that 5.11 is going public . Can you confirm , deny or even discuss this ? <p> DC : 5.11 has many options because of our growth and expansion worldwide . I 'm not sure which avenues well take , but it will be interesting to see what happens . Nothing will happen in the next year because we have too much growth in our international business to finish first . <p> TGB:Does this price adjustment factor into 5.11s potential IPO ? <p> DC : No , that would not affect it at all . <p> TGB:What has it been like at 5.11 since the private equity firm made the acquisition ? <p> DC : Its been great . Its been interesting . For me , I 've always owned my own company . When we went to market 5.11 , we put the company out to bid , and we had 100 companies bid on 5.11 . As they were interviewing us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily picked us . Its a private equity company that has been around 40 years based in London , Boston and San Francisco . The people we deal with , the lead partner , its the only job he s ever had . For me , its been a great learning experience . They appreciate how hard we work for them as a company . Its been a very good , strong relationship . Its been great for 5.11s growth . <p> When we did the deal with TA Associates in 2007 , we were doing about $80 million in sales . This year our budget is to do over $200 million . So , they are quite happy , and so are we . They have a company that kind of runs itself . Other than board meetings , I really do n't  ever see them or talk to them . Its pretty much business as normal . If you were an employee at 5.11 in Modesto , and you were working in design or the warehouse or accounting , you would have never known the company has exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TGB:Is it affecting the strategic direction of 5.11 ? <p> DC : No . We create the direction , and we are deciding the path and the future . As long as we take it from $80 to $200 in that amount of time , they are sitting back saying , " Hey , this is working out just fine . " I would imagine if we were taking it from $80 to $60 , thered be some direction . <h> 5 Comments on " Exclusive Interview : 5.11 Tactical CEO Dan Costa " <p> Dan Costa tells it like it is . Clothing is going up in price . 5.11 had held the price on their pants for years . They have no choice but to keep their prices in line with costs . Competing brands will also go up . 5.11 products are still a good value . 
@@96509934 @709934/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Jakson Adams Is A Fraud <p> Ive been writing about the military dating scams for far too long . Far too long . I 've recently decided to stop just talking about it and actually get involved . I have a little extra time on my hands since I 'm alone in this here garage for a few months . <p> So , I 've started to converse with these morons . Interestingly , they 're starting to disappear . Its amazing what happens when you challenge them . The key is to stick to one of just three questions to assure yourself that the person you 're talking to is a fraud : <p> 1 . What is your AKO ? 2 . What unit are you in ? 3 . Send me a picture of you holding a sign with a heart around my name ( for the ladies ) . <p> That first question is the kicker . I asked one guy to tell me his AKO and he sent me his first name . I asked him what that was and he said his user name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unit one is fun if you know anything about the military , but if you 're not in the military do some research if he answers that . Its not hard to figure out if the unit he claims to be in is actually deployed ( as most of the these scammers claim to be ) . <p> One such guy Ive been messing with lately scams women by the name of " Jakson Adams , " a Soldier who does n't  exist by the way . I traced his IP back to Africa and asked him about that . <p> Hello CJ , I still defend my self and you don , t know anything about me. stop saying what you don , t know and don , t think you can put me to fear . I am who i am as i stated , and stop talking rubbish . You said i should , t contact the ladies again and i think you must come and get me rather than wasting your time over where you are . I reply this mail to you because i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major indicator of a scam . Very few Soldiers type as bad as EVERY SINGLE one of these scammers does . So , I asked two simple questions : What is your AKO and what do you do in the Army ? His response ? " I don , t have time for you . " That was cut and paste by the way , comma and all . I explained to him that if he did n't  answer these simple questions that the good " Jakson Adams " would be exposed as a fake . He did n't  seem to care much . <p> Tell everyone that am fake . I don , t have time to prove my self to you . If i do what will i gain by wasting my time to prove who i am . I have a lot to do and please tell everyone that am fake because that is your job . try and contact name deleted to protect victims to send you my picture so you can past it at all the dating site including my name . i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anymore because i will not reply . i have giving you the go ahead and do what ever . <p> Well , " Jakson Adams " did provide some pictures that he most likely got from elsewhere on the internet . I 'll publish those at the end of this post , but first my continued pressing into who this dude is . <p> You will just change your name to another fake Soldiers name . You just wasted more time not telling me what unit you are in . The picture you sent Trish is not you , it is a REAL Soldier . Someone worthy to wear the uniform . Someone who is n't a criminal panty waste who does n't  get scared from his own shadow like you are . Why is your email coming from Africa if you 're an American ? Can you explain that to me ? That seems weird ! ! Oh wait , you ARE NT an American . <p> When you change names , I will find you again and post that name . You will change again and I will post it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your IP address and find you wherever you go ! Maybe you should just start finding real ways to make money by actually working for a change . You can start by cleaning up elephant poop . <p> Hehe , I said elephant poop . He did n't  like it , either . <p> You are a fool to tell me to start cleaning up elephant poop . I can see you don , t have anything better to do . Just write back to me and let me know the kind of job you will like to do . I said this because you are always on you computer doing nothing and i suggest you need a job . waiting <p> Well , you know me . I 'm not one to leave a good scammer waiting . He has a lot of women to get to and no time to be waiting around on me . <p> Me : I 'm in the army , unlike you . " Jakson Adams " : So you think i don , t know who is written to me ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah , you 're a great pretender . Like when you pretend to be a soldier . <p> For some reason , I have n't heard from him since . The same goes for " Christain Browning " that I was talking with for a LONG time on Yahoo Messenger who also " didn , t have time for me " when I continued to press for his AKO . He has oddly disappeared from Yahoo as well . Here are the photos of " Jakson Adams " being circulated among various women . <p> Now , " Jakson , " if you 're a real Soldier , I challenge you to leave a comment to this post and prove me wrong . I 'd hold my breath , but I 'm not ready to beat the crap out of Murthas hellbound soul just yet . <p> Now as for the photos , a dead giveaway that they 've been stolen from another persons blog or Facebook page is the size of the images . Typically , they wont be bigger than about 130kb , the size that most Facebook photos are edited to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them contact me . <p> Has anyone had dealings with a Sgt George Paul Reynold suppose to be in Eggers camp , Kabul , Afghanistan . Divorced with one Son called Daniel x wife is supposed to be living in Texas . I ave been chatting to him for 6 weeks and yes I 've sent money but I 'm having massive doubts . <p> As ashamed as I am to admit I was scammed by this FOOL who turned me into an idiot . I do n't  consider myself a stupid person and somewhat cautious and very leary . David Wagner contacted me through facebook and I never thought a thing about it . It was just a friend request . As a friend I would chat with him and his words would play with my mind and my heart . Being in the gullible state that by the way I did n't  realize I was in I fell in love with the words thoughts and the idea that somebody out there LOVED ME . And call me STUPID , INSANE , or anything else you want but never being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got swept totally off my feet . His story was good and believable . Everything he told me matched with what I was hearing on the news . I did send him money amount not disclosed . He needed just $XX to have enough to get his plane ticket to come home to ME . Once he got that money it was n't enough he needed $XX more which by the way I did not send but probably would have if my best friend had n't  found this site and warned me . Thank you for your wisdom and may God forgive these people for the pain they are causing . <p> Jackson Adams has created a new identity . They stole pictures from a white man who lives in Denver , Co and South Africa . He contacted me on a dating site and we have emailed each other . Once he got my email address they removed the profile off of the site . The story that is used now is that he is a widow his wife died from cancer and he he has two kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emails are horrible and are cut and paste .. I did my own research and found the name Jackson Adams and found him on a dating scammer site with the same pics and emails he sent to me . I am not an idiot I will not be involved with or communicate with someone who is shadey . <p> Hello Everyone , I just have been in this scam situation on Facebook , but thank God I find out on time . But they have my name and address an a copy of my passport . But I did n't  send them any money . He is on facebook now with the name of Harrison Walter , Medical assistant in Afghanistan . these guys are really something . I hope there is someone out their that can stop them , they are playing with peoples feelings and are not afraid either in using GODs name for promise love and marriage to the ladies . <p> I 've posted here many times . My name is Gordon and I 'm an active-duty Army officer . Pictures of me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April , a new opportunity arose to combat the SCAMMERS . An editor from Glamour Magazine in New York City contacted me and asked for an interview . Needless to say , I jumped at the chance . The resulting article was published in the October 2012 edition of the magazine . I 'd encourage everyone to buy the magazine or read the article on-line through a link that I 'll post below . Hopefully , the story will she 'd more light on this under-reported crime . <p> I 'm an active-duty U.S. Army Soldier . Photos of me have been used by scammers since 2006 when they were downloaded from the Webshots website . I did n't realize the pics could be accessed by anyone in the world with an internet connection . In any case , I frequently search Facebook for people using my last name . The scammers are kind of stuck with that name since it 's on the name tags of my uniforms in the pictures . Today , I found these imposters on Facebook : <p> Each of them used a photo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Facebook and sent warning e-mails to each of their friends . Fortunately , they did n't have many . Hopefully , FB will delete their accounts soon . <p> Also on FB were CARL HANNETT and JAMES HANNETT . Neither of them had a profile picture , but each claimed to be in the US Army . I can tell you that neither of them is in the Army . There are VERY few Hannetts in the Army . The criminals read these posts , so I wo n't say anything else about that . I wish I had time to prowl the dating websites for imposters , but I do n't . Be careful and DO N'T SEND MONEY TO PEOPLE YOU DO N'T KNOW ! ! ! <p> hello Gordon , i am stephani , i would like to talk with you about that , i know this man as paul williamsson and he told me that a scammer also use his pics they have stolen his pics from myspace , i really wan na talk with you and know all about this . thank you <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with a scammer I also told you to go to scamwarners.com and romancescam.com for support hello what more do you need he has asked you for MONEY for a flight from DUBAI what do you not understand HE ASKED you for MONEY he is a scammer you can ask GOD to check him out but either way you look at it he is a SCAMMER and not only that he s given you a fake Name one he made up have you seen him on webcam a CLEAR view of him was there an interactive chat did you ask him questions did he stand up a scammer will never do that he will try some prerecorded crap or he will make up an excuse as to why he cant get on cam I know you have fallen in love with the pics this Poser is using but you need to face the fact that he is a scammer if you have lost Money I 'm very sorry but please stop pushing this and educate yourself about scammers so this will not happen again you are in denial . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  really want to post my e-mail address here ( for all the world to see ) . I suppose I could create another e-mail account and send you the address . Ill look into doing that this afternoon . Ill post that e-mail address here shortly . <p> I 'm a little confused about your situation though . On May 16th , you made three posts to this blog . In one you said that you 've been talking to MICH PAUL WILLIAMSSON . In another , you said his name was PAUL WILLIAMSSON . In the third , you list his name as MITCH WILLIAMSSON . <p> yes at first he said Mitch Williamsson , later he said he has a second name paul Williamsson too also Mitch Pail Williamsson and he wrote me with the mail address as williamssoncollins her said that is his sons name sorry for the late response i was not on this site since . stephani <p> Thank You for the kind words and encouragement . and also for the info I posted it on his yahoo messenger and havent heard a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have a happy holiday and I pray for yor mans safe return <p> FORT BELVOIR , Va . ( March 23 , 2010 ) Special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are warning the American public to be vigilant of Internet scams and impersonation fraud especially those promising true love , but only end up breaking hearts and bank accounts . <p> According to Army agents , CID is receiving frequent reports of various scams involving persons pretending to be U.S. Soldiers , who get romantically involved on the Internet with female victims and prey on their emotions and patriotism . <p> Aca , ! A " We are seeing a number of scams being perpetrated on the internet , especially on social , dating-type websites where females are the main target , Aca , ! A ? explained Chris Grey , Army CIDAca , ! a , , cs spokesman . <p> The criminals are pretending to be U.S. servicemen , routinely serving in Iraq or Afghanistan . The perpetrators will often take the true rank and name of a Soldier who is honorably serving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some photographs of a Soldier off of the internet , and then build a false identity to begin prowling the internet for victims . <p> The scams often involve requests for money from the victim to purchase Aca , ! A " special laptop computers , Aca , ! A ? international telephones and transportation fees to be used by the Aca , ! A " deployed Soldier , Aca , ! A ? so their fictitious relationship can continue . The scams include asking the victim to send money , often thousands of dollars at a time , to a third party address so the phone or laptop can be purchased for the Soldier . <p> Once hooked , the criminals continue their ruse . <p> Aca , ! A " WeAca , ! a , , cve even seen instances where the perpetrators are asking the victims for money to Aca , ! A " purchase leave papersAca , ! A ? from the Army or help pay for their flight home so they can leave the war zone , Aca , ! A ? said Grey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grave misrepresentation of the U.S. Army and the tremendous amount of support programs and mechanisms that exist for Soldiers today , especially those serving overseas , said Grey . <p> Army CID is warning people to be very suspicious if they begin a relationship on the internet with someone claiming to be an American Soldier and within a matter of weeks , the alleged Soldier is asking for money or marriage . <p> Many of these cases have a distinct pattern to them , explained Grey . Aca , ! A " These are not Soldiers , they are thieves.Aca , ! A ? <p> The perpetrators often tell the victims that their units do not have telephones or they are not allowed to make calls or they need money to Aca , !

A " These perpetrators , often from other countries , most notably from Ghana , Angola and Nigeria , are good at what they do and quite familiar with American culture , but the claims about the Army and its regulations are ridiculous , Aca , ! A ? said Grey . <p> To date there have been no reports to Army CID indicating any U.S. servicemembers have suffered any financial loss as a result of these attacks . Photographs and actual names of servicemembers have been the only thing utilized . On the contrary , the victims have lost thousands . <p> The U.S. has established numerous task force organizations to deal with this and other growing issues ; unfortunately , the personnel committing these scams are utilizing untraceable email addresses on Aca , ! A " gmail , yahoo , aol , Aca , ! A ? etc. , routing accounts through numerous locations around the world , and utilizing pay-per-hour Internet cyber cafes , which often times maintain no accountability of use . The ability of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stay on the alert to protect themselves . <p> What to look for : <p> Aca , ! Ac If you do start an Internet-based relationship with someone , check them out , research what they are telling you with someone who would know , such as a current or former servicemember . <p> Aca , ! Ac Be very suspicious if you never get to actually speak with the person on the phone or are told you can not write or receive letters in the mail . Servicemen and women serving overseas will often have an APO or FPO mailing address . Internet or not , servicemembers always appreciate a letter in the mail . <p> Aca , ! Ac Be extremely suspicious if you are asked for money for transportation costs , communication fees or marriage processing and medical fees . <p> Aca , ! Ac Many of the negative claims made about the military and the supposed lack of support and services provided to troops overseas are far from reality check the facts . <p> Aca , ! Ac Be very suspicious if you are asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or company . Often times the company exists , but has no idea or is not a part of the scam . <p> Aca , ! Ac Be aware of common spelling , grammatical or language errors in the emails . <p> @ Stephanie no thanks needed Thank CJ I am just here to share what I know as I am a Military Wife so i may not know everything but what I do not know my husband is just an email away.Take care and spread the word to all you know about these lying begging leeches who are proud to be professional beggars <p> the worst part for me and all the others that get preyed upon I work really hard I am raising my daughter by myself and yo really want to believe that someone could care for you Sorry I am having a hard time with this I lived with a husband who 's favorite passtime was beating me up .

See the world ! <p> YES full name I could n't remember last night in previous messege to this one ( ge whiz ( un dying love within an hour of being on line ) quick worker ! and now i find 4 women attatched to me throug him on my mailsite ? though I cant write them to ask them they just seem to have attatched themselves , anyway this one as i said Sergeant Richard Richardson ( maestro.de@live.com on his last 3 months on peacekeeping in Iraq , completed 28 years originlly from military college , Is it diferent over in USa as here if you go to military college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so how come a sergeant that 's NCO with us over here in UK. or is it that different in USA in the way you do things like that you have diferent status as in segeant first class where as we would have sergeant major ( end of . never mind first class ? ? ? ) <p> Thanks donna , for those kind words you said .. no one thinks they are going to get scammed do they , ? funnily enough had another one to night couldnt believe it after 2 hours he wants to settle down with me leaving Iraq in 3 months , , gave me all the crap as usual . Richard ( nick name " maestro " forgot his surname for a min but will look it up tomorrow on the BADOO site , army sergeant again , could n't believe it . well well well ! ! ! not allowed to make calls out not allowed web cams .. stationed in Bagdad peacekeeping on " post " all night on in terent , what fab security they have in bagdad .. well there we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.J tomorrow too late now , to go back to mail and find it but have blocked him been in army for 28 yearsanyway " T " <p> another scammer his name is captain ferris marshal . says he is in Darfur . Same old story . be wary of him . He can spell . To Chad Never say never . Anything can happen to anybody . People do n't  get scammed because they are stupid.They get scammed because they are trusting . <p> Thank you Judy Judy why would you trust anyone you do n't  know with money and again why would you trust anyone you did know with your money ? You people seriously need to watch some Judy Judy and see how many people screw the pooch in relationships by loaning money . It is plain and simple keep your money in your pocket ! ! ! <p> Unless of course CJ has a worthy cause . He has been checked out . I trust him . <p> Another scammer calling himself Sgt. Kelvin Gray stationed in Kabul Afghanistan contacted me via Facebook . We talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a phone or webcam . He was always sending me pics of himself and poetry . He recently tried to send a package to me to keep until he returned home . Well of course I was suppose to money gram 650.00 to some guy in Spain lolWhen I called him on his scam he told me I did n't  deserve a man like him . I told him he was correct , I deserved much better ! ! ! ! <p> Brad , thanks for your mail and well justified to say least , and yes I did fall for the nice guy I thought he was and no doubt the real guy is nice no doubt , that I wont know , all i can say is that this scammer was n't only writing to me he had a few on the go , 2 of which I write to at the moment , and some guys have a way with words , and some guys do n't  write much , if they are so busy , at work etc , and yes I swallowed a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still using the guys identity on other sites and has n't  been caught yet , hope he is soon , I thought I had found the real guy , different photo pose , to the 3 pictured here in this site , and I just wanted to tell him he was being scammed ( as obviously he does n't  know ) and guess what it was the scammer who answered me ! ! ! ! on that site asking C.J. and me to go that bit further to track him ! ! ! I declined to answer him . As far as face book is concerned I have never put my pic up there or on any other site except a dating site for older people such as myself , which is supposed to be safe and secure and all profiles checked , as you can imagine I have closed down my member ship on that site , so for your info that 's how the scammer found me , all innocent like that . easy peasy ! that 's how they do it , as far as writings and abbreviations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that USA people do not use the same phrases or word or spellings as us BRITS , so I gave him benefit of the doubt there , in his lack of grammar etc . I certainly do not write the same on a computer as I would with my fountain pen and parchment writing paper , lots of people use TEXT language and Abbreviations on Pc , s yet another reason for letting things go a bit , but I wo n't get caught again will I. and as i said I thought Military personel couldnt use web cams , and had to follow strict guide lines , as all their conversations were monitored I must have the wrong info , and the dating site also got it wrong , and I have chastised them for that and they in tend to change their site to make it more secure and vet new and old people as to their true identities and where they are from , Anyway thanks for replying I just wanted to say that , some people get caught , some people do n't  , some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at " face value " which is right and which is wrong .. ? ? I would love to put it all right and show the guy I fell for where he went wrong . wherever he left his face and info , these scammer scum find everything there is to find and leave the person in pieces until they can find out themselves or someone tells them " HEY saw your pic on SOLDIERS perspective you are being scammed " Now would n't that be a good gesture . TRISH <p> REPLY to CHAD . EASY MY DEAR , you could get conned very easily CHAD my BOY ! very easily in deed , if you feel the person is telling you the truth and talks military etc and how busy they are and about uprisings and the news we get over here backs that up , so maybe they listen to the news to back up their stories , I have been scammed twice once for nearly a year waiting waiting , and it never came , , , , , and I am NOT A STUPID WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak point or lonley time in my life , whose to say how it happens , but that 's what they play on and give you evidence to back it up ! they ai n't  stupid either , they are professionals at their line of work ( SCAMMING ) getting into peoples heads and hearts.so there you have it . in a nut shell , hope life is always good for you , did those guys in the phots know they had their identity taken from them DID THEY ? ? ? ? ?

Thanks for your comment anyway Have you been on ILS lately have a look there at all the scammed pics do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trish if a guy does n't  know how to spell or use punctuation would n't some pretty big red flags go up ? Or you would just justify that many he has a little Arabian sand in his keyboard and he is using the comma ( , ) instead of the apostrophe ( ) . I am going to take a huge stab in the dark here you fell for one of these guys ? ( I guessed that before I even read your whole post ! ) <p> Trish maybe if you do n't  want your identity stolen you do n't  put pictures up on facebook . I have a website for my family that is LOCKED . Not everyone can see it . I am not blaming the soldier that had his pictures stolen .

I Love you all .. <p> Hello The man in these pictures has been contactig me for over 4 years he said his name is James Thomas Patrick Wagner , James patrick Wagner aka cooljamesce@yahoo.com aka waglove65 Skype .. wow what a fool I have been I wont disclose how much money I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in Afghanistan and he was a Major , he asked me to do a proxy marriage I could not I like to see things before I buy them . we lost contact for 6 months then he was in Essex London after being promoted to Captain , and he ran from the military , as of 2 days ago he was in Austin Texas . he was angry with me when I stopped the entire game so he sent me threatening messages . but I deleted and blocked him . I pray they catch up with this person and the real soldier is the one to punish him . <p> tthis man is in nigeria going as david wagner he has been trying to contact me threw facebook i just wanted to let u know that he has n't  stopped but i 'm to smart for that because i always google image before speaking to anyone one facebook or any where else .. <p> This man who uses these pictures is a pathetic . Excuse for a . Human being ! ! I 've known him as JAMES PATRICK WAGONER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would SCAM would contact me and tell me their horror stories of sending him . $ 15,000.00 to 25,000 . He would lie about knowing them and getting money . I 've known . Or spoken to him for . 8 years . Caught him in many lies and deal with his . Temper cause he could not get money from me . SUPPOSEDLY he is in GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN in a hospital until December 14 2015 . I do not know what hospital as I do n't  know the name he is using . I have names of people he would want me to send money via MG they would then send to him I have 2 phone numbers that he used to talk to me on .. and various pictures . <p> So , I guess I have now joined the ranks of middle aged women who have been scammed . It is not the first time , unfortunately , but I promise that it will be the last . The first time it was a preacher who conned me . This time it is by a man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has told me that he is a captain serving in the U.S. Army stationed in Afghanistan . As I read the various stories from countless other women , this story sounds so very similar I wonder if this is the newest fad or trend . Of course , no one starts out with the intentions of being scammed . This relationship was built over time , months in fact , and a relationship was established because I truly had a desire to believe that love is possible to be found even if on line . <p> We communicated over the course of 6-8 months first starting on Hangouts , on Google+ , and then later it progressed to Yahoo messenger . I was never leery , and this is the scary part , when I should have been . He had me at " hello ! " Who does that ? So , that just goes to show you that sometimes , as women , and men , we can be so thirsty as to believe just about anything that anyone tells us because it is what we actually wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to point fingers , but to accept the fact that most of this could have been avoided had I been a little bit discerning , and used some simple common sense and wisdom before sending this guy any of my money , or wasting my time on nonsensical lies . <p> But it started out very slow , even though within two days , Alex told me that he was in love with me . Boy , just how flattering is that ! He told me that he is originally from Spain , but lived in the U.S. His parents died tragically in a crash , and it is suspected that relatives are involved for the " inheritance . " He is now widowed , even though he later told me that his wife died right before he was married to her , which would by all intents and purposes make her his fiance , right ? But , I was not asking him too many questions , but I was just listening to him talk . Yet , when I later asked him specifically how the wife/fiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . . . details too painful for him now to talk about . Even though early on there were inconsistencies and glaring red flags in the things he told me , I listened intently . So , he has one son named Daniel who is taken care of in France by his fiances mother ( Debbie Kukoyi ) . Alexs son is now approximately 5 years old . He has attached pics of himself in military fatigues with the name on the chest clearly visible , and photos of him with his son , and all looking very much like him , in all the pictures that were shared . I looked for these details , even though they could have been age variations in these photos , they all looked very much like the same guy . According to him , Alex has been in the military for about 13 years . He is scheduled to end this special tour of duty in December 2015 . But , now that he is in love with me , and wants to marry me , after only chatting with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Now , he tells me that many of his mates in the army use a method of " sneaking out . " They use bribes to pay their military commanders and superiors and they arrange for them to sneak out as civilians using civilian aircraft rather than the military planes . This fee is sent via Western Union , or Money Gram , and is sent to supposed travel agents directly responsible for making the flight arrangements . This fee ranges from $2,000 to $5,000 . The unique thing that happened in this instance with me is that I really fell for this guy , hard . I wanted so much to believe that he was really in love with me . I sent the money , not once but twice . The first time I arranged for him to be sent home , the day that he was to arrive at Bush International Airport , ( I had even seen what I believed as the flight itinerary/ticket ) . Yet , on this day I begin to get a series of text messages on my personal cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also involved with Alex and in love with him who is also serving in the military with him . Her name is Helena J. Soliz . She states that he dropped her immediately upon becoming involved with me , and that he has become so distant and cold with her , that she hacked into his Gmail account and has now blocked me from being able to access him anymore . And , she supposedly changed his password so even HE can not access his own account as well . Also , she has now reported his unauthorized leave to the military police and they are now arresting him at the airport in Houston , and I will never see him again ! She begins to call me all sorts of names and mocking me , and telling me that she is coldhearted , but that I deserve no less for taking her boyfriend . Of course I am distraught at all this news and devastated , because of all that is happening , but never once did I think at this point that I am being scammed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of anonymous telephone calls from a woman , from a Google phone number and she would simply hang up . It was some days , but I finally got a text message from someone stating that they were also in the military with Alex , ( another Google number ) and his name is Jones . Jones states that Alex is in very big trouble as he has been apprehended by the military police and is now locked up . He may lose his job , but that Alex has contacted Jones to tell him to please contact me . He wants me to connect with him on Yahoo Messenger now rather than on G+ . Of course all of this should have been a huge red flag to me , but having never served in the military , I do not know their protocols and if they are allowed internet access even if imprisoned . Does n't  make any sense to me , hey , but what do I know ? <p> I was just so very grateful to hear some news that I thanked Jones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IM Alex on Yahoo Messenger as he instructed where we continued to communicate for months thereafter . He tells me that he is so hurt and sorry that Helena has done this to " us . " She was so jealous and angry , and while he should have told me everything about her , he did n't  want me to know because it was in his past . Now , he is being sent back to Afghanistan to serve a harsh penalty in the " second " camp . It is going to be hard but , at least he did not lose his job . Now , Alex sounds very convincing to me all up to this point , I did not have any reason to suspect that all this was just a scam to get my money . Even though , he asked me to send some " little funds " to his son Daniel and Grandma Debbie Kukoyi because they were going thru some hard times now . She even fell and busted her knee at the news of his arrest ! So , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me almost weekly to send $100 to $200 for their care , and I did send it via Western Union or Money Gram . He gave me an address and a phone number for Grandma Debbie , but one time I tried to call that number and the international phone operator told me that I had an incorrect number . I asked Alex about this , and he responded that she recently lost her phone and so it was no longer a working number and she currently does not have a phone . I then asked him for her email address because to my knowledge he communicated with her on Yahoo Messenger , but he replied that " grandma is not the online type ! " I did not press the issue , but stated that since I am to be " his wife , " in the event that something should happen to him , I should be able to contact her . Thinking back all of this sounds so very bizarre that I wonder about my own sanity for being involved in such stupidity . But , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were implicit in participating in it . I sent money on several different occasions to travel agents both in the states and in Antigua and Barbuda . One was named Kathlyn Phillip in Antigua , and there was one in Belleview Illinois named Laura Rys . I sent money to Steve Dingman who was a supposed friend of Alex who assisted him financially , and who received the money when Alex asked for a cell phone . A mate was coming back to the camp and he was going to arrange for the phone to be given to the mate to bring back to him . As I type now , it sounds so ludicrous , but I really did not question this at the time . I wanted to believe this stupidity , so I guess I got my just dessert here . But , I sent him $180 for a cell phone , and he never called me one time with it ! ! ! I even sent a reloadable T-mobile phone card with $20 on it ! He says that immediately when he received the cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to his military superiors and they took the phone from him because it was a breach of military security . He said that they were holding the phone for him and that whenever he left the camp it would be returned . Heavy sigh . . . there are just too many details but as the story unfolds , we attempt one more time to get Alex home for a 31 day visit . This time , I send to Western Union payments and Money Gram payments to someone named Daniel Akinde in Lagos Nigeria . Then , FINALLY , my headlights came on ! Now , I begin to get the inclination that something is very wrong here . It was n't when he called me a Mother Fer when he got angry at me because he thought that I was out cheating on him when I did not respond right away to his instant messages . It was n't when he threatened to drop me and block me when I refused to borrow money from a loan shark to get him home , and he became angry saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be involved with someone who did not trust him . No , it was not until I heard that money was being requested to be sent to Lagos Nigeria that my intuition kicked into full gear . I had hear all sorts of horror stories about scams coming out of Nigeria . This was a big one . I could not over look it , but now I was so into this guy emotionally and financially . He had promised to pay me back upon arriving in the states and I needed my money ! ! ! I was meeting him this time at the airport this time because he promised to give me his Honda Cross Tour as a gift and we were planning on driving back to where I live from Texas . So , I had purchased a one way ticket to Houston , Texas . So , imagine my horror when I realized that this all was sounding like a scam . I began to panic and get filled with anxiety . My whole family was waiting to meet mamas new mystery boyfriend . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIM HOME , including my children ! " <p> Now , Alex is telling me in addition to the $2200 I had already wired to Daniel Akinde , in Lagos Nigeria , now there are BTA fees . Basic Travel Allowance of $480 I must send that he will not spend , but has to show in order to be allowed to leave the country . I began to research what are BTA fees because I had never ever heard of this term before . This is where I began to understand that I had been involved in a very elaborate scheme to defraud me out of my money . When I saw this I was horrified . Needless to say , though at Alexs insistence , I still send an additionally $480 . Then , in NO LESS THAN AN HOUR , Daniel Akinde and Alex were texting me telling me that the BTA fees were too low and now I had to send an additional $500 or he would be stranded at the airport . I tell you that I knew with everything in me that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to just drop OUT ! I knew this guy was lying but I had invested so much money up to this point that I really did not want to believe that this was what it was . I sent an additional $500 ! ! ! ! Yes , I did . . . because even with all of that I wanted to still believe that there was a slim chance that he may be able to come home . That is when you know that you are the victim of self delusions and denial . So , I can not fault Alex , or what ever this guys real name is , because I made taking my money all too easy for him . I failed on so many levels to just use basic common sense that the saying that we used when I was a kid came to my mind : If you find a fool , bump his head ! This is what we used to say as children . Alex found me to be a big fool , and I was all that and then some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it , and even after sending it his greed kicked into over drive because now he wrote me to tell me thank you for sending the additional BTA fees , but now they wo n't allow him to leave without his paying an additional $420 because he missed his original flight because of the low BTA fees . So , if I could just send the $420 , we will be together at last . This sound so so unreal , I can barely type this , but it is all true . It really happened . But , fortunately , this is where I shut it down , and I did not let on to him that I know that he is just a scammer sitting at some cyber cafe scamming me for all the money he can get , but I just stopped replying to test messages an Yahoo messages . I have n't let on but I told him Goodbye , no more money is coming . He keeps texting me , and Daniel Akinde was actually calling me from Nigeria but I refused to answer . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want people to really learn from my horrible mistake . I refused to look at all the cues and all the signs that I got early on but refused to look at because " I " wanted to believe a lie ! I wanted so much for someone to love me that I was willing to overlook truth in order to believe the lies they were telling me . Alex could not spell , he spoke in broken English , and he even sounded rather illiterate at times . But the thing that I fell for was his innocent way of professing his love for me . Yes , he may have been illiterate , but love is from the heart . I fell for that illusion and this is how I was deceived so easily .

@@96509938 @709938/ 68528 @qwx928528 <h> Testing the WT Tactical Windshirt <p> Windshirts are n't  just for golfers . Although predominately seen on the green , they have fans throughout the tactical community . Windshirts can provide wearers with wind and rain protection without weighing them down . <p> The pullover windshirt proved quite the opponent for wind and rain . <p> I was stumped on how best to test the limits of the WT Tactical windshirt ( $99 ) . Where should I test the wind resistance ? Seeing as I do not have ready access to a wind tunnel , I decided to ask my father for a ride on the back of his Harley . Based on my prior experience riding in the wussy seat , I knew that it was quite easy to suffer from windburn whilst cruising down the interstate . ( I do not recommend operating or riding a motorcycle without wearing appropriate leather protection . Road rash is not pleasant . This experiment was conducted in a controlled environment free of semis and careless drivers . ) <p> It was drizzling the day that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could test its wind resistance and waterproof capabilities at the same time . First , you should know that the windshirt is super light . While it does keep a certain amount of warmth in , it primarily protects your skin from suffering the aftereffects of too much wind . Based on the ride that day , I would say that I 'm fairly impressed with its level of protection but the trip was rather chilly . I would suggest layering up if you intend on wearing it in a colder environment . <p> Regarding the rain the windshirt performed well . My skin was dry at the end of the journey . I can not attest to how well it would hold up in a torrential downpour , but it can easily repel moisture during a light April shower . Also , the shirt itself dries out quickly . <p> The shirt is a 70 denier textured nylon shell encapsulated with silicone said to provide a durable water resistance , abrasion resistance and breathability.The pullover windshirt has a zip that comes halfway down the chest . The wrists are cinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn closed with the elastic cord . <p> One really cool feature is the stow-away hood , which can be easily rolled into the neck . The hood is snuggly fitted so it can be worn under a helmet ( always to be worn when riding ) or similar headgear . <p> Although I wont be using it all the time , I could see myself wearing the garment on windy days in the future . Not to mention I 'm partial to the MultiCam pattern . <p> Have you ever donned a windshirt ? What environment do you think its best suited for ? <h> 2 Comments on " Testing the WT Tactical Windshirt " <p> Personally , I think the windshirt had lots of room . I received a size medium and I was swimming in it . However , I 'm a 56 ? female with an average build . I did have my dad try it on and he usually wears a size large ( sometimes XL , sorry dad . ) . While it looked a bit snug , he could still move freely in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only wear a t-shirt or thin long-sleeved shirt . Yet still that windshirt has gone missing . So , I would say he found it comfortable enough to wear again . = What I thought was really cool was the extra fabric in the shoulder/armpit region . From my experience , I would say that it is not slim cut and you could definitely do a little base layering here . Hope that this helped . If you do try out the WT windshirt , let me know what you think about it ! My email is nora@cat5.com . <p> How was the over all fit of the Wild Things ? I have used a few different Windshirts and to date I think my older ORC PCU windshit is the best fit . I had a OTTE Super-L and it was a size large but fit more like a medium . My ORC was a large and had a nice loose fit . Does the Wild Things fit snug or is the cut more " generous " and give ample room for layering ? That was a concern with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have been able to wear a fleece under it . The only other level 4 I have used is the Patagonia Slingshot and it too had a smaller fit range and I required an XL in it to properly accomplish the layering I needed .

MC even encourages readers to send him questions about anything and everything . His answers are insightful , witty and really quite informative . <p> The title of your blog implies that everyone who gets pulled over is doing something wrong . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they pull someone over ? <p> If you got stoppedyou deserved it . In my experience , this is the case 99% of the time . Of course , officers are human and make mistakes . Sometimes , a car can get lost in a sea of similar looking vehicles . It has happened to me , and I figured out the mistake by the time I contacted the driver . Almost every time , the driver is glad they werent the party I was looking for ; however , they 're still nervous . I chalk it up to them feeling guilty for something else they did whilst driving and did n't  get caught for . <p> Come to think of it , my answer is yes , its always the case just not necessarily for what they were stopped for ! Seriously , though , 99.8% of the time the driver I stop has committed a violation of some sort , and most of the time , they receive a written reminder of their irresponsibility ( read : citation ) . Personally , I 've never issued a citation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up in court and testify to something I 'm just sorta sure about . <p> Believe it or not , most of the questions I get are legitimate . Most folks have always wanted to ask a cop a question , but do n't  necessarily want to approach us on the street ( which is appreciated by the by ) . I did once get a racy question about wearing nothing but the motor boots in the boudoir turns out it was The Wife , though , so I suppose that does n't  really count . <p> Most of the questions I get are well thought out and something that a lot more people than just the asker are curious about . Chances are if you are wondering about it , someone else is as well . I wish people would ask me more about my aspirations and dreams , you know ?

@@96509945 @709945/ <p> To be honest , some topics discussed on his blog go right over our head but not all . Noonans use of charts , tables , quotes , sources and commentary helps even dilettantes embrace medical research . <p> While he has only blogged for a little over two years , Noonans paramedic experience spans almost two decades . Last year his blog was even nominated as a Fire/EMS Blog of the Year . He kindly took a moment away from his growing body of study to answer a few questions for us . <p> Why did you start blogging ? <p> I have been writing on various email listservs for a while . One of the medics I know from the listservs started a blog and has been very successful . A Day in the Life of an Ambulance Driver . I blame him . = <p> What is the inspiration behind it all ? <p> Writing on a blog allows me to format the topic in a way that may help me to make my point more easy to understand . Or it can allow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do both . I do n't  really try for long and tedious , but sometimes I cant help myself . <p> Your blog is extremely thorough and at times pretty research heavy . Have you always been interested in formal research ? <p> Pretty much . I find that the most effective way to convince medical directors to change protocols is with well-done and relevant research . I am trying to let people know what research is out there . <p> By looking at the research and understanding what conclusions can be drawn from any particular study and what may be reading too much into a study , we make progress in providing the best care for patients . If we are n't  doing this to provide the best care for the patients , then we might as well just go home and consider a different line of work . <p> Research Blogging has their own rules for participation . As long as you follow their rules , you can blog through them . <p> Basically , they are looking for posts that provide some commentary on a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pasting from the paper . If you look at some of what others write for research blogging , they tend to be shorter than mine , which is not surprising . <p> I also write for Paramedicine 101 , which is run by Adam Thompson . He asked me if I wanted to participate and maybe it was the way he phrased it , maybe it was that I was in a social mood , I do n't  know . I try to post once a week there . Sometimes it works out to once a month . Other times it works out to several in a week . I have posted for some blog carnivals : Normal Sinus Rhythm , The Handover and Skeptics Circle . <p> I do not have any specific posting schedule . I try to post something two or three times a week on my blog . I also occasionally participate in some podcasts EMS EduCast , EMS Garage and MedicCast . <p> You list many quotes on your page " what is your all-time favorite ? <p> I do n't  have any particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I put a new quote at the top of the blog , since I am trying to focus on pain management research for a while . It is an old quote from Albert Schweitzer : " We must all die . But that I can save a person from days of torture that is what I feel is my great and ever-new privilege . Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death itself . " <p> One thing I like about quotes is that they get people to think about things differently . Many times people think of Nobel Prize winners as serious people who would never encourage any kind of " disobedience . " But the truth is that they often came up with the concept that earned them the Nobel Prize by being disobedient , non-conformist and rebellious . <p> For example , teachers are frustrated by hearing constantly that Einstein did not do well at math , yet look at his success . They might be more upset by this quote : " Never memorize what you can look up in books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to understand , rather than memorize . It does not matter how much we memorize , if we do not understand how to use what we have memorized . <p> I like to use quotes to get people to think . Too much of EMS is about discouraging thinking and just following orders . Do you know anyone who says , " I want a THOUGHTLESS EMT/medic/nurse/doctor " ? The same is true for any of the emergency professions . Fire fighters , HazMat , police , FBI , any branch of the military , et cetera . <p> The thoughtless person is the customer service person , who takes up an hour of your time for a simple fix but provides the wrong fix . These are the people who provide material for comedians . This is not being all you can be . This is not what we want our children to grow up to be . This is not what we want when we have to deal with an emergency . <p> That may summarize my blog . I try to get people to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we develop the insight to make truly significant changes . The only time we can claim that we do not change is when we are dead . I will be there soon enough . I do n't  need to treat my mind as if it is already dead . <p> How long have you been a paramedic ? What attracted you to the profession ? Ive been a paramedic for 17 years . I was going to be a father and figured that I needed to know what to do to deal with emergencies . I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to my daughter , and I could have done something to prevent it . <p> I had watched Emergency ! in the 1970s and liked the show , but every time I was around an injured person , I would look worse than the injured person . I learned to deal with that and found that I like EMS . <p> What 's the most frustrating part of your job ? <p> The useless limitations on appropriate care . The pay . The benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on when you ask , I 'll give a different answer . <p> And the most rewarding ? <p> Helping people . Whether it is helping a patient directly , helping a student/coworker to understand something better , so that they can help patients better , or helping to change protocols to allow for better patient care . <p> Yes . 5.11 Tactical Series . These are my uniform pants , and I like them . <p> My uniform is tactical pants , a polo shirt , boots and a belt . And underpants " they 're tactical pants , not commando pants . I like this uniform . I have no desire to wear anything even remotely formal . I have spent too much time wearing a suit to ever want to wear one again . 
@@96509946 @709946/ <h> Tactical Talk : Meteorite Mens Geoffrey Notkin <p> People call him a modern day treasure hunter . Yet Geoffrey Notkins quest for meteorites is driven by a love for science , not fame and fortune . <p> His relentless pursuit of outer space relics has taken him to some of the most remote locales in the world . As co-host of the Science Channels Meteorite Men , Notkin shares his passion and adventures with the world . He also happens to wear a lot of tactical clothes while doing so . <p> So , how does he gear up for global space-rock missions ? While filming season two of the hit show , Notkin sat down to answer that question and more . <p> Exactly how rare is it to find a meteorite ? <p> The vast majority of people alive today will never find a meteorite , or even have the opportunity to touch one or hold one . Meteorites are perhaps the most elusive treasure on our planet " rarer than uranium , gold or even emeralds " and they are one of our few tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being another ) . <p> Why collect them ? <p> Studying meteorites that have fallen to Earth can help us understand the fabric , and perhaps even the origin , of the planets and asteroids that , along with us , make up Solar System . A contemporary theory suggests that meteorites may have brought carbon , water and amino acids to our planet , thereby seeding our world with the ingredients needed to generate the simplest and earliest life forms . Spacecraft designers have studied the shapes of meteorites , and there is an international network of collectors who are passionate about space rocks . <p> So , meteorites are worth money to collectors and contribute unique and valuable information to academics . Who would n't want a piece of outer space ? <p> A meteorite Notkin found in Morocco in 2000 . <p> Do a lot of people find ordinary rocks and mistake them for meteorites ? And do they send them to you ? <p> Yes , every day ! When I 'm not working on the Meteorite Men TV series I devote much of my time to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sales , as well as science writing and photography . One of the services we enjoy providing is advising people who think they may have found a rock from space . Our Guide to Meteorite Identification is one of the most popular pages on the website , and it receives tens of thousands of visits annually . <p> On a typical day at the Aerolite offices , well receive four or five identification inquires by e-mail , one or two by phone , and perhaps one mailed-in specimen . We recommend that anyone who thinks he or she might have found a meteorite either e-mail us a few photos or send in a small sample for analysis . A lot of people take us up on that offer . <p> In an average year we receive thousands of requests for help in identifying suspected meteorites . We average roughly one genuine space rock for every 1,000 inquiries , and that not-very-encouraging statistic demonstrates just how rare meteorites are . <p> What 's the most bizarre discovery you 've made while on a meteorite hunt ? <p> We have found live ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorpions , rattlesnakes , a black bear , Frontier-era wagon wheels , gruesome vintage animal traps , aircraft parts , hand-forged tools and horseshoes , a chain big enough to hold down the Queen Mary , Civil War relics and numerous other things that we just could n't identify . <p> The strangest single incident took place when my Meteorite Men co-host Steve and I were hunting for meteorites in Kiowa County , Kan . We were searching in a field where we knew meteorites had been found about 130 years ago . We picked up a strong audio signal from a buried target and started to enthusiastically dig down to the source of that signal . <p> We 'd excavated about two feet of rich Kansas soil when the bottom of the hole suddenly collapsed into nothingness . A few seconds later I heard a faraway splash , as clods of earth fell into invisible water , and then a terrifying whoosing , gargling sound spiraled up and out of the blackness . I thought we might have accidentally uncovered the secret entrance to the Underworld , and I jumped so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Steve stood by the side of the hole , laughing and announced that wed discovered an uncapped well of some sort . <p> It was funny in retrospect , but we often used to stand in a hole while digging , especially if we hit a dense clay layer . If one of us had been standing in the bottom of that hole , we could have fallen to a most unpleasant death . I make a point of not standing in holes anymore . <p> Will you ever get bored with looking for meteorites ? <p> That 's a bit like asking if I think I might get bored of eating or breathing . Meteorite hunting is n't just what I do for fun , or business , or for our television show " its the driving force in my life . <p> The thrill of uncovering a visitor from outer space is so invigorating that it makes you want to keep on doing it . Behavioral experts who study addiction and obsession could probably have a field day examining what makes us tick . <p> What advice would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Forget about it , and get a real job ! No , I 'm just kidding , but a story from my college years strikes me as being appropriate here . I have a science and arts background , and graduated from New Yorks School of Visual Arts ( I art direct the Meteorite Men and Aerolite websites , as well as much of our photography and promotion , so the media arts degree came in very handy ) . <p> During my junior year , I was fortunate enough to study with the great Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist , illustrator and writer Art Spiegelman . In the first class he lectured us about being realistic : " If you want to make money and be wealthy , then please leave my class and become a doctor or lawyer . If you 're here , it should be because you need to be an artist . " <p> The same advice holds true for meteorite hunters . If you think searching for meteorites might be a good way to make a quick buck , then think again . Expeditions " especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes dangerous . You need a lot of patience , stamina , and determination , and must be willing to put the time in . <p> But its also true that there are a good number of " weekend hunters " " meteorite enthusiasts who have day jobs but go out in the field during their spare time , and some of them have been successful . I would n't recommend that anyone quit their day job and start hunting meteorites . Read some books , do your research , and give it a try . I recommend The Fallen Sky by Chris Cokinos , Meteorites by Dr. Alan Carion , and Rocks from Space by O. Richard Norton . <p> But do n't  expect to come home with something from you first hunt . <p> Will there be a second season of Meteorite Men ? <p> There will most definitely be a second season of Meteorite Men . In fact , the bulk of my answers to you were written onboard a jetliner while on my way to one of our most exciting Season Two locations . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our show , and we all want Meteorite Men to be bigger and better with more science and more adventure . To that end , Steve and I spent several months looking at possible hunt locations , devising new hunting strategies and experimenting with the latest equipment and technology . <p> We do n't  want to spoil any surprises , but I can tell you that if you enjoyed Season One of Meteorite Men , then you 're going to be blown away by Season Two . As Bachman-Turner Overdrive said : " You ai n't  seen nothin yet . " <p> What has the TV show done for your industry ? <p> Professionals and amateurs in our field have , almost universally , reported increased sales , increased website traffic and a great upsurge in the number of possible meteorites sent in for identification . <p> For the past thirteen years , I have been attending the annual Tucson gem and mineral shows " the largest single assemblage of natural history wonders in the world . I operate a showroom at the Tucson Hotel City Center for the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we received plenty of visitors , but for the 2010 show our room was packed all day , every day , for fifteen consecutive days . Many people stopped in just to tell us that they enjoyed the show and to take a photo with us or purchase a meteorite . <p> A few brought possible meteorites for us to see and three gold prospectors from Arizona told us theyd watched the show and then decided to hunt for meteorites themselves . " And we found this ! " they said , as they pulled an amazing 7-pound stone meteorite out of a backpack . So , our series is educating the public about meteorites and encouraging people to go out and look for space rocks themselves . <p> During a recent hunt in Wisconsin , which was prompted by a spectacular night time fireball , Steve told me that on two separate occasions families walked up to him and said : " We saw you on television and decided wed try meteorite hunting ourselves . " On one hand , were creating our own competition and , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder of space rocks . <p> There is also no doubt whatsoever that new meteorites are coming to light because people have seen Meteorite Men and become inspired . That 's good for science , and its good for the commercial meteorite market . <p> Do you wear tactical pants while out on the field ? What brand has worked the best for you ? <p> Actually , I have worn tactical pants in the field and in the lab ! I am a great fan of 5.11 Tactical , and we use a lot of their gear . Your readers who are familiar with the extremely high quality of tactical clothing will not need me to tell them how durable and resilient it is . Compared to ordinary clothes , 5.11 tactical pants are virtually indestructible . The terrains Ive worked in encompass mountains , desert , prairie , frozen tundra , muddy streams and rivers , heavy forest , farmland and desolate dry lake beds . <p> Notkin wearing 5.11 Tactical from head to toe . <p> We often use metal detectors to search for buried targets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do is drop to my knees and start digging . If you do that a few times with regular cotton pants , you very quickly have no fabric left covering your skin . That 's not a good idea in areas where we might be kneeling on cactus , poison ivy , ticks or scorpions . Tactical pants are especially valuable to me in desert areas that are rife with cactus and other spiny plants . In fact , just about everything in the desert has something spiny on it ! Tactical pants tough fabric helps protect me from cuts , abrasions and annoying insects . <p> I also carry a lot of small but important equipment with me : GPS , notebooks , compass , loupe , plastic bags for storing specimens , a camping knife , a small digital camera for documenting finds in situ and so on . I do n't  want to be reaching into my backpack every five minutes looking for something , so the variety of pockets in my tactical pants are very useful . <p> What other sort of tactical gear has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.11 Patrol Ready bag in the field and its invaluable . I need a rugged bag that can go anywhere with me , and keep the multitude of gadgets I need in the field , safe and in one place . <p> We work long days in the field " usually with a lot of ground to cover during a limited window of opportunity " and I cant afford to waste time searching through a backpack or conventional suitcase trying to find what I need . My Patrol Ready bag has a full-zip top and multiple pockets , so I can locate what I want , when I want it , and its also a great carry-on bag for airline travel . <p> At beginning of Season Two of Meteorite Men , I finally retired my British army-style leather boots .

They are great in many situations , but they are heavy , hot in desert environments and have very poor traction on snow-covered slopes " something I discovered the hard way while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , that 's for all of you who watched the show and saw me fall over at Whitecourt Crater ) .

Let 's be realistic here : I 'm on television , and I want my gear to look good . The XPRT boots required almost no breaking in , and in a crunch I could have taken them out of the box and straight into the field . <h> 4 Comments on " Tactical Talk : Meteorite Mens Geoffrey Notkin " <p> Hello Geoffrey , I recently read that seeing a meteor fall &amp; recovering it is pretty rare , the guy who made the comment said that only about 6 or 7 people a year in the world will do that .

I find that the main difference is when you are wearing a holster for any length of time and in varied terrain in hunting or trapping situations you will soon see that lesser holsters fall behind . Nylon seems to wiggle on your waist and at least for me I am constantly adjusting it . I never had to do that with a Sourdough . Also it holds the gun in a very comfortable position .

@@96509950 @709950/ 68529 @qwx928529 <h> Fort Bragg Barracks Update <p> I dialed into a bloggers roundtable yesterday with BG Dennis Rogers and CSM Deborah Strickland , Deputy Director and Command Sergeant Major of Installation Management Command respectively . While waiting for the attendees to dial in , Matt and I spoke a little about his recent trip to China and the fact that Blackfive is actually banned in China ! ! So , kudos to Matt for that esteemed honor ! ! <p> We were gathered to discuss the recent video that surfaced on YouTube about the barracks at Fort Bragg . The video depicted deplorable conditions , to include sewage leaks in the latrines and mold in various locations . It was assembled by the father of a Soldier who had recently returned from a deployment to Iraq staying in those very same barracks . Naturally , he was very upset with what he saw . <p> The entire issue with the barracks at Fort Bragg and other locations boils down to a single point of failure NCO Leadership . As I 've said numerous times here and everywhere else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the beginning of our military it has been an NCO responsibility to ensure that the living quarters of our Soldiers are up to standard . Naturally , that standard depends on the NCO inspecting the area , but there is a general agreement about the living conditions in which our Soldiers reside . The issue at Fort Bragg was an NCO leadership failure at every level from the most junior of NCOs to the to the most senior on the installation . " It is my responsibility for maintaining barracks throughout the Army , " began BG Dennis Rogers opening statement to the bloggers present . " And in that roleI assume responsibility for the shortfalls in barracks maintenance . " <p> There was no parsing words . BG Rogers noted that we have let our Soldiers down with regard to the condition of living quarters for returning Soldiers . " There is no excuse for that , " he said . <p> Providing a contrast to the video making its rounds in the media and the internet , Rogers remarked that the actual living quarters the beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a new HVAC ventilation system in the building , so the air quality is equally good . <p> The building being shown in the building is a Korean-war era , 1950s vintage building at Fort Bragg . It is one of approximately 23 similar building scheduled for demolition on the installation . New barracks are being built , but the next ones are n't  expected to be finished until sometime next summer ( 2009 ) . <p> CSM Strickland addressed the bloggers and took responsibility for her failures as well . <p> " I 'm going to assume that least some of you are former enlisted or NCOs , " she said addressing us . " So you know that part of that burden really belongs to us . " The two most basic responsibilities of an NCO are accomplishment of the mission and THE WELFARE OF OUR SOLDIERS . This comes directly from the very creed that all NCOs should live by the moment they pin on those Sergeant stripes ( or Corporal stripes in some instances ) . <p> CSM Strickland boiled the issue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate hand off in responsibility from the rear detachment NCO leadership to the Garrison NCOs leadership . She said that they have addressed that issue very quickly and its unfortunate that it might give anyone the impression that this is the way we receive Soldiers returning from theater . <p> Senior Army leadership has directed a thorough walk-through of all barracks . For the most part , this has already taken place . The only places this has not taken place are at the installations or within units that were observing a 4-day pass . In these situations , the barracks are scheduled to be looked at within the next 72 hours . <p> This is where things will get a little tricky . The Army has a difficult task here . The Soldiers have some implied tasks as well . First of all , the barracks are the Soldiers homes . They live there ; they eat there ; they sleep there . Until they can afford to move into their own place or get married and move into a government provided family home , that is where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as such . It is up to the individual Soldier first and foremost to take care of his dwelling , whether a barracks room or single family home . <p> Second , it is the responsibility of the first line supervisor to check out the places where their Soldiers live . If they live in the barracks , it is a leadership responsibility to inspect those barracks to ensure that they live in sanitary conditions . Most Soldiers that live in barracks are younger Soldiers with little to no experience caring for a place or picking up after themselves . Its a fact of life and probably worse today with kids growing up without any real responsibilities in the home prior to leaving . Soldiers that do n't  live in barracks should also be visited , though different rules apply to Soldiers living off-post . However , there is nothing wrong with a supervisor requesting to stop by a subordinates home just to check up on family and make general observations about living conditions . Remember , Soldiers can be forced to live on post if their off-post dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to the Soldier . <p> Third , it is the responsibility of the commands to ensure that leaders are doing their jobs . They do this through several methods : personal interviews , counselings , anonymous surveys , tip lines , etc . Commands must enforce standards and clarify standards that NCOs are responsible for enforcing . Spot checks should be done at regular intervals . <p> The Sergeant Major of the Army has mandated that all Garrison Commanders and Command Sergeants Major check on these standards . These commanders and CSMs have made the assessment that Soldiers are , in fact , housed according to Army standards . The fact is that there are places in the Army that do not meet these standards . They have determined that those locations are isolated and do not represent the standard of living across the board in the Army . <p> Where those Soldiers were living in substandard barracks , " on-the-spot " corrections were made . Based off of some of the stories Ive heard today talking to Soldiers from all over , these " on-the-spot " corrections involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting at the Soldiers . I 'm sure some of it had to do with Soldiers not doing their jobs in the first place to ensure standards were being maintained , but a lot of it is the embarrassment of having a video posted on YouTube and commands acting hastily . At places where on-the-spot corrections are not substantial enough to improve conditions , IMC has directed that Soldiers be relocated while the work is done to fix the issue . <p> To prevent this issue from occurring in the future the IMC CSM will create a facilities management form that will be shared with all installation CSMs to inspect and ensure that Soldiers are living within established guidelines . These forms will be required to be filled out on a monthly basis and forward through Army chains . The forms will contain data compiled by leaders and Soldiers themselves , assessing the actual conditions in which they live . The forms will be used to provide recommendations directly to the Commanding General in order to provide quick resolution to major issues . Its a boots on the ground perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting information flows so that it is timely and we can all affect whatever is affecting our soldiers on the ground , " said CSM Strickland . That is the reasoning behind the NCO quorum at the post and Major Command level . <p> My problem with issue alludes to something that LL wrote about in the comments section : this does n't  seem very isolated . It was n't that long ago that we were dealing with this issue at Walter Reed . I also wrote back then that , having personally visited numerous rooms at Walter Reed , the issues at Walter Reed were blown way out of proportion . Its quite possible they are that way today as well . I havent had any Soldiers living in barracks since 2004 , so I have n't been in them much in the past four years . However , Ive seen good barracks and Ive seen terrible barracks . I remember living in some utterly crappy barracks while I was stationed at Fort Huachuca . Those barracks are still standing , but I believe their offices now and not living quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most Soldiers these days live in very decent barracks . <p> The Army is going through all of this because of some video , according to BG Rogers . It is n't the reason were conducting all these inspections and finding all these issues . " That 's not the case , " he said . " There were a number of different work orders submitted in the last six month to work on these particular barracks . " I 'm not saying anyone is deliberately misleading anyone else here , but go back and read the first comment to this post . These issues have been around since the first rotation of Afghanistan Soldiers began returning home in 2002 . <p> My main concern that I brought I brought with BG Rogers and CSM Strickland was that we need to energize the NCO Corps . Since this came out and my original notice that I was taking part in this round table discussion , ive gotten a few emails and comments both here and through MySpace from Soldiers on different installations indicating this may not be an isolated incident . Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " start looking bad for our side . <p> In response to this issue , the Sergeant Major of the Army , SMA Kenneth O. Preston , is sending out guidance soon related to his impression about this " got off balance , " according to CSM Strickland . She explained that frequently what happens is that things happen at the local and either do n't  make it to the IMC level or arrive very slowly , which gives the appearance that the IMC leadership does n't  care about these issues . The Army is good at trying to solve issues at the lowest level possible for all problems . This is good and bad in that sometimes this way of thinking prevents help from unexpected places that could assist in resolving the faster and better . The entire leadership for the Army expends a lot of effort , she said , in talking to NCOs about being more reactive and getting them back in the barracks . <p> " I think Soldiers have a higher expectation of what we do now , " she added . " They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're returning and their seeing how well one installation may address their returning Warriors and then they experience something less than that . " There has been a lot of discussion at the senior , Army-level leadership on how to make this more uniform , she continued . <p> Part of the problems , and I tend to agree , are that Soldiers are not going through the normal complaint procedures . Its too easy to go ahead and put a video on YouTube or contact ones Congressman or local media about major issues . The other part is that Soldiers do n't  have faith in this system for a reason leaders turn a blind eye . As leaders , it should be our responsibility to make life on the Soldier outside of military duties as comfortable as possible . The Lord knows that everything else about military service is full of pain , agony , discomfort , stress , and fatigue . The least we can do is ease that burden while they are " home " . Besides going through leadership channels , there is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are failing them . I have had nothing but positive results from IGs . They have n't always gone the way I would have wanted , but they explained the reality each time and I understand the rationale . The implied task is that leaders should empower Soldiers and make them aware of that process so they also know when and how to use it . <p> I brought my frustration that , while the majority of barracks on Army installations these days is top notch and hundreds of times better than what I had as a private , its the returning Soldiers that are getting shafted by being forced into substandard barracks until the current occupants of their permanent quarters are moved . <p> The Sergeant Major of the Army made this very clear on Monday to senior NCOs at the installation level : " We want to do what 's right by every Soldier . But , clearly , we want to do better by Soldiers that are returning from war . " <p> A few things to take away from this issue : <p> The Army is reacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  happen elsewhere . 99% of the time , we take care of our own . Every now and then , we fail . The majority of barracks are nice . Soldiers largely have rooms of their own these days and do n't  have to share with anyone . There are some exceptions . With that said , part of me thinks that the Army would NEVER allow an officer , regardless of pay grade or rank , to live in these conditions . That is why NCOs must take the lead in preventing their troops from ever having to live like this again . <p> This is an extremely embarrassing event for the Army and frankly , I think the leadership was trying to sugarcoat the reality of what were seeing . But , they are acting to fix it ! ! Keep in mind as well , that there is nothing wrong with peeling paint . Its ugly and unsightly , but its not a hazard so long as it is n't lead-based . The people that had to largely bear the burden of getting these barracks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The major failure lies with the previous Reserve unit that was occupying the barracks prior to the 82nd unit returning from combat . They had no respect for their fellow brothers in arms and treated the barracks like their personal shoothouse . <p> I risk a lot being this honest as an active duty Soldier , but I 'm not breaking any rules and stand by my words . NCOs need to get off their asses and take an interest in their Soldiers lives . If they cant do that , they need to get out of my Army . I have no use for them . A Sergeant is not just a promotion and extra money . Its responsibility and forward thinking ! ! I 'm glad the leadership is addressing this issue directly , but they need to realize that they have a lot of catching up to do ( when I say leadership , NCOs , I 'm talking to you too ! ) . The worst thing they can is try to white wash this problem especially to a group of active , retired , and former military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger and CSM Strickland take the responsibility for this . It is their ultimate responsibility , but the failings happened well below them at the installation and rear detachment level . I sure hope some OERs and NCOERs accurately reflect what happened at Fort Bragg . I hope that Officers and NCOs have been officially reprimanded and relieved of command or responsibility where necessary . We can move past this and learn from it , but I 'm a bit skeptical . Youd think we had already learned something after the Walter Reed issue . NCOs , take heed ! Wake up now ! Do your jobs or the officers are going to do it for us . Where do we stand then ? <p> Disclaimer : This post was written by me and not representative of Fort Bragg , the Army , the Department of Defense , The United States Government , the 3rd Infantry Division , the 11th ACR , the School of the Americas , TRADOC , FORSCOM , Recruiting Command , The United States Marine Corps , The Merchant Marines , the United States Air Force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Boy Scouts of America , the Department of Education , or any other unit , department , office , Section , squad , platoon , company battalion , brigade , division , Corps , any branch of service , rank , MOS , or any other segment of official military or government , real or imagined . <p> while its true that there are still a lot of barracks in poor condition ; its not the root of the problem . <p> There are several factors involved in this issue and " throwing tax dollars at the problem " is not going to solve the problem by its self . <p> The Army has failed to learn from the other services that have programs that work . Instead they continue to be hard headed and try an re-invent the wheel ! <p> If the Airforce and Navy have programs that work and have for many years , why create new software and procedures when there are already ones in place that work ( available to any DOD service to copy / share . <p> The Army is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind that the Army will still have problems and be in the news for the next 20 years ( concerning barracks and quality of life ) . They just refuse to change . sure they have a lot of news about change and new programs , but management can not correct the problem with correcting the source of the problem , which is the soildier failing to take care of what they have ! <p> More import is the fact that soldiers are not held accountable for standards . Even the ones that have been given new and wonderful quarters have destoryed them ! <p> Keep in mind the the average age of soldiers living in the barracks is about 22 years old ! These young men and women are the best soldiers that our nation has ever seen ! they learn quicker and have stronger skill sets . At the same time they do not a basic life skills ! Meaning that they do not have the motovation to clean-up after themselves ! They wait till very piece of clothing they own is dirty before doing the wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unless we give our military folks laundry service and room service ( hire maids ) , or unless the military gets tough ! This will never change . <p> So why does n't  the military address this issue ? Retention ! The Army leadership feels it has to have it units ( men ) confoned to quarters on-base and living in bulidings that are 200% occupied per DOD standards ( 90sf per man for E4 and below , and 135SF for E-5 ) . <p> Next time you see something on video , ask yourself , if this was management failing to provide quality quarters or soldiers tearing-up what was provided to them ! <p> For the Army to say that its doing something is shameful ! Why ? first of all the idea of unit integerity needs to go away now ! Its actually better for soldiers to interact and live with soldiers from ither units . this issue in its-self it the main cause for the barracks being crowed and also for othe bulidings to be hardly occupied ! <p> Make the chain of command spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them see how the troops act after hours . Many of them have never been in the barracks ! Those that have can count the number of times on two hands ! the chain of command must be active in the barracks areas ( common areas ) . This includes after hours duty sections and duty officers . <p> We have not seen the last of this problem ! Its time to take action on the few that are tearing-up the facilities ! At the same time stop the over crowding of barracks now ! Comply with DOD standards now ! Even if you have to pay BAH to all of the senior E-3 and E-4 soldiers ! 2013 will be here soon ! The Army will not be ready , there is no way that they will meet DOD standards even by 2020 ! <p> Have the barracks being intentionally unmaintained as part of military experience ? I mean , did the boot camp been set up like a sewer as part of hazing ritual to toughen up soldier ? After all , military has been known for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . <p> When the Army has done a lot in the last two weeks to fix up the barracks after the video leak , does that include punishment against those who are responsible for leaking the video footage ? After all , the videographer are technically filming classified information and leaking military secret to the general public , and that can be interpreted as treason . <p> In the Navy , the Executive Officer inspects berthing ( barracks ) every day . Yes , everyone up and down the chain is responsible but requiring the number 2 person in the command to put eyeballs on the living conditions ( daily ) of the most junior sailors ( troops ) ensures that this does n't  happen . <p> Also in the Navy , we assign like units to take care of all the details for returning units . A stateside unit ( battallion for battalion ) should have been assigned and held accountable to ensure details like an abandoned ( for 15 months ) barracks building was up to speed prior to the deployers return . <p> Something like peeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " All these items could have been addressed given the right leadership ( read : does n't  cost a lot of $$ ) . Just about anyone could have picked up a paint brush . How about a welcome home sign ? <p> Hate to tell you Chuck but you 're WRONG on married soldiers not being allowed to stay in barracks . It depends on where they 're stationed , say overseas like we are , when the married soldier is waiting for housing and waiting for his family and there is ROOM , he has a right to have a room in the barracks . <p> As for what has happened , if there 's been an issue since 2002 , this is above and beyond the NCOs , this is up into the brasss failure to take care of the soldiers , once again . Keep blaming the guys who are time and time again fighting for their soldiers but keep getting doors slammed in their faces . The realities is that many of the NCOs at one point in their career lived in barracks , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best given to them . <p> The reason your married son had to un-ass the barracks is because married soldiers are NOT ALLOWED to live in the barracks . They are paid BAH , which is a non-taxable housing allowance . The reason there is n't enough room in the barracks is because someone was n't doing their job , and was letting married soldiers live in the barracks . Even if separated from their spouse , because they draw BAH , the regs are very clear on this . Unless the soldier is mobilized or deployed , married in the barracks is a non-starter . <p> Kudos to the Dad , I do have concern his son will pay a price . This is n't the NCOs fault , the buildings are old and discussion but not action has been going on for years . It is the top brasss fault . Buildings go up here in town in a matter of weeks complete start to finish , no excuse whatsoever for these guys to come home and live in such filth and dysfunction . The military DOES NOT take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in the right direction at least for some . There is no mention of another issue coming from this whole ordeal . My son is station at Fort Bragg lived until Tuesday in a decent barracks . Tues morning he and other married Soldiers were given 2 hours to find another place to live as Soldiers from the " condemned " barracks were being moved to other barracks . Apparently there are not enough rooms . Two hours notice to leave , he had to put his personal belongings in storage and find a motel paying with his own money ! Eventually the housing money will reimburse him and the other married Soldiers . I find this outrageous , at least the Army could have picked up the tab for the motels . I hope this comes to " light " as well , I know I am writing to my Senators to correct this outrageous situation . <p> Way to go , CA ! Youve known about this problem for how many years and your only answer was to tell the soldiers not to sweep ? Ever hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust clouds . <p> You knew about this , you knew it did n't  get fixed , you knew about this again , you knew it did n't  get fixed . <p> Maybe you 're part of the problem . <p> Hows this for a root cause in limited barracks space : the contractors take their sweet-assed time to build the barracks . In the last two years , Ive seen civilian builders working here on the university put up brand new " suites " that could easily house a brigades worth of enlisted . They are VERY nice . Ill bet they 're being paid less than the guys working on Bragg , and there are bonuses for finishing ahead of schedule , and penalties for finishing behind schedule . Anyone know what happens when a contractor goes over estimate on time or budgetthe Army extends their contract , and they work on " insha allah " time . <p> The young mans father had every right to be pissed off , and dads chain of command is dad congress/youtube . Good on him for shining the light , its the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh . I bet he had to cancel his " T-off time " He hates when that happens . <p> I too have a son at Bragg . The only surprise here is that the General pretends to be surprised . He must have made a career of not walking through barracks and ignoring soldiers . <p> I scanned the official response , I bet the only real changes made here is : I am sure BG Denny Rogers will fix this ASAP . First , he will make Ed Frawley%u2019s son sorry he ever let his dad in the barracks . Second , he will enact an order outlawing video cameras in barracks as some kinda operational security issue . Third , he will claim that the problem is fixed .. but it won%u2019t be . <p> CJ , I 'm reading the AP article on this and I do n't  know if you can verify what was quoted with your contacts , but it says , " He said the problems in that building have been fixed and that a final paint job is in the works . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in the 1950s and are scheduled for demolition by 2013 . The barracks singled out by Frawley had been remodeled in April 2006 , Rogers said . " ( emphasis mine ) <p> Does that sound right in comparison to what the video showed ? Was it remodeled but not repaired ? The paint peeling off the pipesthat was just layered and layeredif you 've ever painted , you know what I 'm talking about . *sigh* I 'm frustrated at this story . <p> Good post , I like how you laid the most of the blame for this on the NCO shoulders . Where it BELONGS ! <p> Back when I was a soldier ( 94-99 ) all of my permanent party at Ft Stewart ( bldgs 600 , 700 , 800 ( as they were remodeled and upgraded . ) ) About once a month the CO would do a Pay Day Inspection and every few weeks my NCOs would do a walkthrough . And let me tell you , it was not a happy day when the NCOs or CO were not happy with how we keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not have to have the floor highly shined or our racks made with the OD Green blankets or anything like that . But the wall lockers better close correctly , the floor better be sweep/mopped often enough to be clean and dust free , and that bathroom better pass a white glove check . The Common Area better be orderly . <p> I just don%u2019t see how the ENTIRE NCO chain failed these soldiers since 2002 . How did nothing get reported via the IG , BOSS Line , CO ? Why did the soldiers not report this to the CO , or the Brigade CO , or hell the POST CG ! <p> If these complaints were made and ignored then there is another problem and that still falls on to the NCOs . I don%u2019t see how they could sleep at night knowing that the lower enlisted ( E1-4 ) are living in that sort of hell-hole . How were these items not brought up at NCO-Recalls , and if they are not having NCO-Recalls why not ? I did not know of a single NCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to go on . <p> I do recall one time when the AC unit in my room ( shared with 2 other soldiers ) started leaking water , it took 2 weeks to get fixed , but Housing was working on the issue ( needed to order a new part . But my NCO chain all the way up to 1SG were calling them every few days for a follow up , as was I ( PV2 at that time ) and they quickly capped the system so that it stopped leaking and DPW even helped clean up the mess . I was blow away with how much help and support my NCO chain gave me and my other soldiers . Hopefully this is just like the WRAMC issue and it has been blow out of proportion . <p> I am also glad that the upper leadership is taking responsibility for this issue . And I hope that they are able to resolve the problems that lead to this result . <p> The good thing that came out of this is that the person responsible admited his faults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge will just say that they are being too " complacent " ( to know what I am talking about google " terrorist escape in Singapore " and my goverments response ) . <p> Great post , CJ . One pointyou explain that soldiers are n't  going through the proper complaint channels . Are you telling me that in the hundreds of troops that have lived in those barracks since at minimum 2002 , not a SINLGE ONE did it the right way ? Cuz that seems a bit preposterous . But it is NOT a parents responsibility to follow chain of command stuffit is to care for his or her child and if I was a parent welcoming home my son from a 14 or 15 months in a brutal war zone ( and I know the 82nd has been freakin hammered ) , I would be pissed beyond belief to find those living conditions ( and I 'd embarrass the Army too cuz they SHOULD be embarrassed over this ! ! ) . And guess what.most likely , those tired , worn out/combat fatigued soldiers are gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , that 's a nice welcome home . And they DARE NOT complain because the spotlight is on them now and it will all be " above board , " right ? They will be ordered to keep their mouths shut and get the sh*t squared away . <p> I 'm very dubious of all of this . I cant believe the short sightedness of any of the command at Ft . Bragg that did n't  see this coming after what happened at WRAMC . Blinders on . And againbullsh*t . <p> I am a soldier and a mother of a soldier stationed at Ft Bragg . His unit SUCKS , they do n't  take care of their soldiers and basically retaliate if anyone complains . He never got fully inprocessed , got his meal card 3 months after PCSing there , and could n't even get a mailing address from his unit . They do n't  get their jump pay , travel pay on time and their living conditions are not safe . As a MOTHER I want to go visit his unit and tell them they are an embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would also like to tell them plenty of other things , but I know it would make my sons life a bigger hell than it already is at Bragg . <p> I told him if going through his COC does n't  work there is the IG , but he is n't willing to do it because of retaliation . I explained to him that the idiots get away with this because no one is willing to complain . It is unfortunate that there are so many idiots that have rank and are in charge of soldiers that have no business doing so . Just because you are in the military does n't  mean you have to be miserable which is NOT what some airborne units on Ft Bragg is portraying . Having rank is a privilege not free reign to be an Delta Alpha . <p> Is leaving single soldiers at the mercy of military barracks housing ( and for most single soldiers there IS no other option ) and at the mercy of living in THOSE kinds of conditions a failure of leadership or just one of those " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kind of things ? The CA officer in the comment above says its been like that for a while ( at least several years ) . The father in the video says that the guys who lived there were told NEW BARRACKS were being built . If no contract or construction was started , is this " surprise " one month early return really a justified excuse after 14 months of deployment ? Were they not expecting at least SOME of the soldiers to return to Bragg EVENTUALLY ? ? How is this any different than the WRAMC scandal ? Other than the guys in DC were injured , there IS no difference in my mind , so how do you expect the command above you to handle this situation and correcting the blind eye problem ? <p> Ok , ummm , that was more than one question . I 'm freakin livid , CJ , as I said privately . This is bullsh*t and I call it as such . <p> Oh , and I KNOW its not just at Ft . Bragg . I cant believe other bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pissed parent and youtube can blow stuff wide open after the Walter Reed thing . *sigh* <p> This is not a new issue- I have deployed and redeployed through those same barracks twice since 2002- once to Astan and once to Iraq . Soldiers filed complaints and the post turned a blind eye . Reservist have been forced to use these barracks . The answer lies in the army renting a hotel off base to put Soldiers in while they are training . When I was there , I told my solders to not sweep the floors- the airborne contaminated dust was more dangerous than the dirty floor .

He was quoted in the article and gave his opinion of the latest Woolrich Elite Tactical concealed carry line . <p> " Most of the clothes I used in the past to hide my sidearm looked pretty sloppy and had my girlfriend complaining about my looks , " he disclosed on his blog , Loose Rounds . Later , during the NYT interview he explained why he liked the Woolrich line . " I 'm not James Bond or nothing , but these look pretty nice . " <p> And with that last one-liner , we knew we had to talk to Thompson . Who was this man who so succinctly described what the average gun owner wanted out of CCW apparel ? The answer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started just this year , - Loose Rounds- has taken off . Covering items like firearms and accessories reviews to sharing pertinent news , the blog has easily gained a large following . The- NYT- article has furthered its notoriety , ensuring its readership continues to grow . <p> Shawn takes aim . <h> How long have you been writing for- Loose Rounds ? Do you write for any other blogs ? <p> I , and a friend ( Howard Hatfield ) , started talking about doing a blog around the first of the year . We talk a lot about guns , tactics , gear and self-defense . We came to the conclusion that some of the stuff we say actually turns up some nuggets once and a while and maybe someone would like to hear about it . <p> So we started the blog in early February he had worked on it and got it ready . We went live a short time later . I have not written for any other bogs , but both Howard and I have written a little on websites like ar15.com . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting magazines back in the late 90s now that are no longer published . <h> What is your firearms background ? <p> This is a good question . I started shooting many years ago around age nine . My Dad was always a gun nut and was in the Vietnam War . I always idolized him and guns because of that . He always taught me from a very early age to buy the best guns I could and I would never be let down . His love for his M16 Colt during the war impressed him . He made it a point to teach me how wonderful the system is . I spent a lot of early years hunting and pistol shooting in small matches . <p> Then during college I got to know an accomplished benchrest ( BR ) shooter who was a ballistic reconstruction expert . I worked for him after college for about five years . I was exposed to BR , high-power and bullseye pistol shooting and introduced to some well-known names ( at the time ) in those areas of the shooting world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . During this time I went pretty deep into the high-power and BR world , which led to long range ( LR ) shooting . <p> Locally , I and three others are members of the one mile shot club . After years of LR shooting with a friend in the state police sniper team , we began helping others locally with it . During this time I had also keep up the " tactical " skills of shooting , mainly with the handgun and carbine/AR-15 . Like most others I have been to several carbine and handgun classes through the years and did some part-time gunsmithing on LR bolt guns and 1911s . Recently , I have kept up with all this while sometimes helping my police friend train some of his teammates on the State Police SRT . And of course there are the years of hunting and varmint shooting . <p> Howard , - my partner and co-blogger , is a former infantry Marine that served in Iraq and was wounded . He is a range and safety officer . He is the go-to guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is also knowledgeable on infantry tactics and Systema , the Russian martial art . <h> When did you shoot your first gun ? What was it ? <p> I shot my first gun around eight or nine-years-old , maybe a little younger . My first gun was actually a Colt 1911-A1 surplus gun at 10 years old believe it or not . I spent all of my pre-teen and teenage years shooting " it is all I have ever done . <h> What is your go-to concealed weapon ? <p> My go-to gun is a Colt 1911 XSE- SS .45CP . Its always been a Colt 1911 , but I have carried the stainless XSE for about six years now . For the last two years I have a Colt Rail Gun with SureFire X300 I wear at night for CCW " always with two extra Wilson 10 round mags . <p> Shawns Colt 1911 of choice . <h> In the- New York Times article , you said you were a fan of the Woolrich CCW shirt . What are a few of your other favorite pieces ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator pants . I know most roll their eyes over the name now , but they are really great pants . Of course , I like the ever-present 5.11 pants . <p> This may surprise a lot of people but I was recently given a pair of pants by Craghoppers , which is the brand Bear Grylls wears . I was shocked to find them very tough , comfortable and with plenty of room and pockets in some handy places . They seem pricey but if you see them on a discount I would try them out if you can stand them having the Bear Grylls logo on them. - Since the NYT article , have you received a ton of attention ? If so , is it more on a national level or local ? <p> Yes ! Both on a national and international level . We are read in Vietnam , China , some in the Middle East and Africa . Its growing every day . I think it was over 35 or 40 countries the last time I counted . Some German newspapers reprinted the article a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good look at us . I was even asked for an interview by the BBC , but turned that one down . <h> What is the weirdest question or comment you 've heard someone make about a gun ? <p> That is tough . I have heard a lot of- asinine stuff just like everyone else. - I guess the one that really got me was the " fact " just seeing a gun made people more violent and made them want to hurt others , but of course the top spot is changing every day thanks to- constant left wing blather.

This means that when rain drops or other wet debris hit the jacket , it beads up and can be brushed off . <p> Items deemed " soft shell " come in various forms . The Wild Things ( WT ) Tactical Soft Shell Jacket ( $169.15 ) is no different . Compared to other soft shell jackets I 've experienced , it definitely had more of a stretch factor to it . The jacket is made up of a mixture of nylon and spandex . The material is definitely lightweight and comfortable . <p> For those unfamiliar with WT Tactical , it 's a spinoff of a US-based company that builds technical gear for alpine climbers .

One appears on the lower right-hand forearm and the other on the upper left part of the arm . I found the upper left arm pocket much more accessible and user friendly . Stylistically the pockets are cool ; functionally , though , not so much . The other two zippered hand pockets contain a lightweight mesh lining that is attached to an additional inner pocket , which can be accessed by opening the jacket . <p> My favorite feature on the jacket was the nylon ripstop stow-away hood . It was my first encounter with this type of hood and found it to be quite helpful in minimizing bulk . Accessed by unzipping the collar , the hood provides ample protection in light rain . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will keep you completely dry . <p> Speaking of water repellency , I tested the jackets ability to block moisture using the most extreme method possible " the kitchen sink . I held parts of the jacket under running water and found that it only began to absorb after 15 seconds of direct contact with water . Even though the jacket does n't  claim to be waterproof , it certainly is water repellent . <p> All-in-all , this is a well-constructed soft shell jacket that I will continue to wear for a long time . Plus , it comes in MultiCam , so perhaps I will make an addition to my soft shell collection soon enough .

A safe bet is always the sturdy holster like a Blackhawk SERPA . Also , make sure that it is made for your gun . Universal holsters should be avoided , as they have extra room to allow for various styles of guns . <p> A number of trainers teach the " hard stop , " which means upon finishing shooting , you pull the gun into a high retention position and take a deep breath and relax and then holster .

And he did just that first working on Woolrichs Elite Series and then for his own tactical clothing company in 2008 . <p> Coelho has worked in the firearms industry since the mid-nineties , founding Triton Cartridge , an ammunition company that produced high performance defensive ammunition like the Quik-Shok and Hi-Vel lines . Before his foray into manufacturing tactical gear , Coelho worked at a nuclear generating station outside of New York City as an armed security officer and member of its tactical response team . <p> Because of his amazing ability to talk " tac pants " for hours perhaps , we could n't be in more awe of Coelho or his work . <p> You 've designed and improved upon the design of tactical pants .

You want a pant that gives you the range of motion to allow you to drop down on a knee without the pant being tight in your crotch . You want a pant that allows you to lift your leg without your pant binding . You want a loose fit but not so loose that the fabric gets in your way . We spent a lot of time working on the fit of our pants and listening to the feedback from our team of beta testers .

On Jun 1st , he was killed by an IED in Afghanistan .

Yet sometimes these nicknames come not from adoration , but from pure disdain or infamy . Here are five historical gun names that are , at times , a hybrid of both good and evil . <p> 1 . The Pig <p> It was n't just the M60s appetite for bullets that contributed to its porker of a moniker . The machine guns substantial weight at 23 pounds and unreliability also played a hefty role . The belt-fed machine gun made its debut in 1957 and has been employed by every branch of the U.S. military since . With the ability to shoot up to 1,200 yards , the M60 can be fired accurately at shorter ranges , too , because of its design . <p> 2 . Burp Gun <p> This gaseous nickname for the German MP38 and MP40 , according to the Urban Dictionary , comes from its resemblance to a classic gun toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no joke . Developed in Nazi Germany , the submachine gun was used by paratroopers , platoon and squad leaders along with other troops during World War II . Both weapons were a more simplified version of the MP 36 , which was constructed from machined steel . <p> 3 . Bloop Tube <p> Wed be lying if we told you that Bloop Tube was the only nickname for the M79 grenade launcher . Its also referred to as Thumper , Thump Gun , Blooper and Wombat Gun . We just like Bloop Tube the best because its fun to say . Originating in the United States , the M79 struck a chord with American soldiers in the 1960s calling it " the platoon leaders artillery . " While popular at one time , it was soon replaced by the M203 because of its weight and single-shot ability . <p> 4 . Hitlers Chain Saw <p> Tacking " Adolf Hitler " to any name gives it an immediate ominous connotation . However , the pairing of it with " chain saw " makes it that much more menacing . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most terrifying infantry weapons " in Nazi Germany . With the ability to fire 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute , its no wonder they compare the MG 42s sounds to the revving of a chain saw . <p> 5 . Plumbers Nightmare <p> World War II soldiers had a love-hate relationship with the Sten gun , particularly the Mark II variant , because it was n't the most reliable gun to carry on the battlefield ( jamming , random discharging , etc . ) . Especially detested by frontline troops , the submachine gun earned a few names : Plumbers Nightmare , Plumbers Abortion or Stench Gun . Created in the United Kingdom , Stens were also used in the Vietnam War and Korean War .
