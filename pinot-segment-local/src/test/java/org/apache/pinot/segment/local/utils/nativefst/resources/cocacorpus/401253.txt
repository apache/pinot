Kenneth may have succeeded to the throne of the Picts through his mother , as the Picts followed the custom of matrilinear succession to kingship . At any rate , he made good his claim by conquering the Picts , becoming the first King of Scots . From Kenneth MacAlpin are descended all the Kings of Scotland , save for the interlude of Macbeth and Lulach , as we shall see . <p> Sometime in the century after the reign of Kenneth , the branch of the Tribe of Loarn headed by Ruadri moved into the province of Moray . Moray is the land south of the Moray Firth , around the present-day town of Elgin . The leader of the Moraymen was called a mormaer , which is a Celtic title equivalent to the Anglo-Scandinavian earl , which we use today . <p> The descent of the MacKays through the mormaers of Moray begins as follows : Ruadri was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruadri had a son Cathmail , who had a son Donald , who had a son Morgan , who had a son Donald , who had a son Ruadri. 5 <p> This latter Ruadri had three sons : Findlaech , Maelbrigte , and Donald . It is Donald who is believed to be the male ancestor of what was to become the Clan MacKay . The only evidence concerning Donald which we have is an addition to the medival Book of Deer . In it , we find written the following : " Donald , Ruadri 's son , and Malcolm , Culen 's son , gave Biffie to God and to Drostan. " 6 What this means is that Donald gave title to land over to the Abbey of Deer , along with the younger son of Culen , the King of Scots from 967 to 971 . This incident is referred to in Burke 's Guide to the Royal Family , where the author notes " Malcolm , co-benefactor with Donald MacRuadri of Moray of the Abbey of Deer ca around 1000. " 7 <p> Concerning the brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the father of Macbeth , who became King of Scots . Maelbrigte was the father of Malcolm and Gillacomgain . Up until 1020 , it seems that Findlaech was mormaer of Moray . In that year , the following event is noted in the Tigernach Annals : " Findlaech , Ruadri 's son , mormaer of Moray , was slain by the sons of his brother Maelbrigte. " 8 Malcolm , eldest of the sons of Maelbrigte , succeeded to the title of the uncle whom he had murdered , but he subsequently was killed in 1029 . Gillacomgain then became mormaer of Moray . Gillacomgain made a very advantageous alliance when he married Gruoch , grand-daughter of Kenneth III , the King of Scots from 997 to 1005 . This advanced the claim of the House of Moray to the throne of Scotland . Gillacomgain and Gruoch had a son , Lulach . The mormaer himself did not long enjoy this heightened influence , for in 1032 , the following befell him : " Gillacomgain , Maelbrigte 's son , the mormaer of Moray , was burned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mormaership then passed to Macbeth , cousin of Gillacomgain and son of Findlaech . Macbeth quickly strengthened his rule by marrying the widow of Gillacomgain , Gruoch , in that same year , 1032 . But Macbeth aspired to greater things than the leadership of the Moraymen . He became a commander in the army of Duncan I , King of Scots from 1034 to 1040 . What happened next differs in the accounts put forward by the supporters of Macbeth , or by the supporters of Duncan . The ultimately victorious Duncan camp has largely succeeded in putting over the view that Macbeth murdered Duncan in an infamous act of betrayal , at Bothnagowan ( which is now called Pitgaveny ) near Elgin , on the 14th of August , 1040.10 After Duncan 's death , though , Macbeth ruled Scotland for seventeen years , a fact which shows that he had widespread support , and was an able king . His position was so secure , that the Annals show he made a pilgrimage to Rome , where he distributed alms to the poor . Macbeth may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kenneth III , but he also had pretensions in his own right . He was the mormaer of Moray , a House which claimed the throne of Scotland by the Celtic law of tanistry . His mother may have been Donada , the second daughter of Malcolm II , King of Scots from 1005 to 1034. 11 If this was the case , then Macbeth 's claim was on a par with Duncan I 's , who was the son of Bethoc , eldest daughter of Malcolm II . In any event , the interlude of the House of Moray on the throne of Scotland was not to last long . The son of Duncan I , Malcolm Canmore , took revenge for the murder of his father , and slew Macbeth in battle at Lumphanan , Aberdeenshire , on the 15th of August , 1057.12 Macbeth was buried on Iona , alongside the Kings of Scots and Dalriada . <p> The Moraymen did not give up their claim to the throne , or cease from pressing it . They put forward Lulach , the son of Macbeth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Stone of Destiny at Scone , and proclaiming him king in 1057 . The tide was against them , though , and the reign of Lulach was a brief one . We find Lulach referred to as " The Simple " --- again , by the victors in this struggle , so he may only have been ill-fated . Once again , Malcolm Canmore revenged himself upon the House of Moray , and killed Lulach in battle at Essie in Strathbogie on the 17th of March , 1058. 13 Lulach had reigned for a mere seven months . Malcolm Canmore became Malcolm III , King of Scots , and the House of Moray was never again to lead the Scottish kingdom . <p> The fight continued , though , in various guises , for almost two hundred years . Lulach had two children : a son , Maelsnectan , and a daughter . Maelsnectan became mormaer of Moray on the death of his father in 1058 , and must have continued the rebellion against Malcolm III , for we find that in 1078 he was expelled from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and died in 1085 . The daughter of Lulach married Aedh , and it is with this Aedh that the male descent of the MacKays continues . <p> As in the case of Donald , Ruadri 's son , there is scant evidence concerning Aedh . The Reverend Angus MacKay , in his invaluable work , The Book of MacKay , has this to say about Aedh : <p> The next Earl* of Moray was Aed , who married the daughter of Lulach . Little is known of Aed . He is identified as the Earl Aed who witnessed charters by King David I , son of Malcolm III . Whatever he may have been during the chequered years which immediately followed the death of Canmore in 1093 the fact that he witnessed royal charters later on may indicate that he lived at peace with King David . He also appears to have become Earl of Moray in virtue of his marriage with Lulach 's daughter , and may have sprung from a collateral noble family of Moray.14 <p> * about this time the old Gaelic title Mormaer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation in this last sentence is borne out by Burke 's Guide to the Royal Family , which has the following entry for the issue of Lulach : " A daughter , married Aedh ( or Heth ) , Mormaer of Moray in 1078 , possibly great-grandson of Donald , yst youngest son of Ruadri , Mormaer of Moray . " 15 In the lack of contrary evidence , Table 3 shows Aedh as the great-grandson of Donald . Aedh became mormaer , or Earl , in 1078 , when Maelsnectan was expelled ; in that same year he married the daughter of Lulach , who was Maelsnectan 's sister . If he signed charters of David I , then Aedh must have remained Earl until after 1124 . <p> Aedh had three children : two sons , Angus and Malcolm , and a daughter , Gruaidh . Angus was Earl of Moray after his father . He revived the Moray claim to the throne , and raised an army against King David I in the year 1130 . At the time , the king was absent at the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of his constable , Edward , the son of Earl Siward . Battle was joined at Stracathro in Forfarshire , and the Moraymen were defeated by the royal army . Angus , the Earl , was slain , along with 4000 of his men . The title passed to his brother , Malcolm , who carried on with the struggle . <p> Malcolm was known as MacEth ; " Eth " or " Heth " is the equivalent of the Gaelic " Aedh " : Malcolm 's father . After the defeat in 1130 , Malcolm MacEth fled to the Western Isles of Scotland , where his cause was taken up by Somerled , the powerful Regulus of Argyll ( later to become Lord of the Isles ) . Malcolm married Somerled 's sister , and the two men raised an army to press the Moray claim to the throne . To resist this force , King David called for help from the English barons of the border district . The threat of this army advancing northwards proved sufficient to thwart the Moraymen , and Malcolm MacEth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherents in 1134 . For the next twenty-three years , Malcolm was imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle . <p> The daughter of Aedh , Gruaidh , married William , the only son of Duncan II , King of Scots in 1094 . The Earldom of Moray was forfeited by Malcolm MacEth when he was imprisoned in 1134 , and King David I bestowed it upon his half-nephew William . If he hoped by this measure to end the rebellion of the Moraymen , he was quickly proved wrong , for the children of William showed that their loyalty lay with their mother 's House , and they took part in the coming rebellions alongside the son and grandson of Malcolm MacEth . <p> The male descent of the MacKays follows Malcolm MacEth and his descendants . Malcolm MacEth had a son named Donald , who found himself head of the Moraymen when his father was imprisoned in 1134 . Donald MacEth retained the support of his uncle , Somerled , and together they fought the royal forces until 1156 . In that year , King Malcolm IV , who reigned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somerled had made , amongst which was the Isle of Man . Somerled , in turn , showed how little the claims of his nephew meant to him by handing him over to King Malcolm . Donald MacEth was captured at Whithorn , and was sent to join his father in Roxburgh Castle . No more is recorded of Donald MacEth , and presumably he died in prison . His father , though , was released the following year , in 1157 , and given the Earldom of Ross , a lesser title than that of Moray . Malcolm MacEth did not stay long in the favour of King Malcolm IV , for the records show he was recaptured in 1160 and blinded.16 The unfortunate Earl Malcolm died in prison on the 23rd of October , 1168,17 having spent thirty years of his life as a prisoner . <p> Beginning in 1160 , Malcolm IV and his brother and successor William the Lion expelled the Moraymen from the province of Moray . Most of them fled over the mountains of Ross , north into Strathnaver . From this group came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harold , the Norse Earl of Caithness . The wife of Harold was Gormlath , who was the daughter of Malcolm MacEth . She was a staunch enemy of the Scottish king who had imprisoned her father and brother , and she helped to carry on the rebellion in the far north of Scotland . <p> The last member of the Royal House of Moray to press his family 's claim to the throne of Scotland was Kenneth MacEth . Kenneth was a grandson of Malcolm MacEth , 18 and so he was a son or nephew of Donald MacEth . By this time , though , the line of MacEth was not powerful enough to even lead the dispossessed Moraymen . That honour went to Donald Ban Macwilliam , a grandson of Gruaidh , Aedh 's daughter . The King of Scots , Alexander II , who reigned from 1214 to 1249 , sent an army under Ferquhard Macintagart to fight the Moraymen . To this Ferquhard had gone the title of Earl of Ross , when it was taken from Malcolm MacEth upon his recapture in 1160 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moraymen in 1215 . Both the commander , Donald Ban Macwilliam , and Kenneth MacEth were killed in battle . <p> At one time , the mormaers of Moray were effectively independent princes in their province . Two centuries of rebellion , though , against the royal house of Kenneth MacAlpin 's descendants , had destroyed their power . The Earldom of Moray was lost in 1134 , and even the minor fief of Ross was taken away in 1160 . By 1215 , the House of Moray was both exiled and defeated . Once the hopeless dream of kingship was given up , though , the descendants of Aedh began to thrive in their new home of Strathnaver . <p> To summarise the descent of the MacKays from the time of Ruadri : as we have seen , Ruadri was the mormaer of Moray ; he had a son Donald , the co-benefactor of the Abbey of Deer around 1000 ; Donald had a greatgrandson Aedh , who married the daughter of Lulach , King of Scots , and became mormaer of Moray in 1078 ; Aedh had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of his brother Angus in 1130 , was imprisoned and deprived of Moray in 1134 , released and given the Earldom of Ross in 1157 , recaptured and deprived of Ross in 1160 , and died in 1168 ; Malcolm MacEth had a son Donald MacEth , who led the Moraymen after his father 's capture in 1134 , and himself was imprisoned in 1156 . Donald had a son , or perhaps nephew , Kenneth MacEth , who was killed in battle in 1215 . Table 3 gives the genealogy of the House of Moray . Appendix A is the pedigree of the Kings of Scots from 858 to 1249. 
@@6829719 @29719/ <h> ( to 501 A.D. ) <p> The earliest beginnings of the Scottish people are also those of the MacKays . Around the time the Romans were in Britain ( 55 B.C. to 409 A.D. ) , there were two races occupying what is today Scotland : the Picts and the Britons . These Celtic peoples had successfully resisted the Roman legions , and what the Romans called Caledonia was never incorporated into the Empire . As a result , very little is known about these early inhabitants , apart from brief descriptions by Roman writers . As the Romans withdrew from Britain , these north islanders were faced with new invaders . These were the Scots from Ireland , and the Angles from Germany . It is with the Scots that we are concerned , for it is they who finally succeeded in conquering Scotland , uniting its peoples and giving them their line of kings . From these Scots we can also trace the descent of what became the Clan MacKay . <p> The Scots came from a kingdom in Ireland which was known as Dalriada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Ireland . Very little is known about the kings of Dalriada apart from their names . These are found in two medival sources , the Book of Ballymote and the Pedigree of the Scottish Kings . It should be noted that these sources were not written contemporaneously with the events which they describe . Often , they are copies of original material which is now lost to us , and they were written centuries after the fact . It is difficult to verify the information they give with supporting evidence , which makes the accuracy of that information doubtful . The list of the kings of Dalriada should therefore be regarded as legendary . <p> The Book of Ballymote gives 38 names in its genealogy , all presented as the direct line of kings . It begins with the name Angus Turbech of Tara . Tara , incidentally , is the ancient hall of the High Kings of Ireland . It is on a hill in County Meath , +ire , and its mention in a list of Kings of Dalriada implies that the Dalriada , or " race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Angus was High King from 384 to 325 B.C. , according to the Annals of the Four Masters . The genealogy ends with the name of Fergus , the son of Erc . With Erc we are on firmer ground : he was a king of Dalriada who died around 501 A.D .. The Pedigree of the Scottish Kings contains 25 names , and differs somewhat from the Book of Ballymote . The last eight names , though , from Sen-chormac to Fergus , are the same . The two lists of the kings of Dalriada will be found in Table 1 . <p> The Dalriada crossed the North Channel from Ireland to Kintyre in Scotland , eventually establishing a kingdom around Argyll . The first record of this migration is in 258 A.D. , when the Romans noted that Scots from the north attacked south as far as London .

Conventional electron microscopy , both TEM and SEM is carried out in vacuo . For this reason , the samples under study must not release gases or vapours inside the microscope . In TEM this is achieved by embedding dehydrated samples in a resin and sectioning them or by examining metal-carbon replicas . In SEM , the samples are either dried or frozen at a very low temperature ( -100C or lower ) and examined at the low temperature ( cryo-SEM ) . <p> A new system of environmental scanning electron microscopes has recently been introduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples . In food science this will be particularly important for foods which retain cellular structure such as fruits and vegetables and foods which have a low water content such as seeds , bakery products or meats . Both useful and harmful fungi ( moulds ) on foods will now be studied undisturbed by fixation or drying procedures . <p> Most of my earlier studies were concerned with milk products.Milk appears " empty " under an optical microscope because the major protein ( casein ) is in the form of micelles , about 0.1 m in diameter , i.e. , below the resolution power of the optical microscope . Milk products such as yogurt and cheese originate through the coagulation of the casein micelles . Heating of milk at &gt;85C alters the casein micelle surface . -Lactoglobulin , as one of the two major whey proteins , interacts with ? -casein and the complex adheres to the micellar surface where it prevents the micelles from indiscriminate coagulation .

The characteristic SEM property of showing only surfaces is no hindrance since new surfaces may be produced by fracturing the sample . There are two ways to fracture a sample : <p> Dry fracturing breaks the sample at its weakest points . The resulting surface has a rough topography and the image is biased .

Located in the middle lamella between plant cells , pectin binds the cells together . Its degradation in ripening fruits loosens the cells and results in the softening of the fruits . Pectic substances have gelling properties and are thus used in the preparation of jams and jellies . Pectin filaments in a gel are considerably more difficult to visualize than protein chains in yogurt or tofu . Unlike proteins , polysaccharides are difficult to . Replication of freeze-fractured gels with platinum and carbon is probably the best method to obtain artifact-free images .

A filter holder with a fine stainless steel mesh as part of the Millipore Swinney Stainless , 13 mm filter ( Cat . No . XX30 012 00 ) filtration syringe ) has proven to be very useful when mounted on a vacuum flask using a short flexible tubing . The flask is attached to a vacuum line through a cotton wool filter and a valve . Bacterial suspensions are applied through a pasteur pipette onto an inclined filter . A greater volume of the suspension is filtered through the lower part of the filter , which means that the bacterial layer is thinnest at the top part and is thickest at the lowest part of the filter . Thus , there develops an area with the most desirable density of the bacteria somewhere on the filter . The bacterial layer changes the reflectivity of the filter surface . With some experience , the laboratory worker will always achieve the proper density of the bacteria on some part of the filter .

It is a liquid at the temperature of its boiling point . When a specimen is immersed into it , an insulating layer of gas surrounds the specimen and decelerates the freezing rate . There are several procedures to improve the freezing rate . Better cryogens such as Freons are environmentally harmful and their use has been discontinued . However , freezing in liquid nitrogen is not detrimental to specimens impregnated with ethanol since this solvent does not produce ice crystals when frozen . Thus , there is no risk of developing freezing artifacts . The frozen samples ( 1x1x10 mm ) immersed in liquid nitrogen are fractured using a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ) . ( The easiest way to obtain them was to insulate regular tools in the laboratory . ) The fragments are picked up one by one and thawed in absolute ethanol at ambient temperature and are subsequently critical-point dried ( CPD ) . The fracture planes are shiny under reflected light and they should face up when the fragments are mounted on aluminium SEM stubs . Double-sided sticky tape on the face of an SEM stub facilitates their positioning . Minute droplets of a conductive silver cement at the proper viscosity are then carefully painted on the side walls of the fragments to attach them to the tape . A cement too thick may not properly adhere to the specimen whereas a cement too thin may soak into the specimen and ruin it . The fragments acquire electrically conductive surfaces after they are sputter-coated with a 20 nm layer of gold . They are then ready to be examined by SEM .

I can imagine the feelings of despair if a patient gradually loses his/her vision and fears the loss of sight , because my grandfather died blind and my mother started to lose her vision a few years before a similar problem afflicted me . For many years , even before developing my own problems , I have been contributing to Operation Eyesight Universal , a charitable organization which helps to restore the sight to people in underdeveloped countries . The Canadian National Institute for the Blind is another charitable organization ; it assists Canadians . Now I myself had undergone 3 eye operations , all very successful . Certainly , each individual 's situation is unique . However , the following text and images should encourage everyone , who is scheduled to have his/her sight improved or restored , to face the operation with confidence in the surgeon 's skills and with faith in success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unusual light reflections in one of my microscopes , I had been able to follow what had been happening in my eyes . That may appear scary but advances in ophthalmology have changed the fearful situation into a unique and encouraging experience . Thanks to eye surgeons , I still read ( born in 1929 ) without glasses , I still do microscopy , and I see well even at a distance whereas otherwise I would have been blind . Since I am now almost 88 years old and drive a car in the province of Ontario , I must pass a vision test and a graphic test for the signs dementia every second year . Vision requirements are specified here : A visual acuity as measured by Snellen Rating that is not poorer than 20/50 , with both eyes open and examined together with or without the aid of corrective lenses ; and A horizontal visual field of at least 120 continuous degrees along the horizontal meridian and at least 15 continuous degrees above and below fixation , with both eyes open and examined together . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War 2 . I remember his last years when he used to visit an ophthalmological university department in my hometown in Czechoslovakia . The good professor of ophthalmology promised that a treatment will be started when the cataract " fully matures " . Grandpa understood that he himself will " mature " before the cataract will , so there will be no need for any treatment . He was right as there was no treatment for this dreaded affliction at that time . <p> My mother started to lose her sight when she became an octogenarian . At that time in the nineties of the past century , there was already a treatment - lens replacement . My mother did not believe in it and refused any suggestion that her sight could be restored . " Who has ever heard about operating an eye ? And in an old person ? When would the wound heal - if ever ? " She died at the beginning of 2005 and until that time she was able to read my printed letters thanks to having her diseased lenses replaced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her 98th birthday in the summer of that year . <p> And myself ? In the nineties , although I was still relatively young ( slightly over 60 ) , I noticed that every window had very soft outlines when viewed from a room . The light from outside was shining over the window edges . It was clear to me that I have inherited a susceptibility to cataract development from my mother . Unlike my grandpa , however , I knew that there was a cure . <p> As a microscopist , now living in Canada , I was able to follow the development of a cataract in my left eye . It was scary to see twice a month how a yellowish blob was spreading from the left upper corner of the eye , eventually reaching the centre ( Fig. 1 ) . ( The image could not be photographed - it was drawn from what I saw in my microscope ) . An optometrist confirmed that a cataract was developing and referred me to an ophthalmologist , who suggested surgery . It is a little weird to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him not to have surgery lest he was willing to lose his sight completely . That was my case . <p> Fig. 1 . Development of a cataract as a patient may see it because of reflections when looking into a microscope <p> Fig. 2 . My lens ( white object ) is being broken down and the eye is washed with a solution ( swirls ) <p> The 30-minute surgery , done under local anaesthesia , was interesting to follow . I saw how the lens was disintegrating . It appeared as a white block tumbling in the eye and gradually decreasing in size on a blue background . Occasionally there were swirls seen ( Fig. 2 ) as the eye was washed with a solution by the surgeon or her assistant . At that time ( 1993 ) , the opening in the eye was about 6 mm long and was closed with stitches after the insertion of a plastic lens . At that time , a plastic lid was used to protect the eye from accidental contact with a hard object and a few painkiller pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour returned very soon but there was a feeling that blue hues were more prominent . Reading was restored 6 weeks later after the stitches had been removed . I greatly appreciated the fact that the new lens allowed me to read without glasses . <p> Being an example for my Mom . Of course , I wrote my Mom about the success of my operation . She became excited and wanted to have both her eyes operated as soon as possible . In Canada , the operation was done in half an hour and then I was released to go home . Mom , however , stayed in a Czech hospital after surgery for two weeks . At her age it suited her better than to be released immediately and then to take care of herself . She was very happy with the result and described it as a return from the world of darkness back into the world of light and colours . Interestingly , without my affliction and decision to undergo surgery , she would be blind as her father had been . <p> Nowadays , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading cause of blindness in middle and low income countries and the second leading cause of visual impairment ( after myopia , hyperopia , and astigmatism ) . Cataracts affect about 24 millions of Americans 40 years old and older . At the age of 80 years , 50% of Americans have cataracts . More than 95% of surgeries are successful with fewer than 5% of cases experiencing complications such as inflammation , bleeding , infection and retinal detachment . <p> Fig. 3 . A laser beam is used to cut the membrane on the new plastic lens a year after its insertion . <p> Fig. 4 . The membrane retracts as the cut widens forming a window to view the world clearly again . <p> A year after my first surgery , a membrane started to cover the new lens in an attempt of the body to reject it . Laser surgery made a line of tiny holes in the membrane until it ruptured . Fig. 3 at left shows the colour flashes seen during surgery but not the formation of the holes in the membrane . I observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ophthalmologist . The ruptured membrane retracted towards the perimeter of the lens and the hole formed again opened for me an unobstructed view of the world . I am able to see the hole in the membrane by looking into one of my microscopes . It took several years until the hole was enlarged to the present state indicated by the last image in the animated series in Fig. 4 at right . <p> A few years later , my right eye had a similar problem . In 1997 , however , there was an option to pay $200 and obtain a different kind of lens by a more sophisticated surgical procedure . Later this surcharge was abolished . This second operation lasted for only 15 min. , the wound was only 3 mm long , and there was no need for stitches . I was able to read and drive the car on the next day after check-up by the surgeon . The operation was done so quickly that very little except the overhead lights was seen during that time . <p> Two years later in the fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain suddenly struck my left eye and the flow of tears could not be controlled . I had to discontinue my work . A few days later , an ophthalmologist checked my sore eye . She asked me whether I suffered from diabetes or high blood pressure . No diabetes - but I used to take pills against high blood pressure . The doctor referred me to the Eye Institute of the Ottawa Hospital with a suggestion to have my retina checked . <p> A membrane on my retina ? The first examination at the Eye Institute revealed , in addition to my eye disorder , high blood pressure ( although I use to take two kinds of medication ) . Fortunately , my family doctor found a more efficient combination of medicines - but it took some time . After my blood pressure had been stabilized within normal limits , I had another examination at the Eye Institute . As part of the examination , an angiogram ( Fig. 5 ) was obtained by injecting a fluorescent dye in a vein in the back of my hand and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Consequently , the surgeon concluded that I suffered from epiretinal membrane rather than the more severe macular degeneration that I was concerned about . Whatever I looked at did not appear as sharp in the centre of the eye as a few months ago . The epiretinal membrane somewhat obstructed my view . <p> Fig. 5 . An angiogram of the afflicted retina shows the distribution of fluorescein in the veins 32.2 s after injection . <p> Fig. 6 . An angiogram of the afflicted retina a year later shows deterioration in the central region . ( This image was obtained 35.3 seconds after the administration of fluorescein ) . <p> Radical treatment suggested The surgeon suggested surgery as the only effective treatment of my disorder . This time , unlike with the cataract surgeries , I was very cautious . It would be a " scalpel " surgery - opening the eye through the sclera , draining the vitreous , replacing it with gas , lifting the membrane away from the retina and removing it using a sophisticated pair of tweezers . Were there any risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves risk . In this case , infection , detachment of the retina , even a rupture of the retina could be encountered although the probabilities were very low . The doctor was frank . So far , no infection has ever afflicted any of his patients . The other risks were small but real . I decided to wait - but that was no solution since the membrane was expected to grow , thicken , and eventually affect the underlying retina . If delayed for too long , surgery would not restore my original sight . <p> It took me another year before I called the Eye Institute if surgery was still possible - and was offered it promptly after another angiogram ( Fig. 6 ) confirmed deterioration of my sight . <p> Surgery Following pre-surgery tests , I entered the Eye Institute on October 10 , 2000 at 10 a.m . I knew that there would be no overnight stay in the hospital and that my wife would pick me up with her car after surgery . Interestingly , other patients had their relatives or friends waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife in the waiting room , I was asked , if I was a lonely man . Well , my wife and I just viewed this situation differently from others . <p> Dressed in a hospital gown and lying on a bed with wheels , I was briught into the operating room just before the noon . There , the atmosphere was very friendly . I greeted all four members of the surgical team , i.e. , the surgeon , the anesthesiologist , and two surgical assistants . Then I moved my body from the bed onto the operating table and the operation could have started . <p> Fig. 7 . The instruments subsequently seen inside the eye during surgery : vacuum pipe ( bottom left ) , gas pipe to lift the membrane ( middle ) , a pair of tweezers to remove the membrane ( top ) . Tiny blue beads of an antibiotic were the last to enter the eye ; tiny black dots separated from them and moved " up " . <p> First , however , an intravenous needle was inserted into the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made of plastic and could be bent ) but I remained fully conscious and tried to remember the outlay of the overhead lights . <p> Soon I saw blue and yellow colours dancing in my left eye and a small rod entering the interior of the eye . Evidently , draining of the vitreous had started and I asked if also a large float would be removed . With a relief I saw it soon disappear . Then sharply bent rod appeared in the eye . Perhaps to lift the membrane with gas ? Only then I saw that the membrane was indeed there , covering a relatively small part of the centre of the field of vision . It had a reticulated structure . ( The gas that was used to fill the eye was sulfur hexafluoride , SF6 ) . And then a sophisticated pair of tweezers entered the scene ( Fig. 7 ) , capturing the membrane and pulling it out . If I remember correctly , this procedure was repeated twice or three times . After that the tools were no more visible but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny blue beads in a stream entered the eye . Minute black dots seemed to separate from the beads and to move in a different direction . " What were they ? " I asked the surgeon and he explained that this was an antibiotic . In fact , I asked various questions during the operation ( and received explanation ) . I overheard the staff mentioning that I was quite an exceptional patient interested in all steps of the operation . After the eye had been closed with stitches and protected with a plastic lid taped in place , I moved my body back on the hospital bed , thanked the surgical team , and was hauled out of the operating room to the recovery room . There I was disconnected from the intravenous bottle . My blood pressure was somewhat elevated ( 160/90 ) but soon my belongings were brought to my bed . I dressed , now keeping my head facing down , and after sitting in a chair ( my option ) for a few minutes , I was told that my wife had arrived ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hauled in a wheelchair to her car parked in front of the Institute entrance . At 2:45 p.m. , one hour after surgery , I was at home in my bed following the advise to lie and even to sleep with my head facing down for a minimum of 90% of the day until the gas was replaced with my own vitreous . <p> Fig. 8 . Two days after surgery , the eye was swollen <p> On the next day before check-up , an eye technologist removed the lid from my eye and I was advised to use it for protection only at night . To my amazement , the technologist asked me to read the letters on the typical eye examination light box . All I saw was a milky fog . Or was it ? It was even more amazing that I saw the largest letter E. Then the surgeon examined my eye and was satisfied with what he saw although to me and my wife the eye looked awful ( Fig. 8 ) . <p> With the head facing down - most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to drink juice , tea , and even milk . There were no problems in the bathroom either . In fact , the toilet bowl was a measure of the progress how the gas was replaced with the vitreous . Immediately after surgery , the entire bowl was obscured with the milky disk in the operated eye ( when the good eye was closed ) . Gradually the bowl became better visible through the translucent disk ... <p> No pain in the eye or anywhere else . The next check-up was scheduled a week later . It is very pleasant to note that I had absolutely no pain in the eye either during or after surgery and that I did not need any painkiller whatsoever . A band around the milky centre in the eye started to expand and I was able to see things in the bedroom and bathroom . The milky part turned very soon after surgery into a translucent disk which made me feel as if looking through water . The border with the transparent band indicated that it was the level line and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile liquid centre , through which at least large subjects could be seen , decreased each day a little until about 12 days after surgery , there was only a small bubble remaining . Occasionally , with the movement of my head , one or two very small bubbles separated from it and soon merged with it again . It is interesting to note that initially it was the liquid in the eye that was perceived and latter a bubble became prominent as the eye was almost fully filled with the liquid . Two weeks after the surgery , there was no bubble in the eye whatsoever , so the following day I drove to work , where I spent a part of the day reading e-mail messages . A look into one of the microscopes revealed a crystal clear vitreous . What a difference from my 71 years old vitreous in the right eye ! If I were younger with a prospect for a long career in microscopy , I would certainly ask to have the " good eye " drained to replenish it with a fresh clear vitreous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gradual return of three-dimensional vision when using a dissecting microscope has improved my ability to mount specimens for scanning electron microscopy as well as my ability to focus images obtained by transmission electron microscopy . Another examination two months after surgery showed an improvement in my sight and a new angiogram confirmed the success of the operation . <p> In the spring and in the summer my sight was gradually improving although it did not regain the ability to read regular newspaper text . However , larger text could be read as well as the license plates of cars before me - without glasses . Then my sight started to deteriorate . Had I been informed about the existence of the Amsler Grid , I could have checked what was getting wrong . It was a friend of mine who told me about it . The grid may be found at several Web sites . The grid may easily be printed from the Website or the text may consist of large letters to read more easily for people with eye problems . Yannuzzi modification of the grid is smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both grids are useful to detect early defects in the retina . In my case , the distortion of the grid was substantial but I do not know what it could have shown me a year ago . <p> How I saw the Yannuzzi Grid in February 2002 . In 2008 , the distortions are considerably smaller and there is only a small " blind spot one square diagonally to the right and up from the centre . <p> When I looked at the Yannuzzi card with my operated eye in March 2002 , I saw the white dot in the centre but the grid appeared distorted , higher at the right margin than at the left . In addition , I saw a dark gray cloud as shown in the diagram at left . By focussing elsewhere on the grid , the cloud moved along . This indicated to me that the retina has been warped and distorted off centre . Lately , this gray spot may also be seen if I use only the operated eye and look at some prominent points of interest like a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and to the left . Then the small object " disappears " . Fortunately , this bad vision is only around the centre of vision whereas I see things , though not focussed , farther out in all directions . My right eye has good vision and I am still able to read newspapers without glasses . I have been doing electron microscopy with no problem but this is because large SEM images are observed on a computer monitor . TEM work is somewhat more difficult , particularly because it involves an ultramicrotome where a diamond knife is manipulated to cut thin sections . Some 20 sections are then captured on a " grid " - a dense mesh 3 mm in diameter . The work is done using a microscope . My deteriorated vision in the left eye then tires my sight . The vitreous in the " good eye " has been developing translucent filaments which move like light curtains in a breeze when I look down a particular light microscope . <p> I protect my eyes from the sun by dark glasses . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could I have harmed my eyes in some way ? I used to do copper enamelling every fall for about 20 years ( evenings until midnight ) working red-hot copper pieces in a kiln with the door slightly opened . Every summer , I would be windsurfing and sometimes the sunglasses were not sufficient to reasonably reduce the sun 's glare on the water . A few weeks before the epiretinal membrane developed in my left eye , I was turning the soil in the garden and experienced a sudden pain the left eye with tears flowing down my face . The pain forced me to quit my work . I completed it gradually in the subsequent days but I visited my ophthalmologist only a few weeks later and it took a few months before I was examined by a retina specialist . Would it have been better without the delays ? <p> On April 9 , 2002 , I had another check-up . Two specialists examined me thoroughly , also using multifocal electroretinography ( ERG ) . The surgeon confirmed that my suspicion was correct - there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in only about 5% of patients and I was one of them . Then the surgeon offered me surgery in a few days . This time , there was absolutely no hemorrhaging around the eye , just a little swelling and a week later , nobody who would look in my face would believe that I underwent eye surgery a few days ago . <p> In December 2014 ( half a year after my 85th birthday ) I am still mounting specimens under a dissecting microscope and doing electron microscopy of microorganisms as an Honorary Research Associate . Although I can still read newspapers and view computer monitors without glasses , I feel mor comfortable with reading glasses . Of course , I use glasses for driving . The operated eye has gradually improved although it is not as good as the right eye . Its vitreous , however , is crystal clear as I can see in my Olympus BH-2 optical microscope whereas translucent strings have developed in the other eye which has been my dominant eye . When I asked the ophthalmologist and the eye surgeon whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the stringy vitreous with a clear one , they both responded with a strict " no " because they viewed my question as mischievous , although I was serious . I was told that I have been lucky so far and that I should be satisfied with the state of my eyes . <p> The pressure inside my eyes ( intraocular pressure - IOP ) started to increase with time , although I have been using eye drops ( Cosopt and Brimonidine , twice a day in each eye ) . High IOP would damage the optical nerve and lead to glaucoma . Thus , in September 2008 , I had eye surgery called argon laser trabeculoplasty to improve the drainage system in the eyes . Opening the fluid channels using a laser beam was followed by the application of corticosteroid drops ( 1% prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension ) 4 times a day for 4 days . Eye surgery has again helped me to retain my good sight . <p> In 2013 , my intraocular pressure increased to 18 mm Hg , which is too close to the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes in the evening in addition to Cosopt and Alphagal ( Brimonidine ) . The pressure has consequently normalized . <p> Do I do anything special for my eyes ? For many years , in addition to a regular diet , I have been eating a wide variety of vegetables and taking vitamin pills with lutein every day . ( The " friendly veggies webside " emphasizes that lutein is easily absorbed from egg yolk . ) <p> Acknowledgment I thank my wife Drahomfra for care before and particularly after surgery when I had to sit or lie with my face down all day and night for 2 weeks and for having to cope with manual work which I used to do but was advised by the surgeon to avoid for at least a month after each surgery . <p> Disclaimer : The author is not a health care specialist of any kind .

He advises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole reason for this story is his desire to encourage eye disease sufferers to face their problems with confidence in their doctor and faith in their own healing potential . <p> Eye surgery procedures are completely different in 2011 from what they were 10 years ago . If you are scheduled to have your epiretinal membrane removed , look at it as an opportunity to have your sight restored . Do not postpone surgery , do not procrastinate . The situation may deteriorate with time : An epiretinal membrane or macular pucker is caused by a cellophane-like membrane that grows over the macular surface . In some individuals , this membrane contracts , which results in wrinkling of the retina . The contraction may mechanically irritate the retina and cause retinal swelling .

At that time he was 47 years old , and his father , James Harold MacKay , had died eight years previously . Fortuitously , the New Brunswick form had fields not only for the father 's full name , but also for the father 's age at the birth of the child and his birthplace . These stated that " James H MacKay " was 41 years old when William Elmore MacKay was born on 1 October 1878 , and that he was born in " C H Town P.E.I. " . You can see an image of the form at the New Brunswick Provincial Archives web site here ( note that the record is indexed incorrectly as " MacKay , William Elmire " ) . <p> Putting this information together with the 1911 Census and the death certificate of James Harold MacKay in 1917 saying he was " 80 years old , " I come up with following : <p> James Harold MacKay born 20 April 1837 in Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island married 1 January 1878 in Dorchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 in Pugwash , Nova Scotia <p> Next find records from Prince Edward Island ! <p> Thursday 13 October 2011 17:09:51 EDT <p> " William McKay of Bonaventure district of GaspT " was married to " Mary Ann Warren of New Carlisle " on 14 April 1831 in the Anglican church in New Carlisle , Bonaventure county , GaspT district , Lower Canada ( today , Quebec ) . This is a surprise , as I had always assumed that William MacKay emigrated to Prince Edward Island , and met and married Mary Ann Warren there . It turns out that Mary Ann Warren was probably two years old when her father , James Warren , died , and her mother , Ann ( Beairsto ) ( Murchland ) Warren remarried very soon after that , in 1815 . The widow Ann Warren married John ( Jean ) Rafter of Bonaventure , Quebec , and it is likely that Mary Ann Warren grew up in New Carlise , Quebec , along with her Rafter half-sisters : Margaret , Frances , Sarah Catherine , and Marjory . Mary Ann Warren was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island at the age of two or three , and grew up on the south shore of the GaspT .

He was a gunner in the artillery . He enlisted in the 10th Siege Battery of the Canadian Garrison Artillery , and in France fought with the 5th Field Battery of the 2nd Brigade , which was attached to the 1st Canadian Division . He was not wounded in action , but he was hospitalised for influenza in 1919 , during the pandemic of that year . Upon his discharge , he was awarded a " war service gratuity " of $280 , and declared that he intended to reside in New Waterford , Nova Scotia . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Warren , wife of William MacKay , may have been James Warren of Prince Edward Island . James Warren and Ann Bearstoe baptised their daughter Mary on 29 March 1812 on P.E.I.

Among these is a Dakin cousin , Charles Dayrell Shreve , who won the Military Cross at the Battle of Passchendaele , and who was killed at the Battle of Cambrai .

Both groom and bride were residents of Halifax , and he was a mariner at that time . <p> There still is no definitive proof that Charles Martell 's daughter , Elizabeth Martell , was the Elizabeth who married Paul Burnaby Buckley , and therefore that Peter Buckley is her son . <p> Sunday 24 August 2008 13:15:49 EDT <p> In her book , The Silver Chief : Lord Selkirk and the Scottish Pioneers of Belfast , Baldoon and Red River , Lucille H.

One oft cited claim is that she is the great-granddaughter of Governor Thomas Prence .

The seven known children --- none named Anne --- were all named in his will , according to the Mayflower Families in Progress book on William Brewster . <p> Another claim is that she is the daughter of Samuel Mayo ( ca1625-&lt;1664 ) and Tamsin/Thomasine Lumkin . If so , this is the line of descent : <p> This claim is put forward in Andrew 's The Hamlin Family and elsewhere . The problem is that Thomasine ( Lumpkin ) Mayo had her children from about 1645 until 1664 , and Anne Mayo is likely to have been born in 1684 , at a time when Thomasine was around 58 years old , and Samuel Mayo had been dead for at least 20 years . <p> A final theory is that Anne Mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Canterbury .

Benjamin Hamlin was born 1685 and died 1737 . Here is the purported line of descent : <p> Henrietta M. Spencer died 9 November 1897 in Halifax , Nova Scotia , age 24 , married .

Before you send QSL cards for distribution via this Bureau make sure that : <p> You are an RAC member . <p> Your RAC membership has not expired . You must be an RAC member when the Bureau RECEIVES your QSL cards . <p> You have indicated the call sign for which RAC membership has been paid . This is important if you have recently changed your call sign ( e.g. 3-letter to 2-letter suffix ) or if you have used a special callsign or prefix . <p> You have verified your membership on the RAC WEB page . This is the page we use to check the membership , because it is frequently updated , and expired memberships are automatically deleted . <p> Your club is an RAC Affiliated club in case you submit clubs QSL cards . <p> We check the RAC membership no matter how the VE/VA cards are sent to us : Directly by the members , or via Provincial QSL bureaus . Non-member 's QSL cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all QSL cards to foreign bureaus if the cards have been misdirected in our QSL system . <p> RAC Membership <p> The eligible RAC members are : <p> Individual members who have paid-up their membership . <p> Family members who live at the SAME address as the paid-up member . Family members should always indicate the paid-up member 's call sign . <p> RAC members with several call signs ( even in different VE provinces ) , with the membership paid for at least one call sign . The name should be identical on all QSL cards for all call signs . Always indicate the call of the paid-up membership . <p> Portable operation of the member ( e.g. VE3EXY/2 is accepted since VE3EXY is RAC member ) . <p> ForVE QSL managers the requirement is that the QSL client ( but not necessarily the manager ) is a fully paid-up RAC member . The manager must be a paid up member if he sends his own cards . <p> RAC Affiliation <p> RAC offers QSL card processing to RAC Affiliated clubs . You can find more on club affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the RAC WEB site above . Always indicate the club name as written on the RAC WEB page ( e.g. not KWARC but Kitchener Waterloo Amateur Radio Club ) . <p> Affiliation applies to club 's call sign , not to its members . This means we do not handle QSL cards for members of RAC Affiliated clubs , unless they are RAC members themselves . <p> If the trustee of the club is an RAC member , the club is not automatically affiliated . The RAC affiliation procedure is to be followed . <p> If the club is using a special call sign , indicate the name/call under which the club is affiliated . <p> Frequently check RAC WEB page for your affiliation status . <p> QSL Card Packaging and Mailing Strategy <p> The overall strategy of the QSL bureau is to send QSL cards as frequently as possible , while keeping operating costs as low as possible . The strategy we use is based on minimizing postal expenses through careful packaging . <p> QSL cards are always sent via surface mail to the foreign QSL bureaus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following weights : 250 gr , 500 gr , 1 kg , and 2 kg . We always package as closely as possible to those values , to maintain the desired frequency of QSL cards mailings . However , there are extremes : There are bureaus to which we send QSL cards every two weeks , and others to which we send once in several months when we have accumulated the minimum number of cards for mailing . <p> You should apply a similar strategy when sending QSL cards to the bureau . There are amateurs who send cards every week , others once a year or less . Frequent sending has benefits , in that the probability of missing our mailing to a foreign bureau is minimized . On the other hand , by carefully choosing the weight of the packet , you can minimize your postal expenses . <p> Another benefit of frequent sending is that the foreign amateur will probably get his/her card sooner , and respond sooner , rather than later . <p> Sorting Strategy <p> Sorting QSL cards is definitely the area where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards should be sorted by the order in IARU QSL BUREAUS list , not by the alphabetical order of prefixes . The same IARU list shows all countries where the QSL Bureaux are CLOSED . <p> The most frequent sorting errors are related to US QSL cards sorting . One should remember that there are 11 ( eleven ) QSL Bureaux in the contiguous US states . They match call areas 0-9 , but the W4 call area has two QSL bureaus : one letter prefix bureau , and two letter prefix bureau . In other words N4 , W4 and K4 go to one bureau , all other W4 Area cards in the two-letter prefix bureau . There should not be more than eleven batches of cards for contiguous US bureaux when properly sorted . <p> Note also that US Possessions and Outlying areas have separate bureaus : KP3/4 , KP2 , KH6/7 , KL7 , KH2 . Observe their N , and W pairs ( e.g. NH6=KH6 , WL7=KL7 , etc ) . Cards for countries with several prefixes should be sorted together ( e.g. G and M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards go together ) . <p> You are responsible for finding a DX station 's manager . If you do n't , your cards will end up in the wrong bureaus . Do not expect someone else to do this job for you . We handle tens of thousands of cards and trying to find the manager for each DX QSL card would be an impossible task for the volunteers at the Bureau . <p> Today , finding the QSL manager is much easier than previously . There are many WEB sites , as well as CD-ROMs that serve this purpose . Some WEB sites even have multiple database searches , and provide comparison of search results . Here are a couple of web sites to help finding QSL managers . The list is not considered exhaustive . <p> Once the manager is found , his/her call should be written in the right top corner of the card on the same side as the DX call . The card will be sorted into the QSL bureau of the MANAGER , not the DX stations bureau . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VE3LYC ) would be sorted to the VE3 pile , rather than to VK6 bureau pile . <p> Portable operation should be sent to the ' native ' country . For example , SV5/VE3EXY/P should be sent to the VE bureau , not to the SV bureau , unless specified differently by the DX station . <p> Some Other Tips <p> Here are some other details of QSLing that make handling and processing of QSL cards faster and easier : <p> Special Call Signs : If you are an RAC member , or an RAC-affiliated club , and use a special ( typically unlisted ) call sign , make sure to notify your local QSL bureau . For want of this notification , some cards go through several bureaus before they reach the right one . Sometimes they never reach the operator . <p> Not interested in QSLs ? : If you do not want to claim your cards from QSL Bureau , please notify your Provincial bureau . This will reduce the costs and storage space at the bureaus . <p> 2 kg QSL Cards limit : To limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest stations , currently there is a limit of 2 kg of QSL cards per year/per member . We charge for extra weight . <p> QSLs for Countries without QSL Bureaus : We have listed the countries for which we do not handle QSL cards . Unless you specify a manager served by a bureau , most of these QSL cards will be returned to the sender . Note that we do not send cards to individuals , but to QSL bureaus . Exceptions are some QSL managers for which we know return QSL cards via the bureau . <p> Why is the QSL Bureau so slow ? <p> Sender : Each and every QSO in the log is not necessarily QSL-ed . Some people are not interested , some send QSL cards only to DX stations , and some do not QSL contest QSOs . Some people only respond when they receive a QSL card , or simply do not have cards printed . Also , people have different hobbies and life styles , and may leave QSL writing for ' later ' , typically many months , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs make it easier for sticker printing , and effective QSL card sending . <p> Outgoing VE QSL Bureau : The mailing strategy has already been described . In some cases it can take up to several months before the cards are actually sent from the bureau . In most cases it is much less . In addition , it may take several weeks for the QSL cards to be transported via postal system ( and Customs ) to the DX country 's bureau . <p> Claiming the cards : In many DX countries the principle is much the same as in Canada . Amateurs claim QSL cards from the bureaus , and pay a minimum handling fee and postage . However , there are amateurs , including managers , who do not know how , or where , to claim the cards . Sometimes they intentionally avoid claiming the cards , leaving them at the bureau for years . Some bureaus destroy the cards , some bureaus , return the cards . Some amateurs claim the cards but do not respond to cards received through the bureau . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done through clubs free of charge . <p> Foreign QSL Bureaus : Many QSL Bureaus in the world are chronically under-funded . Some exist only as an address for incoming QSL cards . In some cases they even regularly package QSL cards , but they defer sending until they get some funds . This extends the QSL card waiting period for cards from these countries . <p> Provincial QSL Bureaus : Arriving at the provincial QSL bureau , the cards are further sorted by volunteers by the first letter in the suffix . This may typically take another week or two . Finally , cards arrive to letter sorters , who wait until some minimal number of cards for the VE client station is accumulated before sending them out . Typically cards are sent 3-4 times a year ( as soon as they are received ) , or once every year or longer for less active users . Sorters keep the cards for several years . If the cards are not claimed , they are returned to the DX Bureaus . <p> We hope you find this information useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive cards more efficiently .

They may be viewed by several persons at the same time and their positioning in respect to the images is not as critical . <p> Searching for anaglyphs in the Google provides a large number of images and links , e.g. , the explanation of what anaglyphs are and how to make them . The author of that tutorial prefers the PNG format to JPG because compression artifacts in the latter format degrade the quality of the resulting anaglyphs . There are SEM anaglyphs in science available for viewing using red-and-blue glasses . A 3D model of the enzyme deacetylase shows the configuration of a protein molecule . Some anaglyphs of micrographs are available here . J. E. Heuser shows membrane traffic in stereo and refers to many websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of links to the making of anaglyphs . <p> It is relatively easy to obtain and publish such stereo micrographs which correspond to Figures 1 to 3 , as may be evident from Figures 5 to 7 . Unlike the original micrographs , which appear in landscape format , the anaglyphs are shown in portrait format : <p> Fig. 5 . The yeast cell partly covered with bacteria in the centre of the image raises out of the image plane higher up . The top of the image sinks quite low . <p> Fig. 6 . The matrix consisting of branched chains of milk protein particles is not smooth around the globular void spaces but forms walls . <p> Fig. 7 . The fungal spores in the lower half of the image raise higher up above the composted plant leaf with fungal hyphae . <p> Scanning electron microscopy <p> The reason for this difference is the need to obtain 2 micrographs . After the first micrograph is taken , the specimen is tilted 6 to 10 and the second micrographs is taken . Tilting is done around a horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the area of interest would lie only in very few situations directly above the axis of rotation inside the microscope , but it will be anywhere within the SEM stub . While the stage with the specimen is being tilted , the image moves on the monitor of the microscope . Thus , it has to be shifted manually to stay at the centre . At magnifications of several thousand times it may be advisable to reduce the magnification after taking the first image to 400-700x , and to mark a characteristic feature on the monitor . After the tilting is completed , it may be easier to find the particular area after the original magnification is set . <p> Multi-sample holders , such as the one for 7 samples holding here only 4 SEM stubs are considerably less suitable to obtain stereo pairs because the sample may move horizontally and vertically even more than 1 mm : <p> Fig. 8 . Tilting of a sample ( S ) on a multi-sample holder by degree a around the axis of rotation R. The sample moves by the distance H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . In order not to reduce the working distance and alter the magnification , the sample must be elevated back by that distance . <p> With our eyes , we view things from the left with our left eye and from the right with our right eye . In contrast , by tilting a sample , we obtain micrographs from the top . To prepare a pair of micrographs suitable to form an anaglyph , it is necessary to open them in a graphics software such as Adobe Photoshop and rotate each micrograph 90 , both the same way either in clockwise or anticlockwise direction . If the micrographs markedly differ in brightness , it is the time to adjust them accordingly . They may be somewhat off one from another . To make them fit , copy one over the other as Layer 1 and reduce opacity of Layer 1 to about 50% . This will make both images visible . Find remarkable features and move Layer 1 over the Background to make the features match as closely as possible remembering that they are somewhat shifted one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the same but the width may differ . Then crop the entire image so that both images are included in the new frame . Return opacity of Layer 1 to 100% . Copy Layer 1 to make a new image and give it a new filename .

After 6 years of struggling as an ascetic , " he finally achieved Enlightenment at age 35 . After this , he was known as the Buddha ( " One who is awake " ) . After all of these experiences , Guatama realized that everything is subject to change and that suffering and discontentment are the result of the attachment to circumstances and things which , by their nature , are not permanent .

@@6829735 @29735/ <h> ( 501 to 736 ) <p> The system of succession to kingship amongst the Scots differed from the one we follow today . Now , our monarchs are chosen by a hereditary system known as primogeniture : generally , the eldest son of a deceased king succeeds to the throne . Primogeniture is relatively straightforward , but has the disadvantage of sometimes resulting in minorities , which occur whenever the heir to the throne is too young to fulfil his duties . A regency has to be established until the king comes of age , and this often produces political instability . The Scots , in contrast , followed the Celtic law of tanistry . Tanistry requires that a brother or cousin of the king be nominated by him as his successor . Thus , the throne tends to pass between different branches of the royal family . The advantage of this system is that there is always a mature king on the throne . The disadvantage , as the Scots learned throughout their history , is that it sometimes leads to assassination and to warfare between competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalriada , the succession alternated between the descendants of Erc , with those of Fergus dominating .

We discussed the map and history of the town . They brought out a book on Black Donald and its inhabitants . <p> The mine was flooded and destroyed by the lake breaking through , most likely after 1951 , the year of our photo .

Given the 6 foot viz , we called off that particular exploration at 65 feet ... quite scary but what an adventure ! We currently do not know the dimensions of the pit but apparently a coffer dam was built on the lakeside of it . We have so far not found any other mine shafts , although there are supposed to be , or at least were , several scattered around the town . <p> We returned to the submerged road and followed 10 foot spaced posts on the lakeside of the road .

In these conditions , one is reluctant to remove the dry suit : - ) <p> This is an advanced dive due to the low visibility , a compass is essential equipment here . The potential for great depth and , possibly , dangerous holes should be a caution to anyone . <p> Also , access is through private property and anyone who might consider this dive should be very well behaved and seek permission of the property holders , we would not like to see them abused for their generosity . <p> 75 minutes , 65 foot max though most was at around 20 foot . <p> We now have found another photo , from 1958 , which shows the mine , which can be seen in the photo below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , although this is to be verified , and 300 by 700 feet .

It is located by Crysler Shoal . Also indicated , to the right of the map , is the approximate location of another wreck .

However , as one moves forward through the holds , forms slowly emerge . A trip to the screws and rudder is fun , leaping over the stern . The current immediately behind the stern is zero and low adjacent to the exterior hull . <p> PS . Do not do what I did on one dive here . Do n't forget to take your gloves with you as those zebra mussels are sharp . Ouch , ooo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map shows the section of river between the hydro barrage at Cornwall and Lock 21 , off screen to the left . The land here was flooded around 35 feet when the barrage was built ; depths are given in feet and represent minimums , generally add another 20 -25 feet here . <p> The sites shown , from East to West , are Lock 20 . This will be like lock 21 but deeper , about 75 feet bottom ; it will have a current around 1-2 knots . I have n't dove this site yet though am hoping to this year . This should only be considered if you are extremely experienced due to its proximity to the barrage half a mile away . Next , to the left , is the swing bridge ; I 'll put a photo up later of the bridge before the area was flooded . Then comes the Mille Roches Power House . It still contains generating equipment but should only be penetrated with lines , lights and training . A picture of it before the flood is available on Jean Langlois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the control dam , are buoyed and always popular . As with most sites East of Cardinal , viz is around 15-25 feet , due to silt mostly , and the current is around 1 knot . <p> After having dove the Power House , a couple of short dives are relaxing . They are the Belly Dumper and utility barge , located by the two small circles 2nd and 3rd from the left on the map . Both dives are short as there is not a lot to see . The belly dumper is a dark site ; the dumper has three hoppers in its hull for dumping , and lays on its side in 86 feet . You can swim through the middle hopper . Further inshore , in about 45 feet is what looks initially like an old jetty . In fact it is a utility barge ; rectangular with flat ends , boiler and two steam winches . No idea what it is but it is fun exploring . Both these dives can be done on one 80 cubic foot tank . <p> Further West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dive . There is also , as yet unmarked on the map , the schooner Cornwall , which lies off Moulinette Island somewhere . I hope to dive this soon . <p> Moulinette <p> This is a new and interesting site . I first heard a rumour of a lost tunnel in 2004 . I got all available information I could from The Lost Villages Society , Ghostownpix and The Stormant , Dundas &amp; Glengary Historical Society <p> Referring to the above map , the site lies between Lakeview Heights Park and Bergin Island ; the causeway is shown by the red line ; the tunnel is at the North end of this line . Compare this with the earlier map of Lock 21 . That map was made around 1910 or 1920 . As you can see , there is no sign of anything . <p> That is because this dive site was flooded in 1902 when they constructed Mille-Roches Power House and created Bergin Lake . The following map in posession of the SD&amp;G Historical Society , was drawn in 1879 . <p> This map is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps in the causeway and also that it was created before it was flooded . I have produced the following map that relates the causeway to the Lock 21 map above . <p> . <p> There are several major features , but the one best used to locate all others is the causeway . This was constructed over this branch of the river in the early 19th century . It was used to get to Sheik Island to graze animals and to get to the woollen mill at the South end . Following is a sketch of part of the causeway . <p> The causeway is about 250 feet long . It was built over the narrowest and shallowest part of the river . Given it is about 8-10 foot high , the water depth could only have been about 6 foot ; with the large rocks around , the river must gave been very similar to the Ottawa river by the Champlain Bridge today . The causeway is constructed from large timbers filled in with rocks and earth and a surface made on top . Today , silt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the upstream side clear . It is about 15-20 feet wide . The low elevation of the causeway makes it very difficult to locate with a depth sounder . <p> When the causeway is located , following it North brings you to the Grist Mill . This is shown in this potograph , taken from the causeway . <p> The first floor is complete and the second floor remains up to the window sills . However , over 100 years of silt and rubble have encroached on the lower 6 feet . Inside is not as bad and there appears to be remains of the mill machinery ; to be explored further . Exploring the inside of the grist mill provides a nice respite from the current . <p> Following the causeway further North , one arrrives at the canal . This was the original canal , builtmid-19th century ( does anyone have the actual date ? ) . It was 8 feet deep and , to allow access to the causeway and mills , a tunnel was put underneath it at this spot . This tunnel still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , silt and rubble of over 100 years has blocked the entrances . <p> Diving Moulinette <p> Standing in the park at Lakeview Heights and looking South towards Bergin Island , a slim pointed island which is now home to Cormorants , 2500 feet into the river , just slightly upstream is where the tunnel is . This is not swimmable and even with a scooter , it is very difficult to find due to current , visibility and navigational problems , the bottom being confused undulations and silt . <p> On a boat in mid-stream , the causeway can be found in a line between the end of Bergin Island and the red brick building in the park . Once found , you must go upstream 300 feet to make a free descent and drift onto the causeway . <p> The best way to dive this site is from Bergin Island . From the tip , head straight North and down . You will come to the upstream of the casueway or the channel at right angles to the causeway . If the latter , which is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far bank of it , and there is the causeway . If you turn downstream in this channel , you come to the basement and ruins of the woollen mill , which are n't so interesting . <p> Things to remember are : The original river bottom is at a depth of 65 feet , and more downstream ; the original land and causway are at 55 feet ; the post-1902 land at 35 feet and the canal itself around 40-45 feet in the bottom . <p> There is stiff current so be prepared to be picked up by boat after making a drifting ascent ; a surface marker buoy is needed for this , as well as surface support in the boat . <p> Hoople Creek Bridge <p> Here is a rough sketch and dive report of the bridge . <p> One of the pleasures of diving is to explore new sites , possibly even ones that have never been diven before . Such was today 's expedition to the Hoople Creek Bridge . <p> Where is Hoople Creek you are asking ? Or more precisely , where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , it is upstream three islands . Just West of Dickinson 's Landing , Hoople Creek flowed into the fresh , warm , visible . Old highway 2 crossed this creek by bridge . <p> Longitude 74 degrees 55 ' 32.7 " West Latitude 44 degrees 59 ' 24 " North <p> This is really a boat dive as it is 1500 feet from any suitable entry point on shore . Fortunately us four had 200 cubic foot of air and three scooters so we could enter from the East side of Hoople Island by the causeway . I was in tow , not yet owning a scooter : - ( Even so , it took 15 minutes to get there . <p> We entered through grass and headed to the bottom of the old creek and turned South , following the bottom . Eventually , our uncertainty of finding the bridge ( perhaps it was no longer there ) was dispelled by a looming darkness ahead of us . The Bridge ! <p> It is a concrete structure , which probably explains why it was not removed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at 30 feet and the creek bottom is at 40-45 . The road is about 20 foot wide ( I did n't measure it ) and about 50 foot long ; the creek itself is about 30 foot wide . <p> Even though concrete ( I believe ) it has the form of an iron bridge . Balustrades are on each side , about 3 feet high but of much greater interest are two arches which rise each side over the balustrades about 8 feet with risers from the bridge . You can swim through the holes .

After graduation in 1952 as an M.Eng. , he was a research chemist at a Food Research Institute in Bratislava ( now the capital of Slovakia ) and 2 years later he studied pectic substances as a postgraduate student at the Slovak Academy of Sciences . As a Ph.D . after graduation in 1957 , he studied purification of effluents from sugar factories . In 1959 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home town of Olomouc ( Czech Republic ) . As a biochemist , he was a member of various medical teams , which explains his publications on various topics from dermatology to gastroenterology to enzymology etc . The enzyme arginase was the subject of his thesis to achieve the position of a " docent " ( equivalent to the position of " associate professor " in Canada ) . He also lectured biochemistry at the Faculty of Science , where be held the position of the Chairman of the Department of Organic and Biological Chemistry . With the liberalization of the political regime in Czechoslovakia , many university students were visiting western Europe . These possibilities were not open to their teacher when he was younger , so he wanted to join the new trend and to learn about life in the West . His former superior at the Faculty of Medicine , Professor Dr. Vladimfr Pelikn , was very supportive as well as all university , political , and union authorities including the university president . <p> Miloslav ( Milo ) arrived in Ottawa on September 6 , 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for post-doctorate fellows , to study pig blood serum lipoproteins in the laboratory of Dr. W. H. Cook at the National Research Council of Canada ( NRC ) at Sussex Drive . His wife Drahomfra with sons Pavel ( Paul ) and Petr ( Peter ) joined him in March 1967 . Allowing an entire family from Czechoslovakia to stay in a Western country was a very unusual situation , as the state authorities were concerned that such family may not return . It was a puzzle even for Canadian authorities , particularly since Milo was not a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia . However , the fact that he used a part of his post-doctorate fellowship pay to pay off the remainder of the mortgage on his and his wife 's new house in Olomouc may have indicated that the family would return home after the completion of the fellowship . In 1967 , his fellowship at the NRC was extended for another year . In contrast to his colleagues from western countries , who had to find new jobs after the termination of their fellowships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been promoted to tenured university professor after his return . <p> In Ottawa , nine years old son Pavel was keen to go to the nearest Canadian school immediately after his arrival and he was accepted in Grade 3 , the same grade he was in Czechoslovakia . Four years younger Petr was accepted in a kindergarten , where a few months later he even participated in a Christmas play . This all was done clandestinely since officially their mother was supposed to school Pavel at home according to a curriculum brought from Olomouc . The only school the boys were allowed by Czechoslovak authorities to attend while abroad , was the school at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa . It was incredible how quickly both boys learned English . Pavel soon became a member of the School Safety Patrol , supervising a road crossing in front of the Cambridge Street school . <p> Milo bought a used 6-cylinder Ford Falcon immediately after arrival in Ottawa from a departing post-doctorate fellow , so he gained some experience driving in Canada . In Olomouc , he was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . The family thus travelled a lot in Canada - as far East as the Cabot Trail in Nova Scotia , and along the east coast of the USA from Providence Town , Massachusetts , camping at the Hammonasset Beach in Connecticut , driving downtown Manhattan in New York to the Statue of Liberty , the United Nations Organization Building , along the Broadway , visiting Harlem , camping at Virginia Beach in Virginia , visiting the Kennedy Space Center and camping at Daytona North Beach in Florida . A grand tour to Key West and the southernmost tip of the USA was planned in 1968 but only a much shorter trip to New York City was announced to a US Immigration officer . He noted that the family was very courageous daring to travel that far in " an old lady 's shopping car " . - When returning at night from the Keys to Miami , the family was hit by a tropical storm coming from the Gulf of Mexico . Soon much newer cars were stopped on the highway shoulder whereas the Falcon was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miami , which the family had left in the morning . However , before entering the city , Milo entered an empty parking lot of a supermarket , where he drove the Falcon with his right foot on the gas pedal and the left foot on the brake pedal to heat and dry the brakes remembering that this maneuver following driving through deep water near Olomouc saved him from an accident several years ago . <p> In the laboratory , Milo completed 3 scientific papers and submitted them for publication . In Czechoslovakia , the prevailing opinion was that everything was absolutely perfect in the West . The following situation shows one particular " imperfection " . Laboratory supervisor Bill asked Milo to provide amino acid analysis of a low-density lipoprotein 's apolipoprotein moiety . When he was given the results , he noted sarcastically that the results obtained by a guy from a communist country were nothing but garbage because his own analysis done with his Japanese post-doctorate fellow several years ago produced completely different results . He ordered his technician Jean to repeat the analysis - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These guys from Eastern Europe are infecting this society " , Bill mused , " so I will have to do it all by myself " . Jean was hurt , of course , and very curious to see the results which Bill obtained a few days later . Amazingly , they were exactly the same as those obtained by Milo and Jean . Bill decided to throw all three sets of results into the garbage and not to publish them because they would contradict his earlier data obtained with that great guy from Japan . So it happened that Milo produced " only " three scientific papers on lipoproteins , all published in 1968 during his fellowship . <p> In August 1968 , the Kalb family was preparing to return home . They had airline tickets to Prague for August 25 with short stops for sightseeing in London , Paris and Curych on their way back to Czechoslovakia . Milo was supposed to start lecturing on September 1 . The family 's belongings , brought from Czechoslovakia and also those purchased in Canada and the USA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate statements from the Czechoslovak Embassy which would free the family from having to pay any import duties . All boxes were shipped on August 19 , 1968 from a post office at Besserer Street in Ottawa . <p> In the evening of August 21 , a Czech post-doctorate fellow staying a few street blocks away from the Kalb family brought devastating news : Czechoslovakia was invaded by the armies of the Warsaw Treaty . What now ? It appeared as if the world has collapsed but life was going on . The landlord allowed the Kalb family to stay in the 1-bedroom apartment as long as they would need it . The National Research Council of Canada ( NRC ) extended the fellowship for Milo for 3 months expressing hope that he will be able to find a job , a Canadian Immigration official changed the status of the family from " visitors " to " landed immigrants " and extended their visa , and the Czechoslovak Embassy extended the passports and exit visas and advised the family to have their classification changed to " landed immigrants " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada for another year . <p> In the laboratory , Bill was no more hostile to a guy from Eastern Europe but started helping Milo to find a job . He referred him to the federal Department of Health and Welfare . Milo would test chemicals imported from other countries whether they corresponded to Canadian standards and he would be paid an annual salary of $7800 subjected to income taxes . His post-doctorate fellowship provided him with a non-taxable annual support of $7200 . It was clear that the offer was too low to maintain a family of four . Bill recognized it , called his contact and Milo made another trip to the laboratories at Tunney 's Pasture . The interview was the same but the offer was increased to $10,000 . " How do you feel now , Milo ? " Bill asked . " Could you make yet another call , please ? " Milo asked . <p> It should be mentioned here that some time earlier , at the beginning of August 1968 , Milo was curious to know why there were great differences between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it would be possible to convince a large state dairy manufacturing firm near Olomouc to start producing Canadian cottage cheese and thus , there could be some useful cooperation of his Department with the food industry . At the NRC , he was advised to contact Dr. D. B. Emmons at the federal Department of Agriculture . " I was tempted to forget about this crazy idea of introducing Canadian cottage cheese to Czechoslovakia not having any idea of milk processing " , Milo said later , " my specialization was sugar manufacturing . Yet , I called Dr. Emmons and he was very pleased that a guy from Eastern Europe was interested in his expertise " . Dr. Emmons was the recipient of the American Dairy Science Association 's Pfizer Award for his research of cottage cheese . He spent two days with Milo , brought him to several dairies in Ottawa and the vicinity , gave him his book on cottage cheese manufacture , and waved him goodbye . <p> Desperately searching for a job , Milo called Dr. Emmons whether he would know about a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Maybe , there would be a job at this Food Research Institute ( FRI ) " . Interestingly , no salary was mentioned , except that in the laboratory a young scientist , Henry , mentioned that he hoped that it will be no higher than $12,000 because otherwise he would " raise the roof at the NRC " . This was very good to know . Milo was really hired for the FRI dairy department and one morning at the NRC , he received a call from the Public Service Commission . There were only two telephone lines in the lab and all staff gathered around Milo . Finally , the staffing officer said : " You are being hired as an RES-02 , Dr. Kalb , and your starting annual salary will be $15,500 . Your starting date will be December 2 , 1968 . All the best to you , Sir " . <p> Everybody around Milo wanted to know " how much ? " and he was buoyed : " Eleven thousand dollars , one thousand better than at Health and Welfare , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the roof over the NRC stayed intact . <p> Milo revealed his " little white lie " only about 15 years later to friends associated with neither the NRC nor the FRI . Some argued that Milo was not supposed to lie and his lie showed a spot on his character . The others understood his way of thinking : Had he said the truth , Henry would be bitter and furious and the other collaborators might question , why a stranger from Eastern Europe would be paid more than an established Canadian scientist . With the " $11,000 " sum , everybody was satisfied and wished Milo good luck . <p> In spite of this incredible luck , Milo was afflicted by severe depression . He was supposed to be back in Olomouc , his wife would return to her job in the accounting department of the state enterprise producing frozen foods , the boys would attend the same kindergarten and public school which Milo attended as a young boy and they would again have their two grandmas and two grandpas plus aunts and uncles almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home overlooking the city near the terminal station of the street car route #2 . Who would be giving lectures on biochemistry to " his " students - those studying to become high school teachers and those who would be employed in the chemical industry ? Who would be working in " his " new laboratories at the Faculty of Medicine , where everything was shining ? Everybody there spoke Czech . Milo belonged to people who knew that the invasion of Czechoslovakia was the result of a complex situation . Following the 1968 " Prague Spring " , there was a hot summer , during which there were some voices heard in Prague demanding that Czechoslovakia abandon the Warsaw Treaty and join the NATO . The world was divided into two large hostile blocks and switching sides was sheer utopia which would not end happily - and it did not . <p> Now , Milo was an FRI employee in a very old , almost historical building and he had to take care of his family which he brought to this country at the end of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both would die ? There was a need to make an agreement with another family in a similar situation . In the lab , Milo was assigned a ridiculous project : " By 1974 , to develop a frankfurter imitation based on skimmed milk powder . The procedure should be as simple as possible , not applying any sophisticated texturization , so the product would compete successfully with the traditional frankfurters ( hot dogs ) which were made with low-quality meats . The recommended technology would utilize heat-induced gelation of milk ... " <p> An older colleague , Harry , was assigned as an advisor to Milo who had been given a month to prepare the project . Then the director reviewed his plans . " What material would you work with , Milo ? " he asked . " Skim milk powder " , was the response . Harry disagreed and suggested that Milo should isolate the major milk proteins and test their gelling properties one after another . As a chemical engineer , Milo defended his approach and the director agreed with him . <p> In practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% total solids were placed in dialyzing tubing , 13 mm in diameter and sections about 10 cm long were wrapped in a Saran plastic foil and heated in boiling water for varying periods of time . With the help of the Engineering and Statistical Research Institute , Milo developed a penetrometer which made it possible to measure the texture of the gels at various temperatures . The director was impatient because one particular company was keen to start building kiosks where the milk-based hot dogs would be offered to the public , similar to the Dairy Queen kiosks . There was no problem to give the " milk hot dogs " a nice pink colour and an attractive hot dog smell - and Dr. Emmons even showed them in television . The problem was their mouthfeel . They tasted like a very bad cheese . They were not juicy , they were not springy and they were prone to developing diarrhea even in people who had no problem digesting milk . Made from milk powder , they contained too much lactose . " Their structure is the problem " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a suggestion that an electron microscopist be asked to show structural differences between the traditional and the milk-based hot dogs . <p> Traditional hot dogs are composed of muscle fibres , fat particles , and droplets of gelatin . They are elastic and juicy when heated . Milk-based hot dogs were composed of minute ( 200 micrometers in diameter ) casein micelles very loosely bound to each other . Attempts to incorporate gelatin droplets dehydrated the droplets and produced hard " sandy " particles . Milo was fascinated by the micrographs but the microscopist said that his staff will make no additional images and if Milo wanted more , his staff would teach him how to do electron microscopy . There was a unique situation in Ottawa - a single , well equipped electron microscopy was established to teach all scientists in need of examining their specimens at very high magnification . A scientist and a team of technicians under the supervision of Dr. G. H. Haggis took care of very efficient operations and also performed electron microscopy of specimens obtained by mail . Milo started taking lessons immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Milo and chastised him for having abandoned his project of developing the hot dogs and for spending time in the electron microscopy laboratory . The director refused to accept any suggestion that the structure of the milk-based hot dogs must resemble the structure of the meat-based hot dogs so the imitation would resemble the original . " If you do not stop your visits to the electron microscopy laboratory , you will be given a very bad performance appraisal at the end of the year with all negative consequences " , the director threatened and added , that one particular company wants to hear when the milk-based hot dog will be ready to be advertized and marketed . <p> In his attempts to modify the properties of the heat-induced milk gels , Milo tried various ingredients . Once he obtained gels which did not decompose in water but were relatively stable and even somewhat " springy " . Harry 's technicians , Ms. Zenaida Ventura suggested that they may be palatable with soya sauce or a fish sauce and she had both sauces on hand . She was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a meeting , so Milo brought plates and beakers during the break for the members of the committee to taste his product . " After you have tasted them , please spit them into your beakers " , Milo advised . Eureka , the gels were all eaten ! ! ! " Very good " , the director said , " how did you do it ? " " I added sodium pyrosulfate into the initial slurry and heated it , then I washed the gels " . Jim turned very pale , almost blue , and the committee members seemed to suspect Milo that he wanted to poison them . He explained that pyrosulfate turned into persulfate and persulfate turned into regular sodium sulfate which is not harmful and even it was completely washed out , but this experiment was not appreciated at all ... <p> When Milo looked for a job , he did not know for how long the family will stay in Canada . Conservative politicians of the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia started wide purges and the situation was deteriorating rapidly . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have very negative repercussions on the entire family if they would return to Olomouc . The family thus invited Drahomfra 's sister Jindra to Ottawa and then brought her to the Czechoslovak Embassy , where there was still a very liberal communist staff . Milo and Drahomfra drafted a statement that they were transferring the ownership of their home in Olomouc onto Drahomfra 's and Jindra 's parents . AttachT Ing . Pechar made it into an official document , provided it with his signature and an official stamp . Now it was clear that the Kalb family will stay in Canada . In August 1968 they lost all their belongings , now they lost also their house and a hope that they would ever return to Czechoslovakia . Another year later , Jindra and her parents received an official verdict that the donation of the house was illegal and the house was confiscated by the state . Jindra and her parents were ordered to vacate the house unless they would pay its value which Milo and Drahomfra have already paid in full . The payment had to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow money from any bank . This condition was undoubtedly imposed so that she would be unable to buy the house back and it could be awarded to some faithful comrade . Jindra , however , raised the money by borrowing small amounts from many relatives . Now she became the owner of the house . ( Ing . Pechar was recalled from Canada and arrested ) . <p> In the meantime , personal problems combined with his inability to produce an acceptable imitation of hot dogs using skimmilk powder and his director 's ban on using electron microscopy in order to understand factors affecting the microstructure of the foods studied , severely suppressed the initial enthusiasm of Milo with his new position . In spite of the publication of several papers in his series entitled " Heat-induced milk gels " , there was no hope that the following bombastic press release will ever materialize : " If Dr. Kalab 's research goes well , Canada will be the first country in the world , which will offer her consumers hot dogs made from skimmed milk powder " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in his life and his luck returned to him in a few months , when the director was promoted and a new director took his position . His name was Dr. John Holme and he deserves to be mentioned here . He came from the food industry and when he met Milo , he said that he was impressed that there was an electron microscopist on the FRI staff . " Do you have any problem ? " he asked Milo . " Yes , I have , I am unable to force milk powder to behave as meat and to make an imitation of hot dogs " . " Do you have a pen , Milo ? " Dr. Holme asked and when Milo offered him one , he cancelled the project on the spot . " Now " , the new director said , " do electron microscopy of foods , so that your studies would be useful for the Canadian agriculture " . These words ended one of the most miserable periods in the life of Milo . A new period started , when Milo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice of experts in the food industry ( whom he used to approach ) and the advice of electron microscopy technicians . <p> Milo entered the new period in his life with one of the first computers in his possession . Computers were a new technology . Only director 's secretaries and typists were given access to them . Milo bought his own new computer , Osborne 1 . It was portable with two 5.25 " floppy drives and a 3 " x3 " ( 7.5 cm x 7.5 cm ) monitor . At the advice of his sons , he also bought a larger Zenit b&amp;w monitor and a dot matrix printer . He was thus modernizing his " after-the-hours business " as a freelance translator for the government Translation Bureau . There was a need for translations from Russian , Czech , and Slovak into English and Milo specialized in scientific and technical translations . The Osborne 1 computer was soon equipped with a modem and his sons , now university students used it to access the university computer rather than waiting in line for a keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bought and Milo was bringing it to the laboratory every day . He typed his research ideas , bibliographic references etc. in this new way . This made his Director 's assistant very uneasy when he was shown a draft of a paper with the title , an introduction , a materials and methods section , and the references section already printed on paper . Milo explained that the results and discussion sections will be added as his research progresses but the Assistant Director did not like it , according to him it smacked of fraud having some sections already in print while the research had not been completed first . In addition , the Director did not like it that Milo typed his own drafts and was , thus , unable to assess the work of the institute 's typists because he did not use their services . The new director was not bother by the way , Milo approached his research , he was interested in the essence of the work and he liked to have a short 5 to 10 minute discussion with Milo almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Holme was known for his peculiar approach to his staff - he did not treat them depending on their academic titles but on their performance and so he may have been accused by some scientists of treating some technicians better than the scientists . <p> The first dairy food which Milo examined by electron microscopy was yogurt . In the early seventies , yogurt was almost unknown in Canada ( whereas Milo ate it - with a strawberry jam - as a baby in Czechoslovakia in the thirties ) . A comparison of a rare commercial yogurt with a yogurt made in the laboratory has brought a disappointment - the " homemade " product was soft and watery . What was wrong ? The milk ? No , its lack of heating . Commercial yogurt producers heat the milk at 90C for 10 min. , then cool it to 44C and only then inoculate it with a lactic bacterial culture , which in those times consisted of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus . <p> Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) showed that heating higher than 85C leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the milk serum . The product of the interaction blocks the sites on the casein micelle surfaces where other casein micelles would get attached , thus forming a large clusters . This is actually the process taking place during the coagulation of mik in the cheese manufacture . When only a few such sites remain unblocked in heated milk , bonding of the casein micelles is limited and results in the formation of branching chains . This structure is much more stable and it holds all the aqueous phase ( i.e. , water ) present in the milk . <p> In contrast , cheese manufacture needs compacted casein . It is obtained by the coagulation of milk that had never been heated higher than 85C . Whereas yogurt contains all milk ingredients , cheese used to be devoid of -lactoglobulin and other whey proteins which were lost in the form of whey . In those times , whey was a useless by-product and was even used as a ( nuisance ) field fertilizer , until someone many year later started producing pure whey proteins tremendously important for sportspeople , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings excited Milo who had initially been completely ignorant of dairy science . It was only his curiosity to know why there were differences between cottage cheese made in Canada and in his native Czechoslovakia expressed at a time when he urgently needed a new job . He admired Dr. Emmons , who had the courage to suggest to his Director that Milo be hired for the dairy laboratory . However , the Director 's promotion and departure was essential to a meaningful research which Milo could pursue . After some time , he considered the findings to be so interesting that he printed large micrographs of the yogurt and cheese structures and lactic acid bacteria and brought them to a local TV station in the hope that the Director of Programming will share his enthusiasm . She asked , pointing to some pictures : " What are these ? " " These are images of bacteria in yogurt and cheese " . The response was loud and clear : " Take your pictures , Sir , and get out of here . We do n't want to be sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that there are bacteria in their products . Goodbye , Sir ! " <p> Undeterred , Milo sent the micrographs to an American science popularizing magazine . The response was that the readers would prefer , if the images were in colour . It is known the micrographs from electron microscopes are in grayscale , so Milo started colouring them using a variety of water colours until his colleague Dr. Suk Yiu suggested Adobe Photoshop . Half a year later , the same letter illustrated with the micrographs in colour went again to the magazine . The editor contacted was sorry to inform Milo that the editor-in-chief had ruled against showing foods under the microscope " in order not to scare the readers " . Some colleagues assumed that Milo produced fraudulent micrographs by using " false colours " although he was not submitting them for publication in a scientific journal . It took some more time before false colours were recognized as helpful in describing images of various structures . Nowadays , few readers would believe how different life was several decades ago . <p> It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBC radio host Mr. Peter Gzowski invited Milo to speak for 15 min. about his research . The subject was the development of blisters in cheese on pizza . It was amazing . Where did Mr. Gzowski learn about these experiments which were not even completed ? The live interview was scheduled for 9:00 at the CBC Radio Studio in the Chateau Laurier Hotel in Ottawa . All staff at the Food Research Institute was ready to listen to the radio , and communications experts were prepared to tape the interview . <p> In those days , pizzerias were competing for customers by reducing the waiting times . An idea was to increase the temperature of the oven so the pizza would be baked faster . There was a problem that the cheese started to blister . In regular life , the answer would be to return to regular baking temperature and to leave very high temperatures for smelting . Since the pizza industry asked the federal department of agriculture for help , the research objective was to find out , why unsighty blisters develop in cheese . Photographs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied by image analysis in the laboratory for their numbers per pizza , dimensions , and colours . It was puzzling , where did Mr. Gzowski learn about this work and why this topic was selected over the other , considerably more important scientific findings . Milo was determined to bring general information about these transition of milk into yogurt and cheese to the attention of Mr. Gzowski 's listeners . <p> After Mr. Gzowski 's introduction of " this crazy science " , Milo acknowledged that cheese is indeed an essential part of every pizza and in order to understand its behaviour during baking , there is a need to know , what cheese is and how it is made . Although English is not his mother tongue , he has mastered it sufficiently well to speak , without a break , about electron microscopic studies , following the clock handle to give Mr. Gzowski 3 minutes for additional questions . Mr. Gzowski asked , what " this crazy doctor " sees in cheese under his electron microscope . Milo summarized : " The protein body with fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Gzowski immediately interrupted that he would prefer not to see " microorganisms " in foods . " Well , Mr. Gzowski " , Milo said , " microorganisms such as yeasts are an essential part of every leavened bakery product such as bread and they also make sauerkraut " . Lactic acid bacteria are essential to the production of so-called " cultured milk products " such as yogurt and cheeses ... " As the clock handle came even closer to mark the end of the interview , Milo asked : " Do you drink beer , Mr. Gzowski , or do you , rather , like wine ? " The studio staff , seen through the large window , was already smiling , when Milo continued that both beer and wine similar to all alcoholic beverages are the products of microorganisms , i.e. , yeasts , and without them , Mr. Gzowski would not have his glass of wine . <p> Both men thanked each other , the interview was over , the lights went off and Milo returned to the Centre for Food and Animal Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to enjoy the applause of his colleagues . <p> The study of blisters in pizza cheese was not published because CFAR was shortly after the interview closed and Milo was retired , but a report on them concluded that residual amounts of the monosaccharide galactose in the cheese were responsible for their development and the only reasonable remedy was to reduce the temperature of the oven . <p> A reorganization at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada closed the Centre for Food and Animal Research . Its scientists and technicians had been transferred to other centres , such as a new Food Research Program in Guelph , Ontario , or were scattered al over Canada . Some took an early retirement . Milo was 65 years old , so retirement was the only possibility . Or was it ? Before the last door in the empty institute would be locked , Milo was hired at his request for the next year to work for 11.5 hours per week on electron microscopy of microorganisms and other subjects for the Food Research Program in Guelph . The contract continued to be extended every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then his status was changed to an unpaid Honorary Research Associate . <p> There were three years which were particularly memorable to Milo and his food microstructure studies : 1982 - Pfizer Award by the American Dairy Science Association for research of cultured milk products . Similar to the Pfizer Award which Dr. D. B. Emmons received many years before Milo . 1982 - Food Microstructure journal founded in Chicago jointly with Drs . Samuel Cohen , Eugenia Davis , David Holcomb , and Om Johari. 1986 - Lecturing at the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal , Haryana , India on electron microscopy of milk products . 1989 - Lecturing at the National Food Research Institute in Tsukuba , Japan thanks to a grant from the Japanese Government . <p> There is information in great detail about the Food Microstructure - Food Structure journal on this website and in the Wikipedia . <p> Each of the opportunities to meet colleagues with a similar interest in the studies of food microstructure was exciting . There were 3 scientists awarded the UNO positions of FAO consultants to the National Dairy Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Greig Zadow from the CSIRO Dairy Research Laboratory in Australia , and Milo , who had been asked to make 19 lectures on electron microscopy of milk products . His first 3 lectures filled a large hall as buses were bringing scientists from afar . There was an electron microscopist on staff , Dr. Prasad , who operated a small scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) in seclusion , completely oblivious to the fact , that Milo had been sent to the Centre to help him to obtain additional equipment . He refused to discuss his work with Milo or to show his laboratory . After about 15 presentations , when only a few technicians were in the lecture room , Director General ( DG ) asked Milo why he has only been speaking and showing slides all the time without any practical demonstration . " I am sorry , too " , Milo said , " but Dr. Prasad would not allow me to enter his laboratory " . The DG asked Dr. Prasad to open his laboratory on the next Friday to him , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the laboratory had been locked and Dr. Prasad headed to New Delhi . The DG ordered the laboratory be opened by force so he and several directors were able to see the SEM for the first time . All asked Milo to show , how it works . It was hopeless for Milo to explain that Dr. Prasad added a variety of hardware to the microscope to cope with the local conditions of frequent power failures and that if the DG could not persuade his subordinate to demonstrate the microscope , he can not expect that a stranger , who never saw it before , would operate it without any manual . The pressure on Milo was such that he made a small specimen of milk powder , coated it with gold and then inserted it into the SEM . He managed to obtain the image on the monitor which excited everybody in the darkened room , particularly the views at a few different magnifications and from different angles until the monitor turned black as the filament had burnt out . Milo was able to find another filament in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sierk Itz in Ottawa , who showed Milo many basic steps including the replacement of a filament ( which was the responsibility of technicians whereas scientists were not to supposed to do anything else but to operate the microscopes and call for help if difficulties were encountered ) . Soon the directors and scientists viewed additional images on the monitor and it was a late afternoon . The DG closed the door of the laboratory with a wish that all participants of the memorable day meet in the laboratory again on Monday . <p> On Monday , it was impossible to start the microscope . Dr. Prasad disabled it after having complained in New Delhi that some dilletante from Canada was ruining his electron microscope . The mission for Milo had ended and he had to report at FAO in Rome about his experience in Karnal and to make suggestions for improvements . In spite of Dr. Prasad 's attitude , he recommended that the bottom-quality SEM be replaced with a microscope capable of operating at higher magnifications and that the laboratory be also equipped with a good quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Ottawa , Dr. Emmons visited Milo to show him a letter , where Dr. Prasad asked whether he could study electron microscopy in Dr. Emmons 's laboratory . He already responded that Dr. Prasad should contact Dr. Kalab on this subject ... <p> The 19 presentations were redundant and practical demonstrations would have been much better . However , an elderly technician , Mr. Bagga , attended them all . It was rewarding that several young scientists presented suggestions for collaboration which resulted in joint papers on the microstructure of Paneer ( an unripened cheese ) and Khoa ( a milk-based dessert ) . Milo has been getting requests for advice with SEM from much younger scientists as late as 2016 . He refers them to the NDRI laboratory , which is now , 30 years later , a very advanced site of electron microscopic research . <p> There was an added bonus for Milo and Drahomfra to their stay in Karnal : The Management of the NDRI gave them ( plus John Sherbon and Greig Zadow ) a very nice car trip south through New Delhi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour through a bird sanctuary . <p> Their flight home by Alitalia in February led to 70 km south of Moscow and a turn south to Rome . There was a snowfall in Rome a day before their arrival . <p> Three years later , in November 1989 , Milo and Drahomfra were on their way to Japan and their destination was the National Food Research Institute ( NFRI ) in Tsukuba , thanks to a grant which Milo received from the Government of Japan as a visiting scientist . There were some memorable moments : He was shown his desk in a laboratory , on the top of which was only a notepad and a pencil . " What is this for ? " Milo asked . " It 's for you to take notes " , was the answer , so Milo expressed his surprise whether computers are not being used . " Of course , they are , but we did not know whether you would be able to use one " , he was told . In a short while he was given a laptop computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . There was a somewhat touchy situation : in November 1989 , Milo was past his 60th birthday . At that time , scientists in Japan used to retire at the age of 60 but they started to receive their pensions only at the age of 65 years . They had to survive the 5 years on savings and some really good ones had a chance to be hired by industrial companies as consultants . Thus , Milo as always the oldest at any meeting . <p> One day he was brought to the Materials Research Institute where he was shown how to operate a field emission scanning electron microscope ( FESEM ) . Critical point drying and gold coating operations were automated in Tsukuba - his " work " consisted of pushing a button and then taking the samples out of the machines . The SEM was a pleasure to operate and sharp images were obtained at 100,000x magnification whereas in Ottawa , 30,000x was the limit . The real surprise came the next day : Milo was asked to teach the Japanese scientist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy and the situation , that a stranger would , one day , get a glimpse of a superior microscope never encountered before , and the next day he would have to pass a fragment of his new " knowledge " to the residents of a neighbouring institute , was quite bizarre . <p> Milo made several presentations about his work in Tsukuba and in Tokyo , where he also demonstrated a procedure of encapsulating viscous food samples in agar gel tubes for electron microscopy . It looked almost like a religious ritual with assistants dressing him with a lab coat , handing him Pasteur pipettes and other tools almost like assisting a surgeon . - During one particular presentation on transmission electron microscopy of milk coagulation , a local well-known scientist made some comments which could not have been solved and both participants were advise to solve them after the presentation . The Milo learned that the Japanes were far ahead - whereas sections 90 nm thin were examined in Ottawa , the Japanese microscopist examined considerably thinner sections of 15 nm - so-called " invisible sections " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results were significantly different . On all counts , the Japanese had superior instruments and it was regrettable that only a few scientists used in their studies . One them was Dr. Kyoko Saio ( 1983 , 1984 , 1985 , 1993 ) in Tokyo , who , as an active participant on the annual meetings organized by Dr. Om Johari and a member of the Editorial Board of Food Microstructure , was as a lady very helpful to Milo and Drahomfra . The other scientist was Dr. Zenichi Saito ( 1985 , 1988 ) at the University of Sapporo . <p> The Government of Japan gave Milo and his wife a nice trip to Sapporo to speak at the university and then by train along a long area of smoking fumaroles to Hakodate , a large city known for its fish market . On their return flight to Tokyo , Mount Fuji was seen in all its majestic beauty . Dr. Mitsuru Monma was a young scientist who acted as a guide and a guardian angel for the Canadian couple . Although Milo learned the katakana used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes if Dr. Monma would suddenly disappear . It is regrettable that Milo was unable to return his kindness and be his host in Canada . <p> One day in the caffeteria , Milo found in the Times of Japan news about the political developments in Czechoslovakia , the so-called Velvet Revolution because there was no loss of live during the transition from one political regime to another . <p> Milo noticed in 2015 that his name and a short list of his most recent scientific papers published in collaboration with the colleagues at the Canadian Blood Services appeared in ResearchGate . This situation encouraged him to search for the reprints of his earlier scientific publications since 1959 and to upload them into the new data base . There would be no more need to keep reprints to send them by mail . Registration for ResearchGate is free and makes it possible to access , at no charge , all papers stored . <p> Milo studied chemical engineering in Czechoslovakia and during his studies he worked as a sugar factory analytical chemist .

As a biochemist , he was a member of various medical teams which explains his publications on various topics from dermatology to gastroenterology to rheumatology etc . The enzyme arginase was the subject of his " habilitation thesis " to achieve the position of " Docent " ( equivalent to the position of " Associate Professor " in Canada ) . He also lectured biochemistry at the Faculty of Science , where be held the position of Chairman of the Department of Organic and Biological Chemistry .

@@6829742 @29742/ <p> This project is born from our passion for classic boats ( and a lot of naive ambition and dreaming ) .

The size would be just a touch smaller than average the 1850/90 's size tuna fishing boat . <p> Here are a scanned images of the type of boat the Pepe Berrou will be . <p> The objective has the looks of the past but we would be fools not to use the tools and technology today has to offer . <p> The lines were drawn with the marine design software package PROSURF using NURB surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull surface of the desired shape , to fair it , provide lines , hydrostatics , curvature information and 2d expansion of the 3d surface . It is then possible to export all the geometric information as text files , so xyz coordinates , offset tables ; or as different cad files like Dxf or Iges . PROSURF allows us to analyse the hulls curvature and provides tools to fair the shape in nice curves . We aimed for a shape that would compromise between roundness and relative ease to build of steel plate . Before obtaining the wanted hull shape , a few scaled models were quickly built to be stared at and discussed in the evening for hours on end ....... Every proposed hull also came with its stability data ( compiled with Prosurf and spreadsheets ) . The boat has to look good but it would be a bonus if it was safe and sailable ( ok , it 's not a bonus but an important prerequisite ) . <p> Once we agreed on a hull , drawings were exported to a generic CAD package for detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once . The construction grunt work is not all fun , having detailed plans drawn in the comfort of the office minimises the time spent sweating and swearing . <p> The ribs and some other parts were numerically controlled cut ( NC cut ) from the drawings on a large plasma cutting table at Brannon Steel in Brampton . The ribs were fully detailed , I had the notches for the longitudinal and the limber holes cut in the shape . This was a huge labour savings as all the parts are perfectly cut and the ribs went together within 1/32 of an inch . The files I sent to get parts CNC cut were 2d dxf files , projections of the parts profile . I use Dxf as most cad software can import and read those files . I divided my ribs in pieces that would be easiest nested , there would have been way to much waste if I kept each rib ring intact . That meant welding later the parts together to reform the rings but was the best way to make it economical . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the parts as efficiently as possible on the plate so the positioning of the parts on the file sent to them does n't matter . I only had to make sure that all the parts were small enough for the max size plate the shop could cut . <p> I did n't get the plating of the boat NC cut . I did n't think the gain was worth the risk of a plate not quite fitting the frame . A very slight misalignment of a frame , which otherwise would not be a problem , could cause the plate to be that 1/8 of an inch off . We templated all our plates and cut them out of regular plating and it worked great with very reasonable waste . I used the plate expansion from probasic to plan the plate size I would need and how much material to buy but did n't use it for cutting . <p> Reading over this page I realised that there has been changes over the years and it would make sens to add a note on the software I curently use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the cad package I used and learnt in school .

Prosurf still does the job but there again I have tried to move on to learning more and quite like freeship ( delftship ) . <p> Rhino has really become my main tool but for non boat related CAD and for certain parts or when I need some technical drawings from my model I find I 'm better to use parametric software . The most affordable fully functional parametric CAD software we have found on the market is Alibre . <p> I ' m hoping to get back to this page and add some more recent screen shots , the boat model in Rhino looks quite neat and the interior concept has materalized in CAD

In due time the west side of the river received similar treatment , and by 1819 Mr. Sellar cleared that populous countryside of all its human inhabitants , burning everything before him . 25 <p> This tragic turn of events was compounded by the profligacy of Eric , 7th Lord Reay . As the result of a lawsuit , Eric secured the Mackay estate in such a way that he could sell it if he chose to do so .

@@6829750 @29750/ <p> Microscopy is a scientific discipline , the objective of which is to enlarge minute particles or structures in order to study them . Depending on whether the objects are biological , geological , or metallurgical , there is a wide variety of instruments and techniques suitable to achieve the objective . A good starting point on the Internet is the Microscopy in Wikipedia . <p> There are many reasons to examine foods under a microscope . Low-magnification dissecting microscopes function as magnifying glasses and may be used for better views of the food structure . They show details of meat fibres or seed surfaces and spices which may be captured on film or a video tape using various attachments . They are the first microscopes to be used when examining a particulate food contaminant . <p> Microscopy at a higher resolution helps to understand what happens to the original biological materials such as grains , muscles , or milk when they are processed into bread or pasta , ham or steak , yogurt or cheese . With industrial food production , developers of new foods need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. : string cheese and processed cheese ) or why some foods , which are smooth under normal conditions , become gritty ( e.g. : ice cream stored for too long in a freezer ) . <p> Optical microscopes provide a higher resolution than dissecting microscopes and open completely new views at the specimens examined . They are relatively easy to use . Their price makes them affordable to any laboratory - even individual enthusiasts and students . Magnifications up to 2000x are achieved using this kind of microscopes . With a higher magnification , greater details are revealed but smaller areas are shown . In addition to structural details such as globules or fibres , specific staining procedures make it possible to distinguish proteins from fats , starch , cellulose , mineral components etc . A book entitled Food Microscopy by Olga Flint ( Royal Microscopical Society Microscopy Handbook 30 , Bios Scientific Publishers , Oxford , UK 1994 ) presents instructions on food sample preparation for microscopy and helps to interpret the results . It is illustrated with many micrographs . <p> Electron microscopes are the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than light ( optical ) microscopes . However , since electrons , and not photons , are used to enlarge the views of the specimens , the resulting photographs ( micrographs ) are black and white only . For education and illustration purposes , individual specimen components such as starch granules , fat globules , muscle fibres , cell walls , microorganisms etc. in such micrographs may be highlighted by false colours . Electron microscopy provides a markedly higher magnification at a considerably better resolution than light microscopy but is much more expensive to perform . Instead of light , a beam of electrons generated from an incandescent tungsten or a lanthanum hexaboride electrode is used to magnify the image of the sample . Field emission guns are superior to these thermionic sources of electrons . Information on the working of an electron microscope in greater detail explains other terms such as electromagnetic lenses and their functions as well as advances in the improvement of the microscope resolution . <p> Electrons are negatively charged particles which behave like radiation having a very short wavelength . There are two major electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . The electron beam is focussed using magnetic lenses in both kinds of microscope . In the schematic diagram on the left , 5 lenses are shown for TEM and only two for SEM . The specimen in placed into the path of the electron beam ( S ) in the TEM but in the SEM it is placed at the end of the focussed electron beam path . The image ( Im ) is produced in the form of a shadow on a fluorescent screen in TEM . Greater detail on image formation in the TEM is also available . In SEM , reflected and secondary electrons are processed by an electron detector to form a quasi three-dimensional image on a monitor screen . Since the electrons would be easily absorbed by air , the microscopic examination is carried out in vacuo . To ensure that the electrons will penetrate a thin section of the specimen or its replica , the electron beam is accelerated in the microscope . An anode with an orifice in its centre is positively charged . The negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre fly , accelerated , through the orifice toward the specimen . Accelerating voltage of 3 to 20 kV has been used to do SEM and 60 to 80 kV have been used in TEM of foods . <p> Environmental scanning electron microscopes(ESEM) can be used to examine hydrated ( water-containing ) specimens at a reduced air pressure . In this way , there is no need to dry or freeze the specimen . This is particularly useful with very fragile specimens such as moulds ( fungi and their spores ) and plant specimens such as fruits and vegetables . ESEM micrographs have been contributed by Mr. A.-F . Yang . Traditional electron microscopy requires that the specimen must not release any gas or vapour when inserted into the transmission or scanning electron microscope . Except for powdered foods such as flour , sugar , or milk powder , most foods contain water . Drying or freezing at a very low temperature of -100C ensure that the condition of not releasing gas or vapour is met . <p> Transmission electron microscopy can by performed using various techniques . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting thin sections ( 15 to 90 nm thick ) using a microtome , staining the structures within the sections ( using heavy metal salts such as osmium , lead , and uranium ) , and placing the sections into the path of the electron beam . Other TEM methods include negative staining , which is a relatively simple procedure whereby minute particles such as casein micelles , dietary fibre , bacteriophage , or bacteria are mixed with a heavy metal salt solution and applied on a thin electron-transparent film . The specimen and the salt solution are dried and placed into the microscope . The heavy metal , which surrounds the organic specimen , absorbs electrons but the electrons which pass through the organic specimen form a ' negatively stained ' image . Metal shadowing is another simple technique whereby the specimen is dried on a translucent film and then is ' shadowed ' with platinum vapour in vacuo . The thickness of the coating ( less than 0.005 micrometer ) depends on the angle of the surface shadowed . The image is formed by the electron beam which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the topography of the specimen 's surface . Freeze-fracturing and freeze-etching techniques are the most laborious . They make it possible to examine the specimen without altering it chemically ( fixation ) or physically ( dehydration , impregnation with a resin , drying ) . The specimen is rapidly frozen , then is freeze-fractured at a temperature below -110C and the fracture plane is replicated with platinum and carbon either immediately or after a certain period of freeze-etching , during which a thin layer of ice in the specimen sublimes off and reveals underlying structures . The specimen is thawed and the replica is separated from the specimen , cleaned from specimen residues , and examined in the microscope . <p> In scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , the specimen is examined by a focussed electron beam . Some of these electrons are reflected and others generates secondary electron from the gold coating . ( A great variety of other interactions also takes place ) . Secondary electrons ( or , in other applications , backscattered electrons ) are used to form an enlarged image of the specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to be ' neutralized ' after they have completed the examination , the specimen should be electrically conductive . This is achieved either by chemical procedures which impregnate the specimen with osmium or , more frequently , by physically coating its with gold , a gold-palladium , platinum , or iridium - occasionally both procedures are combined . Metal coating provides a path for the electrons . If this path is interrupted ( by incomplete metal coating or by cracks ) , the electrons sit in the area thus isolated and repel any electrons in the incidental beam in accordance with the rule that electrically charged particles of the same charge repel each other . Thus the area occupied by the stationary negative charge is by-passed and can not be examined . White spots or lines develop in such places and the image is characterized as suffering from charging artifacts . <p> SEM shows specimen surfaces . To the uninitiated , such images may appear familiar , since this is the way in which we perceive our environment , where we also see surfaces , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor and photographed using a 35-mm camera from a special monitor . <p> TEM is predominantly used to reveal internal structures . Mutual relationship between SEM and TEM is explained on the left . Where SEM shows a chain of beads ( top ) in the same way as our eyes would see it , TEM provides an enlarged shadow ( bottom ) of a section through the chain , which had earlier been embedded in a resin . A scientist seeing only the section would assume that there were several single beads ( X ) and a short chain ( Y ) present in the embedded sample . The true structure could be revealed by using both electron microscopy modes . <p> Encapsulation of viscous foods for electron microscopy <p> Biological suspensions consisting of minute organisms are difficult to prepare for electron microscopy as individuals . R. K. Salyaev ( A method of fixation and embedding of liquid and fragile materials in agar microcapsulae . Proc. 4th Europ . Reg . Conf . Electron Microsc . Rome 11 , 37-38 , 1968 ) suggested to concentrate them in agar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled as larger solid samples . This technique is very useful in other microscopic disciplines including food science , particularly with viscous foods such as stirred yogurt , various forms of cream , mayonnaise etc . It may be used for both scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . For the latter technique , considerably smaller capsules would be required than for SEM . A modified encapsulation procedure is very simple to perform but it requires some preliminary practice . The individual steps are shown in the diagram at left from top to bottom . Agar ( 3% ) , dissolved by boiling in distilled water , stirred with a magnetic bar is allowed to cool to approximately 40C and is then maintained at this temperature . The sample to be examined by SEM is aspirated ( approximately a 10 mm long column ) into a pasteur pipette , 1 mm in diameter . The sample is shown in blue colour inside the tip of the pipette at the top of the diagram Step 1 . The exterior of the pipette is wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agar sol ( yellow ) Step 2 . ( Kalb M : Encapsulation of viscous foods in agar gel tubes for electron microscopy . Food Microstructure 7 , 213-214 , 1988 ) . The pipette is then very briefly dipped into the agar sol and is immediately rotated and turned up and down so that a thin sleeve ( yellow ) forms around the pipette Step 3 . The sleeve should be about 0.5 mm thick . It solidifies as the agar sol cools . With an increased experience , this procedure becomes rapid and the sleeve is quite uniform . Dipping in agar sol may be repeated if the first sleeve is too thin . Then the excess gel is trimmed at the upper level of the sample ( arrow ) and is removed Step 4 . The crucial Step 5 is to gently hold the agar gel capsule with fingers and pull the pipette out from the sleeve using the other hand so that the sample fills the gel capsule . The capsule is then positioned vertically ( diagram : bottom line left ) and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end Step 6 . When it cools , the sample is encapsulated and may be placed into a fixative . It is then handled as a solid sample ( dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol , defatted , and freeze-fractured ) . <p> For TEM , the sample is encapsulated using a thin ( 0.3-0.5 mm ) capillary . The agar sleeve should be as thin as possible . Capsules 2-3 mm long may be cut , after the sample had been fixed , postfixed , and dehydrated , before embedding in a resin . At that stage , foods such as yogurt or cream are sufficiently solidified . In contrast to earlier assumptions , this procedure is not suitable for the encapsulation of milk . During fixation , the milk serum is replaced with the fixative and casein micelles sediment at the bottom of the capsule ( Kalb M , Larocque G : Suitability of agar gel encapsulation of milk and cream for electron microscopy . **25;366;TOOLONG und-Technologie 29(4) 368-371 , 1996 ) . <p> Encapsulation at low temperature There has been concern that dipping a heat-sensitive sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a warm agar sol as mentioned above , would damage the microstructure of such food . A new procedure has , therefore , been devised , which makes it possible to encapsulate viscous food samples including egg yolk at low temperature ( Veliky I A , Kalb M : Encapsulation of viscous high-fat foods in calcium alginate gel tubes at ambient temperature . Food Structure 9 , 151-154 , 1990 ) . A double-needle assembly consists of a central needle , 1 mm in diameter , concentrically located in a wider needle . The gap between the two needles is 0.3 mm . This assembly is connected to two 5-mL syringes with pistons ( gray ) so that the food sample ( blue ) would flow through the inner needle and a 3% sodium alginate solution ( yellow ) would flow from another syringe to coat the food sample as shown in the diagram at left . The food sample and the sodium alginate solution are extruded simultaneously into a 0.05 M calcium chloride solution , pH 6.5 , where sodium alginate immediately forms a gel and immobilizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viscosity of the food to be encapsulated . This procedure produces 100 to 200 mm long columns of encapsulated food , which may be cut into shorter segments and transferred into a fixative for subsequent preparation for SEM . <p> Glutaraldehyde fixes only proteins . Unsaturated lipids in foods may be fixed using osmium tetroxide following glutaralldehyde fixation . This procedure is called postfixation . Although double bonds ( -C=C- ) in unsaturated fatty acids react with osmium tetroxide , osmium is easily removed by hydrolysis . This reaction leads to the formation of a diol and osmium trioxide ( OsO3 ) . Hydrolysis does not take place if a heterocyclic base such as pyridine or imidazole is present in the fixative ( the diagram below was drawn according to G. Greyer : Lipid fixation , Acta Histochem . Suppl . XIX:202 , 1977 ) . Based on this information and a paper by S. Angermnller and H. D. Fahimi ( Imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide : An excellent stain for visualization of lipids in transmission electron microscopy . Histochem . J. 14:823 , 1982 ) , P. Allan-Wojtas and M. Kalb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . XIV . Fixation of fat globules in whole milk yogurt for electron microscopy . Milchwisssenschaft 39:323 , 1984 ) . <p> Saturated fat in milkfat globules crystallizes at refrigerator temperatures . This fat does not interact with osmium tetroxide ( and also does not react with subsequent stains ) and is easily distinguished by light colour and sharp crystalline outlines from unsaturated lipids . <p> Imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide may also be used with specimens destined for SEM . In this case , the specimens are rapidly dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and are not treated with chloroform or n-hexane but are subsequently freeze-fractured , returned into absolute ethanol at 20C , and immediately critical-point dried . Failure to either fix fat thoroughly ( e.g. , with imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide ) or to remove it completely ( no postfixation with osmium tetroxide but extraction of the fat from ethanol-impregnated samples using chloroform or n-hexane ) would lead to artifacts : fat residues in the form of minute globules would be found in the sample . <p> Note : This section on the fixation of fat has been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists . <p> Immunolocalization of -lactoglobulin in a milk product embedded in LR White resin 1 . Thin section is treated with rabbit anti--lactoglobulin antibody ( shown in pink colour ) and washed . The rabbit antibody adheres only to areas filled with -lactoglobulin. 2 . Then the section is treated with anti-rabbit IgG ( immunoglobulin G - shown in green colour ) conjugated with gold granules ( shown as yellow discs ) and washed . Anti-rabbit IgG adheres only to areas covered with the rabbit anti--lactoglobulin antibody . The areas which contain -lactoglobulin are thus labelled with gold granules . TEM shows the gold particles as minute black discs . <p> Coloured areas in the action diagram at left are explained above : -lactoglobulin ( blue ) is shown as part of a milk product ( brown ) embedded in a resin ( light yellow ) . The final stage which is subjected to electron microscopy is presented below . Anti--lactoglobulin antibody is shown in pink and anti-rabbit IgG is shown in green with gold granules in rich yellow : <p> Immunolocalization in electron microscopy is a technique which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other proteins and polysaccharides by marking it with minute gold granules . Examples may include the presence of -lactoglobulin in curd which consists mostly of casein or , in case of a fictitious adulteration , bovine milk proteins in sheep cheese . Any substance which evokes immunological response as a ' foreign ' body may be detected . Dying the specimen , as is usually done in optical microscopy , is irrelevant because electron micrographs do not reveal colours . Often the chemical composition of the minor substance to be identified is very close to the major substance , so immunolocalization using colloidal gold is used even in optical microscopy . These techniques are common in medicine and biology and are increasingly useful in food science . The food ( milk product ) under study is embedded in a resin such as LR White or Lowicryl K4M and sectioned . An example of a thin section is in the diagram at right showing -lactoglobulin inside a milk product . The crucial point is to react the section with a specific antibodies against the substance to be marked ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an animal different from cattle ( for example , rabbit , goat ) , if cow milk product is the main sample . Thus , rabbit anti--lactoglobulin antibodies become attached only to the sites where there is -lactoglobulin in the sample . The section is washed to allow only these antibodies to remain attached to the labelled sites . These antibodies are shonw in pink colour in the animation at left . Next , antibodies against anything of rabbit origin are applied . However , these antibodies ( anti-rabbit IgG ) are conjugated with gold granules ( colloidal gold ) . The gold granules are very small , 5 to 150 nm in diameter . Their diameter may be controlled , so there is a choice to use 5 nm , 20 nm , 50 nm or larger ' gold markers ' . In the animated diagram at left , the anti-rabbit IgG is shown in green colour and the gold markers are yellow . The anti-rabbit IgG reacts only where there is a rabbit-made substance at that is the anti--lactoglobulin antibody . Excess of the marker is washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron microscope . There is a word of caution : To show the principle and the procedure , nothing in these schematic diagrams is shown to scale . When the electron beam passes through the gold-labelled section , enlarged shadows of the gold granules are shown where there is also -lactoglobulin in the micrograph . Work is in progress to show such micrographs on this page . <p> The need to prevent hydrated samples ( such as moist foods - meats , cheeses , fruits and vegetables , etc. ) from releasing water vapour when they are prepared for electron microscopy has already been mentioned . Since a beam of electrons is used to obtain enlarged images and electrons are easily absorbed by any molecules in the atmosphere , electron microscopy requires that the specimen releases neither gas nor vapour when inserted in the evacuated stage chamber . This applies to SEM as well as TEM but not to the environmental scanning electron microscopes . <p> Dehydration ( drying ) of the samples is one of the procedures to prevent the generation of water vapour , freezing is another procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples is yet another possibility . Each of these procedures has some advantages and some drawbacks . <p> Hydrated food samples that had been frozen may further be processed for SEM or TEM . It is usually claimed that freezing fixes the specimen without need of using any chemicals so the development of artifacts is reduced . This may be true only under very specific conditions - if the aqueous phase present in the specimen is frozen rapidly to form " vitreous " ice . <p> Examples of ice crystal development in an ice crean mix . Bar in left image : 2 m , bar in right image : 1 m ) <p> Vitrification of water occurs when the freezing has occurred so fast that ice crystals have no time to form . Otherwise , there is a great probability that the specimen will be distorted by ice crystals which develop when water freezes " slowly " . For pure water to form vitreous ice , the freezing rate would have to be more than 1x106K/s and for biological samples the rate should be greater than 1x104K/s . Heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surface . This means that the high freezing rate may be achieved only in a very thin ( up to 3 m thick ) superficial layer . For TEM the specimen thickness is limited to less than 10 m and droplets must be smaller than 20 m in diameter . Beyond the zone of vitreous ice , ice crystals grow and push other constituents in the specimen aside ( schematically shown at left ) , be they simple molecules such as sugars , suspended particles such as casein micelles , or solid structures such as coagulated proteins or a polysacharide matrix . " Slow " freezing occurs even if a relatively small sample , e.g. , 2 mm in diameter , is dropped into liquid nitrogen . Although the temperature of liquid nitrogen is very low ( -196C ) , this is its temperature of boiling . Any object dropped into it vapourizes the liquid around and generates a thin layer of nitrogen gas which insulates the object and reduces the heat transfer from it . Freons ( in the past ) and n-hexane or liquid ethane nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid freezing procedures , particularly high-pressure freezing , have also been developed - details may be found in books listed at the end of this section - in fact , at present , the principles and applications seem to be better explained in the older books than on the Web ) . <p> Frozen specimens are usually freeze-fractured in order to examine the internal structure by SEM . Freeze fracturing may be done in a special apparatus called the cryo-stage , attached to the scanning electron microscope . A brief period of freeze etching removes a thin layer of the frozen ice by sublimation thus allowing the solid structures to emerge . The frozen specimen is then coated with gold . Freeze fracturing may be combined with conventional SEM . The specimen is chemically fixed , dehydrated in absolute ethanol , frozen and freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen ( ethanol does not produce crystals when frozen ) . The fragments are thawed in absolute ethanol , critical-point dried , mounted on SEM stubs , coated with gold , and examined by conventional SEM . The benefits of this procedure have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEM may or may not be freeze-etched and then replicated with platinum and carbon . The specimen is then removed and the replica is cleaned , captured on a grid , and examined . Freezing is also advantageous to negative staining of some specimens . Air-drying used most frequently distorts even minute particles such as spherical viruses . Freezing them with the thin layer of the negative stain still on the supporting film and freeze-drying preserves the globular shapes of the viruses as had been shown by M. Nermut in 2 . Freeze-drying is similarly useful with specimens destined for metal shadowing as had also been shown by the same author . These procedures would be useful with casein micelles and other minute hydrated corpuscular food components . <p> Could frozen ice cream be embedded in a resin ? H. D. Goff provides the answer and decribes an important preparatory procedure called freeze substitution . <p> Many food microscopists have not yet discovered the benefits of freeze-fracturing and open their specimens by dry-fracturing to reveal their internal microstructure . However , there is an important difference between the two preparatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fracture runs through areas of the lowest resistance . If the sample contains dense inclusions ( calcium crystals in cheese , compacted protein clusters in yogurt ) , such inclusions will not be fractured but will be either removed or will stay intact in the sample . Even in a relatively uniform sample such as smooth yogurt or cheese , the topography of the fracture will be coarse . Its images will be unsuitable even to roughly estimate the diameters of the air cells , fat globules , or other constituents . <p> Dry-fracturing of a cheese sample from which fat has been removed ( left diagram ) shows 2 fractures ( red lines ) . In both cases , the sample has fractured through the thinnest walls . The resulting image is that of a very porous **27;393;TOOLONG of the same sample ( right diagram ) impregnated with absolute ethanol is characterized by fracture planes ( blue lines ) running straight irrespective of cheese protein or void spaces which , in this case , are filled with frozen ethanol . The resulting image is that of a sizeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in liquid nitrogen on specimens that have been impregnated with absolute ( 100% ) ethanol . There are no air pockets in such specimens . Whereas freezing produces ice crystals in most hydrated specimens , no crystals develop in specimens impregnated in absolute ethanol . This means that there is no risk that the microstructure of the specimens will be severely damaged by freezing if the aqueous phase is replaced with ethanol . Wherever possible , it is advisable to trim each specimen into 2 or 3 small blocks ( 1x1x10 mm ) before fixation . When the blocks are fully dehydrated , they are immersed one after another in liquid nitrogen using a pair of insulated needle-point tweezers . There should be a small metal block immersed in the insulated box where liquid nitrogen is held . Freeze-fracturing is done on that metal using a pair of tweezers and a scalpel ( both insulated and precooled in liquid nitrogen ) . A sudden increase in pressure on the scalpel tip at the edge of the sample chips off a small particle . The entire specimen block may be fractured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each frozen fragment is then dropped into absolute ethanol held at ambient temperature and all fragments are subsequently critical-point dried . <p> The fragments have smooth fracture planes as if an ultrasmooth cut has been made through the specimen - a marked difference from the rugged surface of a dry-fractured specimen . Dense as well as porous regions are all fractured in the single plane . Distribution and dimensions of void spaces and ingredients and inclusions such as fat globules , microorganisms , calcium phosphate crystals etc. may easily be evaluated . Micrographs of yogurt and various cheeses have been obtained with freeze-fractured specimens . <p> Electron micrographs of thin sections of starch granules embedded in a resin typically resemble the image shown at left . The dark ' spikes ' have long puzzled researchers and some of them have attempted to find correlations between the density , shapes , and dimensions of the ' spikes ' and the presence of other materials , such as proteins , inside the starch granules . However , the origin of the ' spikes ' was explained more than 26 years ago by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la prTparation de coupes de graines d'amidon .

Both diagrams have been drawn on the basis of the authors ' paper . <p> During embedding , the dense starch granules resist impregnation with the resin and so remain unimpregnated . While thin sections are floated on water during sectioning ( diagrams at right ) , the starch granule sections become hydrated and they swell ( figures 2 and 3 from top ) . The swollen section eventually develops folds ( bottom figure ) . Thus , the nature of the ' spikes ' , i.e. , the folds , is rather related to the dimensions of the starch granules , the thickness of the section and the time , which the section spent in contact with water . Authors D. Gallant and A. Guilbot documented the fold formation by SEM micrographs . <p> Many papers on the microscopy of starch have been published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIND function of your browser .

The role of starch in a variety of foods is discussed in great detail . <p> *** <p> SEM of microorganisms <p> Microorganisms are present on purpose in many foods , such as cultured ( fermented ) dairy products , leavened bakery products , sauerkraut , pickles , and even some special salami . Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are part of a group of so-called probiotic bacteria which means useful bacteria which may protect us from food-borne pathogens . Yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , known for their ability to ferment sugar and produce alcohol , are part of Fungi . For their ability to produce carbon dioxide they are also used in leavened bakery products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penicillium camemberti in Camembert cheese , P. rocqueforti in Blue cheese . In contrast to these microscopic fungi , mushrooms can be seen by a naked eye and are being collected for food in many parts of the world . <p> Nuclepore-type filters , 13 mm in diameter , pore size 0.4 m , are most suitable for SEM of bacteria . The stability of the filters in absolute ethanol and liquid carbon dioxide is essential . Wetting the filters with 0.1% polylysine hydrobromide solution may improve their holding power for some bacteria during fixation , dehydration , and critical point drying . The lower part of a KS-13 stainless steel syring holder ( MicroFiltration Systems , Dublin , California ) ( catalog no. 301000 ) was used to hold the polycarbonate filters . A wet bacterial filter was placed on the dense steel mesh and mild suction through an erlenmeyer flask ( see the figure at left ) was applied to drain the polylysine solution . A dilute bacterial suspension was placed from a pasteur pipette on the filter and a mild suction was applied after one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then transferred on the surface of 3-4 mL of a cacodylate buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution ( pH 7 ) for about half an hour and then immersed in the fixative . It is useful to check ( from the clarity of the fixative ) whether the bacteria adhere to the filter . Yeast cells do not adhere well . The filters were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series ( 20 , 40 , 70 , 95 , 100 , 100 , 100% ethanol ) and were critical-point dried . Following the finding that the sticky material of double-sided sticky tapes penetrates the filter pores and eventually covers the bacteria and makes them unavailable to microscopy has prompted a change in the mounting procedure ( figure at right ) . Only a narrow strip ( &gt;1 mm wide , yellow ) is now placed on an SEM aluminum stub ( light blue ) .

Any contributions will be noted and appreciated . <p> Preface <p> I want to pass along some information , in hopes that it will help those that are considering modding their C5 or LS1/LS6 , and what happens when you do.I do n't claim to be an expert , and much of what I have learned , I have learned from ; my own experiences , other enthusiasts , and elsewhere . There may be some errors below , but all of this information has been performed and researched over a long time by me , and is thought to be correct . <p> Introduction <p> One of the most typical mod that most effects your system 's calibration is modding the MAF . Adding cold-air systems , ported/polished throttle bodies , etc , serve to compound taking the system out of scope when used with a ported MAF . <p> This is a byproduct of enhancing the efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . <p> Other modifications to the engine , including adding headers , all the way to heads/cam applications , and even full out , bored and stroked motors , all effect the system in much the same way a ported MAF does . Because when you increase the efficiency of the motor , you are changing the way it is calibrated to meter airflow , and fuel delivery . <p> I am attempting to be as low level as possible , yet also am trying to speak in layman terms where at all possible . <p> Here is an internal view of the LS1 PCM that runs the whole show . This PCM is located in the engine bay on the passenger side behind the tire well on the C5 . <p> Most GM enthusiast are familiar with the older Delco engine computers and the availability of so called ' hot chips ' , unfortunately with the GenIII PCM Delphi moved to using Flash ROM which did away with the need for a removable EPROM ( Memcal ) . It 's great if you have the tools to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a GM dealership such tools are probably a bit out of reach . <p> Looking at the picture , the MCU is clearly visible as the big square chip near the top , this MCU is based on the Motorola MC68332 but it seems to be a custom one for GM as there does n't seem to be a 160pin 68332 in any Motorola docs . A few of it 's features are a 32bit CPU and on board TPU ( Time Processor Unit ) . <p> The MC68332 ia s highly-integrated 32 bit microcontroller that combines high-performance data manipulation capabilities with powerful peripheral subsystems.This MCU is built up from standard modules that interface through a common intermodule bus ( IMB ) . <p> The MCU incorporates a 32 bit CPU ( CPU32 ) , a system integration module ( SIM ) , a time processing unit ( TPU ) , a queued serial module ( QSM ) and a 2 Kbyte static RAM module with TPU emulation capability ( TPURAM ) . The MCU can operate at 16 , 20 , and 25 MHz . <p> To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 4 Mbit unit by Intel , this is where all the running code and calibrations are stored , it can not be easily removed , but it can be reprogrammed ( new calibrations etc ) via the ALDL plug under the steering column with a Tech2 or similar device . <p> Down each side you can see many driver arrays mounted to a heatsink , these are all the drivers for various functions ( Injectors , A/C relay , Fan Relays , Transmission Solenoids , Idle Stepper Motor , etc . ) . One smart move IMHO is that Delphi choose not to fire the 8 individual ignition coils directly from the PCM ( unlike some other makes do ) , instead each cylinder has it 's own ' igniter ' mounted on it 's coil and the PCM drives that with a low voltage pulse , the advantage there is that ignition coil failures happen , if they go short circuit then it usually takes out the igniter , if this is part of the PCM then you are up for another PCM instead of just 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage the PCM 's internals if it does not directly fire the coils . <p> The PCM has the capability of running 8 Injectors sequentially , and firing 8 Individual Ignition coils as well as all the other O/P 's that must be managed by the PCM . GM have always been great with their diagnostic info from computers , the GenIII PCM is no exception , with about 100+ different error codes it should be quite easy to pin point any errors that are detected . <p> MAF and Throttle Body Porting , and it 's application <p> Obviously the reason people port their MAF , whether it 's by physically porting it , adding MAF ends ( 97-00 only ) , or by replacing the entire unit , GMS etc ... , it is to increase the engines ability to take in air , and also attempt to increase timing advance , by inducing less perceived load . <p> A stock 97-00 MAF is comprised of several components . <p> - the center housing and heated elements- outer ends with the intake side having a honeycomb screen- electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements temperature , to a frequency to be sent to the PCM for processing <p> The 01 MAFs , including LS6 MAFs , are slightly larger than 97-00 LS1 units , and are complete housings , without MAF ends . This MAF is actually the MAF used on the GM Truck engines , and was adopted from them in 01 for the C5 . ( By the way , so was the 6.0 liter truck cam for 01 ) . There is a wiring difference between 97-00 and 01 MAFs , so be aware of that when modding , because the 01+ MAFs have integrated the IAT sensor into the MAF Housing . All C5 MAFs ( except the 02 Z06 ) have screens in them to help in laminar airflow . The 02 LS6 MAF does not . It was removed because GM believes the location of the MAF assembly so far forward near the filter with a screen does not significantly assist in helping smooth airflow , at least when compared to the power the 02 LS6 is making , and the need for more air . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire elements inside the MAF housing . When airflow increases , the wires attempt to cool , and the current draw needed to maintain the temperature , is converted into a frequency and sent to the PCM for further processing . The PCM contains algorithms that interpret the signal received via the MAF sensor . It then increases or decreases fuel injector pulse width signals , thus increasing or decreasing the a/f ratio . In true closed loop mode ( part throttle operation ) , the PCM uses the O2 sensors to insure that it is mixing the a/f mixture properly , and it will adjust fuel trims accordingly to achieve a 14.7 stoichometric a/f ratio . This ratio is the scientific ratio where 100 percent of fuel is utilized when 14.7 parts of air is mixed with 1 part of fuel . This achieves the best compromise of fuel economy and power . <p> Throttle Body <p> I think porting the TB is not worth the money on a stock motor . I do think smoothing it out , and removing any turbulent causing items , does help smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Air/Fuel Ratios , and their effect on power output <p> Due to the nature of the internal combustion engine , it produces maximum power on a slightly richer mixture than 14.7 - around 13 parts of air to one part of fuel will satisfy most engines . Maximum economy occurs on a mixture that is slightly leaner than the chemically correct proportion - around 16:1 . Under normal operating conditions , the fuel system has to regulate the mixture around these two points , depending on whether we demand power from the engine , or are just cruising at a steady speed on the highway . <p> From the graph it is clear that mixtures richer than about 13:1 will only succeed in wasting fuel : one part of fuel will burn up 14.7 parts of air . If we add two parts of fuel to 14.7 parts of air , only one part of fuel will burn up and do work , because there is not enough air for the second part of fuel to burn . A very important point to note , is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any work , takes up space in the combustion chamber valuable space which could have been filled by a combustible mixture . So , where we could have had a combustion chamber that was filled 100% with a combustible mixture , we now only have about 80% of that space available . The other 20% is taken up by excess fuel , which is not going to burn . That leaves us with an engine that will only deliver 80% of the power it is capable of , while using twice the amount of fuel it should . This explanation finally dispels the " more fuel , more power " - myth . If we want more power , we need to fill the combustion chamber with more " mixture " . <p> Another aspect of tuning " rich or lean " comes down to your reference point of what is rich or lean . <p> How does it effect power ? Let 's take a look : <p> Above we can now see why the PCM does not concern itself , nor is it restricted to EPA restrictions during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FUEL enrichment mode " : ) <p> Back to the C5 ; If the proper ratio is not being maintained based on O2 input , the PCM will begin to adjust the short term fuel trims . This means the PCM will increase or decrease the injector pulse width based on a too lean or rich condition . If the PCM has to adjust for this condition long enough in the short term fuel trims , it will make an update to the long term fuel trims , and set the short term fuel trims back to 0 . <p> Fuel trims are simply tuning parameters inside the PCM that the PCM updates based on information from the Oxygen Sensors . <p> Fuel Metering Modes of Operation <p> Short Term Fuel Trim Description <p> The short term fuel trim ( FT ) is a PCM erasable memory register . The neutral value for the short term FT is 0 percent . Any deviation from 0 percent indicates the short term FT is changing the injector pulse width . The amount of pulse width change depends on how far the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short term FT is rich when the scan tool indicates a negative number . The short FT is lean when the scan tool indicates a number greater than 0 . The short term FT changes the injector pulse width by adding to or subtracting from the base pulse width equation . As the PCM monitors the oxygen sensors input , it is constantly varying the short term FT value . The value is updated very quickly , therefore the short term FT only corrects for short term mixture trends . The correction of long term mixture trends is the function of long term FT . <p> When the PCM determines that the short term FT is out of the operating range , 1 of the following DTCs will set : <p> The long term fuel trim ( FT ) is a matrix of cells arranged by RPM and MAP . Each cell of the long term FT is a register like the short term FT . As the engine operating conditions change , the PCM will switch from cell to cell to determine what long term FT factor to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given cell , the PCM also monitors the short term FT . If the short term FT is far enough from 0 percent , the PCM will change the long term FT value . Once the long term FT value is changed , it should force the short term FT back toward 0 percent . If the mixture is still not correct ( as judged by the PCM ) , the short term FT will continue to have a large deviation from the ideal 0 percent . In this case , the long term FT value will continue to change until the short term FT becomes balanced . Both the short term FT and long term FT have limits , which vary by calibration . If the mixture is off enough so that long term FT reaches the limit of its control and still can not correct the condition , the short term FT would also go to its limit of control in the same direction . If the mixture is still not corrected by both short term FT and long term FT at their extreme values , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the long term FT is out of the operating range , the following DTCs will set : <p> Under the conditions of power enrichment , the PCM sets the short term FT to 0 percent and freezes it there until power enrichment is no longer in effect . This is done so the Closed Loop factor and the long term FT will not try to correct for the commanded richness of power enrichment . <p> The ability of the PCM to increase or decrease long term fuel trim adjustments is +/- 25% in either direction ( 23% and 13% for 01 's ) . It will set a diagnostic code . At that point , you are forced to look at your system and either remedy it by go back to where you were , or tuning your system , and/or adding larger injectors , etc . <p> Fuel Cells <p> The PCM will move from cell to cell under varying conditions.There are 22 Fuel Cells , and are as follows : <p> The LS1 and other modern engines use Timing and Fuel Tables inside the PCM . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAF <p> When you port your MAF , you do several things to the system . <p> First by removing the screen , you increase airflow . By doing this however , you somewhat decrease the laminar ( smooth ) airflow across the MAF elements in the housing . The increase in airflow though , typically offsets the increase in turbulence , so its a good mod . Vendors are now including airfoils with their MAF ends to reestablish a smoother airflow . <p> Porting your MAF either by MAF ends , physical porting , or adding a completely new housing , increases air volume into the motor , but decreases air velocity . Also , unmetered air bypasses the MAF elements . This conflicts with the algorithms in the PCM since air velocity changes , and unmetered air gets by . <p> You in effect have " tricked " the PCM and created a lean condition because you now have more parts of air relative to fuel . In closed loop mode , the PCM will fix the problem because the O2 sensors will realize the lean condition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually the longterm fuel descriptions , if the anomaly is maintained . This in effect forces the PCM to operate in a constant state of modifying the a/f mixture in long term fuel trims from its neutral state without further tuning/modding . <p> There are several " modes " of operation : <p> The PCM looks at voltages from several sensors to determine how much fuel to give the engine . The fuel is delivered under one of several conditions called modes . The PCM controls all modes . <p> Wide Open Throttle Operation <p> Something to note : The PCM on GEN III engines only operates in True Open Loop Mode during cold engine startup because the heated O2 sensors need time to warm up to operating temperatures . Cold startup is where the engine runs in speed density mode , whereby it only looks at map/maf sensors , and other information such as engine speed and throttle position . Then it goes into , closed loop mode , but has a Power Enrichment Mode for WOT operation . This mode of operation is a modified version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metering to determine engine load , but does not send updates to the PCM like fuel trim adjustments . <p> Starting ModeWith the ignition switch in the ON position ( before engaging the starter ) , the PCM energizes the fuel pump relay for 2 seconds allowing the fuel pump to build up pressure . The PCM first checks speed density , then switches to the mass air flow ( MAF ) sensor . The PCM also uses the engine coolant temperature ( ECT ) , throttle position ( TP ) , and manifold absolute pressure ( MAP ) sensors to determine the proper air/fuel ratio for starting . The PCM controls the amount of fuel delivered in the starting mode by changing the pulse width of the injectors . This is done by pulsing the injectors for very short times . <p> Clear Flood ModeIf the engine floods , clear the engine by pushing the accelerator pedal down to the floor and then crank the engine . The PCM reduces the injector pulse width in order to increase the air to fuel ratio . The PCM holds this injector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine speed is below a predetermined RPM . If the throttle is not held wide open , the PCM returns to the starting mode . <p> Run ModeThe run mode has 2 conditions called Open Loop and Closed Loop . When the engine is first started , and engine speed is above a predetermined RPM , the system begins Open Loop operation . The PCM ignores the signal from the HO2S and calculates the air/fuel ratio based on inputs from the ECT , MAF , MAP , and TP sensors . The system stays in Open Loop until meeting the following conditions : <p> Both HO2S have varying voltage output , showing that they are hot enough to operate properly . This depends upon the engine temperature.The ECT sensor is above a specified temperature.A specific amount of time has elapsed after starting the engine.Specific values for the above conditions exist for each different engine , and are stored in the electrically erasable programmable read only memory ( EEPROM ) . The system begins Closed Loop operation after reaching these values . In Closed Loop , the PCM calculates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from various sensors , but mainly from the HO2S . This allows the air/fuel ratio to stay very close to 14.7:1 . <p> Acceleration ModeWhen the driver pushes on the accelerator pedal , airflow into the cylinders increases rapidly , while fuel flow tends to lag behind . To prevent possible hesitation , the PCM increases the pulse width to the injectors to provide extra fuel during acceleration . The PCM determines the amount of fuel required based upon the throttle position , the coolant temperature , the manifold air pressure , the mass airflow , and the engine speed . <p> Deceleration ModeWhen the driver releases the accelerator pedal , airflow into the engine is reduced . The PCM looks at the corresponding changes in throttle position , manifold air pressure and mass airflow . The PCM shuts OFF fuel completely if the deceleration is very rapid , or for long periods ( such as long closed throttle coast-down ) . The fuel shuts OFF in order to protect the catalytic converters . <p> Battery Voltage Correction ModeWhen the battery voltage is low , the PCM compensates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways : <p> Increasing the amount of fuel deliveredIncreasing the idle RPMIncreasing the ignition dwell time <p> Fuel Cutoff ModeThe PCM cuts off fuel from the fuel injectors when certain conditions are met . This fuel shut off mode protects the powertrain from damage , and improves drivability . The control module disables the injectors under the following conditions : <p> The ignition is OFF ( prevents engine run-on ) The ignition is ON but there is no ignition reference signal ( prevents flooding or backfiring ) The engine speed is too high ( above red line ) The vehicle speed is too high ( above rated tire speed ) ( Does not apply to Y Cars ) During an extended , high speed , closed throttle coast down ( reduces emissions and increases engine braking ) <p> ----Power Enrichment Mode <p> When going to WOT or Power Enrichment Mode . The PCM does several things . <p> It no longer is concerned with maintaining economical or environmental operations . It freezes the fuel trim adjustments , stops monitoring the O2 sensors , and looks briefly where it was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to rely almost exclusively on the MAF sensor input for proper a/f adjustment . <p> Here is where we are most concerned . Since we have modified our stock MAF , all the conditions of unmetered air , decreased air velocity , etc , that we created with our mods , cause the system to be out of adjustment , in power enrichment mode . <p> To solve this problem , we need to increase the injector flow rate . To do this , we can either have custom PCM programming done , which modifies the a/f tables in the PCM to accommodate the difference in airflow . Or we can modify the signal before it enters the PCM for processing by tricking the PCM into perceiving there is a greater or lesser load being reported . <p> In this mode the PCM will add fuel as a percentage , greater than it would normally during PE Mode , if the Ltrims are positive ( correcting for a lean condition ) . However if the Ltrims are correcting for a rich condition ( when they are negative ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel that it normally adds during PE mode . <p> You will find that if you are running positive Ltrims during non PE mode , and you go WOT , you will see a correlating locked positive Ltrim value at WOT . On the other hand , you will see the trims locked at 0 if you normally have negative Ltrims during non WOT . <p> MAF Translator , GMS , and MAF Operation <p> The stock MAF sensor consists of 3 wires . A ground , power source , and a signal wire . <p> Let 's look at how the GMS or MAF Translator work . <p> The GMS ( granatelli ) is a complete MAF Sensor with its own customized fixed electronics . It 's electronics are preset to adjust the change in airflow based on it 's MAF 's physical characteristics , and sends what it believes to be the appropriate signal to the PCM for proper fuel adjustments . It seems to be pretty successful in doing this , as long as there are no other variables in the system such as other mods like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more involved , but allows more flexibility . <p> The MAF Translator consists of a microcontroller ( mini stand alone computer ) , which takes the stock MAF signal , and reinterprets it before the PCM sees it . <p> The MAFT has two potentiometers on it ( variable resistors ) that allow the user to skew the signal one-way or the other . <p> This is a photo of the MAF translator board that resides in the box . Notice the two variable resistors on the bottom . Note : all mode switches should be set to off on the C5 <p> The first POT , is the BASE POT . It is the fundamental signal adjustment , and is present throughout , including WOT . The second POT is the WOT POT . It is utilized when the MAFT senses a WOT load from the MAF . It combines to further skew the BASE signal for fine tuning of WOT a/f operation . <p> Here is a frequency breakdown of MAFT operation : ( courtesy of ' Topless Texan ' of corvette forum ) <p> When changing values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal across the whole range . At &gt; than 8K you are adding in WOT settings to BASE for WOT operation . This allows fine tuning of WOT . <p> The PCM will not " learn out " the settings of the MAFT on the BASE . What will happen however is a permanent change in Long Term Fuel Trims . This will most directly effect perceived engine load and timing . Remember that no matter what , the O2 sensors rule in ' closed loop ' mode , and will always tell the PCM to adjust to 14.7 stociometric a/f ratio . The MAFT setting during fuel enrichment ( WOT ) however will always be permanent since the PCM freezes any possibility of updating its fuel trims or any other values . In this mode the PCM solely relies on raw flow data from the MAF , RPM , and TPS . This is what makes the MAFT a very good product . <p> How long does it take for Long Term Fuel Trims to update and set Short Term to 0 ? That is really dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen it take up to 250 miles of driving to fully normalize the system after tuning the BASE on the MAFT . The WOT happens immediatly . <p> Fuel Cells <p> You need to analyze your fuel trims ( cells 0-19 ) only , for dialing in the BASE setting on your MAFT , and you analyze your O2 sensors only , for WOT tweaking . Remember , that the stock narrow-band O2 sensors are not precision devices , and should be baselined against a Wide Band O2 sensor at a dyno shop , before you begin tuning . <p> Custom PCM programming is great , and offers other features separate from a/f tuning , but the drawback is that you have to wait to get a new program each time from the vendor . ( update Jan 2002 ) LS1 Edit is out and looks extremely promising as a tool for the home user , without need of hiring a PCM tuner to give you a program . However the learning curve may be somewhat steep for beginners . <p> Most injectors will max out at 80% duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific fuel consumption - How much fuel you are using per horsepower per hour . <p> Formula : <p> .50 = B.S.F.C ( Brake Specific Fuel Consumption ) In most cases a naturally aspirated engine will have a B.S.F.C of .50 . This means that the engine will use .50 lbs . of fuel per hour for each horsepower it produces . Turbocharged engines will want to be at .60 lbs . per hour or higher . <p> ( While .50 is used as the industry standard for calculating and determining an injectors HP ability . High Performance Engines and Racing engines begin to use less than .50 <p> .48 , or even .40 in extremely high output . <p> So with the LS1 , there is a margin there below .50 <p> It 's difficult to determine precise BSFC needs on an individual basis , because the process involves extensive dyno testing , and the use of lambda meters to observe and log specific air fuel ratios under all conditions . <p> Also to note , an engine will be most efficient at peak torque . ) <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of versatility . Since most ported MAFs typically lean the system out 10 to 15% , the SVO pieces actually bring you back over into a too rich condition ( or as I like to say , enough to purposefully overdo it ) . <p> This is what we are after . Since the PCM determines the timing curve to use based on engine load , we can now use a MAF Translator to dial in " leanness " or " less of a perceived engine load " . Since the PCM does n't  know the larger than stock injectors are in there , they flow more fuel . Yes , the O2 's will adjust for the extra fuel flow via the fuel trims , but the WOT will again be skewed along with the fuel trims . So we have tricked the PCM with our larger injectors . By dialing in leanness , ( less perceived engine load ) , on the MAFT , the PCM will increase the aggressiveness of the timing . Or in other words , it will advance the timing . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pre-ignition , or knock should not occur . We can dial out knock if necessary . <p> The nice thing about the SVO racing injectors , is that they are also able to grow with our engine if we happen to need the extra HP ability of them . They are also much more robust and quieter than the stock ones . They maintain the same 10 degree conical spray pattern , and are distanced in the same position over the hot intake valve . They also have the same impedance rating etc of the stock units . In fact , they are the exact same type of injector , only they flow more fuel . <p> Here is a visual comparison with the SVO unit on the left : <p> Note : Fooling around with injectors is not for all . Its for those looking to maximize output . Do n't  expect any major gains on a stock motor . <p> Couple of things about Dynoing your car and using a Wide-Band O2 Sensor : <p> Remember that when you dyno , you ca n't make changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a permanent gain . If you understand the fundamentals of Short and Long Term Fuel Metering . You know that they require time to normalize . In most cases 40 - 100 Miles of spirited driving between tuning sessions . WOT settings on the MAFT can however be changed while dynoing to identify gains or losses . <p> Tuning : One of the best tools for tuning your system , is an ODB-II scanner . This connects to your vehicles ODB-II port under the steering column , and you can observe and log 100 's of parameters in real-time . Most importantly you can monitor your Fuel Trims , and Oxygen Sensors , and tune your engine accordingly . It is a must have tool for tuning . I prefer Autotap . Something to consider . The heated oxygen sensors used today , are quite accurate at low voltages which occur during closed loop operation . However they become less accurate during WOT operation . They should however remain fairly consistent , for this reason , it is important to Dyno your vehicle every so often to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they compare . It is also important to consider that taking reading before and after the catalytic converters can be different since there is a catalyst action occurring on the exhaust gases . so keep this in mind . The best location to place a wide band O2 sensor is in the exhaust stream before the cats . Some drill holes in their exhaust for this purpose , some remove their precat O2 sensors and use that boss . Speak with your dyno operator for the best placement . <p> Personal Opinions : <p> The first performance mod I would recommend for anyone is a cold air system . I am partial to the Vortex Rammer , for a few reasons . The Vortex uses a round filter with a inwardly shaped conical front that allows very efficient airflow and increase laminar ( smooth ) flow . <p> It also sets up high . Almost where the stock box sits , so water ingestion is as much / or as little of an issue , as with the stock box . Also , remember , that the C5 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ram effect or positive atmosphere . The most substantial gain from a aftermarket filter comes first in removing the restricted stock box . Then you pick up the rest from exposing your filter to cold air . As you accelerate your intake air temperatures will decrease a lot . I would say you pick up power from a cold air system where 80% is from unshrouding , and 20% is from cold air exposure . <p> The second mod i would do , is long tube headers . Cold air and headers will in most cases net you a solid 35 to 40+ HP to the rear wheels . That 's real power . Headers are one of the most expensive bolt on mods at around 1200 with install . But by the time you nickle and dime other mods onto your C5 , you will go over 1200 pretty quick . Guys with 4 CATS like 01 's will see a larger return by removing the precats with the long tube header install . <p> Beyond that , bolt on mods become thrown into what I call an " additive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit in the throttle body bypass , powerducts , ported mafs , etc . But the HP increase is small for each . All together though , and they can add up to something worthwhile . <p> Exhausts will typically yield 0 to 8 HP on a basically stock motor . Do not buy exhausts expecting performance increases . Buy them for looks and sound first . And anything you get will be a pleasant addition . <p> Other solid HP and ET gainers are : <p> LS6 intake <p> Heads <p> Cam <p> Rear Gears <p> Torque Converter ( for autos ) <p> Bored and/or stroked engines <p> And obviously Nitrous <p> Summary <p> As you can see , the whole system is quite involved . But it becomes more and more simple if you break it down . An internal combustion engine functions on the same fundamental principles of physics as it did since inception . Often times , the most difficult process in learning and understanding it , and its electronics , is the difficulty of most to , " dumb " themselves down enough , to understand it .

@@6829756 @29756/ <p> Cheeses are the most common dairy products . The basic procedure is simple and is based on spontaneous processes which , thousands of years ago , probably led to the development of cheese . Milk from various animals , particularly cattle , buffaloes , goats , and sheep is used to make cheese . One of the best descriptions of cheesemaking procedures is easy to follow . Various books may be found in libraries . Some scientific journal papers dealing with the development of structure in cheese are richly illustrated with micrographs , e.g. , in <p> To make cheese , milk is curdled using a bacterial starter culture and an agent called rennet present in the tissue of the calf stomach . Rennet ( chymosin ) is a proteolytic enzyme and its role in cheese making is to destabilize casein micelles and make them to coagulate . Similar enzymes are also found in digestive tract tissues of other animals including chickens . Global shortage of animal-based enzymes and various kinds of aversion of some people to such sources , have led to the use of proteases isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are called vegetarian cheeses . <p> The proteases break down ? -casein present on the surfaces of casein micelles in milk . Deprived of its protective action , casein micelles coagulate and form a gel . When examined by electron microscopy , the coagulum consists of casein micelle clusters and short chains . They encapsulate fat globules - the natural large corpuscular particles present in milk . Void spaces in the casein matrix are filled with the liquid milk serum called whey which is a solution of lactose , minerals , and vitamins , and a suspension of whey proteins . The subsequent steps in the cheese manufacture are aimed at separating the curd from the whey and ripening the curd into cheese . There are many photographs showing , how cheese is being made . <p> Freshly coagulated milk is cut or broken into smaller particles using wire knives , stirrers or other tools and the cut or broken milk gel is slowly heated and stirred . Casein micelle clusters gradually shrink as they expel the whey and the protein matrix becomes compacted . <p> Another milk component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curd . A small number of fat globules , which were exposed during curd cutting , are washed away with the whey . The micrograph at left shows an early stage of milk coagulation . Fixation in a glutaraldehyde solution preserved the solid constituents allowing water to be removed to show the microstructure of the milk coagulum . <p> The removal of the whey makes the casein matrix ( shown blue to black ) more compact and also brings the fat globules ( yellow ) closer together . The curd shown was made from fresh full-fat milk . The fat globules appear as separate entities in the curd - they do not interact with the casein micelles in the fresh milk and they may be characterized as nonreacting inclusions in the curd . This is true of fat globules unaffected by homogenization . <p> Homogenization of milk is a process during which large fat globules are disintegrated into considerably smaller particles . Their total surface is up to 6-fold larger than was the total surface of the original fat globules . Since the original fat globule membranes were fragmented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat surface . Consequently , the small fat particles react immediately with any available proteins in the medium until all bare fat is again well covered . Even entire casein micelles are used for this purpose . Homogenized milk produces a different kind of curd . It is firmer than the curd made from nonhomogenized milk provided that all other parameters have been left unchanged ( enzyme , total solids , pH ) . This phenomenon was known even before the use of electron microscopy , but now the reason for the difference is clear : The minute fat globules with casein micelles anchored on their surfaces have become part of the protein matrix . Fat is no more an inert inclusion but has become a structural constituent . This example is one of many which show the benefits of electron microscopy in elucidating interactions among food constituents and the development of food microstructure . <p> Each individual parameter used during the cheese manufacture has some effect on the cheese produced . This is probably one of the reasons for the great variety of cheeses . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep sensory attributes of a particular product constant in a world where , for example , the original rennet has to be replaced with a similar product from a different source because there is a global shortage of calf stomachs or because the consumers request that no constituents of animal tissues be used in cheese production . Enzymes with a high proteolytic activity may be efficient in quickly curdling the milk but they may also disintegrate a large proportion of the milk proteins which would consequently be lost for the cheese production . High proteolytic activity may also lead to a weakened casein matrix and alter the characteristic consistency of the cheese . Similar constrains are encountered quite frequently . However , new technologies and new ingredients offer new directions in cheese manufacture . Examples will be presented as this home page is further developed . <p> Rennet is added to milk along with a lactic bacteria culture . The role of the bacteria is to assist curdling by decreasing pH of the milk . This is achieved as the bacteria oxidize lactose into lactic acid . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next stage - ripening - takes place at a lower temperature for several weeks or months . This is the time when bacteria slowly degrade the milk proteins and produce substances which give the cheese its characteristic structure ( carbon dioxide eyes in Swiss-type cheeses ) and flavour ( e.g. , a low concentration of propionic acid ) , The great variety of cheeses is made possible by the combinations of many varieties of specific bacteria . However , some cheeses are made with Penicillium moulds ( fungi ) such as Penicillium camemberti and P. roqueforti. rather than bacteria . A small group of cheeses ( Paneer , Queso Blanco , White cheese ) is made by coagulating milk while it is hot , with an acid , such as lactic acid . Such cheeses are not ripened . <h> Pressing and ripening <p> The increase in the density of the curd matrix as a result of whey removal and pressing has been followed in various cheeses by TEM . The micrograph at left shows a thin section of cheddared curd in a cross section . The casein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the preceding micrographs . The fat globules are in contact with each other , having retained their fat globule membranes . An occasional bacterium ( brown ) may also be found . Cheddaring is a process , during which slabs of the warm curd are piled up in the cheese vat , subjecting the curd to a slow flow . It aligns the proteins and fat globules into a ' fibrous ' structure reminiscent of a baked chicken breast . A section cut parallel with the ' fibres ' shows the internal organization of the curd ( micrograph at right ) . Similar kinds of structuring ( ' stretching ' ) may be found in Italian-style Mozzarella cheese and , in particular , in ' string cheeses ' . <p> Cottage cheese represents an early stage product in the cheese manufacture . Curdled milk , cut into cubes , is heated and gently stirred . The cubes shrink and expel whey , as has already been explained . The whey is drained off and the curd is cooled so that its grains are prevented from ' matting ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cottage cheese , as seen by SEM at left , is still porous - consisting of distinct casein micelle clusters . Three bacteria ( greenish ) can be seen as if attached by filaments to the protein network . These filaments developed during sample preparation from a thin layer of polysaccharide mucus ( bacterial capsules ) which surrounded the bacteria in the fresh curd . Highly hydrated polysaccharides are produced by some lactic acid bacteria . They are beneficial in our diet as a source of dietary fibre . In addition , the high viscosity of these polysaccharides modifies the mouthfeel of the food products such as Cottage cheese or yogurt . A high water-holding capacity of the bacterial polysaccharides is another beneficial property . However , the polysaccharides can not be fixed during preparation of the specimen for electron microscopy and the mucus shrinks during dehydration in ethanol into filaments ( at higher mucus concentrations it would shrink into scales ) . The filaments thus did not exist in the original Cottage cheese and are artifacts . <p> Some cheeses ( Indian Paneer cheese , South American Queso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese ) are made by coagulating hot milk with an acid and separating the curd from the whey . <p> All have some features in common : the milk is first heated to at least 85C and then is coagulated using an acid such as citric , lactic , acetic , or hydrochloric acid ( or an acid precursor such as glucono-d-lactone ) to a final pH value of 5.5 making the curd mildly acidic . The coagulated milk is then cooled and the whey is separated . The microstructure of the casein particles has a characteristic ' core-and-shell ' structure ( micrograph at left ) . <p> How the microstructure develops has not yet been fully explained but it is known that three essential conditions must be met : <p> The milk must be coagulated at a temperature higher than 85C so that whey proteins may interact with ? -casein ; <p> As the name indicates , Cream cheese is made from pure cream or from mixtures of cream and milk . It has a rich , mildly acidic flavour and a smooth buttery consistency . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homogenized , and coagulated using a lactic bacterial culture . The curd is then heated to 52-63C , drained , and hot-packed or cold-packed . This kind of manufacturing procedure yields whey which has to be disposed off . <p> In a newly formulated method of ' whey-less ' manufacturing , the cream-and-milk mixture has the total solids composition of the cheese . The mixture is also pasteurized , homogenized , and incubated with a lactic bacterial culture at 30C . Then the solidified mixture is homogenized again and packed without cooling . Products which have not been made by the traditional procedure may not be called ' cream cheese ' and terms such as ' cream cheese food ' or ' cream cheese spread ' are used . <p> Microstructure of Cream cheese made from high-fat cream and acid-coagulated hot milk Fat globules ( brown ) and the curd ( which shows the core-and-shell ultrastructure of casein particles - dark blue ) are the major ingredients dispersed in the aqueous phase ( yellow ) . <p> Another new procedure has been suggested by H. W. Modler . Curd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citric acid acid solution until pH of 5.3-5.5 is reached . The whey is drained off . Whey proteins are retained in the curd depending on how high the milk was heated prior to coagulation . The curd is mixed with high-fat ( 58% ) cultured cream and the mixture is homogenized at 70C and the resulting cream cheese spread is hot-packed . <p> Structural differences between the cheeses are best observed using TEM of thin sections . This technique makes it possible to examine the interior of the cheese particles whereas SEM shows surfaces . This is useful , too , because surfaces may be formed by breaking ( fracturing ) cheese particles ; the structure of the protein matrix may thus also be observed . Preparation of the cheese specimens for electron microscopy may preserve the fat globules or remove them . <p> In the traditional Cream cheese , TEM reveals a very high fat content in the form of minute fat globules . Their surfaces are covered with protein particles . The protein frequently covers fat globule clusters rather than each individual fat globule . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is noticeable at the first glance : the fat is present in the form of relatively large fat particles which are not associated with protein . Protein is relatively evenly distributed through the body of the spread in the form of small clusters attached to the fat particles at random . <p> Cream cheese spread made by homogenizing high-fat cream with fresh curd differs from the products mentioned above and reflects the manufacturing procedure . Fat is mostly in the form of small globule clusters and the protein is in the form of relatively large particles . The structure of the curd also reveals its origin - acid-induced coagulation of hot milk to pH 5.5 . The ' core-and-shell ' ultrastructure of the casein particles is preserved ( figure above at right ) , although the curd undergoes homogenization during production . <p> Information on Cream cheese products presented in this section is based on earlier experimental work described in several papers co-authored by D. A. Froehlich , M. Kalb , H. W. Modler , and A. G. Sargant , in Food Structure and in Milchwissenschaft 40(4):193-196 ( 1985 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whey protein-based Cream cheese spread ) . <p> Electron microscopy has also been used in studies of low-fat or fat-free cheeses , where fat has been replaced with one of the so-called fat replacers . They may be based on proteins , polysaccharides , or even on indigestible fats and oils . Their action is based on the fact that our tongue receives stronger signals about the dimensions of the particles than about their chemical nature . Particles 1 to 3 m in diameter are perceived as fat . In the micrograph at left , a protein-based fat replacer has been incorporated in cheese . It affects , because of its protein nature , only sensory attributes and instrumental measurements of the cheese . Protein- and polysaccharide-based fat replacers do not melt and their use is limited to specific situations , for example frozen desserts , salad dressings , and some other applications . <p> In the low-fat cheese featured at left , a fat substitute based on protein ( light green-coloured globular aggregates of microparticulated protein ) was used to replace a small portion of milkfat . Fat globules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was prepared for scanning electron microscopy . Initially they occupied the spaces which now appear empty in the protein body of the cheese . <p> The low-fat cheese sample shown at left was freeze-fractured . This procedure makes it possible to fracture ( break ) even minute particles and study their internal structure by scanning electron microscopy . <p> Additional scientific papers are being processed for this page . Images of fat substitutes used in cheese , the structure of cheeses made without the aid of microorganisms , Cottage cheese and other cheeses such as Mozzarella will be gradually presented at this site . Processed cheese is another important dairy product in which interesting discoveries have been made using electron microscopy . <p> Differences between cheeses can not only be tasted but also seen , because manufacturing processes impart special features on the cheese microstructure . <p> To make cheese , curdled milk is cut using steel wire knives or the milk gel is broken into small particles using a propeller stirrer . Subsequent heating shrinks and compacts the particles , as whey is drained off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniform body of cheese . <p> The sites of contact , where adjoining curd particles meet , are called curd granule junctions . Their development is schematically shown in the diagram . The gelled ( nonhomogenized ) milk which contains fat globules ( yellow disks ) is cut ( red vertical line ) . The fat globules thus exposed are washed out from the curd ( arrows ) . The surface of the granules heals ( middle figure ) . Pressing of the 2 granules together ( last figure ) causes the superficial layers depleted of fat to fuse . The junction is shown as an area devoid of fat globules . <p> If homogenized milk is used where the fat globules are considerably smaller , the width of the junctions is markedly reduced . <p> The junctions can easily be seen by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) as compact zones . To obtain the micrograph shown , a small Brick cheese sample ( 1x1x10 mm ) was fixed in a glutaraldehyde solution , dehydrated in ethanol , defatted in n-hexane , returned into absolute ethanol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transferred into liquid nitrogen , where it was freeze-fractured , returned into absolute ethanol , where it thawed , and then it was critical-point dried from liquid carbon dioxide . Defatting and freeze-fracturing were the essential steps to show the junctions . Removal of fat makes the fracture plane of the sample ' rough ' - full of cavities ( initially occupied by fat ) - in the area showing the interior of the curd granules . The protein walls separating the cavities scatter light in all directions . Light scattering causes this area to appear lighter than the compact structure of the curd granule junctions , which is mostly free of fat globules . The contrast between both structures creates the curd granule junction patterns . <p> The junctions are visible even to a naked eye . Brick cheese ( left figure below ) made from curd obtained by knife cutting shows granules relatively similar in size . Such images may be obtained even at a high school chemical laboratory and instructions on how to proceed are given below . They are also characteristic of other ' stirred-curd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> Cheddar cheese manufacture involves considerably more work . The fused curd granules ( curd slabs ) are piled one over the other in the cheese vat in traditional Cheddar making . Heat and the presence of fat in the curd make it to slowly flow down . This cheddaring process elongates the granules . The slabs are gradually replaced so that all are exposed to maximum flow and then the slabs are milled into finger-like pieces . These are salted and pressed together . Milling produces new cuts and thus new junctions ( right figure ) . They are called milled curd junctions and are noticeably thicker than the curd granule junctions . <p> Also mechanized and automated cheddaring produces both kinds of junction . Different equipment leaves its marks in the junction patterns . <p> Do these findings have any practical importance ? Yes . For example , they show that any attempts to alter cheese processing would easily be detected . The findings ensure that the higher price which the consumers pay for Cheddar cheese compared to Farmer 's cheese is justified and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Readers who would like to see the junctions in their piece of cheese and who have access to a chemical laboratory , will find that the procedure is relatively simple . <p> Obtain thin ( 2 mm ) slices of the cheese under study , about 5x5 cm ( 2 " x2 " ) large , and immerse them in an aqueous 2 to 5% glutaraldehyde solution in separate petri dishes overnight . This treatment will fix the cheeses and make them easy to handle . It will also increase the contrast between the junctions and the curd interior . Next day , replace the glutaraldehyde solution with 96% denatured alcohol , about 3 times after 30 minute periods . Then replace ethanol with n-hexane or acetone ( twice ) to extract fat from the cheese . Using a pair of tweezers , place the cheese slices between two filter papers , place them , with the papers , between two glass or metal plates , place a weight on them , and let the cheese slices dry overnight . All this work must be done in a fume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are light and brittle . Sand them carefully with a fine sand paper and see the junctions emerge as sanding progresses . Why is it necessary to sand the slices ? Because cutting had smeared the cheese protein on the slices and it is necessary to remove it . <p> Processed cheese has a relatively short history . First experiments started at the end of the last century but success was achieved only in 1912 , when citric acid was introduced as a melting salt . This happened in Switzerland . A few years later , sodium phosphates were added to sodium citrate and have been used since that time . <p> The initial idea of processing cheese was to increase the shelf life of cheese and , more importantly , to utilize cheeses which may have had various defects . If it was possible with butter by rendering it , some people believed , it should also be possible with cheese . However , when cheese is melted without any additive , fat separates from protein and the result is terrible . The secret of ' processing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heating , however , decreases the ability of the cheese proteins to keep the fat globules in the dispersed state , which means that the emulsifying capability of the proteins has been reduced . Melting salts restore it by binding ( sequestering ) calcium which is present in the caseins . Melting salts with very strong calcium-binding ability ( affinity for calcium ) lead to the production of hard processed cheeses which contain fat in the form of very small globules . For those readers who like chemistry , the affinity increases in the following order : <p> It has to be emphasized that the melting salts are not emulsifiers but they restore the emulsifying ability of the milk proteins very efficiently . <p> The principles of cheese processing are simple : Various natural cheeses are shredded and then blended with the melting salts and other ingredients such as various kinds of milk solids such as milk powder , whey powder , coprecipitates , cream , butter or butter oil , and sometimes also previously processed cheese . Vegetables and spices may also be added and some processed cheeses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , salami , or fish . Other additives such as preservatives , colouring and flavouring agents , binders , and salt and water complete the list of the ingredients . <p> The blend is heated with constant stirring until a smooth mass is formed . In a continuous processed cheese production , the temperature is increased to 140C for a few seconds to destroy harmful bacteria ( such as clostridia ) if they happen to be present in some of the ingredients . <p> From the structural viewpoint , many features characteristic of natural cheeses are destroyed , for example , the curd granule junction patterns and the original fat globule membranes . On the other hand , new features are formed . In most processed cheeses , undissolved melting salt crystals may still be evident . Adding the salts in crystalline form rather than in the form of an aqueous solution to the cheese blend leaves some crystals undissolved . Interactions between the melting salts and calcium in the natural cheeses lead to the formation of insoluble calcium phosphates . Emulsification of fat - that means disintegration of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in processed cheese . <p> Processed cheese rework <p> Overheating affects the microstructure of processed cheese . <p> The amount of heat absorbed by processed cheese blends during processing may vary and may even be excessive at times . A blend may receive too much heat during continuous processing if , for example , packaging is delayed for some reason and the flow of the viscous processed cheese blend in the pipes is reduced . The blend eventually thickens and stops moving . Then it is called hot melt . It is removed from the pipes and is frozen for future use . Reworking or reprocessing consists of thawing and shredding the hot melt and adding a small quantity of it to a fresh blend . This is often done on purpose to modify the melting properties of processed cheese in a desired manner . Hot melt is thus a type of process cheese food that is not packaged for sale although it would meet product specifications . If it is re-used , it is called rework . <p> Electron microscopy revealed structural changes in the proteins in rework in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter ) dark areas in the micrographs of thin sections . Darkening may be the result of compaction of the cheese proteins or alterations in their chemical structure whereby the heat-modified proteins would react more intensively with heavy metals used during fixation and staining . Tests , in which heavy metals ( Os , Pb , U ) were omitted from the fixatives and stains during sample preparation for electron microscopy indicated that the proteins in the dark areas were rather compacted than chemically altered . The submicrostructure of the compacted areas was found to be related to the melting salt used to make the processed cheese . Hot melt contained considerably less undissolved melting salt crystals apparently because the crystals had time to dissolve during the entended exposure to heat . Rework dispersed rapidly in the freshly processed cheese blend . This visual observation was confirmed by optical microscopy . <p> The upper image at left shows compact electron-dense structures ( purple arrow ) which developed in processed cheese made with 2.7% trisodium phosphate , used as the melting salt , due to excessive heating ( 82C for 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of electron-dense structure developed in process cheese made with 20% rework consisting of hot melt . The hot melt was obtained by processing cheese with 2.7% sodium citrate and heating it at 82C for 5 hours ( green arrow ) . The shredded hot melt was added to a fresh cheese blend and the mixture was processed ( using 2.7% trisodium phosphate ) and excessively heated . Purple arrows point to structures developed in the fresh cheese blend . <p> What do these findings mean in processed cheese production ? They show that the loss of meltability is associated with structural changes in cheese proteins . They make it possible to detect if rework was used in cheese processing ; even at 10% rework , there was a high concentration of the dark areas in the micrographs . Finally , these findings point to interesting thermal effects on processed cheese , which may eventually be studied in greater detail and explained . <p> As with any sample to be examined by electron microscopy , the scientist/technician must have knowledge of the composition and structure of the material to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein matrix which is interspersed with fat globules and lactic acid bacteria from the starter culture . Other structures such as calcium phosphate crystals or ingredients used in the cheese production may also be present . As curd changes into cheese , the matrix become gradually more compact which means that whey and air pockets are reduced in size . It also means that fixation , dehydration , and defatting is decelerated as the diffusion of the respective agents is hampered . <p> At this stage the researcher needs to decide whether also the fat globules are of interest . They may either be removed to show void spaces in the protein matrix which had initially been occupied with fat ( example : Micrograph of processed cheese ) , or fat may be retained ( example : Coagulation of milk ) . Retention of fat may be achieved by postfixing the specimens with imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide . It is described in Fixation of fat for TEM . That procedure will be described later . <p> In the procedure described here , the fat will be removed . The prisms fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series ( 20% , 40% , 60% , 80% , 96% , and 100% ) . Depending on the compactness of the sample , the individual steps may take from 15 min ( coagulated milk , fresh curd ) to 30 min. with denser specimens . Fat in the prisms in absolute ( 100% ) ethanol may then be extracted using n-hexane ( initially , chloroform was used for this purpose ) . Three changes of n-hexane are advisable to prevent residual fat from contaminating the specimens ( M. Kalb : Artefacts in conventional scanning electron microscopy of some milk products . Food Microstruct. 3(2) , 95-112 , 1984 ) . Replacing n-hexane with 2 changes of absolute ethanol prepares the specimens for freeze-fracturing . The reason why freeze-fracturing is important for SEM of milk products and why dry-fracturing is not suitable for such work is explained a few paragraphs below the information about osmium tetroxide . <p> Freeze-fracturing starts by rapidly freezing the specimen in liquid nitrogen ( LN ) and breaking it there thus producing smooth fracture planes . LN , however , would not prevent ice crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute ethanol does not form crystals on freezing . It is used , therefore , to impregnate the minute prism specimens . <p> To freeze-fracture the specimens , the author uses a black cardboard box ( 110 mm x 90 mm x 50 mm ) well insulated with polystyrene . Inside is a low rectangular copper dish . The dark colours make it easy to see specimen fragments . The dish is half filled with LN and when vigorous boiling has ceased , two or three prisms are immersed using a pair of insulated tweezers ( made by glueing insulation to the tweezers - a scalpel is insulated in a similar way ) . While holding the prism with the tweezers , the scalpel tip is pressed a mm from the end of the prism . In this way , several fragments are obtained . They are then picked with the tweezers and dropped into 10-20 mL of absolute ethanol in a small beaker . The thawed fragments are then critical-point dried using liquid carbon dioxide as the transitional medium . <p> Suitable fragments of even thickness with well developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike the prism sides , the fracture plane is shiny when examined under a dissecting microscope . The fragment is mounted with the fracture plane facing up . The author uses a double-sided sticky tape attached to the SEM stub because it conveniently holds the fragment in place while a small volume of a cement is painted around the base using two needles to provide an unterrupted condutive path after the specimens are coated with gold . With highly porous coagulated milk specimens it is advisable to paint the cement up to the upper edge of the fragment . Care must be taken that the cement is neither too " thin " ( the solvent would soak into the porous fragment and ruin it ) or it is too " thick " and would not adhere to the surface of the fragment . <p> Coating with gold is the last preparatory step preceding SEM . <p> SEM of cheese with fat retained in the protein matrix <p> Fixation of cheese specimens with glutaraldehyde fixes only the proteins . Fat globules surrounded with protein may be preserved but dehydration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid carbon dioxide may result in partial extraction of the fat . Fixation of milkfat in cheese and other milk products is based on the fact that such fat contains unsaturated fatty acids which may react with osmium tetroxide . However , the reaction in a regular ( cacodylate , veronal-acetate etc. ) buffer ultimately leads to conversion of the unsaturated double bond to a diol while osmium is released in the form of osmium trioxide . Stable fixation may be achieved using imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide ( Allan-Wojtas , P. , Kalb , M. : Milk gel structure . XIV . Fixation of fat globules in whole milk yoghurt for electron microscopy . Milchwissenchaft 39 , 323-327 , 1984 ) . That procedure is based on a paper by S. Angermnller , H. D. Fahimi : Imidazole-buffered osmium tetroxide : an excellent stain for visualization of lipids in transmission electron microscopy . Histochem . J. 14 , 823-835 , 1982 <p> The original paper by Allan-Wojtas and Kalb on yogurt may be difficult to obtain . The procedure may be adapted for cheese . It is easy to check as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : when fractured , the sample should be dark throughout its entire diameter . However , it is not necessary to wash the samples for 48 h as mentioned in the text from the Electron Microscopy section reproduced below : <p> ( a ) Thin sectioning Samples ( &lt;1 mm3 ) were taken from approx. 0.5 cm below the surface of the yoghurt and were fixed for 24 h at 22C with a 1.4% glutaraldehyde solution in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) , containing 0.05% CaCl2 and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone ( w.w. 40,000 ) . The samples were then washed for 48 h in several changes of the buffer and postfixed for 24 h in an imidazole-buffered 0.5% OsO4 solution . This solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of crystalline OsO4 in 50 mL of a 0.05 M veronal-acetate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) , and mixing this stock solution with an equal volume of a 0.2 M imidazole solution adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 N HCl .

Micrographs were taken on 35 mm film . <p> ( a ) SEM Samples ( 3x3x0.5 mm ) were cut into pieces 3x1x0.5 mm ) after fixation in the buffered 1.4% glutaraldehyde solution as described above .

@@6829766 @29766/ <h> Forests build soil . Ours is losing it ! <h> What 's going on ? <p> In the early 1990s , members and leaders of the Macoun Field Club began picking individual trees for study in a 10-acre hardwood forest in our Nature Study Area . Leader Barbara Gaertner chose a mature Sugar Maple and had her photograph taken beside it in the summer of 1994 , at left in the pair of pictures immediately below . She visits often and makes notes . In August , 2008 , seeing how badly things are now going wrong , we took a repeat photograph ( at right ) . <p> The passage of time -- 14 years -- is evident from the way the leafy sprout that previously screened her from view has grown into a tall , dark sapling . <p> Same person . <p> Same tree . <p> Same view . <p> But ecologically , <p> what a difference ! <p> The two changes that dominate these images are first , the disappearance since 1994 of the green shrubbery , and second , the loss of leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , an overpopulation of White-Tailed Deer browsed away all the shrubby growth and wildflowers . Then , from 2006 onward , a population explosion among earthworms has eaten up every fallen , dead leaf off the ground . Both are ecological catastrophies , but of the two , we fear that the worms will turn out to be the more dreadful . <p> That is because the deer have only removed the youngest generation of trees -- about 25 years worth . If the deer go , the forest , whose large trees are still producing good seed crops , should be able to recover in another 25 years . The worms , however , have eaten not only the leaf litter , but the layer of decaying leaves and much of the black humus layer -- more than 100 years ' worth of soil building . The ground has been literally melting away . <p> The results are clear in the following pair of images from another mature hardwood forest ( at White Lake , Ontario ) , an hour 's drive west of the first . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rooted in soil still protected by a worm-free mat of dead leaves . At right , a somewhat smaller White Ash in the same woods , whose roots have become exposed following a localized invasion and proliferation of earthworms . <p> The picture at left shows the natural state of the forest floor under a canopy of deciduous trees . The leaves that fell last autumn were pressed flat by the winter snowpack , but can still be pulled up one by one . Beneath them is an inch-thick layer of leaf fragments that is bound together by fine rootlets and fungal threads . That is called leaf mould , or duff . Beneath it is an inch-thick layer of black organic soil the humus . You have to dig through all of that with your fingers before you hit mineral soil . This forest floor is soft and springy underfoot . <p> In the picture at right , the soil has retreated from the roots , and the remaining ground is solid and unyielding . <h> Why do we blame earthworms ? <p> At least three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leaf litter gets eaten up . The duff layer disappears . The humus disappears . And some organic matter is spread downward into the mineral soil . Different species seem to be responsible for these several components . <p> To begin with , we can be sure that the species known as the Dew Worm ( Lumbricus terrestris ) , is what is stripping away the leaf litter because we have watched them in action and therefore know the distinctive evidence they produce . These large worms , typically eight inches ( 20 cm ) long , reach almost full length out of their burrows , grab a dead leaf , and drag it back to the burrow opening . There they can eat it in safety , leaving only the leaf-stem , or petiole . They do this over and over , until there are no leaves left within reach . <p> The discarded petioles accumulate in a tuft or pile over each burrow , often stuck together with dirt . ( If you grab the clump and pull it away , you will usually see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead leaves at night . When Dew Worms are abundant , they produce a creepy rustling sound all around you , with nothing in sight . ( If you want to see them , first clear away almost all the dead leaves from a convenient patch of ground and come back later , walking softly . ) <p> But Dew Worms are only one of the half-dozen species we 've identified in our Study Area , and their role in the destruction of the forest floor takes place entirely out of sight . To figure out what they do , we 've placed several individuals of each species in its own jar filled with samples of the different soil layers from a healthy ( worm-free ) forest . In these experiments , the Red Marsh Worm , Lumbricus rubellus , ate holes through both the layer of mouldering dead leaves under the leaf litter , which is known as duff , and the black organic soil called humus . The Pasture Worm , Aporrectodea turgida , consumed only the humus . It is able to do this even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study Area , we have observed the action of earthworms on the forest floor over a 20-year period , gradually learning to see what they are doing and the signs indicating that they are responsible for the changes that have occurred . As we have seen it , the progression runs from : <p> a worm-free , well functioning forest <p> worms invade but seem innocuous <p> duff layer destroyed below the leaf litter <p> disruption of leaf litter ( bare ground starts to show ) <p> complete loss of leaf litter <p> exposure , death , and disappearance of fine rootlets <p> exposure of bare soil to rainfall with consquent erosion <p> continued lowering of the ground surface , exposing roots and rocks <p> the future -- yet to be seen <p> We speak of worms invading because all earthworms in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States are alien , mainly European species . We do n't know when they arrived in our Study Area -- it could have been in the 1800s . By 1989 they were numerous among our study trees , but for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely intact . <p> In their natural state , northeastern forests slowly build soil in a process that is illustrated by the profile at left . Each autumn , leaves fall and become matted into a moist mass . In a process that takes years , a succession of small insects and other invertebrates , together with fungi , slowly eat their way through this mass , successively breaking down the leaves ' tougher components to the point where they can be used by other detritivores . The duff layer is rich in mites , springtails , nematodes and millipedes , as well as their predators , such as salamanders , spiders , and parasitic fungi . Eventually , black organic soil humus is produced at the bottom . <p> Earthworms , in contrast , chew their way through the litter and duff in a single pass . Gardeners and composters prize this speedy decomposition . But in the forest , the worms leave nothing for other forms of life , except bacteria . <p> As earthworms invade a forest , they eat and they multiply . Judging by results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich , black organic soil and the duff above it . As their numbers increase , they exhaust these ready-to-eat resources , and shift to eating the most recently fallen dead leaves -- the leaf litter that is the visible surface of the forest floor . <p> At first the matted surface of the litter is only tousled here and there by the rising piles of castings and petioles . At this stage , you can look underneath and see whether the duff still exists . As the worms become more numerous ( with burrows about a foot apart ) , the leaf litter begins to open up , exposing bare soil . This is when we first notice them . In our Study Tree Woods small patches bare of leaf litter opened up every summer for about 10 years . <p> Then , in 2006 , when the burrows were only six inches apart ( signaling a four-fold increase in population ) the worms stripped away every dead leaf across five acres of forest floor . The mulch of half-rotted leaves was already gone.The complete loss of cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . They were supple and still living at first , but by the season 's end had dried out and died . Brittle now , eighth-inch-thick sheets of intertwined rootlets could be lifted up like ragged tatters of fabric . <p> In 2007 and 2008 , stripped of leaf litter , duff , and the meshwork of fine rootlets , the mineral soil of forest floor has lain exposed to the summer rains . The ground looks rain-spattered , and appears to have shrunk away from the bases of trees and embedded boulders . In places , living tree roots that must have grown within the soil now stretch through empty air . Sometimes pebbles sit perched on protected pedestals of sand , almost an inch of ground having washed away on every side . <h> What can be done ? <p> Earthworms have had good press as soil builders ever since Darwin wrote about them , and people are reluctant to believe anything bad about them . The first thing we must do is learn to see for ourselves what is going on . Where worms have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the signs : the petiole piles , the absence of important layers from the forest floor , the shrinkage of soil away from fixed objects . <p> By way of example , in this photo , the Sugar Maple roots running over the small boulder show that the whole boulder was once covered by soil . The whiteness of the exposed rock shows how recently it was buried , and the moss that caps it shows that a few years have passed since its top , at least , was exposed . The mass of fine rootlets under the sapling show that the process is on-going .

@@6829773 @29773/ <p> This page explains in moderate detail how a particular artifact-bearing deposit -- the most controversial one -- at the Sheguiandah Site in Ontario , Canada , was originally identified as glacial till . Forty years later it was re-interpreted as a beach deposit . It is important to see this issue in its broader context , so for a historical overview , click here . <h> Why they said it was glacial till <p> The short answer , for those familiar with tills , is that the controversial deposits were unsorted and contained a majority of rock types foreign to the site . Clasts were often faceted , and the softer types bore glacial striae . The diamictons also contained rounded sandy inclusions . Fabric studies revealed orientations consistent with regional ice flow . Alternatives , such as mudflow and beaches , were explicitly ruled out . <p> This short answer , however , was long in coming . Geologists visiting Lee 's excavations often gave their opinions on sight , but hastily retracted them on learning that artifacts were being found , because the prevailing view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . Some came back again and again over the four years Lee was excavating , arguing back and forth , raising objections and seeking additional evidence to move forward . <h> Till is an unsorted sediment , with every size of particle from clay to boulders <p> We all learn about glacial features in school , such as moraines and drumlins . The material they are made of is called " till " . If , as at Sheguiandah , you do n't have the landscape features to identify them , you have to dig inside and look for the characteristics of till . At left , a vertical profile of the controversial deposits , overlying another deposit ( also identified as till -- see below ) . Rocks that had been dug up were piled beside the trench . <p> As glaciers move across a landscape , they pick up material from underneath and carry it along , slowly grinding it ever finer . Enormous boulders are broken down into smaller boulders , cobbles and pebbles . Pebbles are ground into sand grains , and even sand grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as there is a continuous supply of rock underneath , then all stages in the breakdown process , from big to small , will be present in deposits left behind by a melting glacier . Because no particular size class predominates , glacial till is typically referred to as being " unsorted " . <p> Normally , people live in safe and stable places . This seemed to be true at Sheguiandah as far back as the 10,000-year Paleo-Indian level . But as his crews dug below that in what he named the " Habitation Area " ( left ) , Thomas Lee was stumped to see that there were stone tools buried among , and even under , rocks of all sizes ( right ) . He could not believe that people had lived on the spot while these boulders were being dropped all around them . At the end of the first field season , in 1952 , visiting geologist John Sanford offered a solution to the puzzle . He suggested that Ice Age glaciers had created the whole deposit , having incidentally picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till . <p> From a geological standpoint , this seemed chronologically possible , because the deposits in question lay below the level at which Paleo-Indian spearpoints had been found . The Paleo-Indians had been the first humans to reach the site after the Ice Age , and they would have been walking on top of fairly fresh glacial till . But it was a problem archaeologically . If the artifacts were already in the ground when the Paleo-Indians arrived , then this was something new and exciting . Could they instead have been made after the Ice Age and then become mixed into the glacial till ? <h> Artifacts --part of the till , or only mixed into it ? <p> Mixing might have happened even while the first Paleo-Indians were still living there . Suppose they had made their first tools on another , higher part of the hill , and left them there . If that piece of ground had then slid or tumbled downhill and come to rest in the Habitation Area , then the situation might appear as it does . The first artifacts , originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mixed into the underlying deposit as it moved to its final resting place . Then the Paleo-Indians could have resumed work on the new surface , this time leaving behind some of their distinctive spearpoints . <p> There were several kinds of downhill movement Lee had to consider . Rainwash was ruled out , because it would have left the rocks behind . The deposits were not colluvium , because the nearest slopes were either too distant or too shallow for rocks and soil to have tumbled down by force of gravity . Mud , of course , can flow down lesser slopes and carry even large boulders along , but Lee observed that the sediments he was dealing with would n't hold water . As geologist Ernst Antevs summarized the situation , " You ca n't have mudflow where you ca n't make mud . " In any case , the deposits were were in the middle of a wide , flat area , cut off from higher ground by transverse ridges of bedrock . <p> Could the artifacts perhaps have been mixed into the glacial till at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , trees do get uprooted , animals burrow , and the expansion of frost heaves the ground . <p> In one approach to this question , Lee reconsidered the spearpoints , which represent a narrow period of time in archaeological chronology . They were essentially confined to a thin layer about five or six inches down in the soil . The broken halves of some specimens were found at roughly the same depth and in the same stratigraphic level , even when separated by as much as 15 feet ( 4.5 m ) . If there had been any substantial mixing , one would expect these artifacts to have become scattered through the soil . It is difficult to argue that non-projectile-points had been mixed downward , while leaving the spearpoints behind . Furthermore , at least two culturally different levels were distinguished below the Paleo-Indian level , and one above it -- a stratigraphic sequence . <h> The more specific features of till -- rock origins , shapes , and markings -- and lumps of sand <p> If , then , the artifacts really belong where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsorted sediments are truly glacial till ? And how can we be quite sure that the sediments are still where the glacier left them , undisturbed ? Specific evidence was sought to answer these questions . <p> Glaciers , as we have noted , pick up large rocks as they move along . It will often happen that these are carried beyond their native region , and when the glacier drops them , they will be different from the local bedrock in their new location . <p> The Sheguiandah Site hill is predominately white quartzite , sticking up out of Manitoulin Island 's limestone . About half of the stones in the controversial deposits are instead granite and greenstone from more than 20 miles away , across the North Channel -- completely foreign to the site . An additional 22% were shale , which crops out close by , but downhill from the Habitation Area . A continental glacier , irresistibly moving over and around obstacles , was the one force able to move boulders of shale uphill . In that sense , these , too , are foreign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% , were quartzite and probably local . <p> In the course of being ground up , several things happen to stones in a glacier . Periodic breakage produces angular fragments , but then continued abrasion rounds off the corners . And within the ice , stones are carried along in first one position , and then flip to another . Abrasion by gritty particles held in the moving ice therefore tends to produce a set of flat , smooth sides -- facets -- with rounded edges . This is evident in the large granite cobbles at right ( in a blow-up from the image at the top of this page ) . <p> Also , when two rocks held within the ice are ground against each another , the softer one may be scratched . As the stone changes position in the ice , it gets scored in different directions . In Sheguiandah 's controversial deposits , both facets and scratches ( glacial straie ) were specifically noted on the softer shales and greenstones as they came out of the controversial deposits . <p> In the course of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their trowels slicing easily through what they supposed were chunks of disintegrated sandstone . The patch of clean yellow sand at left , beside a small boulder of white quartzite , is one of them ( also visible in this page 's first picture , right in the center ) . Another visiting geologist put these finds in a different light . ' What you have there , ' he explained , ' are formerly-frozen lumps of sand that a moving glacier ripped out of iron-hard , icy ground and carried along for a time like any other rock . ' <p> Similar lumps of sand occur in a now-petrified till ( tillite ) in Kluane National Park , Yukon Territory . The one shown at right was evidently melting , with other till materials being forced into it , when its glacier stopped and allowed it to be preserved . Melting can also allow a lump of sand to be smeared out flat before being obliterated . Not only had Lee found ball-like lumps of clean sand in the rather stony till at Sheguiandah , but also sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2.5 x 45 cm ) . " This , " Ernst Antevs advised him , " is your strongest evidence . " <p> But Antevs was by then an old man , and something new and important was coming into the field he had contributed to all his life -- fabrics . No matter how slowly it grinds along , a flowing glacier streams faster in the middle that at the sides , and the lower levels also gradually slide up over those in front . These and other stresses induce an alignment of the stones inside the ice . When the glacier stops and melts away , these patterns of stones may be preserved in the till , rather like the lines of iron filings that remain on a piece of paper after the magnet has been removed . If the deposit is not disturbed , the orientation and strength of the fabric can be measured , even many thousands of years later . A very strong fabric , shown above left , is evident in the same Kluane tillite . <p> The stresses in a glacier are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places , lengthwise stresses predominate , as in the lines of flow in this Kluane glacier ( left ) . In other places on the same glacier , crosswise cracks are more pronounced ( right ) . Within the ice , and in compressed , plastic sediments underneath it , elongated stones tend to line up either with the flow ( the more usual case ) , or transversely , across it . <p> Both types of alignment were detected in the controversial deposits at Sheguiandah , in different levels . Today , as in the 1950s , the data for a fabric is collected one stone at a time , with a ruler ( to determine the length-to-width ratios of the stone ) , a compass ( for bearing in relation to north ) , and a clinometer ( to measure the dip of the longest axis ) . Computer programs assess the distribution of oriented stones and generate fabric diagrams . At Sheguiandah , Thomas Lee measured nearly 600 stones and plotted the results . He showed that the stones still lay in alignments consistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast , toward the southwest ( leftmost diagram ) . Even the transverse orientation , at right , shows an up-ice ( northeastward ) dip . <h> Problems with the glacial-till hypothesis <p> How could tools made by man possibly survive being caught up in a continental glacier ? This was the first problem Thomas Lee faced . He eventually came to realize that a hill can protect what lies on the lee , or down-ice side , and keep it from being carried away . It has since been discovered that while glacial ice does flow , it can not wrap tightly around an obstacle , and leaves an ice-roofed space underneath . At right , Kluane 's Kaskawulsh Glacier , flowing around a hill and not quite meeting below it . A lake , dotted with icebergs , fills the gap . <p> The second problem is that the re-investigation team says there can be only one till and that they have identified it underneath the controversial deposits . Lee 's own fabric diagram for this deposit ( left ) confirms their identification . <p> The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The controversial deposits are looser , sandier , and quite reddish , while the underlying sediment is indurated , looks like clay , and is yellowish-grey . But there are also similarities . <p> Lithologically , the stones in the two deposits are comparable ( 47% foreign , 30% shale , and 23% local quartzite in the deeper till , versus 52% foreign , 22% shale , and 20% local quartzite in the controversial tills ) . Both deposits contain the same kind of microfossils from an adjacent deposit ( the Mystic Ridge ) . And the fabrics for both are similar in strength and direction . <p> An irregularity in the grain-size curve for the subglacial till led the geologist with the re-investigation to propose that it was " immature , " meaning that it was closely related to local material the glacier had just picked up . This argument can be even better made for the controversial deposits , which contain lumps of sand apparently ripped out of a frozen sandy sediment by glacial ice . There need not be two tills , representing two glacial episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on different sediments the ice was overriding at different times .. <p> After the Ice Age , Lake Algonquin 's declining shoreline must inevitably have fallen across the entire Sheguiandah Site . Every point on the hill must have been touched by waves at some time . The question is , did the lake make any impression here ? Did an ancient beach develop out of glacial till ? This is the interpretation of the re-investigation team .

@@6829775 @29775/ <h> Deep River Astronomy Club <h> The Origin of Julian Days <p> Astronomers , especially variable star observers , commonly use the chronological system of Julian Days to record their observations . Most astronomy texts explain that it is based on the number of days that have elapsed since noon universal time ( UT ) , 1 January 4713 BCE ( before current era , or B.C. ) ; for example , 1 January 1996 CE ( current era , or A.D. ) is equivalent to Julian day 2,450,084 . <p> But why and how did this dating system get started ? Who was Julian , anyway ? And why was 4713 BCE chosen as the starting date ? If you think that " Julian " refers to the Julian calendar , named after the Roman emperor Julius Caesar , you are both right and wrong . The Julian calendar is involved , but only partly . This system was named after Julius Caesar , but not the one who ruled Rome and was assassinated by Brutus and others . <p> We tend to take our present Gregorian calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years to the usual 365 , to account for the approximate 365.25 days it takes for Earth to orbit the sun . We divide the year into 12 months , based on the approximate 29.5 days of each lunar cycle . Although the number of days in each month varies from 31 to 30 , or even 28 , and we sometimes have to resort to the " Thirty days hath September ... " rhyme to remember the days in a particular month , it 's a fairly regular system , once you get used to it . <p> The ancients knew the length of the year fairly accurately , as well as the length of the lunar cycle . Some societies set up calendars based on the moon , or lunar cycle , and some on the sun , or solar cycle . Many combined the two , inserting extra months when needed , to prevent the two cycles from getting out of phase , and to ensure seasons would begin the same time each year . Sometimes this led to confusion , since it was up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice given by ancient astronomers . When rulers changed , sometimes the calendar did , too . <p> In ancient Rome before 45 BCE , for example , the civil year was 355 days , with an extra or intercalary month ( Intercalaris ) , inserted after Februarius every two years , but there was no rule to determine the length of this month . Officials before Julius Caesar varied the number of days in it , either for prolonging office terms , speeding up election dates , or through sheer incompetence . By Caesar 's time spring equinox was falling in winter . <p> Sosigenes , the Greek astronomer , advised Julius Caesar on how to correct this problem . So , on 1 January 45 BCE Caesar decreed that the next year would be 445 days long . Contemporaries dubbed it the " year of confusion " , although its purpose was to end confusion . The new Julian calendar was based on the solar year of 365 days , with an extra day every fourth year . The intercalary month was eliminated , and every other month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other months , except February , would have 30 days . February would have 29 , and 30 in leap years . <p> Two years later Julius got knifed , but his calendar ticked along until 7 BCE , when it was interfered with during the reign of Augustus . The fifth month , Quintilis ( the year started with the spring equinox , in Martius , or March ) , which had been renamed Julius ( our July ) after the deceased Caesar , had 31 days . Augustus , or the Roman Senate , wanted a month named after the emperor , so the next month , Sextilis , with 30 days , was changed to Augustus , and given the same number of days as Julius . The extra day was taken from the final month , Februarius . This alteration left three months together , July , August , and September each with 31 days , contrary to logical alternating 31/30-day months of Sosigenes . To remedy this , September and November lost their 31st days to October and December . That 's why we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make matters worse , after Julius died , the leap year was being added every third , instead of every fourth , year . Augustus put a stop to this by eliminating leap years from about 5 BCE to 8 CE ( A.D. ) . <p> However , the Julian calendar year was 11 minutes , 4 seconds longer than the solar year . By 1582 , this error has accumulated to 10 days , so the spring equinox ( and consequently the Christian celebration of Easter ) , was falling about 11 March . To correct this anomaly Pope Gregory XIII , on the advice of his astronomers , took drastic action and decreed that 15 October 1582 would immediately follow 4 October , thus eliminating 10 days forever . To prevent the calendar from getting out of phase with the seasons again , he decreed that years ending in 00 would be 365 days long unless evenly divisible by 400 . <p> At first , only Catholic countries adopted this Gregorian calendar . Due to anti-Catholic political sentiments , Protestant countries did n't make the change until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tycho Brahe and Kepler , had earlier approved of the reform . The British Empire held out until 1752 ; China with its revolution changed in 1912 , and Russia with its in 1917 . There are institutions that still adhere to the Julian calendar ( now 13 days behind the Gregorian ) , such as in the Orthodox Christian Church . <p> The years between 1582 and 1752 are still subject to confusion when comparing dates between England and the European continent . For example , the deaths of Shakespeare and Cervantes on the same day , 23 April 1616 , did not really happen , for England was still using the Julian calendar . Shakespeare actually outlived the Spanish author by 10 days , dying on 3 May , according to the Gregorian calendar ! <p> All these manipulations of the calendar create complex problems for historians . It might be enough to make them throw up their hands and say " Forget months and years , the only certainty is days ! " Joseph Justus Scaliger ( 1540-1609 ) , a French classical scholar , did just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , named after his father , Julius Caesar Scaliger . This was a period of 7,980 years , derived from the product of 28 times 19 times 15 . <p> Why these numbers ? Well , 28 refers to the number of years in the Julian calendar it takes for dates to fall again on the same days of the week , the so-called solar cycle . The figure 19 comes from the Metonic cycle of 19 years , devised by Meton of Athens in 432 BCE , although known in China as early as 2260 BCE . The basis of ancient Greek , Jewish , and other calendars , it shows the relationship between the lunar and solar year . In 19 years of exactly 365.25 days each ( the Julian , or solar year ) , there are 235 lunar cycles , with seven of these years having a 13th , or embolistic , month . At the end of the cycle , the phases of the moon recur on a particular day in the solar year . The Metonic cycle was important because it established a lunar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get out of phase with the cycle of tropical ( seasonal ) years . <p> The figure of 15 refers to the ancient Roman cycle of indiction , a 15-year period used for taxation .

Now all in the space of about one or two heartbeats -- virtually simultaneously when possible -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , curtsey ( you never bow ; you CURTSEY , dropping your butt towards your toes until your knees are bent 90 degrees and you 're looking forward from BELOW the booms ) , aggressively move ( or let the sail pull ) your weight forward towards your toes , thrust and lock your front elbow out straight as though you were stiff-arming a tackler , tip that front hand ( and the mast ) downwind as you bend your back elbow hard to sheet in until your sail foot hits your back leg ( this is oversheeting , to switch the power off ) , look at the water maybe 50-100 feet out in front of you where you will exit your jibe ( I look at some distant landmark downwind to gauge my progress in my turn and time my sail jibe ) , and lift your front heel to force its arch into its strap . Your weight is riding evenly on the ball of your front foot and your flat back foot , so you 're not carving the turn yet . You 're still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail , and feet to the new tack ) . <p> If you were unable to oversheet because of too much backhand sail pressure , you ( a ) waited too late to oversheet and/or ( b ) did not thrust the front hand forward and into the turn . To correct this error , straighten that front elbow and tip the mast into the turn dramatically at the same time you oversheet . This shuts off the power in the sail like a kill switch and puts you back in control . The only time you do n't want to oversheet is when you 're not planing and need to use the sail to push your board through the turn . <p> So far this is all just normal , textbook , powered-up carved jibing . But here is where my friend 's tip and my own addition helped my jibing in several ways . <p> FREEZE FRAME : Notice your arm'n'hand position ; they 're cocked as though to fire a bow and arrow at a target downwind of your present path ( inside your turn ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it were holding the bowstring and arrow feathers , your front hand is way out there holding your bow and supporting the arrow . Both arms are cocked to fire the arrow ( spin the sail ) , but WHEN should we jibe the sail ? <p> My own modification helped me time the sail jibe . I began shoving my hips sideways into the turn HARD -- as though trying to bump the car door closed while standing beside it with my arms full . This carves a very tight , smooth turn and puts my body into an excellent position to exit the turn with full power on the new broad reach , maybe even automatically hooked and sheeted in if everything falls into place well . This hip swing weights the leeward rail to initiate and maintain the carve , and times the sail jibe ( flip ) . Your body should be arced into a pronounced C , with your hips leading the convex side of the C into the turn . <p> Because your front hand is as far in front of you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the new direction , you will feel like you 're trying to surf your board in the opposite direction from where the sail is going . The sails still heading west but your board is starting to head east , so to speak . The cure , of course , is to jibe the sail and take it along with you . <p> Try it , but be forewarned ; before you even have time to THINK about jibing the sail , you will whip through the full 180 degrees in two heartbeats , get backwinded , and crash . That 's a big improvement , because at least now you carved ( jibed ) the board all the way through the turn . Now all you have to do is jibe ( flip ) your sail and jibe ( switch ) your feet within that same couple of heartbeats , and you 're jibin ' ! This is partly an issue of timing the sail jibe somewhere within the board jibe . <p> Piece ' o cake : <p> 5 . Back to our sequence : at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're pointing downwind , the pressure will leave your sail . NOW fire the arrow i.e. , jibe ( flip ) the sail . Just as the step jibe technique calls for us to step forward at the same time we release the back hand , this technique works best if we jibe the sail as we thrust the hip . <p> Right here is where millions of carved jibe attempts fail . The magazines once told us to release the back hand , grasp the mast , let the wind blow the sail around the mast like a barn door blowing around its hinges as you coast to a slog , and when the sail wanders around far enough you take the new side of the boom and sail away . <p> BS ! <p> That has a MAJOR , fatal , flaw : If you outrun the true wind throughout your jibe , as you should , there wo n't BE any tailwind to push the sail around . You feel tailwind only after you drop below the true wind speed , well on your way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there at zero speed holding a fully powered-up sail . In the 15th century this position was known as a loaded catapult . <p> The sailor , not the wind , should jibe the sail . We should SPIN that sucker around its center of gravity like a top , not wait until we slow down so much the tailwind pushes the sail around the mast like a $1,500 barn door . A jibe is a very aggressive mindset and process which WE , not the wind , should control . <p> This is where Monte changed my life , when he said , " THROW , THROW , GRAB , and GO ! " <p> Only the sailor can spin the sail inside its boom length ; the winds surely not going to do it . At the hip thrust , just as you feel you and the sail are heading in opposite directions , you THROW the back of the boom away like a hot shot-putt . A millisecond later -- way before you complete that first THROW -- you THROW the front of the boom way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the new broad reach . Your mast hand motion is much like throwing a pass to a receiver running right along your new broad reach ( your jibe exit path ) . ( This is why you inverted the front-hand grip ; this second throw is much easier with your palm up . ) The sail spins untouched before your heart beats again , leaving the new side of the boom floating in the air in front of you . GRAB it with both hands and GO ( i.e. , sheet in and sail away on a screaming broad reach , often sailing faster that you were going before you jibed ) . With luck and practice , you will switch your feet simultaneously within or immediately after the second in which the sail rotates , and will exit accelerating hard in the new broad reach . You should lose no perceptible speed in the whole process because a ) its all off the wind and b ) you 're coasting unpowered for only a second or two . <p> As soon as or before I shove my hip into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon just past downwind . If I have n't spun the sail by then , I 'm late and must stop the carve and spin the sail NOW , or I 'm going to be on the new beam reach before I 've jibed the sail , and grabbing a sail at full power on a beam reach before getting that back foot strapped in is asking for a catapult . <p> Jibing quickly like this does n't  give you TIME to lose speed , hit three rows of swell , and lose your balance or crash . I do n't think my sail flip , from throwing the back hand away to sheeting in on the new tack , takes a full second when I do it right . The whole Throw/Throw/Grab/Go business is just one continuous , fluid two-handed sweep of my hands and forearms , as much like a Kung Fu move as I can make it . The same process works for 3.0s and for 6.8s ; the 6.8 just takes harder THROWS and takes two heartbeats rather than one . <p> The first one of those I tried was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more barn doors eating up precious seconds , mph , and two boom-lengths of space while I fight for balance over three row of chop ! This is partly why leading ABK instructors have begun teaching this boom-to-boom approach to jibing . <p> Oh , yeah -- the feet . My feet are too far from my brain to access all them complicated textbook footwork options , let alone select a method in mid-jibe . The step jibe , for example , requires we pull the front foot out of its strap until its heel crosses the board centerline , maintain inside rail pressure with that front heel , and step forward with the back foot while we do several OTHER things with our hands . That footwork was too demanding for me . Besides , the step jibe 's purpose is to get our weight forward to avoid sinking the tail after we slow down , and we want to accelerate , not slow down , in our jibes <p> 6 . I find it simpler to just take my weight off both feet and switch ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That works at any speed , in any chop or swell , overpowered or underpowered , planing or slogging , Sunday or Wednesday , before or after the sail jibe , in any instant I 'm not footsteering . If I 'm barely planing , I slip my new front foot further forward into the step jibe position before reapplying weight to it . Unweighing my feet and jibing them simultaneously sent my jibe success rate way up . It ranges from merely sliding both feet across the deck on smoother water to hopping a foot off the deck in huge chop . I 'll jibe my feet before , during or ( usually ) immediately after jibing the sail -- whenever it seems natural ; no thinking required . <p> On my bad days I might still miss half my jibes . Here are my more common errors : <p> A face-plant inside the turn because I bent at the waist bowing rather than curtseying into my turn . ( I ca n't perceive that error until too late since losing an inner ear to surgery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched , when coming out of my jibe if I jibe the sail too late and/or carved back up to the new beam reach before sheeting in . Fixing my eyes on that landmark just past downwind and spinning the sail simultaneously with the hip thrust stops that . <p> Getting bounced around and unbalanced and losing my carve in very rough water because I failed to get that front hand WAY out in front of me and tipped into the turn . Now that we have the front hand palm-up , straight-arming the rig like this is how we get our weight forward onto the front of the board to stop bouncing . <p> Being unable to oversheet because I bore off the wind too far before trying to oversheet . The save ? Shove the mast WAY forward and inward as I oversheet ( this shuts off the power instantly ) , or foot-swerve back to a beam reach , oversheet , then resume the jibe all in one quick slash . <p> Losing track of where I was in the turn because I watched my gear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking where I was going . <p> You must look where you intend to go , rather than where you are , because our boards ( and cars and mountain bikes ) follow our gaze . Do you look at your dashboard or far ahead into the turn to steer your car ? I get my best results looking at that spot on the horizon just past downwind . <p> Sinking the downwind rail with too much rail pressure for inadequate board speed . <p> Thinking too much . I have my best successes when I get PISTOFF and JUSTDOIT rather than engaging my brain . My brain apparently has n't  the capacity to think real time about the dozen or so steps required in a tight carved jibe on a small board . A bigger board and sail slow the process sufficiently that I can think it through . <p> Textbook footwork and all that boom-to-mast-to-boom handwork works for millions of people . But 1 ) I could n't make them work ; 2 ) they leave other millions losing their plane before completing their jibe ; and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they involve more steps , they swing the sail through twice the space , and they require greater coasting ( unpowered ) time and space . Sarah James , a leading ABK instructor , now teaches boom-to-boom jibing instead of the old , more complicated , cumbersome , slower boom-mast-boom method . <p> The boom-to-boom sail jibe helps cure the following aborted carved jibe that I see every five seconds at the amateur end of the Gorges Hatchery : They enter the jibe fast , DELIBERATELY sail off the wind until the board stops planing and the sail yanks their back hand , release the back hand , let the sail take its own sweet time blowing around the mast as the board coasts to a standstill , then grab the new side of the boom and try to get planing again . While that is a jibe , it is NOT a carved , or planing , jibe , by definition . And its tough to do in big chop . <p> Aggression and commitment are virtually required to carve planing jibes . The wind has already done its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jibe is OUR responsibility , AFTER which the wind comes back into play . <p> Try this . It sure made my decade . <p> Positioning a sail for waterstarting by Mike Fick <p> People keep writing about " swimming " one 's gear into position for a waterstart . I swim for only three reasons : 1 ) my gear is out of reach , 2 ) there 's NO wind , not even a breeze , between neck-deep water and the windline ( if there 's a breeze , I butt-sail to the windline .... none of that schlogging crap , y'know ) , or 3 ) the wind dropped below the planing threshold and caught me on a sinker abeam or downwind of my dawg . I usually sail upwind of my launch if I do n't trust the wind , just so I can also butt-sail back to my dawg . You can butt-sail for miles , effortlessly , if need be . Saves lots of calories for the next session after you rig up , or if the wind resumes . <p> Speaking of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stuff ? Now there 's a waste of perfectly good calories if I ever saw one ... important if most people are n't even out of bed yet and there 's still 360 miles of wind coming today ( 30 mph times 12hours ) . <p> So turn your gear around the same way you puked into your inner tube as a kid . Remember ? You jumped in the tube , lay your arms and chin on it , and swept your entire torso and legs in a four-foot-radius circle just below the water 's surface around the tube as fast as you could , with only your shoulders stationary . You could pull probably 60-70 RPM doing this , guaranteed to make any non-ice-skater lose his cookies . At 60-70 RPM , your barf radius was pretty astounding ... and disgusting . And is n't being disgusting a big part of being a prepubescent boy ? <p> OK , we smarter bears stopped short of upchucking , but it was CLOSE way too often , and you get the idea . The world spun for a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to turning your sailing gear around . When it 's not lined up right , rather than swimming it around using the same tired small arm and leg muscles you use all day to sail , use your rested and larger torso muscles to turn that stuff around . Just grab yer kit and start rotating your legs and torso in as big an arc as you can reach with your extended legs . Three things : you ai n't gon na hit 70 RPM , you better watch that fin , and you 're gon na use some much bigger , fresher muscles to turn it all around relatively effortlessly . In two or three turns of your torso and legs your gear should turn 180 degrees .... maybe 4-5-6 turns if on giant sails but still much less effort than swimming . It also defeats opposing winds very effectively if on your 3.0 . <p> WATCH OUT FOR THE FIN ! <p> Carve Gybing a longboard <p> centreboard up , track back , planing : Use an exaggerated sail movement . Keep power in the sail until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then flip . The foot movement is very slow , smooth , and deliberate . If you stomp on the rail , the board will tilt and go straight . The key is to keep speed through power . This allows you to weight the inside rail to carve . It takes a lot of entry speed and fairly flat water to make a full planing carve without dropping to displacement at any point . <h> Cold Weather Windsurfing <p> When I think about Cold weather windsurfing , I am referring to water temperatures less than 8 degrees celcius ( 48F ) , and/or air temperatures less than 8 degrees celcius ( 48F ) . I do n't know about the rest of you , but I am not too thrilled sailing by myself when the air/water is very cold . I thought about creating a list of people who ( sadistically ) enjoy sailing in 2 degree air/water so that if you feel the urge you can call someone on the list and find someone to go windsurfing with . Email me at slaby@magma.ca to add your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The biggest problem people face is having their extremities get very cold . The best approach to avoid this problem is to look after your core body temperature . <p> I have used two different setups ; a steamer as well as a dry suit . Of course the dry suit is much better , but you can get away with the steamer with the appropriate accessories . <h> Dry Suit <p> I currently use a Kokatat Goretex Drysuit , which I find is better over the traditional neoprene drysuit . I have used this suit in the following conditions for an hour without getting cold ( ice formation on the equipment terminated the session ) : Air temp : -3 celcius ; water temp -1 celcius , windchill -12 celcius . <p> In the past I have used a Bare Polar which is a hybrid ; like a standard thick drysuit on the bottom half , and a baggy material on the top . Others use traditional drysuits , which I feel put undue strain on your arms due to their thickness and tight fit , while others use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have concerns about the suit breaking and filling with water , but I feel this a small risk , and can be avoided by wearing a snug lifejacket ; if the suit ruptures you can always rip out the seals to let the water out ) . <p> Depending on how cold it is , I add various layers underneath ; polypropolene underwear , thin fleece , thick fleece . Unless the suit is made of gortex , you *will* sweat in the suit , so you want to keep the perspiration away from your skin <p> The next biggest area of heat loss is the head . I use a neoprene hood ; some people complain about its interference with your hearing , but I found minimal problems and gained the added benefit of protecting you against ruptured eardrums in a catapult . <p> For hands , I use full neoprene gloves . Lots of people whine about lack of feeling and their forarms cramping up . I found that concentrating on keeping your weight in the harness and not having a " death-grip " on the boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a 10 minute ride until I feel my forearms tensing up . I go back to shore and stretch them , and I am good for the rest of the session ( has been as long as 5 hours ) . I really have to get a picture of some of the locals who do n't wear gloves or boots who come crying back to shore after a 5 minute run with their hands/feet purple from the cold complaining that they ca n't sail ! <p> For the feet , I use neoprene boots . Depending on the temperature , I add fleece lined neoprene hunters ' socks in the boots . I have yet to try any of the " dry boots " that are on the market ; maybe next year ... <p> Another alternative I recently found is latex socks . These socks are loose on the feet but tight around the ankles so that water does n't touch your skin . These socks are perfect for use with a drysuit that has latex seals at the ankles ; put the drysuit on and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Absolutely no skin will touch the water with this setup ! <p> Finally , I wear my neoprene lifejacket . On top of adding additional impact protection , it adds yet another layer of warmth to your core . <p> My last session in 1999 was December 11 ; air temp around -1 degrees celcuis ( 30 F ) ; water temp around 1 degree ( 32 F ) and snow on the gound . I was in the drysuit with two layers of fleece on , and I was sweating after an hour long session . The only problem I encountered was that the water was freezing on my boom , making it very difficult to hang on in transitions . Find it hard to believe ? Check out the my session pictures . <p> My own personal rule is to go out only if the air is above zero ( 32 F ) since having water freeze on the equipment is a significant problem . <h> Steamer <p> The biggest problem with a steamer ( for me anyways ) is getting a icy blast of cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best accessory to prevent this is adding a hooded neoprene vest . <p> I also wear my polypropolene undershit and possibly a thick rash guard ( with or without the vest depending on the temperature ) . <p> As far as the extremities go , same equipment as listed above goes . <p> My last session in 1998 was December 1 ; air temp around 3 degrees celcius ( 38 F ) ; water temp around 2 degrees ( 36 F ) . I was only in a steamer , but with all the other items mentioned above and I was good for a 2 hour session . <p> Mobility is greatly reduced ; I much prefer the full or part baggy drysuit for its comfort and warmth . <p> Other tips <p> - Do n't eat lots of food during your session ; blood flow will be diverted to your stomach to process the food , which will reduce the flow to your extremities <p> - Pouring hot water into your boots will prevent the initial shock <p> - If you are wearing a steamer , pour hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial shock of the first immersion . I feel that it also extends the length of your session before you start to get cold <p> - As soon as you feel you are starting to get a little cold , immediately go back to shore and pack it in . <p> - ALWAYS sail with a buddy whenever possible . If something happens to you , extended immersion in the cold water could increase your risk of further injury ( death ? ) due to hypothermia . Without a buddy to get help , you could be in the water for a long time ... <p> Barry Peterson suggested the following : " Another tip I have found useful : I find the wind information I get through my ears while sailing is very valuable and I agree with the sailors who do n't like sailing without it . Rather than sailing without a hood ( which would slash my sailing time ) , I cut small ( 3/8 inch diameter ) holes in my hood right on top of my ear hole on each side to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of water that enters is insignificant and leaks right out the hood bottom once you clear the water . I still benefit greatly from the added warmth of the hood the rest of the time sailing AND the hearing loss is close to none . A win-win. "

@@6829804 @29804/ <p> Perhaps this is not the ideal place to launch a discussion of the important role facilitation can play in learning , but it seems to me that most teaching is conceived to be presentation by the teacher , which makes teachers into lecturers . A better way to look at teaching and learning , I think , is to regard it as a conversation between the teacher and the learners . There are many specific techniques one can learn and meeting processes one can use , but fundamentally , if you approach your teaching as a conversation rather than a presentation and then ask , what contributes to a good conversation , and then do that , you wo n't go wrong . <p> In this I have been much influenced by H.H. Clark , On Language . Clark proposes that conversations happen in " Common Ground " , the place where the participants in a conversation meet . I think the teacher or facilitator 's role is to create common ground for the other participants . We all have a common understanding of why we are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presentations that I have seen go off the rails right from the start because the teacher fails effectively to establish common ground , often because he or she thinks there 's no time to do that . But presumably there is time to teach a class in which learners do n't learn much . One thinks about the old teacher joke summed up by this cartoon on Baldvin Georgsson 's blog : <p> Following Clark you can think of the things that characterize a conversation and then seek to make those things happen in your classes . Clark talks about : <p> Recordlessness ( The participants ' actions leave no record or artifact ) <p> Simultaneity ( The participants can produce and receive at once and simultaneously ) <p> And , of course , in a facilitated environment , the teacher and the learners are all " participants " . <p> This presents particular problems for online learning , I think , for the very nature of the systems on which we offer online courses make it almost impossible to have a " conversation " , because the communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate records . The perennial debate about participation on discussion boards is evidence of this , and I think Clark 's presentation of conversation makes clear why online discussion is such a problem . <p> The challenge is to create an online course , I think , in which real conversation can happen . There are two suggestions here for an approach , the Facilitated Course Template , and the Facilitated ( Online ) Course Model . Of course , the key to this is not the structure of the course , but rather the processes that are used to deliver it . I do believe that a facilitated online course is possible , assuming that one uses groupwork in which the teacher does n't meddle . If you are interested in my current musings on this subject , here is a recent mind-map , called " Conversation Space " , albeit very incomplete and tentative . I 'm glad to discuss this topic if you 're interested . <h> Make your lecture into an exercise ! <p> Another way of looking at this is not to ask yourself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather " When the learners have learned this , what will they be able to do ? How will I know they have done a good job ? " With that information you should be able to turn what you intended to tell them into an exercise in which they teach themselves . This is certainly more work than just standing at the front of the class and talking , but , I believe , it leads to much more actual learning . In this I am very influenced by my daughter 's excellent Montessori teacher , Alison Goss , who was certainly one of the most gifted classroom managers I have ever seen . <p> What I 'm often trying to do , as a facilitator , is to be one the the donkeys in this cartoon , which I first came across as a political poster from Allende 's Chile .

@@6829822 @29822/ <p> Here are some pictures of my beloved 250 Ducati . I started the restoration in fall 2001 , completed substantially in fall 2002 . Finishing touches complete in spring 2003 . I bought the bike in 1987 for $600 from school teacher . He had a Triumph in his living room . <p> The bike is interesting in that it has the infamous " square styling " that almost killed Ducati in the late sixties . Ducati introduced the peanut shaped gas tank and square fenders with boxy Aprilia headlamp for the US market in 1967 . The first shipment of about 1600 bikes was not well received by ( then powerful ) Berliner Brothers , NY . In fact , they turned back the shipment . These US bikes even had ape-hanger handle bars , which was quite bizarre as the Ducati singles were hot little bikes , of race-bread lineage and renowned performance . The 250 cc Mach I for example , was the first and only 250 cc motorcycle of the day to deliver top a speed in excess of 100 mph right off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refined version of their single - the widecase . The earlier narrowcase bottom ends with shorter cranks had some problems . The kick starter spindle was poorly supported , wich lead to crankcase cracking under the spindle support . Also , the frames were slightly flexible . The wider crankcase bikes had tougher kick starter internals , stiffer frame ( due to wider swing arm spindle ) and hugely improved electricals . The new alternator put out 70W as opposed the earlier , useless 40W power plant . <p> Alas , Ducati had not learned their lesson in 1968 . This was a transition year in that the older models were upgraded to widecase engines ( same old bodywork etc . ) . For the US market , they again attempted to provide the square styling bikes . In 1968 they added the improved widecase engine ( and frame ) and added chrome fenders . My bike is exactly one of these Monzas . I think the bike is quite rare because the shipment was small , and was not repeated . In fact , most Duc fans do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced with chrome fenders . Mine is the only one I have seen , and my chrome supplier claims that the fenders on my bike have factory chrome . <p> When I started the restoration , I discovered the cylinder head is not original .

Also , the valves were the " tulip " shaped version fitted in in the high performance models . The rocker arms had the shim adjustment system instead of threaded tappets - also a feature of the high performance models . I figure the head was taken off a Mark III . My approach to deal with this mess was to get a new Dellorto VHB30 carburetor to fit the port . I had new valves made to match the racing ones . I replaced the rocker arms with ones fitted with threaded tappet adjusters - to make for easier maintenance ( I wo n't be revving the bike over 8,000 rpm anyway ) .

I also got the tank and side covers painted with epoxy urethane by the same supplier as the powdercoat ( much cheaper than a professional painter ) . I had a painter spray clear over the decals I applied myself . I replaced my rusted Radaelli rims with SanRemo aluminum rims , new stainless spokes . At least the rims are italian ! Bearings are all new . The shocks were replaced with new Cerianis ( correct period at least ) . I threw the ape-hanger bars in the garbage a long time ago .

@@6829826 @29826/ <p> Historically , those involved in creative pursuits have often turned to their " muse " for inspiration and support . Although the concept of a muse developed from ancient Greek literature , the muse has come to be more of an abstract concept , which is just as well since the traditional Greek muses leave a lot to be desired . They are for reference : <p> Calliope : Muse of epic poetry Clio : Muse of history Euterpe : Muse of lyric poetry and music Terpsichore : Muse of choral dance and song Erato : Muse of erotic poetry and the mime Melpomene : Muse of tragedy Thalia : Muse of comedy Polyhymnia : Muse of the sacred hymn Urania : Muse of astronomy <p> Creative pursuits in the modern day encompass so many more things .

Topics should be fairly specific , as it would be ideal to end up with , after many workings , an entire stable of muses in the true ancient Greek tradition of overkill . After the initial " birthing/nurturing " period , muses may be called upon by anyone who is aware of their existence . <p> The room for the ritual is prepared in advance . Candles and incense should be lit , and all items to be used during the ritual brought into the room .

Birth of the Muse : Thunder and Scrying <p> The traditional muses were the daughters of Mnemosyne ( the personification of Memory ) and Zeus ( the personification of Testosterone ) .

Let the images flow through you . You are looking for your muse 's form . It can be anything : animal , vegetable or mineral , but it must be something you can concretely describe to others .

@@6829833 @29833/ <p> It has been a very long time since I attempted to update the website and I do n't expect to get it really up to date . Actually , the framing was done in summer 2005 and I 'm writing this in 2008 .... feels like some school homework overdue for yesterday . <p> So ... about the framing . I put the ribs together within three weeks . Mark was away for work so I just went at it non-stop . Like for the rest of the building , having the boat detailed in CAD was a big advantage , I could double check the trueness of my frames with multiple diagonals picked out of the computer model . To assemble the ribs , I had previously built four heavy steel tables with adjustable feet . A couple rollers on tripod also helped support longer spanned pieces . For each ring , there are n't two of the same dimensions , I localized the table so all the NC cut parts would be accurately supported in a single plane . That meant running the laser level and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for each rib ) . Having a perfectly flat floor would of taken all the fun out of the process .... <p> Each rib was divided in two sides , a top ( some split in two ) and a floor piece ; that was done to optimize the nesting of the parts for NC cutting and minimise steel ( and money ) wastage . Knowing myself as great for mixing up order of things I had not only well identified and numbered all the parts but also " cut " the ribs so the angles of the mating sides would allow only the proper parts to be assembled with each other . It was somewhat a fool proof puzzle . <p> Step two of ring assembly was , welding on a flange . All the centred ribs I made up in T sections , the bow ribs were L sections with the flange on the aft side of the rib and the opposite for the stern ; that is for better access under the flanges for blasting , painting and maintenance . We are hopping a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made up many clamping jigs to position the flanges and help pulling the flat bar strait onto the ring . <p> Non of this was difficult just long and laborious after the first few ribs and a relief when I got to the fifteenth one . The trickiest part of the job was probably getting the bigger ribs out of the shop after they were built , even threw the wide garage door . <p> Here 's the keel ! ! We were so exited when that ... piece of channel was laid . I had been starring at my drawings for so long by then that I did n't need more to see the boat . It was there , clear and all in shape . I just could n't help continuously asking Mark : Do you see it ? I may have a lot of imagination because I could se the boat on that channel . <p> Never less , that single piece of steel was the most critical to position . For any kind of precise assembly you need a reference to which all other elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element arbitrary to each other . So here was my reference piece , the keel shoe angled at 85 degrees with the orientation of gravity . It turned out to be much more strait forward than I expected to position it . We used a good laser level , a long ruler and a bubble level . <p> The stem ! ! I really wanted that piece to look like if it was made out of a solid piece of wood and was willing to do the extra work for that . It could n't be a simple box section to look right , I made some bevels like a wood stem would have . Anybody can decide for themselves if it has the looks of wood but for the solid part of things I 'm pretty confident it 's solid . I spent a good week making this somewhat phallic sculpture . <p> Bringing this out of the shop we had a little choc from the size of it . The stem is over 15 ft high on it 's own so standing 6ft over the ground we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat . <p> The first rib to be raised was the tenth one ( the big one with the big floor , wich is meant to become a bulkhead ) . As I mention before , the dead wood was meant to help locate and positon precisely the ribs , the tenth rib was to be welded against the forward compartement on the deadwood . The first few ribs were held in position by some welded angle iron framing fasten to the beams running under the keel . <p> We took great care lining up the ribs . With NC cutting our days it is possible to get accurate rib shape and if positioned right there should be no reason the ribs could n't dictate accurately the shape of the hull . Once more , the computer model made it easy . We worked with the laptop in the truck parked beside the boat , pulling out any notch to notch dimension we needed to line up the frames . Each rib was tied to the other and had an external temporarily welded frame to support it until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting up the ribs was a very stimulating phase of the boat building , it was fast and provided much visual progress , the temperature was cool and dry . Even thoutgh my nerves were making balls in my stomach , it has been my best boat building time up to now . I had drawn and built all those ribs and was terorised by the idea I may have done a mistake at some point , at the same time there was that huge satisfaction to see it come together as planned . <p> Its funny how a simple question as which longtudinals are we going to install first can bring in a full reflexion . Every step is fully thoutgh and I probably can give a reason for every step , order or detail . Maybe I shoul n't think so much but maybe time lost on reflexions is better than time lost fixing a mistake . All that to say that we started by locking in the deck longitudinals starting by the center . Before it is a full structure the boat frame can get distorded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add stability without forcing the frame out of shape . The deck longitudinal litteraly dropped in the notches on most of the ribs and would only need a bit of pulling for the rest . <p> The hull longitudinals followed , alternating one on one side and the coresponding longitudinal on the other side to keep forces balanced . Was keeping forces balanced an issue at this point for such a structure ? I do n't know , maybe not .... but what if it was , it did n't make it any more trouble to follow an order . <p> The longitudinals went easily in to the notches for most of the boat . The only trouble occurred in the bow where they would trip to much ahead of the second rib for my liking . We solved the problem by chopping the flat bar at the second frame and making new pre-bent pieces for ahead of it . The problem was n't worth crying over , it only meant a little bit of extra work . <p> I have since paid a special attention at the longitudinal frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of and noticed most boats have tripped longitudinals in the bow . Does that mean I should n't of been bothered by a bit of wobble ? Maybe , but if I was to design an other hull I would plan ahead for some NC cut stringers for the bow and not even try going against the steels will . <p> The last lengthwise frame are the deck pipes . It was a charm fitting those in there grooves in the ribs . As each rib met the pipe on a different angle , so each groove would have a different elliptical shape drawn from the intersection of the pipe and the rib on CAD . Once more , it was neat to see the shapes mate as planned . We started from the middle of the boat and went are way to the ends . On this picture I 'm trimming the end to match the bow .

@@6829835 @29835/ <p> Starting from in front of the former Hudsons Bay post in North West River , you cross Little Lake and then go through the passage to Grand Lake . If the water is high , you will have to line your canoe along the edge of the left-hand side of the passage against the current flowing out of Grand Lake . Next , you have to choose whether to travel down the left-hand side or right-hand side of Grand Lake . Huge waves can come up on Grand Lake and it is easy to become wave-bound . There is often a prevailing wind blowing from the southwest . In these conditions , the left-hand side can be calm , while there will be large waves breaking on the right-hand side . This can suddenly change , however , if a storm system comes in from the northeast , resulting in massive waves breaking on the left-hand side of the lake . ( Go to Page 9 )

@@6829854 @29854/ <h> James Wilson Morrice ( 1865-1924 ) <p> Born in Montreal in 1865 , in an upper-class family , Morrice studied Law , but soon decided to devote himself to his true passion , painting . He first goes to London , but soon finds out that all young painters have their eyes on Paris and we find him there in the Spring of 1892 . <p> His first friends are American painters : Maurice Prendergast , and later Robert Henri and William Glackens , three of the artists that will exhibit in 1908 under the name " The Eight " . The young artists make sketches in the streets of Paris ( L'Omnibus ) , or on the beaches of Dieppe and Saint-Malo , using little sketchbooks or small wooden panels ; the bigger canvases are painted later in their studios . <p> The Impressionists are now better known in Paris , but Morrice and his friends do not seem to be aware of their technical advances , preferring darker tones , suitable for their night scenes ( nocturnes ) ; their idol is the American expatriate James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and music greatly appealed to Morrice ( his other passion was music , and he played the flute ) . <p> It is not in Paris , but during a visit to QuTbec , in the winter of 1896-97 , that Morrice discovers the brighter colours of the Impressionists , the only ones that can accurately render the bright light of a Canadian winter . He may have tried to emulate the works of his painting companion Maurice Cullen , a young Canadian recently returned from Paris ; they spent a few days together at Sainte-Anne-de-BeauprT . <p> Morrice does not immediately adopt the Impressionist technique of the divided touch . The paintings done just before 1900 are rendered in a very thick paint , which he then rubs to smoothen the surface ; the modulations of colour are then painted over , in very light passages . The results are very subtle harmonies that reveal themselves slowly to the spectator ; excellent musician , Morrice has learnt how to include the time factor in his paintings . <p> Venice at the Golden Hour marks a turning point : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we easily recognize the Impressionist touch in the shimmering sunset reflections on the Grand Canal . It is a happy period in the painter 's life : he moves to a new apartment overlooking the Seine , travels extensively ( France , Spain , Venice ) , and meets the woman what will share his life , LTa Cadoret . He also make makes new friends : British novelist Somerset Maugham will use him as a model for his poet Cronshaw in Of Human Bondage . And Morrice exhibits more and more , getting good reviews , at least in Paris ; Canada is less receptive for the time being . <p> Morrice 's palette becomes lighter after 1903 : he uses very diluted paint over a white preparation , but his harmonies are as subtle as before . Paintings done after drawings and sketches brought back from Dieppe , Marseilles , Venice , MontrTal and QuTbec , and later from Concarneau and Le Pouldu in Brittany ( long sojourn in 1909-10 ) , show this new style .

@@6829875 @29875/ <h> Welcome to the Macoun Field Club ! <p> We are now on summer break , but families can still enquire about having their children join at any time . Either phone Rob Lee at ( 613 ) 623-8123 ( note that " Macoun " rhymes with " crown , " not " croon " ) , or e-mail him at Macoun@ofnc.ca . The Macoun Club is sponsored and supported by the Ottawa Field-Naturalists ' Club ( OFNC ) ; there are no fees . <p> Indoor meetings take place at the Fletcher Wildlife Garden building beside the Experimental Farm 's arboretum ( Building no. 138 ) . Meetings start at 10 a.m. and wrap up between 11:30 a.m. and noon . Field trips take place on alternate Saturdays and typically run about 5 hours ( sometimes with the option to attend only the part before or after noon ) . We go to wild places in Ottawa 's western Greenbelt ( Stony Swamp ) and Lanark County ( the Pakenham Hills ) . <h> Schedule of Activities <p> Sept. 9 , 2017 <p> Start-up meeting . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered part of the Ottawa Field-Naturalists ' Club and may , with their parents , join the OFNC 's regular field trips . Check the OFNC events page for other upcoming events . <h> What are meetings and field trips like ? <h> Here 's what we 've been doing : <h> June 24 , 2017 : Annual party <p> Our meeting started as usual , with Observations . Rob had seen six Sandhill Cranes while driving in , and Jan had been to the Sarsaparilla Trail in the Macoun Club study area . We starting remembering what we 'd seen on last week 's field trip especially the two Water Snakes , which led into a slide-show review of the event . <p> Then it was time to hand out the awards . First-time members were presented with badges , and old-timers with individualized cards featuring photos of themselves in the course of the year . <p> Everyone got a copy of The Little Bear , with its articles and poems , and drawings of birds , mammals and mudpuppies . Finally we got to what everyone was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fall of the Great Lakes . " <h> June 17 , 2017 : Pakenham in early summer <p> At first all we were noticing were the wildflowers along the trail : Common Buttercup , Wind Flower , Maple-leaved Viburnum . But then we began finding caterpillars . First there was an Eastern Tent Caterpillar nest , and then Forest Tent Caterpillars ( with white marks down the back instead of a straight line ) . After lunch one that had rolled a strip of dead leaf into a tube around itself drew attention to itself by dragging the camouflaged case along . And as we were walking out , someone picked up a blue-backed caterpillar . <p> Avalon caught a baby Water Snake in the creek , and Garrett netted a bunch of tiny Sunfish . Then the rest of us went swimming below the old dam just the thing to do on a hot day . Our toes were surely perfect bait , but we failed to nab a single leech , crayfish , or snapping turtle . <h> June 6 , 2017 : Why were Ice Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macoun Club to get us thinking about why Ice Age mammals were so big . Not only was the climate cold during the Pleistocene glaciations , but dry , too . The forests had retreated southward , opening up dry , cold plains with tough vegetation . How , Robby asked , had herbivores like mammoths and giant bison evolved to thrive in that environment ? Insulating fur , we said , and he pointed out their bulky intestines for digesting tough grasses and fat reserves for winter . <p> What about the predators ? He spent a lot of time on the Short-faced Bear . Its shortened muzzle was an adaptation protecting it from bitter cold , and its long , relatively slender legs allowed it to outrun its prey . He discussed the pros and cons of saber teeth , and pointed out that there have been other periods in earth 's history when predators were similarly armed . He suggested that these were times when predators were few and did n't have to defend their kills against competitors . <p> And why are they gone ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleistocene megafauna disappeared . It is popular to attribute these extinctions to the arrival of humans , but Robbie appears to be a skeptic . <h> June 3 , 2017 : Two-part trip : Brewer Park and Study Area <p> In recent years we have run a joint field trip with the OFNC at Brewer Park , introducing neighbourhood children to the aquatic life of the river-side pond . In the usual pattern , kids caught frogs and crayfish ; they were put on display in an open-air aquarium and then released in a safe zone . Our member Niccolo caught a small Painted Turtle . Rachel photographed the Red-winged Blackbirds that were nesting just a few steps away from all the activity . <p> We all took our lunches to the Macoun Club nature-study area in Stony Swamp , and tried to see the Scarlet Tanager singing overhead while we ate . All the other birds typical of a mixed forest were there : Ovenbird , Eastern Wood Pewee , Red-eyed Vireo , Pileated Woodpecker , and Pine Warbler . Afterward , we searched under rocks and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of ants tend for honeydew . Starflowers dotted the forest floor , and we came across two or three Pink Lady 's Slippers ( Moccasin Flowers ) . <h> May 27 , 2017 : Members ' photo day <p> We had no sooner settled in for our meeting when a late arrival reported that the Mourning Dove just outside the door was feeding its nestling . Everyone rushed out to watch . The bird had started building her nest during one of our meetings , and is so used to people she was n't perturbed at all . <p> Macouners all seem to have cameras and use them to get nature photographs . When our meeting resumed , we took turns presenting our pictures to the group . Rachel 's images ranged from a hanging drop of rainwater that had focused the world beyond within itself , to a black squirrel with glowing yellow eyes . Jan 's pictures reflected his interests and adventures : cormorants in Ottawa , a Grey Seal and a Fin Whale , and a Gannet colony . Samantha showed photos of a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded meadow . Gabriel had pictures of birds , including a local Red-headed Woodpecker and a thousand Snow Geese ( with several Blue Geese mixed in ) . Niccolo had pointed his camera through a microscope and captured images of Gypsy Moth caterpillars hatching . <h> May 13 , 2017 : Field trip in the rain <p> Birds were singing we heard a Winter Wren , Ovenbird , and Northern Waterthush . Biting flies were out , and we had recently emerged Black Flies in our faces , but they were n't quite biting yet . <p> We directed out attention to a much neglected corner of our Study Area the far southwestern corner , in fact . The small patch of deciduous forest there had some Saskatoonberry trees with their white flowers , and quite a number of American Beech trees with uncharacteristic white stripes on the bark . These were aggregations of white , waxy Beech Bark Scales , first stage in a disfiguring and generally fatal disease complex . We found the first occurrence of this introduced just last year ( see May 28 , 2016 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A shallow wetland yielded small tadpoles of two sizes ; the smallest ones were developing hind legs , so were probably Spring Peepers . We did n't hear any Peepers calling all day ; their breeding season is over , and they have returned to the forests they occupy in summer . Eastern Newts were also reported here . <p> On land , under rocks and logs , we found many , many introduced earthworms , some beetle larvae , ant colonies , and some more salamanders . Among them were two Red Efts , the terrestrial juvenile stage of the Eastern Newt . <h> May 6 , 2017 : Nature-art workshop <p> As the end-of-May deadline for Little Bear contributions approaches , we all sat down to sketch and draw creatures that appeal to us . Some members flipped through bird books , one used a field-trip image on Rob 's laptop as his model , and Rachel called up a picture on her smart-phone . Niccolo drew his subject from life he had brought in bunch of Gypsy Moth eggs that had begun to hatch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our artwork will appear in issue number 71 of our annual publication , which will be distributed at the annual party at the end of June . <h> Apr. 29 , 2017 : Creatures of earth , sky , land and water <p> The number and range of things to see increases tremendously as spring arrives . We had n't quite entered our Study Area when a Great Egret flew out of it , big and white against the blue sky , and bucking the strong north wind . Once in , under a little grove of Red Maples we noticed that the leaf litter was gone already , consumed by introduce earthworms ( we found the culprits under a log : Lumbricus terrestris , along with L. rubellus and Aporrectodea turgida ) . In the over-browsed main maple woods , a limited roster of spring ephemerals was in bloom : Spring Beauty , Dutchman 's Breeches , and Bloodroot . Several members found Garter Snakes . <p> This being a late-afternoon and evening trip , we settled down for supper overlooking a sparkling woodland pond . Those who finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with fascinating invertebrates : Fairy Shrimp , caddisfly larvae , and mosquito wrigglers . <p> Along the shoreline , under logs , Niccolo found two salamanders , one the common Blue-spotted , and the other the very first Yellow-spotted Salamander we have ever seen in the Study Area . And we have been looking since 1970 ! As night came on , a dozen Spring Peeper choruses came to life , and in one corner of the Woodland Pond , we heard three Chorus Frogs . <h> Apr. 22 , 2017 : Swimming 3200 km to get home <p> We have all seen video of salmon leaping natural obstacles and dodging bears . We have also heard that the spawning runs are faltering in many places . Today Nick Lapointe explained that Chinook Salmon spawning in the upper Yukon River are a shadow of their former abundance . Why this should be is a puzzling problem to fish biologists like him , because the Yukon River is largely free of trouble . <p> In its 3200-km course , there is only one dam , built in Whitehorse in 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Nick explained in detail the factors that had to be taken into account to make the fish ladder work . ) Running through the Yukon and Alaskan wilderness , the river water is also clean . Being in such a rigorous northern environment , it is largely free of invasive species . There are commercial fisheries along the river 's length , but they appear to be actively managed . The destruction of salmon in the open ocean of the Bering Sea has been curtailed . Yet since 1961 the Chinook population upstream of Whitehorse has been only a tenth of what it had been . <p> Nick is employed by the Canadian Wildlife Federation to investigate more closely . He carries out field research on the river , and studies existing reports for clues that have eluded others . He told us that the large number of fish people see going up the fish ladder at Whitehorse breaks up into many smaller sub-populations that spawn separately on small tributaries of the Yukon River . Each of these might be made up of no more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wiped out through either some local natural disaster or unevenness of the commercial catch along the course of the lower river . Such losses would eat holes in the overall population . Nick also highlighted for us evidence that the age structure of the population has been altered so as to favour younger fish , which are far less prolific than the much bigger , old fish that used to be present . It is possible that the successful management of the fish as a single population along the whole Yukon River has not been able to protect the sub-populations in its farthest reaches . <h> Apr. 8 , 2017 : Seeing the snow go <p> On our first spring trip to our Nature Study Area , we could have used both snow boots and rubber boots . We tramped through acres of snow still deep enough to go over the tops of rubber boots , but there were also pools of meltwater that proved irresistible . Rubber boots or no , we soon had water soakers as well as snow down our boots . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On land , however , the opening ground had released a small number of feebly kicking insects : Stink Bugs green ( Acrosternum hilare ) and brown ( Podisus serieventris ) , and one green Assassin Bug ( Zelus luridus ) <p> Julia drew attention to a large , dead tree with something tapping inside . Drawing close , Rob recognized the slow , heavy pounding of a Pileated Woodpecker , yet Julia was right , it was inside the tree . When we drew back , a male Pileated stuck its head out an opening and started flinging out little bits of wood . Then we noticed that the snow under the tree was littered with thousands of wood fragments . The bird was chiseling out a nest cavity . <p> Other birds were signaling spring , too : we heard a Robin , a Song Sparrow , a Brown Creeper , a Junco , a Black-capped Chickadee , and a Phoebe singing . <h> Apr. 1 , 2017 : The wild life in Mongolia <p> What do you see when you look at the horse shown here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note its thick neck and large , blocky head . And how its mane stands up so stiffly . Domestic horses do n't have these features . This is a wild horse , the world 's only surviving wild horse species . Known as Przewalski 's Horse , it lives wild in Mongolia . <p> Our speaker , Roy John , had photographed this horse in the course of touring this still-wild land . His pictures showed the short grass of the Asian steppe running off to the horizon without a landmark in sight , let alone telephone poles or wires . We wondered how he could ever get close to the wildlife he had hoped to photograph . Yet he succeeded , and showed us a variety of birds , mammals , a lizard , and a huge grasshopper . <p> The people of Mongolia also came before Roy 's lens , and we were introduced to herders and their gers ( yurts , in Russian ) and riders above all , riders . Herders on horseback , jockeys at the races , and children . He spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spotted her brother coming over a distant hill and leapt onto one of the nearby horses and took off across the grassland to meet him . Roy rode a horse , too , to get into some of the special places . <h> Mar. 25 , 2017 : Birds of Africa and North America <p> We started with some exotic birds . Rob Alvo had recently made a birding tour of southern Africa , hitting as many different ecosystems as possible . Surprisingly , we recognized many of the birds , which we ourselves had never seen : weavers , owls , ostriches , and African penguins . Rob asked thought provoking questions that led into issues of conservation . <p> Then , switching continents , our guest led an exploration of his new book , " Being a Bird in North America . " He had a copy for everyone to peruse . With a different species on every page , and a custom cartoon for every bird , the kids quickly became absorbed in it . <p> But Rob also read aloud some of the species accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morgan , asked if she could read out the species that had caught her interest . Each account characterizes the species and summarizes its conservation status and any threats to its survival . We studied the photos and range maps , and discussed as much as time would allow . <h> Mar. 4 , 2017 : Icy cold at Pakenham <p> Conditions were almost perfect in the Pakenham hills today : a refrozen snowpack we could all walk on , with animal tracks showing in a light layer on top ; brilliant sunshine to warm us ( it was minus 18C ) ; ices as smooth as a skating rink running down a hill ( for inveterate sliders ) ; and a steady wind ( to make the pines sing ) . <p> We saw all the usual tracks as we walked in : deer , hare , fox , coyote , squirrel , deer mouse , vole , shrew , fisher , turkey , and porcupine , plus raccoon , otter and ermine . After lunch , we came upon a dead muskrat with one leg chewed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raven and an eagle , and heard a nuthatch . <p> It was such a beautiful day , and the leaders remembered such a special scene in a distant place , that we risked being late getting out and made for an " ice waterfall . " It 's a thing that can be seen only in winter , after a strong thaw , such as we 've just had . A considerable quantity of melting snow on the hillside above drips over the lip of a small rock face , gradually building curtains and columns of icicles . ( In summer , the water just wets the surface and drains away . ) <p> And we were late . <h> Feb. 25 , 2017 : American eels in the Ottawa River <p> Our speaker , Nick Lapointe , was himself once a member of the Macoun Club , so he was confident of having a knowledgeable audience . " What is the eel 's scientific name ? " Anguilla rostrata . " Where do they start from when they hatch ? " The Sargasso Sea ! " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to grow up ? " Rivers that empty into the Atlantic Ocean . <p> Macoun members who have been around long enough already knew the answers because we had heard about eels from Lauren Stoot on November 2 , 2014 . And even some of our newest members could answer Nick 's questions from their own general knowledge . But we very quickly got beyond that . There are hints that somehow the young eels " know " which river they should ascend . We learned that in all the species ' range ( from Greenland to the northern part of South America ) , the eels of the upper St. Lawrence ( including the Lake Ontario and Ottawa River watersheds ) grow to be the biggest ( 1.1 metres ) and oldest ( 50 years ) before returning to the sea . The enormous number of eggs the huge Ottawa-River eels produced meant that they constituted a quarter of the species ' reproduction . The implication for conservation is that this watershed is of outsized importance . <p> Historical records show the American Eel was once the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are left . What happened ? It was n't over-fishing , even though eels had been a major resource taken by native people in Ontario . It was n't pollution . It was n't habitat loss , either . The trouble and it is n't too late to remedy it is a series of barriers to the twice-in-a-lifetime migration of eels . In a pattern opposite to that of salmon , young eels migrate up the Ottawa , and mature eels migrate down in order to complete their life cycle . Four all but impassable hydro-electric dams bar upstream travel , and their turbines constitute a generally lethal route downstream . The second of the four is right in downtown Ottawa . <p> The dams were built mainly between 1900 and 1960 to generate electricity . That was before wildlife such as fish were taken into account . It is expensive to retrofit them , but the organization Nick is working for ( the Canadian Wildlife Federation ) has been working with the dams ' owners . The Ottawa Hydro dam will soon accommodate eels traveling in both directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give eels a reasonable chance of surviving the industrialization of one of their most important river systems . <h> Feb. 18 , 2017 : The ice is thinner than it used to be <p> The Sarsaparilla Trail in winter seemed like just several loops of well beaten pathways and a bunch of greedy Chickadees . The observation dock , scene of so much wildlife activity spring , summer , and fall , looked out over an unbroken expanse of snow over ice . We fed the Chickadees , and then marched out into the middle of The Big Pond . The snow out there was completely unmarked by humans , animal tracks , or even the touch of recent winds , and when we sat down for lunch , no Chickadee or squirrel dared come out so far for handouts . But there was something Rob figured we could see only there . <p> Rob remembered that in 1974 , the ice on this pond had been 20 inches thick . In this era of global warming , with average temperatures 1 higher than they were back then indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 above normal , and today 's ( at +12 ) was 16 above normal how thick would ice in the same place be ? We started chopping . <p> It turned out to be slow work , and pretty soon everyone was eating lunch while Rob , Ulyses , and Samantha took turns swinging the axe . They broke out big chunks of ice , which were full of bubbles . That meant the ice had formed mainly by water seeping into snow , rather than water freezing directly . Finally , Ulyses punched through and hit water , which slowly welled up . The ice was a foot thick , little more than half what it was in the mid-1970s . <p> Rob 's curiosity satisfied , we toured the northern margin of the pond where the tracks of an Otter showed how much it loves to slide along on its stomach , and flocks of Robins ( more than 30 birds seen ) had found food in muddy seeps below the beaver dam . <h> Feb. 11 , 2017 : Mammals of the Ottawa area <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nocturnal , some are crespuscular , some are subterranean and a good many have reason to fear us and hide . But they are here all around us and Gordon Robertson from the OFNC reviewed our local species groups . The meeting was a great success because everyone our speaker , our leaders , and our members has had memorable experience with one or more of our local mammals . <h> Feb. 4 , 2017 : To snowshoe , or not ? <p> In planning for today 's field trip , we had to make a decision about snowshoes three days ahead of time . During January , daytime temperatures had been at or above freezing for weeks ( this being about 6C above normal ) , but then the weather had turned cold and added five inches of fresh snow . Would the shrunken snowpack underneath have frozen hard enough support our weight ? Rob went out and walked around enough to judge the situation . He found that he could walk around easily most of the time , but sometimes sank in to his knees unexpectedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the smallest children would be free to run around unencumbered . We dug into our supply of donated snowshoes and outfitted any big person who did n't have their own . <p> It turned out to be a good choice , enabling us to get well off trail for lunch . We made our cooking fires in a new spot where we could eat out of the wind and in occasional sunshine . And when we started up again , we were free to go in any direction we pleased . We slid to the bottom of a steep hill ( even on snowshoes ) , probed both coniferous and deciduous forests , and crossed a half-drained beaver meadow . We even got into an environment destined to disappear from the earth : a Black Ash swamp . <p> All along the way we were crossing the tracks of the animals that occupy these woods . Those of Deer were deeply sunken into the snow , while Coyotes had trotted around on top , like our lightest kids . Two Fishers had run all through the woods ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare had almost floated on top of even the powdery snow , while a Red Fox had drifted about almost as lightly . We could see where Red Squirrels had dashed from tree to tree , and a Porcupine had waddled back and forth between its den and a favourite feeding tree ( a big Hemlock , reduced , after successive years of attack , to a skeletal state ) . We saw Wild Turkey and Ruffed Grouse tracks , too , but never a single living creature . <h> Jan. 28 , 2017 : Winter on the James Bay Road <p> If you wanted to see Woodland Caribou in the wild , how could you do it ? They have been pushed so back into the far reaches of Canada that in most places you 'd have to fly into some northern community . But there are one or two places where you can also drive into the north . It 's a long drive , but Mary Beth Pongrac set out from Ottawa in mid-December to drive the James Bay Road , a 2400-km round trip . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon saw species that you just do n't ever see in Ottawa . Willow Ptarmigan had come out to the road to peck at sand grains , and waded around in the soft snow to get at the buds of deciduous shrubs for food . They were in winter plumage , white as snow except for their bills and a few tail feathers . It is n't unusual for them to get hit by cars , so she had samples of their feet , densely feathered to the tips of their toes . There were other animals typical of the boreal forest , such as ravens and foxes , that no doubt patrol for roadkill . But the caribou were not wintering along the road this year and she did n't see them . <p> On a still day , it was the deep silence that impressed Mary Beth . She described it as being so quiet she could hear individual spruce needles falling out of the trees , and a car approaching along the road could be heard a quarter hour before it appeared in the distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were animal tracks all over the place at the Study Area , but apart from a few squirrels , we really had to search to see anything with fur on it . There were the footprints of all sizes of dogs along the walking/skiing trails , deer tracks crossing those trails , and muddy raccoon footprints leading from one muddy melted-out patch to another . Luckily , Rob knew just where to search , and how . We focused on porcupines . <p> One of the sure places to find porcupines is up in the cedars and spruces on the wooded slope falling away to the north . We had to go off-trail for this , wading through heavy , wet snow as much as knee deep . The litter of fallen green twigs on the snow gave the animals ' locations away , and seven times a search of the thickly branched , crowded treetops revealed a solitary porcupine , high up . <p> Our search brought us out to Pond VI and a beaver lodge . Farther up the shore freshly cut cedar stumps and drag marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting hungry . Rob , in the lead , was the only one to spot the animal as it dove from the shore into a beaver canal running under the ice . <p> As for squirrels , we watched a black-phase Gray Squirrel running through the treetops in a maple woods , getting closer and closer to a scraggly bundle of twigs high up in a White Birch . It paused to one side , then entered the bundle a nest ! There are so many of these clumps of debris up in trees , and one never knows whether they 're active or old . <h> Jan. 14 , 2017 : Earth 's atmosphere <p> Why do puffy clouds have flat bottoms ? This was just one of the many questions Rob posed as we explored different aspects of earth 's atmosphere . Earth 's breathable atmosphere is the only habitat we really , truly live in , but owing to the normal invisibility of air , we forget about it . <p> So why are clouds flat on the bottom ? Rob characterized clouds as forming when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise up . We know higher places , like mountains , are colder . If there 's enough water vapour in that air , as it rises past a critical altitude the vapour condenses on microscopic particles , producing visible water droplets . The visible cloud may be flat bottomed , but below that straight-line , level zone where condensation begins , the lower part of the bubble of warm , rising air may be as round as the top . <p> Rob presented his own photos of a variety of other phenomena , such as violent downdrafts tumbling out the bottom of a cloud , the natural blue haze of clean desert air in the Grand Canyon , and mirages of both the Mojave Desert and the Canadian Arctic . <h> Dec. 10 , 2016 : Skulls and bones <p> Macouners are notorious scavengers of skulls and bones , routinely raiding a friendly trapper 's carcass pile with abandon , and dragging home items that parents with more sensitive noses may relegate to the garage , the backyard , or even earthen burial . But well chosen , cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . OFNC member Jim Montgomery has donated his own childhood collection , and came in with two other enthusiasts to share their knowledge . David Campbell is a retired zoologist from the Museum of Nature , and Mary Beth Pongrac has previously presented her own collection to us ( see April 28 , 2012 ) . <p> What sets Jim 's collection apart is the catalogue he kept of each new specimen , which allows one to pick up a Raccoon skull , no. 33 , for instance , and learn that it was " found eaten ( hide inside out , no meat or innards ) in ravine behind Sunnybrook Hospital on April 6 , 1965 . Probably not run over before being eaten ; no broken bones . This skull is one of the biggest I have seen . " <p> Others had been donated , received in trade ( from David Campbell ) , or as birthday gift ( " from Mom and Dad " ) . With 150 specimens to chose from , our experts were able to point out the key features that separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear that indicate biological age . <h> Dec. 3 , 2016 : Rob 's winter forest <p> Rob Lee lives in the forest , and today we explored part of it . We found a good lunch place where the bare deciduous trees ( Sugar Maple , Beech , and Ironwood ) let a little sunshine in , and a few White Pines provided dead , dry branches for a hot , steady fire . The temperature never got above freezing , but those sitting closest soon stripped off coats and boots . At the end , we used snow to douse the last flames and embers . <p> Then we were off , running and jumping , and zig-zagging around tangles of fallen trees . Rob led over rising ground , and then down , down to an old-growth cedar swamp , where aged specimens of these normally thin-barked trees had bark almost an inch thick . Then up over one last hill , to burst onto the open expanse of White Lake . There was ice in the bay , but open water out beyond . We looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wildlife this grey day a Red Squirrel ( but plenty of eaten-out cedar seeds in piles ) , a couple of Black-capped Chickadees , and just a few passing Ravens . Ulyses turned a rock and revealed two kinds of millipedes and a couple of Ground Beetles tucked in for the winter . There were tracks , however , in the patches of snow Deer , Fisher , and Fox . <h> Nov. 26 , 2016 : The Museum 's reptile exhibit <p> A month ago , Macoun member Morgan told us about an amazing travelling exhibit of 30 live reptiles that is being presented at the Museum of Nature this winter . Today we visited as a group . <p> With the benefit of prior experience , Morgan held intense consultations with some of the boys . Heads together , the three of them sidled along , gesticulating , and punctuating their conversation with bursts of laughter , and exclamations of " Oh ! That reminds me ! " Rory and Aidan told her all about how there 's something in Gila Monster spit that , when refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " addictive cravings . <p> And kids with parents dragged them along , too : " Mum ! Mum ! Come see . . . . " And the parents would be propelled toward the objects of their fascination . They 'd be brought to a Veiled Chameleon , brilliantly striped in the greens of her leafy perch , and three Frilled Leaf-tailed Geckos . <h> Nov. 19 , 2016 : Study Trees and more <p> Our Study-Tree Woods is only 10 acres in extent , yet after 25 years of choosing trees , new Macoun members can still find ash trees and ironwoods that no one else has ever studied before . We spent the morning hours touring all those that current members are following ( and picking new ones ) . One very large White Ash had split wide open and fallen in big pieces . Niccolo took it as his own and counted the exposed annual rings : the tree appeared to have been 70 years old . Ana was entranced by a Christmas Fern , bright green amid all the brown of the late autumn forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study before . <p> After lunch , we took a newly ( and unofficially ) developed trail north past " the waterfall " now dry but more often walked parallel to it . Rob was watching the crevices in the limestone escarpment for the Study Area 's only Walking Ferns , without success . <p> We came out on the Trans-Canada Trail that forms our northwestern boundary , and it 's never been done before then explored beyond it all the way to Robertson Road . Right away we found a massive Sugar Maple bigger than any we have seen before . Past that were blocky rock outcrops with gastropod fossils that are absent from our Study Area . And then alvar-like terrain overgrown by Jack Pines planted in the sixties . <p> We finished up by examining the ruins of a long-abandoned farmhouse and out-buildings ( also outside our Study Area proper ) , including a spring-house ( root cellar ) , barn , and silo . <h> Nov. 12 , 2016 : " The Story of Stuff " <p> We began by reviewing last week 's field experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing three repeat echoes off an isolated house ( getting a result of 1010 feet per second ) . Rob explained how we can use that figure to tell how far away lightning is striking as a storm approaches . We had also heard echoes from the forests on either side of the field , at a higher pitch than those from the flat wall of the house . How come ? <p> Then we turned to watch the famous 2007 video , " The Story of Stuff , " which was written and narrated by Annie Leonard . In this animated documentary , Leonard explains the story behind the consumer society we all , willingly or not , take part in . Behind all the material things we buy is an unsustainable linear system that begins with destructive resource extraction and toxin-generating manufacturing and finishes in pollution-generating disposal . <p> She said that recycling by individuals like us is still important , but that what goes on in the other parts of the production-and-disposal chain is so much bigger that we have to understand and deal with that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant elements in the story is the tale of how the system of planned obsolescence was invented .

We settled down for lunch in woods beside the last stretch of rushing water above miles and miles of marshy meanders . The steep valley sides seem to have protected the place from human disturbance . Big Sugar Maples and White Cedars stood close along the banks , and like the boulders , were green with thick mosses and liverworts . <p> Half the group had already crossed by rock-hopping or wading when Rob decided to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we explored upstream , reaching a point where the tumbling water ran almost out of sight through a field of boulders . We found several dead Green Frogs , the bedraggled remains of a small bird , and one live Bull Frog . This species is so poorly adapted to low temperatures that , even at plus 10 C , this big one could only ponderously clamber out of reach among the rocks . <p> Going back , we had to pass through a managed Red Pine plantation on the high ground above . Selective logging had been carried out earlier this year , leaving the ground ribbed with deeply compacted skidder trails every 30 feet or so , and wood-cutting waste in every direction . Pioneer rock piles showed that this ground had been plowed ; charred stumps of the original forest showed that it had n't been fertile enough to be worth completely clearing . It must have been planted to pines 50 years ago . <h> Oct. 29 , 2016 : What 's out there when the sun goes down ? <p> What 's out there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mice scurry , but up there where first one faint light and then another appears . People have been wondering in a serious way about the sun and the moon and the stars for thousands of years . Today Rob guided an exploration of the cosmos by probing and expanding our collective knowledge . <p> The ancient Greeks took some significant steps forward , and some back . Anaxagoris calculated the distance to the sun and said it was just a big ball of fire , and got banished from Athens for his pains ; Hipparchus turned his geometric diagram around and said that because the earth was round , not flat , that what Anaxagoris had really measured was the radius of the earth . Knowing the size of the earth enabled him to use more geometry to calculate the distance to the moon ( using the time the earth 's shadow obscured it during lunar eclipses ) . <p> Macoun member Carter said that today we measure the distance to the moon by bouncing laser beams off it , and dividing the time taken for signal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the speed of the speed of light for that method to work , and suggested how we could calculate that with instruments no more special than an ordinary telescope and a stop watch . How ? Well , you had to be there to join in the fun ! <h> Oct. 22 , 2016 : Pakenham in the late autumn rain <p> Late autumn on a cold , rainy day : what is there to see in the woods ? We dragged a small sheet over the ground but collected no ticks at all . Apart from a solitary Raven circling high overhead when we walked away from the cars , there were no birds . Two types of mushrooms were seen several times : Destroying Angel and Jellied False Coral . Three individual wildflowers were in bloom : Heart-leaved Aster , Bunchberry , and Sweet White Clover . But at lunchtime on a high granite ridge covered with scattered White Pine trees and Reindeer Lichen , the gathering of firewood was interrupted by the discovery of one salamander after another . In all , four Red-backed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , about 3 cm long . ) <p> There had been enough of a lull in the days of rain for the fine pine twigs we rely on to become less soggy , but it still took much care and a couple of handfuls of birch-bark slivers to bring the fire into full strength . Then we were able to continue cooking even when the rain picked up again . <p> Circling , we explored new trails , and then cut cross-country once Rob and Rachel were sure of their direction . We hit on the spot where our granite ridge rises out of the ground and followed it right back to our lunch place , which lay not far off the bush road back to where we 'd parked . <h> Oct. 15 , 2016 : Silicate minerals <p> Quartz , olivine , garnet , pyroxene , hornblende , the micas and the feldspars what unites them ? There is an underlying order in their composition . They are all share chemically identical molecular silicate skeletons . It is said that if you get to know the minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex rocks , you should be able to identify most of the rocks on the face of the earth . <p> As a start , from his own collections Rob handed out samples of the minerals pictured at right . He explained that the molecular building blocks of all of them are tetrahedrons triangular pyramids each with a single silicon atom surrounded by four of oxygen . In mica , the tetrahedron units are very strongly connected together in broad sheets , while adjacent sheets are very loosely held to each other ; mica peels away thinner than paper . Clay particles are layered like this , too , allowing a mass of clay to absorb water and become squishy and capable of being molded into pottery . Rob passed around portions of prehistoric Iroquoian pots made more than 500 years ago . <p> In quartz ( amethyst is a variety ) the tetrahedra are bound to each other in three dimensions . A large specimen can be a single crystal . In chert and jasper , also considered varieties of quartz , there are millions of crystals , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . <p> Rob 's father was an archaeologist , so he has specimens of prehistoric stone tools . He showed everyone Iroquoian arrowpoints made from chert , together with similar points he himself had made out of broken window glass . Glass is another silicate . <p> For hundreds of thousands of years , until metals came into use , humans shaped naturally occurring silicates into their tools . Now , several kinds of artificial silicon-based materials are used all through our material world . Pure silicon , a metalloid , is the basis for integrated circuit electronics . Zeolites are used in hair gel , non-clumping cat litter , and water filters . Silicone ( silica-oxygen polymers with organic side chains ) have been designed to serve as lubricants , rubber sealants , and kitchen utensils . <h> Oct. 1 , 2016 : How the birds were saved in 1916 <p> One hundred years ago , just after the last Passenger Pigeon and Carolina Parakeet died , rendering both species extinct , the International Migratory Birds Treaty was signed , protecting the remaining birds of both Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even countries had not been able to do it . Today , Rob explained how unrestrained hunting in the late 1800s and early 1900s was driving many others to extinction . In those days , people were shooting birds for food ( pot hunting ) , slaughtering birds to make money ( market hunting ) , killing birds to sell the feathers for decorating hats ( the millinery trade ) , and " potting " birds just for the fun of seeing them fall . <p> Rob traced out a part of this history by reading aloud from a book by Jack Miner , who hunted hard for the first half of his life , but turned almost completely around and created a sanctuary for Ontario waterfowl that continues in operation to this day . Jack was born in 1865 , early enough to join his father in shooting Passenger Pigeons in Ohio . When he was 14 , he and his brother took up market hunting to help provide for their parents ' family . " We soon became expert shots , " he said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For at least five miles around the birds appeared to fear us , and fly and scream as though Satan himself was after them . " But they could n't keep it up : " I am pleased to say that we two boys soon outgrew this murderous practice , and hunted for pleasure only . " <p> Hunting ducks was Jack 's chief joy in life , and when he got the chance he started knocking down the first Canada Geese to appear in his neighbourhood . But one day in 1903 , the family of geese that he was calling down out of the sky spotted him despite his concealment and fled in panic . As he headed home empty handed , he was doing some " tall thinking " as he called it . " Why did they pass right over two other men within shooting range , and then shy before getting that close to me ? Moreover , why were they so dreadfully frightened ? Possibly because the leader saw one red hair of my topknot projecting from under my blanket and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know me as their enemy . " And then he had a further thought : " If they know me as their enemy , surely they would know a friend if they had one . " <p> Jack reflected that birds were becoming scarce : " I have seen more birds in one day , before I was ten years of age , than the average ten-year-old of the present day has seen in all his life . " <p> He went home and dug a pond and stocked it with captive ducks and geese . Year after year he looked for wild geese to settle in with them , and in 1908 he was rewarded with a small flock . He persuaded his neighbours not to shoot them . Every year after that , more came until he had to say , " Really , I did not know there were so many Canada geese on earth . " He had become their friend and protector . <h> Sept. 24 , 2016 : Return to the old Study Area <p> For a change , we made a cross-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wild Bird Care Centre . Only Rob knew , and he never mentioned it , but this is the terrain of the Macoun Club 's old study area , the one we used from 1968 to 1970 . We petitioned for a new one because this area was being despoiled by indiscriminate logging . It has some features that our current Study Area does not have : the aftermath of a recent forest fire , some well preserved fossils , vertical fissures in the bedrock , and a couple of invasive plants ( Phragmites , Coltsfoot , Japanese Knotweed , and the introduced land snail Cepea nemoralis ) . It has also become the home of the Wild Bird Care Centre . <p> The route past the big cattail marsh runs right by the ruins of a lime kiln from the late 1800s ; on the shaded quarry face behind the main structure , Rob named the wall of orange fuzz as the rather rare terrestrial alga Trentopolia . <p> Not far away was an extensive patch of cedar forest that was killed by a summertime forest fire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the charred ground is now hidden by a chest-deep growth of Staghorn Sumac and Trembling Aspen . This was our third visit : see also Oct. 20 , 2012 and Nov. 23 , 2013 under Past Activities . <p> We examined a lot of limestone and peered into the 3- and 4-foot deep fissures where wide areas are exposed , but found good , clear fossils only at a minor exposure somewhere along one of the trails . There were delicate byrozoans , broken up crinoids ( single segment rings ) , two species of brachiopods , and one nautiloid . All are of Ordovician age ( 470 million years ) . <p> We hit open water at only one point , and from an observation platform looked down on eight sleepy Mallards lined up on a floating log . Not two seconds after we turned away , there was a sudden noisy commotion behind us . All of the ducks had plunged into the water with frantic quacking a deadly Goshawk had just sailed over them . <h> Sept. 17 , 2016 : Invasive species at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our Study Area seemed like a good way to put in our time . At the Sarsaparilla Trail , however , the observation dock has become so closely surrounded by tall stands of Narrow-leaved Cattails ( and their hybrids ) that little open water was available for our nets . We managed to catch a couple of Brook Stickleback minnows , and let them go . Working south along the shore , thick masses of Reed Canary Grass lay between us and the cattails . Only Rob found his way out to open water and he did it by walking off the end of a floating log ( thereby getting a rubber-boot soaker ) . <p> As lunchtime approached , Rob changed course and led the group overland through seemingly endless thickets of Glossy Buckthorn , eventually emerging into a well remembered clearing with a small stand of Rhubarb . Samantha and Gabby happily chewed on the unsweetened stalks for a long time , even after their meal . <p> After one more attempt to reach water , Rob gave up on Pond I and led back past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tall vegetation , too , but we hit on an old beaver canal from which we dredged up several kinds of pond snails , a bunch of Mudminnows , and three Green Frog tadpoles . The main problem was the mat of floating Frogbit plants that had to be lifted off the net in order to see anything . Owen competently reached in and plucked out a Giant Water Bug , holding it safely so that all could see . <p> There is a really big old ash tree by the trail , and we were saddened to see that it is half dead from the attacks of the Emerald Ash Borer . Over the years , the hollow trunk and knotholes have been home to Honey Bees , young Porcupines , and a White-breasted Nuthatch family . <p> Narrow-leaved Cattails and their hybrids , Reed Canary Grass , Glossy Buckthorn , and European Frogbit , as well as the Emerald Ash Borer , are all invasive species that have been substantially reshaping our Nature Study Area from what we have known it to be . <p> Updated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All photos were taken by Macoun Club participants and friends . 
@@6829879 @29879/ <h> Fireball Mast Tuning <p> David Landsberg , Spring 1997 If you have recently acquired a Fireball or mast , and are starting from scratch , the following mast tuning guide will be helpful for getting the mast set-up . Before starting your work , be sure to view some competitive boats and decide on how you want to configure your shroud adjuster and jib halyard rigging systems . You should ideally have a 12:1 purchase system on your jib halyard . <h> Basic Setup <p> The mast rake is measured from the tip of the mast to the top of the aft transom , amidships . Rake is one of several tuning variables critical to boatspeed . Rig tension is another . Rake is measured by attaching a measuring tape ( 25 ft , minimum length ) to the main halyard , and hoisting it as far as it can go . Do not cleat the main halyard in the normal spot - pull until the shackle is jammed against the top mast sheave , then tie it off or cleat it anywhere . Pull the tape tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake . Rig tension can only be determined by using a tension gauge . It is essential to buy or borrow one in order to set up the mast properly . <p> Rig tension should be 350 lbs ( as measured on the shroud ) for older boats that do not have boosted stiffness between the chainplate area and the centerboard case , or just generally decrepid hulls . If the boat is new or stiffened in this area , select a rig tension closer to 500 - 550 lbs ( as measured on the shroud ) . Once you decide your tension , stick with it all the time . Do not worry is your hull restricts you to 350 lb . Many older boats carrying this amount of tension go very fast . <p> The basic objective is to adjust the length of the jib halyard ( or forestay ) so that you can easily set it to achieve the basic rake setting : 22 ft. , 8 in. at your chosen rig tension . It is essential that this setting is achieved with the shrouds pinned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes on the chainplate adjusters ( or shroud levers , or whatever system your boat has . When you have accomplished this , set-up reference marks ( tape , magic marker , wax pencil ) on the mast aside some distinguishable feature of the jib halyard that correspond to the following settings : <p> and 22 ft. , 4 in ... 22 ft. , 2 in. and so on , as far as the range of your halyard system will permit <p> Note that the mast reference mark , and corresponding rake as a pair correspond together with a chainplate hole for shroud attachment , for a given rig tension . Before ( or during ) sailing , you now simply adjust rake by deciding which value you want , placing the shrouds at the corresponding chainplate holes , and pulling on rig tension ( via jib halyard ) to the appropriate reference mark . Choose rake as follows : <p> 22 ft. 10 in. in drifter conditions <p> 22 ft. , 8 in. in everything else up to about 12 knots <p> 22 ft. , 6 in. for 12-18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you go racing in over 25 knots , bottom out your rake as far as you can take it ! <p> This is of course a rough guide ( probably good for light crews ) the best values for your combined crew weight must be determined through experimentation - the best part ! <h> Spreaders <p> Before you get out your drill and finalize your hardware for jib the halyard arrangement , a note on spreaders is required . These adjust the mainsail fullness in the upper half of the main . The spreaders should be the right length for your crew weight and swept aft a somewhat . Note that the spreader bracket should be the type that blocks the spreaders from pivoting forward . If this is not the case , modify your spreader bracket so it has adjustable stops . Better yet , throw it away and get a modern set of spreaders with matching bracket . <p> Spreader length affects the sideways stiffness of the mast . The longer they are ( i.e. stiffer mast arrangement ) , the less the mast will automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shorter spreader length will make the mast less stiff , and therefore it will readily bend in a blow - de-powering the mainsail . It stands to reason then , that heavier crews will benefit from longer spreader length while the lightweight teams would be better off keeping the spreader length a little shorter . A good starting point for average weight crews ( 320 lbs combined ) is 395 mm from the spreader pin at the mast to the shroud eyelet at the tip . <p> Spreader angle affects the amount of pre-bend , or fore/aft bend of the mast . The pre-bend is measured by applying your chosen standard rig tension at base rake ( 22 ft. , 8 in. ) , releasing the mast ram so it is free to float in it 's track , and drawing the main halyard tight against the aft face of the mast at the step . Looking up along the mainsail track on the aft face of the mast , it will be possible to view the fore/aft curvature of the mast with respect to the tightly drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width between the back of the mast and the halyard at the widest point is the definition of pre-bend . Ideally , your sailmaker will specify the required pre-bend for his artfully crafted sail . For getting started , any of the good sails available will tend to work well with about 2 in. ( 50 mm ) of pre-bend . Increase spreader angle ( i.e. sweep spreaders more aft ) to increase pre-bend . Note that increasing spreader length acts to increase pre-bend as does rig tension - so the higher your rig tension , the less spreader angle you will require . <p> To summarize spreader tuning , consider the example of team A - the heavyweights , in comparison to team B who are very light . Let us suppose they have the same mast , but team A have a new stiff hull and are carrying 600 lbs of rig tension . Team B on the other hand have a soggy , flower-pot of a hull and can safely carry only 350 lbs of tension without destroying their boat . Team A love to blast around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches are more intense with long spreaders - they have settled on a spreader length of 415 mm . Team B on the other hand want to somehow cope with any breeze over 18 knots , and they find the boat easier to keep flat with the top section of the mast bending off in the puffs - this works for them with a spreader length of 385 mm . Both boats have been set up properly with 50 mm of mast pre-bend at base rake and ideal tension ( 600 lbs for team A and 350 lbs for team B ) . Observing these boats side by side , team A 's boat would appear to have very little spreader angle ; by contrast , team B 's boat would appear to have radically swept-back spreaders . <p> To ensure you spreader setup is symmetrical try the following trick . Dial on some rig tension ( any amount over 300 lb ) , and tip the boat on its side . At the spreaders , tie a string tightly from shroud to shroud . Viewing from the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of your boat that is parallel to the beam ( i.e. the thwart ) . Fine tune your spreader set-up until this string is parallel to this feature , i.e. perfectly perpendicular to the centerboard - and all your variables are achieved . <h> Mast Ram <p> Basically , the ram should be thought of as a mainsail lower half fullness control . Generally fullness equates to power . If the car is mounted on the mast , then lowering the car will push aft on the mast , removing pre-bend . Straightening the mast in this way pushes the sail in on itself making it fuller . Raising the car up flattens the sail . <p> In really light air , the fullness of the main presents a challenge to the low energy air ( wind ) trying to flow across the sail . In this case you need a flat main just to keep the boat moving , so raise the car and add some pre-bend . <p> In light air , when the crew is required to sit on the tank to keep the boat flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or down ) . Induce some fullness by dropping the car a bit only to develop power for punching through chop , otherwise use no ram . <p> In medium air ( approximately 8-10 knots ) , the objective is develop all the power available from the rig . Drop the car sufficiently to straighten the mast for power . <p> When the wind has built to the extent that you are over powered and can not keep the boat flat , raise the car to flatten the main and reduce power . Do not release the car altogether however , as in this weather one tends to apply a lot of vang . Without the car pinned in an upward position the mast would bend freely and possibly break .

There are stone tools in abundance , quarried bedrock from which the stone was obtained - and 50 years ' worth of contention over whether people lived there before the Ice Age . <p> The hill is close to the modern village of Sheguiandah , on Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron . Protected by Ontario 's heritage laws , it has been illegal to remove any artifact from the site for more than half a century . <h> What is the history of research there ? <p> The site was discovered by National Museum of Canada archaeologist Thomas E. Lee in 1951 , and he excavated intensively there with large crews for the next four years ( 1952 to 1955 ) . They made exciting finds that put Sheguiandah on the map for having the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 years old ) . Even these soon paled in significance , however , when geologists told Lee that artifacts under the spearpoints were in Ice Age deposits . This exploded the established idea that spear-throwing Clovis Indians were the first humans to enter the Americas , after the Ice Age . Lee was vigorous in making his case , but the established authorities did not want to hear it . More than four decades would pass before the American " Clovis barrier " could be broken . <p> Meanwhile , opposition brought Lee 's work to a premature end , and he found his papers rejected by leading journals for being " too controversial . " He never got another chance to work on the site , and for a long , long time , no one else did , either . In 1987 neutral observers characterized it as " Canada 's most neglected major site of the past 30 years . " <p> No one was granted permission to work at the site until nearly a decade after Lee had died in 1982 . His old trenches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) by a group jointly led by Patrick J. Julig of Laurentian University , in Sudbury ( left ) , and Peter L. Storck of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto ( right ) . They re-evaluated some of Lee 's original evidence and then made their own observations , which led them to feel they could refute his challenge to established thought . In their view , the site is only10,500 years old , just a little younger than Clovis . <p> Instead of stimulating further work , the reinvestigation seems to have once again terminated all interest in the site . <h> What kinds of evidence are there ? <p> This being an archaeological site , the first lines of evidence have to do with the things left behind by the prehistoric peoples who lived and worked there . Ordinarily , an archaeologist can look at an assemblage of ancient specimens and draw conclusions about who made them and why , based on knowledge acquired elsewhere . <p> At Sheguiandah , this is so for only a few dozen spear points ( including the one shown here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storck , and Julig -- agree that these are mainly late Paleo-Indian and early Archaic forms , dating from about 10,000 years ago . But there is no agreement on who made the masses of other stone tools and debris that cover the Paleo-Indian spear points , or the quite different artifacts buried underneath them . Lee likened the latter to Old-World paleolithic cultures of 30,000 or more years ago . <p> The geological context of the artifacts provides a second complex of evidence . Geological events such as the Ice Age , high water levels in the Great Lakes , and the weathering of rock over immense spans of time leave traces that can be fitted into broader chronologies . If the artifacts are associated with those events , then something is known about their ages , too . <p> To understand the geological deposits where they were digging , both Lee and Julig worked with specialists . The geologists Thomas Lee worked with told him that the older tools he was finding were in sediments directly deposited by continental glaciers . That would mean that the Paleo-Indians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the last major advance of the Ice Age . <p> Geological opinions presented to Storck and Julig instead portray these same deposits as beach-related , stemming from a high-water lake stand that occurred at the end of the Ice Age , about 10,500 years ago . <p> The interpretation of almost every line of evidence is radically different , depending on whether the successive sediment layers are seen as intact or disturbed . For Lee , the stratification of the soil is real and represents a meaningful timeline . Storck and Julig dispute this , and contend that artifacts were introduced into the different layers by soil mixing . <h> So what is the conclusion ? <p> No single conclusion accomodates all the evidence from both sides . The authors of the reinvestigation differ widely from Lee not only on the age of the site , the identity of the peoples involved , and the nature of the sediments , but on the reasons prehistoric peoples occupied the site at all , and the defining purpose of most of the stone tools they left behind . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in brief , early peoples lived and left their stone tools on the Sheguiandah hilltop in a warm period before the last major glacial advance . The returning glaciers caught up and moved those tools - but only a few yards or tens of yards . The tools stayed locked up under the ice for tens of thousands of years , until it melted away . Then a succession of Paleo-Indian and Archaic groups migrated along the north shore of a subarctic Great Lake . Each stopped briefly at Sheguiandah , leaving a scattering of spearpoints and other stone tools ( maybe 5% of the total archaeologists now find ) on top of the glacial till deposits . About 5000 years ago , the lake basin filled again , temporarily turning the hill into an island in Great Lakes Nipissing . A tremendous stone-quarrying industry sprang up , covering parts of the site at least five feet ( 1.35 m ) deep in broken rock . Yet it was n't the rock they wanted , except as on-the-spot tools to be used in the splitting and shaping of wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envision Paleo-Indians as the first humans and principal inhabitants of the site , arriving about 10,000 years ago , after the Ice age was over . Natural mixing introduced these and Archaic peoples ' artifacts into beach sediments , which Lee has mistaken for glacial deposits . Great Lakes Nipissing does not figure significantly in their chronology of cultures , and the majority of the larger artifacts are seen , not as wood-working tools , but as unfinished stages in the production of small stone tools , to be carried away far and wide . <p> Neither point of view takes cognizance of certain contrary evidence . Lee 's interpretation , for instance , appears inconsistent with later findings that the appearance of the sediments could be due to post-depositional mixing , which only made a beach look like glacial till . <p> Likewise , Storck and Julig 's interpretation of Lee 's tills as beach deposits seems at odds with Lee 's observation of rounded sandy inclusions .

@@6829943 @29943/ <p> When Rhizobium radiobacter infects a plant , it injects a circular piece of a DNA plasmid into plant cells . Apart from causing a kind of plant cancer , it is being used in genetic manipulation , to carry foreign genes into plant cells . Galls may develop anywhere on stems and roots , but are usually found near the soil line , because the bacterium attacks plants at the junction between the root and shoot at the soil surface . The galls vary from pea size up to several inches in diameter . Unlike insect galls , crown galls are a solid mass of tissue all the way through .

It contains the Ti plasmid with the ability to enter plant cells and insert a portion of a genome into plant chromosomes .

This bacterium thrives freely on the Balkan Peninsula and along with Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus is best known for its role in yogurt manufacture . Both are part of a group of lactic acid bacteria which metabolize lactose and produce lactic acid . The slow production of acid lowers pH of the milk and causes the casein micelles to coagulate and to form a gel .

On this basis , we can say that these animals do regularly occur in the Study Area , with no significant change over the past 30 years . <p> Our only estimate of abundance was made in June of 1989 , when an overnight live-trapping exercise ( with 100 live-traps ) yielded a scant four White-footed Mice ( one of them at right ) in a 10-acre hardwood forest . It was believed that numbers would have been much higher later in the season , after the mice had raised families . <p> Gray Squirrels ( which are commonly black ) appear to be much more common than 30 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private bird feeders everywhere along the trails , these and other small rodents now have a much better chance of getting throught the winter . This may be why ten Gray Squirrel nests were observed in the above-mentioned 10 -acre forest in 2000 , where there had been only one in 1992 . It is probable that squirrel numbers have seen a real increase . <p> The growth of Red Pine plantations into signifcant cone-bearing trees has provided an abundance of seeds in winter that only the Red Squirrels exploit . Their habitat has thus expanded by almost 50 % in the last 30 years . They are stil most common , however , in the natural coniferous forests . <p> Eastern Chipmunk numbers are harder to assess . In some years , we hardly see or hear them ; in others , they seem quite common . <h> Rabbits , hares , and larger rodents <p> Snowshoe Hares are the common lagomorph here . Their numbers fluctuate dramatically in a famous 11-year cycle . They were at a low ( one dozen total ) in 1994 , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cottontail and Domestic Rabbits have had only a minor and possibly brief presence here . <p> Muskrats thrive in the marshiest parts of the beaverponds ; without looking for them , we see easily a dozen Muskrat houses in the winter . There are probably several , or even many times that number . <p> We have studied Porcupines more than any other mammal , and between 1987 and 1991 documented an increase from 21 to 49 animals in the square mile . From casual sightings ( which we still record in detail ) , we believe that the numbers leveled out at close to 100 . <p> Beavers are in a sense new to the Study Area , in that they had been wiped out across the whole region long ago by hunting and trapping , and only reappeared here about 1960 . Right away they began damming up the two small seasonal streams that cross the Study Area , creating a dozen ponds , some of them as much as 25 acres ( 10 hectares ) in extent .

By selecting some tree species over others , they alter the compostion of their own food resource so that it becomes less favourable to them over time . <h> Carnivores <p> This is a rather mixed bunch , as half of these ' carnivores ' are actually omnivorous and readily eat insects and berries . Two of them are n't even wild animals . But all can and do hunt and kill other animals from time to time . <p> Coyotes and Red Foxes are best known by their tracks , though we have had short encounters with both species . In recent years , we have been finding the remains of deer that have been at least scavenged , if not killed , by Coyotes . In some cases , we are sure from the tracks that Coyotes were the predator . <p> The smaller weasels -- Mink and ermines ( Long-tailed and Short-tailed Weasels ) -- have been normal residents of the Study Area all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few times , years apart . One that was hit by a car while crossing Robertson Road , just north of the Study Area , was 47 inches from nose to tail . <p> Fishers , like Beaver , were long absent from the Ottawa region . As part of an eastward expansion of their local range , the first Fisher tracks were seen in the Study Area in November 1997 . In 1999 there were two of them , distinguished by the size of their footprints . And in the winter of 2001/02 , Fisher tracks were easily the most frequent animal track to be found in the woods . We found where one had killed and eaten a Porcupine . <p> Former members who have been away from Ottawa for some time might be amazed to learn that Fishers , once known only from up toward Algonquin Park , first became common in the Pakenham Hills in the early 1990s , and have now spread east of the Rideau River .

We can generally find several den trees if we look for them . <p> Dogs and cats are really just visitors , but both are known to kill wildlife here .

About 12 years ago , the deer began wintering here . By the end of the 1990s , they were eating their favourite winter food ( White Cedar branches ) faster than it could grow back the next year . A pronounced browse line developed . As of 2002 , certain wildflowers , notably White Trillium , have been almost eliminated as flowering plants . The whole shrub layer of the forest , where tree regeneration takes place , is under intense browsing pressure summer and winter . <p> Humans have played several very different roles here . Pre-historically , and even for hundreds of years after European visitors began to keep historical records , people occupied the region as hunter-gatherers . Their populations were small , and humans fitted into the natural ecosystem without greatly altering it . We have no direct evidence of this stage here . <p> For about a hundred years , from the early 1800s to the mid-1900s , agricultural production dominated what is now our Study Area .

Physical remains include stone piles and rail fences , house foundations , roads , and rubbish heaps that are notably free of plastics . <p> As agriculturalists , humans introduced hundreds of other organisms that are alien to this place , ranging from crops and weeds to insects , livestock , and predators . Many persist . Allied to agriculture is silviculture , in which trees are treated as crops .

The goal of this display was to create a signature piece for the central atrium of the museum and to launch a fund raising effort for a new Fossil gallery . I had the privilege of creating the models for this exhibit . Previously I had created life-size reconstructions of two Ice Age mammals , the woolly mammoth , Mammuthus primigenius , and the giant beaver , Castoroides ohioensis , for the same institution . Those projects were undertaken was while I was on the museum 's staff , working with other model makers . This would be my first major undertaking as a private contractor . <p> The museum had a fixed budget that was raised from the generous donations of staff , trustees , members and volunteers . As a result every attempt had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of Mary Rose Saccu ( Project Manager ) and CTcile Julien ( Development Officer ) , sponsors donated most of the moulding and casting materials . Early on in our discussions CMN paleontologist Dr. Steve Cumbaa asked me if it would be possible to create two distinct Pteranodons from one mould . By modifying the angle of the wings and the direction and details of the head in a second cast it was possible to have two different sculptures at a fraction of the cost of doing two original pieces . <p> Once we had decided to go with two P. longiceps I had the idea to depict them in an in flight conflict over a fish . I ran the idea by Dr. Cumbaa , Mary Rose , and Leo Saccu ( Exhibit Designer ) ; we were all in agreement . My original idea was to have the beaks of both Pteranodons clamped on the same fish , performing the same type of aerial acrobatics that Frigate birds pull off today . Leo 's concern was that this composition would not make the best use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Museum Building that houses CMN exhibits . We decided to show one Pteranodon carrying the fish , in an evasive dive followed from above by it 's rival . I took this idea and developed the poses . I believe the end result is spectacular and shows the benefit of a collaborative effort . I may still create my original idea but for this space this was the best choice . <p> 1/12th-scale models of the pterosaurs were first constructed under the guidance of Dr. Cumbaa . I always look forward to working with scientists such as Dr Cumbaa since they view the results with a critical eye based on scientific knowledge and an appreciation of art . The enthusiasm of scientists such as Steve also serves to regenerate one when the project reaches those dreaded tedious stages , . i.e. fiberglass lay-up . Valuable observations and critique were also offered to me by CMN paleontologists Dr. Mike Caldwell , Dr. Rob Holmes and Research Assistant Rick Day . The models were based on the scientists ' observations , scientific papers and examination of specimens in the Museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scaled down versions of the skull , rib cage , pelvic girdle and major limb bones were created in balsa wood , wire , epoxy and then covered with clay muscle and skin . ( Figures 1 &amp; 2 ) <p> Fig. 1 : 1/12th-scale skeleton <p> Fig. 2 : Approved unpainted 1/12th-scale miniatures <p> The next step in this five-month process was to scale the model up to the life-sized sculpture . To arrive at the full size model , a cast of the miniature was sliced at predetermined intervals . The cast was encased in a wooden box filled with expanding foam to prevent the sections from migrating . ( Fig. 3 &amp; Fig. 4 ) <p> Fig. 3 : Yours truly , preparing the miniature cast to be cut into templates . <p> Fig. 4 : Sliced sections of the miniature still encased in foam . <p> Each of these slices created a mini template that was then projected to full size and cut out of plywood .

This form was then covered with modeling clay and detailed . The wings were a combination of wood , wire mesh , cardboard and body filler ( Fig. 6 ) . <p> Fig. 5 : Life-size form for sculpture . <p> Fig. 6 : The finished clay sculpture . <p> Once Dr. Cumbaa approved this sculpture an eight-piece polyurethane rubber mould with fiberglass support jackets was made . ( Fig.7 &amp; 8 ) Once the mould was completed the original clay sculpture was discarded . It was from this mold that the finished sculptures were cast in fiberglass reinforced polyester resin ( Fig. 9 ) . The angles of the wings were changed in the mold for the second cast ( Fig. 10 ) . Once it was free from the mould the head was turned , the beak was closed and the wings were finished in an upswept position ( Fig. 11 ) . Metal armatures were incorporated into the casts to provide hanging supports . The sculptures have wingspans of approximately 7 m ( 24 ft ) , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200lb ) Each model is suspended in mid-flight by two 2mm ( 1/16 inch ) diameter stainless steel aircraft cables . <p> Fig. 7 : First rubber sections of mould on original Sculpture . <p> Fig. 8 : The dismantled mold in its support jackets . <p> Fig. 9 : The unmodified cast stands free from the mold . <p> Fig. 10 : The headless second cast still in the mold <p> Fig. 11 : The second cast showing modified areas . <p> For the exterior finish we chose a lightly textured hair-like finish similar to those seen in fossils of other pterosaurs such as Rhamphorhynchus , Sordes , Dorygnathus and Pteradactylus . Stiffening fibers called aktinofibrils are suggested in the brachiopatagium , the major portion of the wing membrane . <p> Acrylic paints and glass taxidermy eyes were used complete them . Since the colour of these beasts is unknown this was one area I was given some but not unlimited artistic license . We looked to today 's ecological equivalents of pterosaurs - the soaring , open-ocean seabirds like albatross . It stood to reason that patterns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scientists suggested using light colours for underneath , which would help camouflage it against the sky for fish looking up , and dark colours for the back to blend the Pteranodon into the greenish-blue Cretaceous chalk sea as a way to be less noticeable to its rivals . Taking these colour suggestions I was free to come up with the markings on my own using the 1/12th-scale miniature as a canvas . After a viewing by the scientists of my first attempt I took the model back and refined it based on their critique . My second attempt was accepted without change . For the head and crest : I drew my inspiration from brightly coloured male birds like the great blue heron ( Fig. 12 &amp; 13 ) . For the back I chose a patterned body to acknowledge the reptilian nature of Pteranodon .

The 61cm ( 24 inch ) fish was sculpted life-size in polyurethane foam covered with clay ( Fig. 14 ) .

Once approved this model was also moulded with polyurethane rubber . The finished plastic cast also benefits from lifelike glass taxidermy eyes . For color Dr. Cumbaa suggested a blue and silvery-white pattern similar to modern fast predatory fishes of temperate marine waters , such as barracuda , bonito or mackerel . The hapless prey is held in the beak of one Pteranodon with the other in hot pursuit , in hopes of stealing a free meal . Jean-Guy was also hired on to help me during the process of modeling , moulding , casting and finishing the life-size Pteranodon models . <p> Photo by Steve Cumbaa CMN <p> Fig. 14 : Clay sculpture of Enchodus <p> All in all I am very satisfied with the final sculptures .

Maybe there is a future Paleo artist amongst them .

Dairy products with direct access to full-text papers . <p> 1982-1993 History of the " Food Structure " Journal <p> An American organization , Scanning Electron Microscopy , Inc . ( SEM Inc. ) , added foods as another subject of annual meetings in 1979 . The meetings were very successful as they gave a global scale forum to food microscopists to present their findings and to exchange ideas and experience . The presentations were published in the hard-cover SEM journals published by SEM Inc . In preparation for starting a new journal specialized in food structure , all presentations were compiled in 1981 by D. N. Holcomb and M. Kalb in the form of a book entitled " Studies of Food Microstructure " , In 2014 , it is still available on the book market . In 1982 , a new scientific journal , Food Microstructure , was established . It is interesting to note the affiliations of its co-founders : Sam H. Cohen ( Science &amp; Advanced Technology Laboratory , US Army Natick R&amp;D , Natick , MA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutrition , University of Minnesota , St. Paul , MN ) , David N. Holcomb ( Kraft Inc. , Glenview , IL ) , and Miloslav Kalb ( Food Research Institute , Agriculture Canada , Ottawa , ON , Canada ) . These scientists thus represented academic research ( E. Davis ) , industrial research ( D. Holcomb ) , and government research , both civilian ( M. Kalb ) and military ( S. Cohen ) . <p> SEM Inc. financially supported scientists in developing countries to make their presentations in person under the condition that the resulting manuscripts will be published in Food Microstructure . Scientists from countries around the world served as Editorial Board members and additional scientists were appointed as editors . In 1990 , Food Microstructure was renamed Food Structure at the suggestion by I. Heertje ( The Netherlands ) and the frequency of publication was doubled to 4 issues per annum . Although the journal was printed all on glossy paper to ensure high quality of the micrographs reproduced , annual subscription was low compared to similar scientific journals . It was $50.00 in 1982 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 by a sudden personal decision of the publisher , Om Johari ( Scanning Microscopy International , AMF O'Hare , IL ) . Food scientists were thus deprived of their journal and also their annual meetings . <p> During the short , 12-year existence , 386 papers were published and the Tables of Contents are still available at these sites : ? , ? , ? , and ? . By the kind of paper , there were 279 research papers and 76 reviews . By subject , there were 79 research papers on dairy subjects , 61 on meat research , 53 on cereals , 47 on food lipids and their emulsions , 32 papers on legumes research , and 83 papers on other subjects including fruits , vegetables , mushrooms and even bacteria , food packaging materials and feeds . The Food Microstructure and Food Structure journal issues may be found in the libraries of many university departments of food science in the USA and in a few libraries in foreign countries . The journal , although defunct for 20 years , is also available at some on-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nationalities of the scientists who served on the Editorial Board . They represented the following 18 countries : Australia , Bulgaria , Canada , Denmark , France , Germany , Hungary , India , Israel , Italy , Japan , New Zealand , Sweden , Switzerland , The Netherlands , UK , USA , and Yugoslavia . <p> Until the 20th century , dry foods such as cereals and other seeds , legumes , and stable food sources ( potatoes , cabbage , carrots , squash ) were stored for the period of their shortage in winter or at a time of poor crops . Many perishable foods ( fruits , vegetables , even meats including fish ) were preserved at home . Pickling , salting , smoking , drying , cooking , baking etc. were done on a small scale . During World War II , the need to transport easy-to-prepare foods over long distances to the armies led to industrial food preservation which rapidly expanded after the war . Nowadays , the food industry produces ready-to-eat meals . Food preservation has moved from the households to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a need to understand the effects which cooling , freezing , drying , extended storage , atmospheric oxygen etc. have on them . To maintain high quality of the foods manufactured , there is a need to understand the processes which change the food sources into the finished products , e.g. , milk into cheese or butter , flour into bakery products , meat into sausages etc . Chemical composition and nutritional values are not the only parameters affected by the processes mentioned . <p> Mouthfeel makes us to decide whether we like a particular food . It is closely related to microstructure . Is it smooth , granular , or fibrous ? Uniform or heterogeneous ? Do we want to improve it or to imitate it using different ingredients ? There were times when it was believed that wieners , originally based on meat , could easily be made from milk powder . Imitating meat with soy protein was possible only when a similar fibrous microstructure was made using sophisticated technology .

Human tongue perceives all such particles , irrespective of the material used , as " fat " . <p> There is a variety of laboratory techniques to study food microstructure . Light ( optical ) microscopy has been used for a long time . Individual food components such as proteins , fats , polysaccharides may be stained to be easily distinguishable under an optical microscope . This is an advantage of optical microscopy but its resolution is limited to several micrometres . Electron microscopy offers a considerably better resolution but the microscopes are very expensive both to buy and to maintain . Yet , the information provided by electron microscopy has been essential to the food industry and this has led to a rapid expansion of industrial as well as academic food research in the second half of the past century . <p> The subject of this presentation is the microstructure of foods with emphasis on scientific papers published in the Food Microstructure - Food Structure 1982-93 journal .

The latter participates in the development of cheese and cultured dairy products only after it is metabolized into lactic acid through bacterial action . Lactic acid acidifies the milk and coagulates the casein micelles . Coagulation of milk may also be achieved using other acids , e.g. , hydrochloric . The micelles are too small ( 0.1 to 0.2 m in diameter ) to be seen by optical microscopy , yet they have their own submicroscopical structure . TEM using shadowing with platinum vapour ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in constant motion and their free path is about 3 casein micelle diameters before they collide with another micelle ( Fig. 2 ) . <p> Fig. 3 . Casein micelles coagulate into clusters in milk which had not been heated and will produce cheese ( left ) but they coagulate into branched chains in milk that had previously been heated at &gt;85C for 10 min. and will produce yogurt ( right ) . <p> Following their destabilization by acidification and/or the presence of proteolytic enzymes such as chymosin , the casein micelles stop ricocheting and start sticking to each other . The milk curdles . The microstructure of the coagulum depends on whether the milk had been heated before coagulation . If not , the casein micelles produce large clusters ( Fig. 3 , left ) which are easy to separate from the liquid phase called whey . The solid curd then forms the base for cheese production . There are very many cheese types . <p> Yogurt and labneh <p> In milk , which had been heated above 85C , the whey protein called -lactoglobulin reacts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sites where other casein micelles could get attached . The micelles still move freely in heated milk but the changes severely limit their interactions when the yogurt bacteria , Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus , ( Fig. 4 ) acidify the milk with lactic acid . ( Other " probiotic " lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus , lactococci , and also bifidobacteria may be used to make a varied microflora in yogurt ) . The micelles aggregate into short branched chains ( Fig. 3 , right ) . The liquid phase , i.e. , the milk serum with all its nutrients including the whey proteins , is held by the " spongy " coagulum ( Fig. 5 ) . Whey proteins have high nutritional value because they provide sulfur in the form of amino acids cysteine and methionine . This is the principle of yogurt manufacture . " Strained yogurt " is called Labneh and its research was done do a great extent by A. Y. Tamime with collaborators . <p> The illustrations are micrographs obtained by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micrographs are produced in grayscale because electrons instead of photons are used to form them . They were later provided with false colours using Adobe Photoshop . <p> TEM was done in two of several modes : Fig. 1 was obtained by capturing a very thin layer of casein micelles from diluted milk on a carbon-coated Formvar film on a 100-mesh grid , 3 mm in diamater , and shadowing the micelles under a sharp angle with platinum vapour in vacuo . The grid was examined in a beam of high-energy electrons and the shadows of the platinum coating were captured on a sensitive photographic film . That kind of film has been replaced in modern electron microscopes with digital cameras .

While in liquid nitrogen , the yogurt prisms were fractured , the fragments were thawed in 100% ethanol , critical-point dried , mounted on stubs , coated with gold and examined by SEM . Figs. 6 and 7 were obtained by TEM of thin sections . Particles , approx 1x1 mm , were fixed , dehydrated and embedded in a resin . Thin sections ( 90 nm ) were cut using a diamond knife , stained for proteins with lead citrate and and captured on a carbon-coated Formvar film on a 100-mesh grid , 3 mm in diameter . <p> SEM shows branched casein micelle chains in yogurt ( Fig. 5 ) and a compact protein mass of cheese ( Fig. 10 ) . Casein micelles which form both kinds of dairy products have similar internal structures as shown by TEM in Figs. 6 and 7 . The core-and-shell structure in Indian cheese " Paneer " is the result of coagulating milk to a relatively high pH of 5.5 using an acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also found in other non-ripened cheeses such as the American White cheese and the South American Queso blanco . The structure may be observed only by TEM but not by SEM , because the annular space between the core and the shell is narrow ( 50-80 nm ) and would be partly obscured by the usual 20 nm gold coating used in SEM as was shown by Kalb in 1980 and confirmned by Gastaldi et al . in 1996 . The structure is very stable and persists during cheese processing . Its presence in processed cheese thus indicates that non-ripened cheese was part of the ingredients . <p> Fig. 10 . Compression and ripening change coagulated casein micelles and the fat globules into compact cheese . ( Fat removal from the sample produced globular cavities in the protein matrix - SEM ) . <p> Cheese is made from milk that had not been heated . Proteolytic enzymes such chymosin are used to coagulate the milk . They used to be obtained from calf stomachs as so-called rennet , but may also be of microbial or plant origin . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide characteristic flavour of the cheese . Structural changes taking place during the manufacture of various cheeses have been described and illustrated and also archived elsewhere . <p> Hard cheeses are made by curdling milk in a large vat , cutting the curd into small cubes ( 6 - 16 mm ) and slowly stirring the mass while heating it to expel whey from the curd cubes . Due to the loss of water , the cubes shrink into small curd granules . The whey is drained off and the curd settles at the bottom of the vat . <p> Cheddar cheese manufacture is similar but the curd in the vat is cut into large slabs and these are piled on top of each other at the vat wall . The warm slabs slowly flow down and the curd acquires a quasi fibrous structure . The slabs are reshuffled so all curd is exposed to this kind of " cheddaring " . Then the curd is milled into finger-like particles . They are salted , placed into moulds , pressed , and ripened to form solid Cheddar cheese . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas depleted of fat globules . Extraction of fat using n-hexane causes the cheese surface to reflect light and to appear lighter than the compact junctions . <p> To visualize the patterns , small cheese slices such as 30mm x 30mm x 2mm are fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde , dehydrated in graded ethanol , defatted in n-hexane and dried between 2 filter papers under a small load in a fume hood , the slices are sandpapered with a fine-grain sandpaper . The two different kinds of cheese produce two distinctly different types of patterns ( Fig. 12 ) . They are simple in the Brick cheese and complex in Cheddar cheese . The lines are areas where neighbouring curd granules are joined together . Cutting the curd leads to a loss of milkfat globules from the superficial layers of the granules . Subsequent pressing joins two fat-depleted layers and forms the so-called curd granule junctions . They appear darker to a naked eye . - In Cheddar cheese , the curd granules are elongated as the result of the cheddaring process . Thicker lines - milled curd granule junctions - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The origin of both kinds of patterns is explained with instructions how to obtain rhem . Large images of both kinds of junctions are shown on page 26 and in Fig. 16 . Cheddar cheese commands a price higher than Brick cheese and some other stirred curd cheeses because of the more laborious manufacturing process which contributes to the quality of the cheese . Mechanized and automated cheddaring produces similar two kinds of junction <p> The image of an entire loaf of Swiss ( Emmental ) cheese at left ( Fig. 13 ) showing its internal structure was obtained by M. Rosenberg et al . using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The objective was to assess the development of the " eyes " inside the cheese ( dark areas inside the loaf ) and to fully ripen only those with uniform eye distribution . This would allow the elimination of loaves with defective internal structure withut a need to cut the leaves . MRI is a non-destructive method which provides high-resolution images of air and whey pockets as small as 0.1+0.1+1 mm . The study saved space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eliminated cheeses in other ways such as making processed cheese . <p> Cheese processing was initially invented to salvage trimmings from large cheese blocks or to salvage damaged cheese blocks . Fat separates from cheese on heating ( as may be seen on a pizza ) because heating impairs the emulsifying properties of cheese proteins . They may be restored by so-called melting salts such as sodium citrate or various sodium phosphates . Processed cheese of desired properties may be obtained from blends of selected natural cheeses with the addition of other ingredients ( milk or vegetable protein solids ) and appropriate melting salts . The resulting consistency of processed cheese may vary from spreadable to hard . The cheese may be produced in various shapes including slices and has become very popular . Processed cheese is no more produced from scraps but is made nowadays from sources especially formulated for this purpose . If there is a problem somewhere in the line between processing and packaging and the flow of molten processed cheese has to be stopped , the cheese may harden in the pipes . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses , the hardened cheese is retrieved and milled and the resulting rework is added to a new batch of fresh cheese blend . TEM can detect rework in the form of " osmiophilic " areas in the new processed cheese ( Fig. 14 ) . Such areas , which appear dark in the micrographs , consist of proteins different from the fresh cheese blend , for example by being denser or by reacting more strongly with the osmium tetroxide fixative . <p> Unknown structures consisting of thin protein sheets with minute globules attached to them ( Fig. 15 ) were occasionally observed by TEM in milk . B. E. Brooker has found that they were the residues of milk foam which had developed during milking . Milk proteins become attached to the air-milk serum interface and form a membrane approx. 5 nm thick . Casein micelles then become attached to these membranes . <p> Ice cream manufacture has been described in great detail on the University of Guelph , Ontario , website . H. D. Goff studied the ice cream structure by electron microscopy , using both cryo-SEM and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both an emulsion and a foam . Physical chemistry of ice cream is quite complicated as there is a need to stabilize the minute air cells ( bubbles ) with partially coalesced milkfat . However , there is also advice for almost every problem which may develop during ice cream manufacture and storage . <p> In her article about ice cream , Bethany Halford has compiled information about the manufacture and properties from two university professors , H. D. Goff ( Guelph , ON , Canada ) and R. W. Hartel ( Madison , WI , USA ) . In the USA , according to federal laws , anything that is labelled as " ice cream " must contain a minimum of 10% milkfat by weight . Premium brands may contain twice as much milkfat . <p> Fig. 17 . Fat globule membrane fragments ( right ) found in the sample are a proof of the presence of traditional buttermilk solids . Skimmilk contains only casein micelles ( left ) . ( TEM of thin sections . ) <p> Milk solids are used in so-called meat binders to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk solids , those of dried traditional buttermilk , have been banned for a simple reason : lipids present in the buttermilk may be susceptible to becoming rancid on storage . Electron microscopy was found invaluable in the enforcement of the ban . The principle of the detection of buttermilk in the presence of other milk solids is based of the disruption of milkfat globules when cream is churned to produce butter . Fragments of the milkfat globule membranes are concentrated in buttermilk . A coarse suspension of a suspicious material is first centrifuged at low gravitional force and the supernatant is ultracentrifuged . The pellet is examined by TEM . A micrograph of milk solids free of buttermilk is shown in Fig. 17 ( left frame ) . Membrane fragments in the right frame indicate the presence of buttermilk solids . <p> Fig. 19 . Milk powder . Interactions between large and still soft particles and small already dried and hard powder particles during spray drying lead to different surface structures on the large particles . If the large particles are very soft , they capture the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dry but still soft , the small particles ricochet and leave dents in the large particles ( image at right ) . <p> Drying is the best method to store surplus milk . There were several drying procedures used in the past , the easiest having been roller drying . The milk powder produced was of limited solubility , however , so that it was not suited to make reconstituted milk ( and make yogurt ) . Instead , it was used as an ingredient in some bakery products . Roller dry-ing was abandoned in favour of spray-drying . <p> The milk is first evaporated to remove a large part of the water . The evaporated milk is atomized into minute droplets in a drying tower . The size of the dried milk powder particles is related to the size of the droplets . The final appearance of the particles ( Fig. 18 ) is the result of interactions taking place during drying . During drying , large and small particles collide . Large particles dry and harden more slowly than small particles ( Fig. 19 ) . Images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19-22 . Instant milk powder , which dissolves easily without foaming , is made by agglomeration of the individual primary particles .
