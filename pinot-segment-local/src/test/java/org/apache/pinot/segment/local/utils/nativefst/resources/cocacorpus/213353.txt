Your job as an affiliate would be to send lots of traffic ( people/customers ) to an advertiser 's website . You then get paid for each person that goes to your advertiser 's website or a possible commission on anything they buy . So let 's say your friend Allie comes to look at your website and sees an ad for Nike shoes . When she clicks the ad she is redirected to Nike 's website . She finds a pair she likes and purchases them . And just like that , you earned some cash . <p> Affiliate marketing ranges a wide variety of situations and you can be working for people you do n't even know . But if you can send large amounts of traffic , then you can use that to make money . <h> Key Terms <p> 1Advertiser <p> Also known as merchant . The guy/company trying to sell a product ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also known as a publisher . An affiliate is a company or person that takes the advertiser 's marketing material and distributes it to consumers . Affiliates are the source of traffic or data . Each affiliate has a unique affiliate I 'd ( AFID ) that allows LinkTrust to track their respective traffic and conversions .. <p> 3Campaign <p> A campaign is a series of advertisement messages that share a single idea and theme that make up an integrated marketing communication ( IMC ) . Advertising campaigns appear in different media across a specific time frame . <p> 4CPA <p> Cost Per Action ( sometimes known as Pay Per Action or PPA ) . When a customer clicks on an ad on your webpage AND completes some action ( a purchase , a form submission , and so on ) , you ( the affiliate ) will get paid . <p> 5CPC <p> Cost Per Click ( aka Pay Per Click ) . This is when an advertiser ( merchant ) will pay their affiliate when a user clicks on their advertisement . This is used on search engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CPC is how Google makes money . <p> 6CPL <p> Cost Per Lead ( Pay Per Lead ) is a method of marketing that enables an advertiser to receive membership or advertising services in return for paying per lead received from the marketing venue used . It can be compared to other advertising methods that require the advertiser to respectively pay for clicks , sales and actions generated through a marketing venue . <h> Story Examples <h> Story 1 : Sarah <p> Sarah has a blog that she writes on regularly . She mostly writes about her kids . Wanting to gain a little extra cash , she decides to recommend for all of her readers to buy Gerber Baby products by clicking an ad given to her . Gerber Baby promises to give her a 5% commission on anything her readers bought after clicking the ad . LinkTrust will track every time one of her readers clicks the link and buys something so Gerber Baby will know how much to pay her . <h> Story 2 : John <p> John has a very successful youtube channel where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some money off of his viewers and decides to endorse Audible.com to everyone and give them a link to a 30-day free trial . He gets paid every time someone signs up through his personal link . LinkTrust tracks who signs up for Audible to make sure that John gets paid for the people he sent to sign up . <h> Story 3 : Nike <p> Nike is looking for a way to get more traffic to their website so they reach out to ( affiliates ) people who have agreed to post a Nike advertisement on their websites and blogs for a 10% commision . Nike will give each of these people a unique LinkTrust link that connects to the ad being placed . Anytime someone clicks on the ad it will redirect to the Nike website using this LT link . LinkTrust will track how many times the ad is clicked on so Nike knows how much to pay those who hosted the Nike Advertisement .

@@23491589 @3491589/ <h> Lesson 2 : Basics of tracking ( CPA , CPC ) <p> Affiliate marketing is performance-based marketing , meaning that the advertisers ( these guys are the vendors or merchants- the people selling a product/service and pay affiliates for conversions or leads they send ) only pay for advertising that converts . LinkTrust 's role in the industry is to provide tools necessary to make that possible . LinkTrust does the behind-the-scenes work to track online advertising so the advertisers know where their sales are coming from and can pay their affiliates the correct amount . <p> How does it work ? <h> CPA Offers ( cookie-based tracking ) <p> CPA means Cost Per Action . Meaning that the affiliate is paid depending on the completion of a certain action ( like making an online purchase , sending a lead or filling out a form ) . <p> The main way of tracking CPA offers ( or campaigns ) is through cookie-based tracking . Let 's walk through the steps to see how this works : <h> Step 1 : <p> Consumers click on a tracking link or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directs the click ( the consumer ) to LinkTrust . <h> Step 2 : <p> Linktrust records the data for the click and writes a cookie on the consumer 's browser . <h> Step 3 : <p> The consumer gets redirected to the advertiser 's landing page . <h> Step 4 : <p> The consumer makes a purchase and is taken to the advertiser 's confirmation page . A confirmation pixel is fired from the confirmation page . <h> Step 5 : <p> The confirmation pixel " eats " the cookie from the consumer 's browser and records a sale in LinkTrust . <h> What is a tracking link ? <p> A tracking link is what marks the beginning of a transaction . The majority of sales models that LinkTrust tracks begins with the consumer clicking on a tracking link . Here is a sample tracking link : <p> http : // This is known as the protocol . https : // means that it is a secure site ( with SSL encryption ) and http : // means there is no encryption . <p> demo4.linktrust.com This is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer where to go to find the webpage . <p> /click.track This is a LinkTrust-specific option that tells linktrust we would like to begin tracking . <p> ? This is a question mark ( no duh ! ) . This basically says that anything that comes after is data that we want to send to LinkTrust . <p> CID=256580 This is a key-value pair . The key CID means that we want LinkTrust to recognize the value 256580 as a CID in the LinkTrust system . CID means Campaign I 'd . <p> &amp; The ampersand means that we are done with the last key-value pair and we are going to start a new one . We 'll only mention this guy once . <p> AFID=289914 This is a key value pair . It is used to pass in the Affiliate I 'd through the AFID key . The value , of course is 289914 <p> SID=a5dd4fTTE This key-value pair sends in the Sub I 'd . We 'll explain more about that later on . <h> CPA Offers ( ServerSide Tracking ) <p> LinkTrust can also use ServerSide pixels , which do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Post Back URL that is executed upon each conversion . With server to server tracking , a unique value ( ClickID ) is created and captured for each click . LinkTrust also captures and stores the campaign I 'd , affiliate I 'd and any other information passed into LinkTrust with each click . LinkTrust passes the ClickID to the advertiser on the landing page URL . When the consumer purchases a product , the pixel is fired and posts the same ClickID back to LinkTrust . Using the data associated with the ClickID , LinkTrust can then attribute the sale to the correct affiliate . LinkTrust users that want to use server to server tracking must allow ClickID Postbacks in the Conversion Tracking Options section of the campaign settings to use this function . <h> Step 1 : <p> Consumers click on creatives ( advertisements ) placed on an affiliate 's website . The link directs the consumer 's click to LinkTrust . <h> Step 2 : <p> LinkTrust records data for the click and writes a cookie on the consumer 's browser . Note that ServerSide pixels do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the system needs to create it to generate a Click I 'd . <h> Step 3 : <p> The consumer is redirect to the advertiser 's landing page and the advertiser captures the value of the ClickID ( from the URL ) . <p> Note that within LinkTrust you must pass the ClickID to the landing page URL . We use the token =ClickId= . So the landing page URL inside of LinkTrust would look something like http : //www.linktrust.com ? trackid==ClickId= . <h> Step 4 : <p> The consumer makes a purchase and is taken to the advertiser 's confirmation page . A ServerSide pixel/postback is fired from the advertiser 's server . <p> Note that ServerSide pixels may be on the backend shopping cart or backend server to fire , or they can be placed on the confirmation page . <p> Example Pixel to send to advertiser : LONG ... . Once the advertiser fills it out , the pixel would look something like this : LONG ... <h> Step 5 : <p> The serverside pixel communicates directly to LinkTrust using the ClickID to associate the converstion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct affiliate . <p> Note that serverside pixels do not need cookies to track conversions . The pixel communicates directly to LinkTrust on the back end , between the advertiser 's servers and LinkTrust 's servers .

@@23491602 @3491602/ <h> Mobile Marketing What You Need to Know <p> The online marketing world is rapidly changing and molding to the ways of the consumer . Of course , we 're all aware of how important mobile phones have become to our society , but how does mobile marketing fit into your online marketing plan ? Let 's dive into what you need to know about mobile marketing . <p> Mobile marketing is all about tailoring your branding message to fit on the device the consumer you 're trying to reach is using and making your message relevant to what they are doing on their phones . <p> WHY MOBILE MARKETING ? <p> There are a lot of ways we can market through mobile devices , but first let 's think about why we would market through mobile . <p> Consumers are now spending 51% of their time on a mobile device and only 42% on a computer . This means your target audience has a better chance of seeing your ad on their mobile device rather than their computer . <p> People are still using a computer 91% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so on their mobile phones , but the rate mobile phone usage is increasing is astounding . <p> It also benefits marketers to use mobile marketing because of the convenience of mobile devices , the direct connection it provides , and how we are able to reach the consumer right when and where they need to be reached to be the most responsive to your message . <p> CRAFTING YOUR MOBILE MARKETING STRATEGY <p> Now that we know why mobile marketing is so important , let 's look at strategy . Your mobile marketing strategy should vary because of how , when , where and why the consumer is viewing the message . <p> Mobile marketing includes creating ads and messages that are easily viewed on mobile devices such as text messages , video messages , app advertising , mobile constructed email marketing and social media posts and advertisements . <p> Mobile marketing should be another piece to your online marketing strategy and sometimes there will be a need to create separate messaging strictly for mobile audiences . <p> One of the major conveniences for using mobile marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Maybe your brand is national , but you 'll still need specific local messaging for mobile users . <p> Consider if you 're out to dinner and you go to leave only to find out you left your lights on and your car battery is dead . <p> If you 're a store that carries car batteries and you 're within walking distance of that consumer , you 're more likely to get the sale because of your proximity and the consumer 's need for immediate action . <p> Consider the reasons your audience could benefit from knowing about your business when they are likely to use their mobile device , keeping in mind - your current marketing strategy and goals , and this will lead to your mobile marketing strategy . <p> MOBILE MARKETING TIPS <p> The messaging should be condensed down to the most pertinent information because the screen is much smaller than a computer . You want the reader to be able to get the jist of the message without taking any or much action . That 's when you 'll lose them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience to be able to clearly see all your information in a pleasing and concise view no matter what device they are viewing your website from .. If it 's difficult , again they might return to their search and choose another business . <p> Keep in mind the vertical view of most mobile devices . Create single column , short content with finger-tapping-size call to action buttons . <p> Make sure your website is listed in your local markets with easy to find contact info . Most mobile viewers are looking for you on the go . <p> Put a lot of thought in mobile apps . Either using them to place ads for your audiences or creating one for your business . Be careful that this makes sense for your business and it 's the right time because it could backfire quickly . <p> By continuing your online marketing strategy with mobile marketing , you 'll reach real time audiences that are most likely ready to make a purchase , upping your conversion rate and loyal customer base , and that 's all you really need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts ?

I knew that the rest of the Pacific Rim would be affected by this event and that my mother and other extended family , living in Hawaii , was in harm 's way .

Export all campaign information and creatives from Cake . If you have a technical crew within your organization , you can use LinkTrust API 's to import the campaign and creative information into LinkTrust . If you do not have technical resources to use LinkTrust API 's , each campaign can be manually created in LinkTrust . LinkTrust may have resources to assist in this process and an hourly fee may be applicable . You may also consider moving campaigns over a few at a time rather than all at once . 3 .

Note : Do not have your advertisers remove the old Cake pixel yet ! Wait until after your Cake account is closed . 5 . If you imported your Cake Affiliate IDs into LinkTrust with each affiliate , you can then place the appropriate LinkTrust click link into each campaign within Cake . This way , Cake traffic will begin redirecting through your LinkTrust campaigns and then on to your advertise 's landing pages . Once these are in place , LinkTrust will begin tracking clicks and sales at the same time as your Cake account . Note : when placing the LinkTrust click link into each Cake campaign as the landing page URL , ensure that the Cake affiliate I 'd is automatically appended to the LinkTrust click link as &amp;AltID=CakeID. 6 .

Other things to consider are customizing your Affiliate Center and getting LinkTrust training for your team . Frequently Asked Questions : 1 . Can my affiliates/publishers continue to use the same links from my Cake account ? Only while your Cake account is active .

Here are just a few of the best . <h> Increase reach <p> The main reason that you should consider an affiliate program for your product is simply that it will increase your reach as you promote your product . Whether your product offering is big or small , you always have room to increase your reach and have your offer seen by more people . Pretty much every topic has other blogs , sites , forums , and individuals interacting on social media . An affiliate program creates incentive for these sites and individuals to promote your product . <p> Of course , not everyone will be motivated by an affiliate commission ( some bloggers do n't use them at all ) , but you will find that some are definitely moved by them and those people could open up a considerably larger audience for you . <h> Gain new customers <p> Affiliate programs help you grow your list of customers .

A $10 sale from an ebook could end up leading to five more $10 sales in the coming year " or it could end up generating a $200 sale if you launch larger products down the road . <h> Manage advertising costs <p> Affiliate marketing is performance-based advertising , so you only pay a commission when a sale is made . The amount to pay out is based upon the performance of each affiliate or traffic source . So , as long as you set your margins properly , you can make money with one sale or a million and never go over your marketing budget or waste money on un-trackable marketing campaigns . <h> Why starting an affiliate program might not be right for you <p> It 's important to note that having an affiliate program is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs to consider along with the opportunities they open up . <h> May lower margins <p> Let 's start with the most obvious cost " affiliate programs eat into your profit margin . When someone recommends your product they bring in new business , but you share the benefit of that business with the affiliate . A $20 flashlight sale effectively becomes a $10 sale if you share a 50% commission . For some merchants this is a stumbling block , and not something that they want to do ( I 'll speak more about it below ) . Of course , the argument can be made that you are also saving the marketing costs associated with advertising the product yourself . Plus , you are only paying this cost when the product actually sells , and not paying for marketing that does n't produce revenue . So , it 's quite understandable to pay more for the guaranteed sale of each product . <h> It takes time <p> One of the big hidden costs of an affiliate program is the time that it can take to manage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are some extra logistical tasks that you might find yourself doing when you introduce affiliates into your strategy . These include paying them ( depending upon the system you use ) , providing them with sales material , motivating them , helping those who have limited technical knowledge to set up links , and so on . You will find that some affiliates need a bit more hand-holding than others " and some can be quite high maintenance ! LinkTrust 's affiliate management solution will definitely streamline your activities and save you lots of time ! <h> Some loss of control <p> Another hidden cost of affiliate programs is that you lose a little control over the way your product is promoted . Not everyone will promote it in the same way you do . This can be a problem " particularly if affiliates use hype and build products up to be better than they actually are in order to get sales . In doing so they create false expectations in buyers that the owner of the product will need to then manage . Having affiliates agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent this problem . <h> How much should you pay affiliates ? <p> This is one of the most common questions asked by people new to affiliate marketing , but of course there are no real wrong or right answers . You 'll want to consider a number of factors : <h> Price of product <p> It 's not just the percentage of commission that is important , but also the price of the product . For example , 50% of a $5 product is certainly not as attractive as 50% of a $100 product . There may not be a lot you can do about this , but it will be a factor for those considering promoting your product . <h> Size of the untapped market <p> If you 're just starting out and do n't yet have much of an audience of your own , you might want to consider a higher commission . This will give a greater incentive to affiliates to work for you to get things going . However , if you have a large audience of people who trust you already , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your product successful . <h> Future product releases <p> Some people use affiliate programs more as lead generators than anything else . Many people offer affiliates 100% of sales to give them a big incentive to promote the product . The hope is that , while the affiliate is the only person to make money from the initial promotion , the sales will generate a list of buyers to which the product owner can promote future products . <h> Tiered commissions <p> One strategy that some product producers use is to offer bigger affiliates a higher percentage than smaller affiliates . In this way , they increase the incentive for those who have larger audiences . You 'll want software like LinkTrust to implement and manage a tiered commission structure . <h> Physical vs virtual products ( and other overheads ) <p> Many information products offer affiliates 40-50% commissions . This is in part because there are limited overheads on virtual products . To sell a $20 ebook only really costs me a few cents for hosting and bandwidth , and a small amount in PayPal and shopping cart fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , a physical product will have a much smaller profit margin . I have one friend who has an online camera store , and he 's only able to offer his affiliates 4% commissions , because his own profit margin is n't high . <h> Consider your expenses carefully <p> Even if you 're selling virtual products , keep all of your expenses in mind . I had an interaction with an ebook seller recently who did n't realize what the PayPal fees would be on his $5 ebooks . He offered affiliates 60% commissions on the sale price and , once he took out PayPal fees and his design and proofreading costs , he realized he was n't really making more than a few cents per ebook . <h> Why I pay 40% commissions instead of 10% <p> Are you concerned that commissions will eat into your profits ? If you are struggling to justify why you should pay more to someone else for simply promoting your product when you did all the work to make it , then read on . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy for paying higher commissions on your products ( Iike paying 40% ) is that any new customer that an affiliate brings in is a customer you probably never would have had otherwise . So earning 60% ( or $12 on a $20 ebook ) is $12 more than you would have had in your pocket than if you had n't had an affiliate promoting your product . <p> Take into account the fact that that person buying your product might also buy future products from you . They may also recommend your products to their friends and may become a regular customer . So the initial $12 profit could end up being considerably more with time .

For example , a tracking URL follows the following format : <p> An affiliate uses a third party tracking system that generates a system value called a tracking I 'd or click I 'd . The system value may be 10 to 12 characters long . This value is unique , because the affiliate 's system never generates a duplicate tracking I 'd . The affiliate uses the tracking I 'd to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Each time a consumer clicks on the affiliate 's tracking URL and is redirected to the affiliate 's system , the third party tracking system generates a unique tracking I 'd . <p> The affiliate sends the tracking I 'd number to a LinkTrust partner using the affiliate reference I 'd parameter . <p> When a consumer selects the tracking URL , LinkTrust captures it .

@@23491636 @3491636/ <p> The Link Generator page allows you to create links between campaigns and affiliates . On this help page , you learn about the following : <p> Link Criteria <p> How to Create a Link <h> Link Criteria <p> The following is the criteria you need to create a link : <p> Campaign <p> Affiliate <p> Creative ( ADID ) <p> Force Approval <p> Force Affiliate Payout <p> Force Advertiser Payout <p> Sub I 'd ( SID ) <p> Affiliate Reference I 'd <p> Additional Data <p> Advanced Options <h> Campaign ( CID ) <p> A- campaign- is a set of advertisement messages that share a single idea and theme that make up an integrated marketing communication ( IMC ) . <h> Affiliate ( AFID ) <p> An- affiliate- is a company or person that takes your offer and your creatives found in LinkTrust and distributes them to either their affiliates ( your sub-affiliates ) or the general public increasing the market reach of that offer . <h> Creative ( ADID ) <p> ADID- is the parameter used to track the performance of creatives . The ADID parameter is placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tracking URL in order for the tracking URL to work . If the ADID parameter is omitted from the tracking URL , the Creative report will show a 0 value for all the tracking links missing the ADID parameter . <h> Force Approval ( A ) <p> Force approval- is a custom conversion parameter that allows the advertiser to use the confirmation pixel to dynamically send transaction approval information to the LinkTrust system . The transaction approval can be posted in through the advertiser using a parameter named A followed by the equal sign ( = ) and a value . The A for approval is not case sensitive . <h> Force Affiliate Payout ( AP ) <p> Force affiliate payout- is a custom conversion parameter that allows the advertiser to use the confirmation pixel to dynamically send affiliate payout information to the LinkTrust system . The affiliate payout can be sent in by the advertiser using a parameter named AP followed by the equal sign ( = ) and a numerical value . <h> Force Advertiser Payout ( MP ) <p> Force advertiser payout- is a custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixel to dynamically send the advertiser payout information to the LinkTrust system . The advertiser payout can be sent in by the advertiser using a parameter named MP followed by the equal sign ( = ) and a numerical value . <h> Sub I 'd ( SID ) <p> A sub I 'd is a common identifier used to differentiate traffic from affiliates . Generally , sub IDs are numbers and letters or something that designates an affiliate or sub affiliate . Because traffic types are redundant , the sub I 'd value is repetitive . This allows you to use sub I 'd reporting to identify which sub I 'd is performing the best . It is common practice for affiliates to place a sub I 'd on a tracking link . <h> Affiliate Reference I 'd ( AffiliateReferenceID ) <p> The affiliate reference I 'd is a parameter that carries a unique value designated by an affiliate . The purpose of the affiliate reference I 'd is to pass information from the affiliate to LinkTrust and then back to the affiliate . The maximum number of characters allowed is 255 . <h> Additional Data <p> Additional data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URL using a parameter name=value pair . The affiliate can use any name and value . LinkTrust takes the parameter name used by the affiliate and creates a token to match the parameter . The value of the parameter is placed into the token . This is called tokenizing the value . The token allows you to pass information through LinkTrust to the advertiser and back to the affiliate . <p> If you want to send additional data to a advertiser 's landing page , the name of the beginning parameter must match the advertiser 's website form , so that the value is dynamically placed in the correct field . <p> For example , the advertiser has a website with form fields for a consumer 's first name , last name , and email address . The affiliate also has a website with a form that has already captured the consumer 's first name , last name , and email address . The affiliate sends the consumer 's information to LinkTrust and then on to the advertiser 's page . When the consumer lands on the advertiser 's page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . This happens because the affiliate appended the first name , last name , and email address parameters to the URL and passes the values to the into LinkTrust . This saves the consumer time having to re-enter the information twice . <p> Basically , by using additional data parameters and values , the affiliate can populate the advertiser 's website with the consumer information it has already collected . <h> Redirect to Landing Page <h> Write Cookie to Browser <p> Disabling- Write Cookie to Browser , adds C=0 parameter to the tracking URL. - This prevents a- Cookie- from being written to the consumer 's browser . <h> Track Clicks <p> Disabling- Track Click , adds T=0 parameter to the tracking URL. - This prevents LinkTrust from tracking a- Click- in the system . - If a click is not tracked , no click I 'd is created and therefore , no conversion can be tracked from a click which was not tracked . <h> Save Cookie <h> This feature is not enabled in the User Interface ( UI ) . - When adding Savecookie=x to the confirmation pixel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful transactions . <h> - <h> Tracking Link Settings <p> This option allows you to choose the domain you want to use from a list of tracking domains configured for your account . <h> Additional Domain <p> Select the domain you wish to use for your affiliate 's tracking link by selecting the pre-configured domain configured within your account . <p> In addition , you may select- Use Secure URL ( HTTPS ) - to add the ' s ' to the http. - I.e. Before - http : //www , After - https : //www. <h> - <h> Tracking Link and Pixels <p> After you select Generate Links at the bottom of the Link Criteria section , the Tracking Link and Pixels section displays . This section displays the following : <p> Tracking link <p> Impression pixel <p> JavaScript confirmation pixel <p> Image confirmation pixel <p> Click I 'd pixel post confirmation pixel <p> AFID pixel post confirmation pixel <h> Send Email <p> To generate emails , you must select Generate Emails at the bottom of the Tracking Link and Pixels section . Then the Send Email section will display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following : <p> Send an affiliate the impression link and tracking link in an email <p> Send a advertiser the confirmation pixel in an email <p> From the Send Email section , you can modify the From , To , Subject , and Body fields of the email .

Potential audiences wo n't necessarily see your company info , but your brand will also be attached to this unethical process . This is strictly forbidden by honest affiliate networks . <h> Copycat Sites &amp; Traffic Diverting These clever culprit fraudsters divert traffic from the honest hard working affiliate and send them to the fake affiliate site- so that real affiliates do n't receive their compensation and eventually quit network programs , while merchants lose their niche markets provided by those hard working affiliates . <h> Containing the Culprit <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now equipped to deal with them and avoid their antics , saving merchants and the good affiliate companies .

Though the number of hives you can keep and the placement and registration all differ depending on where you live , two LinkTrust employees have found bee keeping to be a hugely rewarding new hobby . <p> " Were working towards being prepared for emergencies and being self-sufficient , so we 've been reading about all the different things you can do to prepare , " said Darren Smith , LinkTrust designer .

Some more painful than others . <p> For example , bee keeping suits are white because the bees seem to be less intimidated and largely ignore the lightly colored suit . In fact , the bees ignore him while in his suit but will chase his black chickens around the yard . ( Yes , both Gavin and Darren also have chickens in their backyard . ) <p> A big part of bee keeping is keeping the hive clean and organized , but that means you have to get into the hives while the bees are coming in and out and you have to do so carefully . <p> " A bee never wants to sting you , they die if they do , but its their natural reaction to getting pressed too hard or a little bit squished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning out their hive , " said Grow . " They really do avoid it as much as possible and so do I so it does n't  happen that regularly . " <p> Both Gavin and Darren have found the effort to become more self-reliant to be entertaining and educational . Because they bring honey in to the office to share , the rest of the LinkTrust team has also enjoyed their efforts and cant wait to see what they try next !

@@23491669 @3491669/ <p> Earnings per Click ( EPC ) is a mathematical formula used to determine the commissions earned per click in online advertising .

This article will help you understand how Google works and how its affecting your business . <p> All About the Mobile First Web <p> Google has become all about the mobile first web . What exactly that means is that we should be designing our websites and online presence with mobile viewers in mind . Around a month ago , Google released an official announcement that you could be penalized if your website is not optimized for mobile . <p> Think that 's drastic ? Consider this . There are five times the number of smartphones as laptops or desktops in the world . Mobile devices account for over half of the internet usage in the U.S. and users spend 60% of their time on a mobile device rather than a desktop or laptop . 70% of mobile searches convert to actions on a website. 61% of the population expressed that their view of a brand with a mobile site was better than a brand without a mobile optimized site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62%. 40% of mobile searchers have the intention to purchase within their local region . 70% of mobile users will delete an email that does n't show well on mobile devices without even reading the email .

These statistics show us the users want mobile responsive . And Google intends to deliver . <p> Location , Location , Location <p> We have all been told how important location is to a business , but how important could it be to the online world ? The answer is incredibly important . The most sought after information on the web by local searchers is the location , address , and phone number of a business . 50% of mobile searches will visit a brick and mortar store within one day of visiting their online site , meaning when people search on their mobile devices , their intent to purchase is high .

( source : Search Engine Land ) <p> Google 's Autocomplete <p> We can all remember a time we were typing something into the search bar and got distracted by a list of Google 's autocomplete suggestions . So how does Google come up with their suggestions or predictions ? It 's all based on how the keyword you 're entering has been previously search for and then Google will predict , based on what 's popular , what you are likely looking for . Language and location both play a very important role in what Google will predict . Then Google ranks those suggestions . They will include a prior search you 've inputted first even if that search topic is n't the most popular or highest ranking . So it will basically customize your search predictions .

@@23491678 @3491678/ <h> Then and Now of Affiliate Marketing <p> If you can believe it affiliate marketing actually has its founding when computers looked like miniature TVs and had the simple black screen and green cursor . Twenty-seven years later and we 're still using this technique to reach multitudes of audiences and increase sales by paying out a commission to sites that refer business . But the game has changed . What does the then and now of affiliate marketing look like ? <p> A Brief History <p> Prodigy Online Services was formed in 1984 as a hub for subscribers to get access to news , email , network services , banking , weather , shopping , games , polls , etc . William Tobin who owned PC Flowers and Gifts paid a commission to Prodigy beginning in 1989 to refer subscribers to his shop . In 1993 , PC Flowers was generating more than 6 million dollars for Prodigy every year . And thus , affiliate marketing was born . <p> The Amazon Effect <p> Amazon changed the game around 1996 by offering their associate program where others could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of sales , books , music , and so on . But as affiliate programs began to bloom , Amazon 's associate program began to shape the affiliate industry into what it has become . <p> Today 's Affiliate Marketing <p> Affiliate programs such as Amazon and eBay continue to thrive as mainstream affiliate income marketing , but affiliate marketing has also grown to include online business and blogger revenues . <p> Technology has changed the way we campaign in affiliate marketing . Simply put , we 're more intelligent about our web traffic , website viewers , and conversion data . This is not to say prior affiliate marketing was n't intelligent , but the amount of insight we now have , has changed what we know , therefore changing where we use our budget and channel our efforts . <p> Informative Statistics and Newer Platforms <p> Thanks to innovative advances we now have access to which links refer a visitor , the amount of time spent on a webpage , the journey an online customer went through and the final outcome and more . With this data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective . <p> But the changes continue to charge ahead with the advances of Google Analytics , Google Adwords , LinkShare , Commission Junction and more . These networks offer different ways of affiliate marketing based on what the merchant is trying to accomplish . This is leaps and bounds from where affiliate marketing starting with simply posting info on a subscriber website and getting a commission off a sale . <p> Looking Forward <p> Affiliate marketing will continue to grow and so we must be prepared to look ahead . By now we all know we must market to our niche audience . Meaning we probably wo n't get much out of using an affiliate site that targets gamers when trying to sell baking products . But it 's the depth of that niche that will set us apart and we find it with the intelligence we mentioned in the above section . <p> Our insights on consumer behavior will also continue to develop as we learn about our consumers ' buying habits . It is also important for affiliate marketing to stay on top of technology . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on affiliate marketing and one thing is for sure . History will always repeat itself . <p> Stay on top of trends , insights and more with LinkTrust affiliate marketing intelligence software ! 
@@23491679 @3491679/ <p> The Campaign Settings page identifies campaign information for both CPC and CPA/CPL campaigns . <h> Tracking Method <p> The tracking method is the methodology and technology used in a campaign for tracking . A pixel tracking campaign allows you to track conversions using a pixel code on the confirmation page . A lead capture campaign allows you to capture lead data . The tracking is calculated from the data captured . Lead capture campaigns require a Network Plus License and are available in LinkTrust 5.7 only . <p> The following are tracking methods : <p> CPC - Cost per click through <p> CPA/CPL - Cost per lead ( lead usually meaning a free registration ) <p> If CPA/CPL is selected , the campaign will track when a tracking pixel is fired on the confirmation page or a server-side post is emitted or called . <h> Basic Information <p> The Basic Information section contains the following general information specific to the campaign : <p> Field <p> Do the following : <p> CID <p> The campaign I 'd ( CID ) is a unique number given to each advertising campaign created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the campaign in the Partner Center . <p> Category <p> A category is a specifically defined division in a system of classification . You can assign your campaign to a category to improve your searching and reporting in the Partner Center and Affiliate Center . <p> Group <p> The group is the name of the campaign group that the campaign belongs to in the Partner Center . <p> Type <p> The campaign type identifies the type of advertising campaign being deployed . A campaign type can be any of the following : <p> CPC - Cost per click <p> CPA/CPL - Cost per acquisition or sale/Cost per lead completed <p> Status <p> Campaign status shows the current state of a campaign . You can control the current state of a campaign in the Partner Center and Affiliate Center .

They provide the products and services to be sold . <p> Revenue per Transaction <p> The revenue per transaction is the amount of money earned from a advertiser for each transaction . <p> Advertised Affiliate Payout <p> The advertised affiliate payout is the default amount paid to affiliates . This usually is the lowest payout possible , because individual affiliate payouts can be configured to override this amount . <p> Note : Changes made to affiliate payouts take effect the beginning of the next business day . Changes applied to today adjust all the payouts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> To Auto-Approve transactions for all affiliates , mark Auto-Approve transactions X% of the time . By default 100% of the transaction will be approved for affiliate commissions . If you have an agreed scrub in place , you can apply this scrub by reducing the approved percentage . This percent is applied to all transactions for a give 24 hour period . <p> Zero Revenue for Transactions <p> This feature allows you to set the revenue for a transaction that is qualified but not approved . This will help make your accounting more accurate for transactions that you are not paid for if they are not approved . <p> Campaign Manager <p> A campaign manager is the individual who oversees the implementation and management of an advertising campaign . Only an administrator can assign an existing campaign to a campaign manager . <h> Expiration Information <p> In the Expiration Information section , you can enter a campaign start date , campaign end date , and redirection to another campaign or URL if this campaign has expired . <h> Start Date <p> In the Start Date field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> End Date <p> In the End Date field , enter the end date of the campaign using the Calendar . <p> When an offer is about to expire , it is important to place an expiration date in the campaign settings . After a date has been selected , the campaign expires at midnight of the day you selected . <p> For example , if you want your offer to expire on August 19 , 2012 , you must set the expiration date to Aug 18 , 2012 , so that the affiliate 's tracking links stop working at 12:00 AM on Aug 19 , 2012 . If you set the expiration date to Aug 19 , 2012 , the offer will expire on Aug 20 , 2012 at 12:00 AM . <p> After the campaign expires , you can redirect all traffic by utilizing the Expired Redirect drop-down menu . <h> Expired Redirect <p> After a campaign expires , you can select one of the following three options to handle expired redirect traffic that may still be coming through : <p> None <p> Selecting None causes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Selecting Campaign allows you to redirect the expired traffic to another campaign within your account . <p> Note : If this expired traffic converts in the new campaign , LinkTrust will not credit the affiliate with the conversion . The affiliate will not see the conversion . If you wish to give credit for the conversion on this expired traffic , you must approve the affiliate for the converting campaign . <p> URL <p> Selecting URL gives you the option to redirect the consumer to another web page through a URL . <p> Redirect.com <p> This option allows you to redirect your expired clicks that you are not able to monetize from your own efforts . - LinkTrust has partnered with Redirect.com and traffic will be redirected to offers at Redirect.com . You may receive a credit towards your account fees for your traffic based upon sales results from your clicks to Redirect.com . <h> Campaign URLs <p> The Campaign URLs section allows you to manage the landing page URL , cookie life , unassigned affiliate traffic , and the propagation of additional traffic . <h> Landing Page URL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website provided by a advertiser for the purpose of generating conversions . It is the website that the consumer goes to . <h> Tokens <p> Landing page tokens can be added to the landing page URL to allow you to pass data to the advertiser 's landing page . The landing page is the advertiser 's website for consumers . It is the first page a customer sees in the process of making a sale . The landing page URL is the URL of the website provided by a advertiser for the purpose of generating conversions . <p> The following tokens can be added to the landing page URL : <p> Campaign I 'd : =CID= <p> Affiliate I 'd : =AFID= <p> Creative I 'd : =ADID= <p> Sub I 'd : =SID= <p> Click I 'd : =ClickID= <p> Affiliate Reference I 'd : =AffiliateReferenceID= <p> Alternate I 'd : =AltID= <p> Non-Encoded URL for dynamic landing pages : =NonEncodedURL= <p> Additional Data : =Field Name= <p> Merchant Reference ID(s)* : - =MerchantReferenceIDs= <p> *Merchant Reference ID(s) <p> - Each channel has the ability to capture a Merchant Reference I 'd . - You can combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Success page by placing the Merchant ReferenceID(s) token on the success URL. - If you have more than one Merchant Reference I 'd being passed tot he success page , the values will be passed in a comma seperated format . - i.e. LONG ... <h> Cookie Life <p> The cookie life is the length of time before a cookie expires on a computer , rendering it invalid . For popular high traffic offers shared by other networks , a shorter cookie life span is suggested to help prevent false positive conversions from tracking because other networks have sent a consumer to the advertiser 's site during the time that your campaign 's cookie was still valid . If tracking by click I 'd , the cookie life span dictates the length of time that the click I 'd is valid . Cookie life is part of a CPA/CPL campaign only . <h> Allow Unassigned Affiliate Traffic to the Landing Page <p> Unassigned affiliate traffic is any affiliate who does not have a campaign assigned to their account . An unassigned affiliate is not authorized to run traffic to a campaign . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LinkTrust to gather the additional data that was added to the tracking link and add it to the redirected campaign or URL . <p> If you want additional data on the tracking link to be added to the URL of an alternate location , enable Propagate Additional Data . <p> If you want to block any additional data from being added to the URL of an alternate location , disable Propagate Additional Data . <h> Hide Affiliate Referrers <p> This eliminates the page referrers prior to sending the traffic to the advertiser . - If LinkTrust is unable to remove the page referrer , the consumer is redirected to a page that has a link that says " Click to Continue " . - This will allow the page referrer to finally get removed . - Note : Less than 0.5% will make it to this step in the process of removing the page referrer. - <p> The Hide Referrer feature relies on removing something from the consumer 's browser. - To do this , the browser info must be purged , but this is different depending on the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we attempt to purge the referrer in 4 steps. - After each step , we check to see if it purged. - If it did , we send the consumer on their way to your landing page. - If they get through the first three steps and we can not purge the referrer , the system is set to send the consumer to a page which causes them to click a link . - The physical act of clicking this link should cause the referrer to finally be purged. - However , this does stop the redirect until the consumer clicks the link. - They may decide to abandon the offer instead of click the link . <h> Additional Landing Page <h> Adding additional landing pages to a campaign accommodates the need to facilitate the ability to redirect consumers to specific landing pages based on an : <p> Individual Affiliate <p> Affiliate Group <p> Any series of sub I 'd 's <p> Any series of creatives <p> Any series of consumer 's user agent <p> Because this feature can be configured in such detail , it 's possible for traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsers , and other consumer attributes along with affiliate attributes . - <p> The priority order in which landing pages are selected can also be set . - If all additional landing pages are not able to redirect the traffic based on their rules , the traffic is then send to the default landing page URL . <p> - Steps to adding an Additional Landing Page : <p> Enter Name <p> Enter URL <p> Propagate Additional Data <p> Rules ( All rules must be true to redirect to landing page . ) <p> Select or Add Affiliate Group or AFID(s) . <p> Add SID or Sub I 'd . <p> Add ADID or Creative I 'd . <p> Select User Agent <p> Contains <p> Does Not Contain <p> Add User Agent information <p> Select Add to save settings. - <h> Conversion Tracking Options <p> The Conversion Tracking Options section allows you to add tracking options to your campaign in a CPA/CPL campaign only . There are two types of tracking options . <p> Standard Tracking <p> Mobile Tracking <h> Standard Tracking <p> Standard tracking consists of the following tracking options : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ClickID Pixel Post is created by adding the click I 'd to the tracking URL . This method is considered very secure , because a transaction can be generated on by using a click I 'd . A click I 'd can only be used once and within the time frame of the configured cookie life . This helps prevent fraud . The following is an example of a pixel URL with the added click I 'd : <p> An affiliate I 'd pixel post is created be adding the affiliate I 'd ( AFID ) to the tracking URL . This method is not considered secure , because a transaction can be generated simply by knowing the campaign and affiliate I 'd leaving the affiliate I 'd pixel post method open to fraud . The following is an example of a pixel URL with the added affiliate I 'd : <p> LONG ... <p> Enable Pay-Per-Call Integration <p> The LinkTrust pay-per-call service allows you to create , track , and manage call-based campaigns . For more information , see Pay-Per-Call . <p> Allow Cookie Tracking <p> A cookie is a simple piece of data that is unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tracked when they visit various sites . <p> Allows Cookieless Tracking ( IP Backup ) <p> Cookieless tracking is a feature that can increase your tracking accuracy by approximately 5-10% . By default , this feature is enabled . - If this feature is disabled , - a Advertiser may- report higher sales conversions then appear in LinkTrust and consecuently to an Affiliate <p> Restrict Postbacks to White Listed IPs <p> Restrict Postbacks to White Listed IPs is a security feature that locks down the ability to post transactions into your account unless they originate from the IP addresses you listed in the IP White List . In order for this feature to use the white list functionality , you must add the known IP addresses , posting in the transaction , to the While List field on the Domains / IPs page . This feature works for all ServerSide Postbacks ( ClickID and AFID ) and Mobile Tracking . . <p> In the IP Address White List field , enter the IP addresses you wish to allow . <p> Note : Enter each IP address on a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversion Parameters <p> Custom conversion parameters are parameters that allow the advertiser to dynamically send the affiliate payout , advertiser payout , and transaction approval information to LinkTrust on the confirmation pixel . <p> These parameters allow you to add specific values to a confirmation pixel that modify the transaction and allow for customized conversions . Below are the parameters and values that can be added to the confirmation pixel of a flat rate ( non-percent ) based campaign . <p> Affiliate payout <p> You can set the affiliate payout by putting &amp;AP=0.00 on the query string in a confirmation pixel . The affiliate payment parameter is not case sensitive and should not contain a dollar sign ( $ ) ; for example , &amp;AP=4.99 or &amp;AP=4.99 . You must use a decimal for cents ; for example , &amp;AP=4.25 would be interpreted as $4.25 while &amp;AP=425 would be $425.00 . <p> Advertiser payout <p> You can set the advertiser revenue by putting &amp;mp=0.00 on the query string in a confirmation pixel . The advertiser payment parameter is not case sensitive and should not contain a dollar sign ( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must use a decimal for cents ; for example , &amp;MP=4.25 would be interpreted as $4.25 while &amp;MP=425 would be $425.00 . <p> Transaction approval <p> You can set whether or not the transaction is approved by putting &amp;A=Y or &amp;A=N on the query string in a confirmation pixel . Since LinkTrust only looks at the first letter of this parameter , you can cloak the value in the confirmation pixel by adding additional letters , as shown below . <p> To approve a transaction , all of the following can be used : <p> The first letter is Y or y ( e.g. , &amp;a=y , &amp;A=Y , &amp;A=Yes , &amp;a=yahoo ) <p> The first letter is T or t ( e.g. , &amp;a=t , &amp;A=T , &amp;a=true , &amp;A=Telephone ) <p> The first value is 1 ( e.g. , &amp;a=1 , &amp;A=1 , &amp;a=1234 , &amp;A=1abc ) <p> To unapprove a transaction , all of the following can be used : <p> The first letter is N or n ( e.g. , &amp;a=n , &amp;A=N , &amp;a=night ) <p> The first letter is F or f ( e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The first value is 0 ( e.g. , &amp;a=0 , &amp;A=0 , a=0123 , A=0abc ) <p> To enable any of the custom conversion parameters for a campaign , do the following : <p> If Allow Custom Conversions Parameters is not marked , LinkTrust does not recognize any of the parameters on the confirmation pixel . <h> Mobile Tracking <p> Mobile tracking allows a client to track the installs of a mobile application by passing the device I 'd and the device IP address to LinkTrust . <p> What is a Device I 'd ? <p> A device I 'd can be the following : <p> IMEI numbers that come in a 17-digit or 15-digit sequences . The current IMEI format used is AA-BBBBBB-CCCCCC-D . <p> An MEID is 56 bits long ( 14 hex digits ) . It consists of the following three fields : an 8-bit regional code ( RR ) , a 24-bit manufacturer code , and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number . <p> ESNs are often represented as 11-digit decimal numbers or 8-digit hexadecimal numbers . <p> CDMA-based standards do not include any removable card , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handset itself. - <p> If a campaign is set to mobile app install tracking , then conversions are tracked in one of the following ways : <p> If a DeviceID parameter is passed to the conversion pixel , it is looked up to determine the corresponding click. - The campaign I 'd must also be passed to the conversion pixel because the device I 'd is tracked on a per campaign basis. - <p> If no click with a matching device I 'd is found for the campaign or one is not passed to the conversion pixel , the IP address is looked up. - If no click can be found for the IP address , then no conversion is tracked. - It is possible when doing mobile app install tracking to pass an IP address into the system using the DeviceIP parameter. - If it contains a valid IP address , that IP address is used to find a click rather than the IP address that is actually connecting to LinkTrust . <h> Tracking Process <p> In the Tracking Process section , you see a visual representation of both the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Process <p> The standard tracking process , the tracking URL sends the customer to the landing page URL . From the landing page , the customer goes to the confirmation page where either a client-side pixel is fired or a server-side pixel post is executed or called . <p> The CPC tracking process follows a different model . Cost per click ( CPC ) or Pay per click is an Internet advertising model used on search engines , advertising networks , and content websites , such as blogs , where advertisers only pay when a user actually clicks on an advertisement to visit the advertiser website . Content websites commonly charge a fixed price for a click rather than use a bidding mechanism . <h> Mobile Tracking Process <p> On the conversion when Pixel.track with Mobile Tracking is enabled for a campaign , the one of the following occurs : <p> BEST METHOD : Device I 'd and IP <p> Using the device I 'd and IP address is the most accurate way to track mobile application installs as long as the device I 'd is also appended to the click URL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conversion URL to track and record conversions . Both parameters appear in the Conversion Additional Data column of the Transaction Details page . <p> If a device I 'd and device IP address are both appended to the conversion URL , lookup the click I 'd by matching the device I 'd in the Device ID/IP table. - If it is not found , perform a search using the device IP. - If neither can be found , use standard cookie/IP backup tracking . <p> Note : All other URL conversion parameters function normally . For example : If cookie=x appears on the URL , do not expire the click I 'd . <p> The following is an example of the conversion URL with Device I 'd &amp; Device IP : <p> Many times , a device I 'd can not be appended to a tracking link by affiliates . But if the device I 'd is known on the conversion , the conversion URL should contain it . <p> If only a Device I 'd is appended to the conversion URL , search for the click I 'd by matching the device I 'd in the Device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search using the conversion IP address matched to the device IP address. - If it is still not found , use standard cookie/IP backup tracking . <p> Note : All other URL conversion parameters function normally . For example : If cookie=x appears on the URL , do not expire the click I 'd . <p> The following is an example of the conversion URL with device I 'd : <p> LONG ... <p> OK METHOD : Device IP Only <p> Sometimes the conversion URL is not loaded from the mobile application on the user 's mobile device , but must be passed from another location like the developer 's server. - In this case , the IP address of the user 's mobile device will be appended to the conversion URL. - Conversions will be recorded by associating the corresponding IP address . If the IP address from the session ( created on click ) does n't match the IP address on conversion , then the conversion will not be recorded . To solve this problem , you can include the user 's mobile IP address on the conversion URL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be recorded. - <p> Note : A device IP appended to the conversion URL always supersedes the IP address from the request . <p> If only a device IP is appended to the conversion URL , lookup the click I 'd by matching the device IP in the Device ID/IP table . If no match is found , use the device IP found in the table or use standard cookie/IP backup tracking. - <p> Note : All other URL conversion parameters function normally. - For example : If cookie=x appears on the URL , do not expire the click I 'd . <p> The following is an example of the conversion URL with device IP : <p> LONG ... <p> LEAST DESIREABLE METHOD : No Device IP or I 'd <p> The system currently works in this way for mobile app download tracking. - This is a last resort in case when no other method of tracking is used . <p> If the device IP address and the device I 'd are not present on the conversion URL , use standard cookie/IP backup tracking . The following is an example of the standard conversion URL :

From the left menu select ' Create a Campaign ' and put in the appropriate information : the campaign name , a category and a status . <p> The testing status indicates a test campaign . Both the public live and private live options are similar in that they allow affiliates to get the creatives and tracking links , however a public live offer let 's affiliates see the campaign in the affiliate center and request the offer , while- a private live status hides it and you get to decide who runs it . A paused campaign is one that is getting ready to expire or might have problems .

@@23491691 @3491691/ <h> LinkTrust SAN Project <p> Im excited to share some details about my latest project at LinkTrust , something we 've been calling the SAN Project . Hopefully this will be the first of many posts on what is going on behind the scenes at LinkTrust . <p> My brain is always thinking about something . About a year ago it started pondering how we store all the data in LinkTrust . At the time we had about a terabyte of data and it was growing fast . I realized we needed to start looking at a new storage solution . <p> The problem for us is n't so much that we have a lot of data . Our problem is we need to access the vast amount of data quickly . Performance and reliability are key to keeping LinkTrust running well for our partners . <p> These considerations lead me to begin looking at a SAN . In a nutshell , a SAN is a big black box full of hard drives that work together . It provides high-performance data storage with a high degree of reliability and redundancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors . We had to separate what the sales people told us from what their products actually do . The importance of this decision meant we had to carefully look at all our options . In the end we decided to go with Compellent . Their product offers some very unique flexibility and optimizations that I felt made it our best choice . <p> Once we decided on a vendor the real work began . There are a myriad of configuration choices to be made when implementing a SAN . I really wanted to make sure we got this right . It was important to me we did n't have any single points of failure . <p> To ensure every piece of the system worked well , we also upgraded our switching fabric to a new set of Juniper switches . I purchased new Cat 6 network cables to ensure we were n't bitten by an old cable starting to give out . The devil is in the details as they say . Every little piece must be considered to ensure success . <p> Whenever we embark on a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It needs to be worth the time effort and money we spend on it . I also do n't want there to be a lot of pain associated with upgrades or changes we make . <p> I work hard and plan meticulously to ensure successful project implementation . With the efforts of my great team we successfully moved our first database to the SAN last week . <p> To ensure success we started relatively small . The database that was moved was selected because it allowed for a seamless move with no visible impact to our partners . At the same time , it had enough load on it we could see a visible benefit when it was moved to the SAN . <p> Even I was surprised to see we were able to index more than 20 million records in a matter of a few seconds with no impact to user performance . This was something our previous infrastructure could n't do . <p> There is still much work to be done . We 've grouped remaining tasks into a series of phases to allow for minimal impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will begin this evening , will require we take the Partner Center , Affiliate Center and Merchant Center offline for about an hour . This is to ensure no changes are made to configuration settings while the move is occurring . <p> This project really started about nine months ago . Looking back it has been a long road . We can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel . We can tangibly see the benefits that this new infrastructure will bring to the LinkTrust system . We 've been able to make the upgrades with minimal impact to our partners . I 'm thrilled to see the success we 've had with this project thus far . I 'm sure I 'll only be more excited by the final outcome . 
@@23491692 @3491692/ <h> January Ticker : Brets Top 10 of 2012 <p> 2012 was a big year for LinkTrust . We made some great improvements to the software , implemented changes internally that have helped us become even more agile and hit a major milestone . <p> It 's hard for me to believe , but it was 10 years ago 2002 when Frank Ouimette and I decided we had to build a tracking system . Originally we only set out to automate some of our job functions , but that simple automation has lead to the creation of the best tracking system available today . <p> To celebrate our 10-year anniversary , we released new features almost every other month . It was hard to choose , but here are my top 10 favorite features from 2012 . <p> 1 . Traffic Caps Report- " This feature provides the insight needed to help our clients quickly make business decisions . The report 's ability to give a snapshot of every caps status means that clients do n't have to dig for hours every day to monitor their affiliate and campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time means better reaction time and greater ROI . <p> 2 . Affiliate Trends Report- " I take special pride in this report because I spent so much time designing it to be useful in helping a manager analyze the traffic trends of their affiliates . This report is our first that gives a forecast or projection based on a track record . I find this very exciting as it serves as a working prototype for how we may be able to anticipate future business for clients in other areas of the system as well . <p> 3 . Tasks " - I love this feature ! - It takes LinkTrust from managing affiliates to the start of helping users manage their day and gives administrators an easy way to monitor their teams work flow and task progress. - This feature is the first step in making LinkTrust the work flow central in the workday . <p> 4 . Additional Landing Pages- " Sometimes I wonder how we went so long without this feature. - Landing page redirection is one of the biggest parts of what LinkTrust does. - This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clients and is the doorway into more mobile feature releases . <p> 5 . Site Optimizer- " Because Landing Page redirection is such a big part of what LinkTrust does , it seems a natural fit to ensure that those landing pages convert. - Adding the Site Optimizer integration for landing pages is a step into providing a more complete solution for marketers. - The more we can give Merchants all the tools they need within a single platform , the more cost effective and productive their time becomes. - I love this feature because it moves LinkTrust into providing a complimentary feature typically reserved for an entirely separate software and provider . <p> 6 . Transaction Details API- " As custom transactional reporting becomes more important to our clients , we can not facilitate getting all the raw transactional data they need into their own back office reports. - This eliminates our clients man hours in researching for fraud and archiving data. - This feature has also opened the door to many 3rd party integrators who provide value add services in the performance marking industry such as CPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing more tools for our clients to become more productive and increase their ROI . <p> 7 . Transaction Modification API- " Automating the editing of transactions is a must have to keep enterprise-level clients happy. - Having this API has increased LinkTrust 's overall ability to integrate with our clients ' back office systems . In addition , having this feature opens up more business with merchants who we previously could not support because of the complexity of their business model . <p> 8 . Automatic Campaign Assignment- " This feature removes the repetitive actions of many clients who want to ensure that certain campaigns are always assigned to affiliates when they signup. - I love providing simple ways to automate tasks that can become overwhelming tasks throughout the day. - This feature shortens the time it takes for an affiliate to start running offers ! <p> 9 . QR Codes- " I really like this feature because it opens LinkTrust up to the ability to provide more offline marketing through mobile devices. - This feature is unique to LinkTrust within the industry . Although to skeptics , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , it 's a fact that they have become pervasive throughout the world. - Allowing Merchants to capitalize on this new technology is critical to our clients being at the leading edge of marketing technology. - I think it 's important to open up as many doors of business opportunity for our clients as possible . <p> 10 . Clone Creatives- " Adding creatives is the single most time consuming process , especially when you have hundreds of them within a single campaign. - Making this process more efficient is a big time saver for clients. - In many cases , campaigns contain similar creatives because the campaign is only distinguished by geographic borders , currency or devices. - Giving customers the ability to copy specific creatives from one campaign to another makes sense. - It also allows clients to create a creative library campaign and then pull creatives as need from that library . <p> These and the other features we released last year have set us up for releases in 2013 that will revolutionize the way LinkTrust users run their businesses . Keep an eye out for big things coming from LinkTrust in 2013.

In a world with electric cars called a Yaris and a fruit named technology that places a random lowercase I in front of all its products , we all need a little decoding from time to time . In this article , we 're going to inform you how to decode the technological world of affiliate marketing . <h> Affiliate Marketing <h> It makes sense , it 's understandable but it makes the brain hurt when putting those words together .

Let 's break it down . Affiliate marketing is an online connection where either you pay another online business to bring you customers or you bring them visitors , which in the end hopefully result in sales. - When done successfully , that 's when the affiliate gets paid . <h> To make this even more- simple let me give a few examples of a couple big wig affiliate companies .

The ad network will do most of the work for you , but they charge a commission , ( sometimes as high as 30% ) for their services . On the other hand , a tracking platform charges a low monthly fee and will usually walk you through a minimal- amount of setup but from there on out , you are in charge of your own company ! You get to make the decisions and watch your revenue grow as your friends , family , and followers enjoy the products of your chosen companies. - <h> Picking a Partnership that Works <h> Before choosing which companies to market , make a list of the products or services that you fully back and that you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to see who- your competitors of similar blogs or websites are using and advertising for .

@@23491710 @3491710/ <h> LinkTrust and EDU : myFootpath <p> We 've talked a big game about LinkTrust and EDU recently from calling it a match made in heaven to offering solutions for some big-time industry changes . Luckily , you do n't  have to take our word for it . To cap off the series our friends from myFootpath are taking you into the trenches and giving you a firsthand view at how the power of LinkTrust is revolutionizing the way EDU marketing works . <p> myFootpath got started in the education industry in 2000 , when CEO JT Allen left Ernst &amp; Young . Together with top guidance counselors , JT produced a software product to help high school students evaluate their options . When that product was sold , the next steps were clear : with the infrastructure , call center and latest technology already in place , myFootpath transitioned into a service that assists for-profit colleges in connecting with prospective students . <p> For the past 6 years , we 've run our own websites , managed social campaigns and purchased transfers from call centers all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different partner sites , but in 2014 , a bold new approach is required . Educational marketers seem to be reaching the same limited pool , and the same data is changing hands again and again . Meanwhile , many prospective students never get the information they need . We plan to change all that , to provide the highest quality information to colleges and to reach more of the people who are looking for the next step on their life paths . <p> We 've decided to break away from traditional methods and fish in a new pool . We 're ramping up a new channel of student inquiries , sourced from pure content producers instead of over-exploited lead-gen outlets . Bloggers , social media influencers , mobile apps , truly career-centered content producers and the like will form the core of our new affiliate network . We 'd rather pay a premium to 100 unexploited bloggers than bring on another oversold jobsite everyone else is already buying from . <p> Enter LinkTrust . Over the past six years , our developers have created sophisticated internal tools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something externally accessible that could provide 3rd party validation and would be simple and efficient for new affiliates . We considered several platforms and tools . Ultimately , LinkTrust had just the right amount of bells and whistles . <p> It was critical for us to have just what we needed without the unnecessary complication of features neither we nor our affiliates would be using . Receiving rapid response from LinkTrust support assisted our development team with wiring up our systems , enabling us to exchange the necessary data to ensure accurate reporting and payment to our affiliate bloggers . Everything about the system has been pretty intuitive , and we love that . It often takes longer to write up a scrum task card than it does to go into the LinkTrust system and actually complete the task . 
@@23491712 @3491712/ <h> Weathering Change in the EDU Industry <p> In the second part of our LinkTrust and Edu Leads series , were dishing out tips for navigating industry change and staying on top . <p> Few verticals can be as lucrative for performance marketers as for-profit education . Targeting millions of non-traditional students that want fast-track career paths with flexibility and easy financing , private sector schools spent more than 4 billion dollars on marketing alone last year . <p> Unfortunately , securing a share of that money is harder than it seems . As schools face unprecedented pressure to clean up their game , many affiliates and lead aggregators find themselves in the cross-hairs . <p> On one hand EDU business has never been better . As the market creeps its way back towards stability , lead generation has experienced a healthy resurgence with schools willing to provide generous incentives to marketers who can attract quality inquiries . Moreover , in the Obamacare age , some argue that consumers will only become more accustomed to submitting web leads and being matched with advertisers and their services . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the industry just as it 's hitting its stride . Pressure to regulate spending and better advocate for consumers particularly call into question the way schools approach their marketing and messaging . <p> So what 's a marketer to do ? In a field with so much promise , packing up and leaving seems out of the question but with stricter standards than ever is it possible to stay on top ? <p> The answer is a resounding yes . By fine-tuning strategy , better focusing attention and investing in the future , marketers establish themselves as respected sources of valid leads and guarantee success . Here are some tips : <p> Focus On Quality : <p> With so much emphasis on turning out job-ready students , schools have no interest in unqualified leads that wont see things through . By filtering student information upon submission , you can make sure the lead is valid before sending it to buyers . This means fewer returned leads . Furthermore , by matching school criteria to the student data in real-time , you can save the schools admission department time by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cement Relationships : <p> What 's that saying about burning bridges ? Particularly in the for-profit education field , a lead aggregators lifeline is their relationship with their buyers , and in this industry , that means the different schools who are looking for students . If a school trusts you with their brand and knows that you send quality students that convert , you can count on a long future with them . If you burn bridges by sending fraudulent leads in hopes of getting a quick buck or misrepresent their school and brand , you 'll quickly run out of places to send your traffic . <p> With the right tools its easy to keep your buyers close . By tracing a prospective students digital fingerprint from landing page to first click and eventual form submission you can keep fraudulent leads under control and ensure images and messaging meet a schools guidelines . <p> Use the Right Tools : <p> The right landing page can mean the difference between 2 new students and 200 . If you 're not already testing out a variety of landing pages , you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with A/B testing and improve the performance of your campaigns . <p> You can ensure you 're getting fresh new leads that havent been sold a million times already thanks to services like LeadID that assign a unique I 'd to consumer lead information , providing you with valuable input about its history and previous sales . <p> Making sure your call centers handle each lead correctly and as quickly as possible also helps increase enrollment and solidify your reputation . Be sure to make sure your call center representatives have the right script to get the student to the right school as quickly as possible . <p> You also need to make sure to find a lead management system that gives you as much insight into your lead generation efforts as possible . With robust reporting in real-time and the ability to effectively manage each individual lead sold , a lead distribution platform like LinkTrust provides you with a powerful command center for all of your campaigns . Whether you 're managing relationships with your buyers or attributing which marketing channel is most effective , the success of your program hinges largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So do n't  sweat the changes , think beyond them .

To enable tracking for your mobile application installs , configure it in the Additional Tracking Options area of the Campaign Details . <h> Promo Code Enforcement <p> Coupon craziness is everywhere , but it has been a challenge for advertisers to transition coupons and promo codes to performance marketing . There has always been an issue with advertisers wanting to protect their own promo codes from affiliate marketing . And affiliates want to have the best possible offer for their traffic . <h> Merchant Revenue by Affiliate <p> When a merchant is willing to pay more for traffic from specific affiliates , the LinkTrust customer can set a custom merchant revenue earned per affiliate by campaign . <h> New Look and Feel <p> Were you getting sick of the Windows ' 98 look of LinkTrust ?

You 'll be seeing more improvements as our development roadmap progresses next year . <p> A few menu names and locations have changed , so be sure to attend the webinar or watch the short help video to ease your transition to the future . One time-saving update we 've made is that you can now access affiliate and campaign specific reports directly from affiliate and campaign details without ever leaving the page . <h> New Fraud Controls <p> With fraudsters finding new ways to wreak their havoc everyday , sometimes performance marketing feels like the Wild West . LinkTrust tracking software continues to improve fraud controls , giving you more security in managing your traffic . In this release we 've included four new ways to help you cut down on fraudulent conversions and clicks . <p> Cookie-less tracking is now more efficient and secure with a white list of IP Addresses for AFID and Click I 'd Postsbacks . This security feature locks down the ability to post transactions into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white list . Locking this down is as simple as checking the option in the Additional Tracking Options in a campaign details . <p> Automatically block traffic coming from known public proxy IP 's . We update the public proxy list daily to prevent fraud and protect the merchant from questionable traffic . The blocked traffic can be redirected to another campaign , a separate landing page or error page of your choice . Enable this rerouting feature on the Campaign Filters page . <p> When click and conversion IPs do n't match , prevent them from being automatically approved transactions . Although there may be cases where the IP 's change and the transaction is legitimate , this feature allows an affiliate manager to review each case before approval <p> Ensure that a Merchant Reference I 'd is required and unique by using the Duplicate Merchant Reference I 'd Filter that prevents conversions from being approved for affiliates when the I 'd provided by the merchant is a duplicate . <h> Default Test Affiliate <p> Just like car companies use crash test dummies to determine the safety of their vehicles , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on new campaigns . There might not be any broken bones if you do n't set up a campaign correctly , but broken links or landing pages are a pain . Avoid the headache that comes from missing images or creatives by sending your traffic to the Test Affiliate before it goes live to your publishers . <p> All traffic you send through the Test Affiliate will be tracked and recorded , but revenue and commissions may be set to zero , eliminating accounting nightmares . You can also disable all click filters on test traffic . <h> Campaign Groups <p> Campaign Groups were born as a quick work around for LinkTrust customers needing to manage campaigns in several currencies . Building the ability to apply multiple languages and currencies into LinkTrust is a big project we 're working toward , but we know you need a solution now . So until we can give you Yens , Euros and Rupees , we 've made a few adjustments based on the suggestions of some of our creative clients to create Campaign Groups . With this new feature , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one group . For example all campaigns running in France , Spain , Germany and other EU countries can be grouped into a Campaign Group called Euro traffic . This group 's commissions revenues will be paid in Euros . You can build a group for any currency you need . <p> In addition to the multi-currency scenario , Campaign Groups give you the ability to have two-layers of organization when utilized with Campaign Categories . This would be useful for networks which use a variety of offer types within one vertical . Example : If your network is running Healthcare offers and uses the Campaign Category to designate each one as a Healthcare offer and uses a Campaign Group to differentiate between Incentive , Email and Search offers within the Healthcare Category . <h> Affiliate Access to Conversion Details <p> LinkTrust customers have always been able to drill-down in their reports to access details on the transaction level . Now you can let your affiliate download the details of their conversions in their Affiliate Center . <p> Like seeing your credit card statement helps you adjust your budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her conversion details will help them budget their traffic allocations for your offers . When your affiliates can break out the reports and know the referrer for each conversion and get access to the Affiliate Reference I 'd they can know which traffic sources convert better , give you higher quality traffic and qualify for a better payout . <h> Additional Features <h> More Affiliate Management Tools <p> Know which affiliates are active users of your network by searching to see which affiliates have never logged into their account . Additionally , you can send a message to all of the resulting affiliates directly from the search results page . <p> Adding more places to add payments means that you can manage your affiliate payments more easily . When you are reviewing a specific affiliate 's commission report and find that an additional payment should be reflected there , you can add the payment without leaving the screen . You can also review recorded payments on the Affiliate Payment Details page . <p> With hundreds of affiliate applications flooding your network , there simply is n't enough time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet someone at a show later and he tells you that he applied to be an affiliate but has never been approved . Now you can go back and search all of the pending applications by name to find the one you missed . Along with searching by name , a variety of other search criteria is now available on the pending affiliate applications page . <h> Auto-Assign Campaigns for New Affiliates <p> We 've made it easier to get new affiliates up and running . You can select which campaigns will automatically assigned to all newly approved affiliate applications . This makes the new affiliate signup process a breeze for the affiliate manager while giving the new affiliate enough campaigns and information to hit the ground running . <h> Custom Payout and Revenue by Sub I 'd and Creative <p> You asked and we listened ! Now you have increased flexibility when it comes to affiliate payouts or merchant revenue . Tie an affiliate 's payout and/or your own merchant revenue to a specific Sub I 'd . Also , allow all affiliates using a specific campaign creative to get paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past our adjustment log was not that easy to use . We 're sorry and to make it up to you , we 've redesigned it and given it functionality you can use without being a human calculator .

And best of all , you can delete a mistaken adjustment instantly . <h> Improved Creatives API <p> The Creatives API has been improved to make the information included with each API response more complete , allowing you to utilize those creatives faster and more efficiently . <h> Global Merchant Pixel <p> For merchant 's who use a single confirmation page for multiple products , this improvement to the Global Pixel means the Campaign I 'd ( CID ) no longer needs to be passed when performing a Click I 'd postback .
