You could tell members : <p> how often they may hear from you <p> where to find members-only content <p> what perks the membership offers each month / week / year / etc <p> what other memberships or products you offer <p> how they can get the most out of the membership <p> If any of this content feels long for a welcome email , you can also link to static content on your site . <p> Your welcome emails should help your customers while giving you the opportunity to play host : thank customers for becoming a part of your community , and give them the tour of your brand or eCommerce store . <p> Now let 's talk about how you can send new customers a welcome email when they register for an account on your site , depending on which eCommerce plugin you use . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are a couple ways to edit the emails sent to new customers when they register for an account on your site . By default , WooCommerce will disable the general WordPress " new user " email and replace it with one of its own templates when a customer registers . <p> New Account Email Template <p> If you want to use the core WooCommerce email for new customers , you can view its information by going to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Emails . There 's one problem , though : <p> Core New Account email <p> You cant edit the content of this email easily . If you want to customize this email for your store , you need to be familiar with editing WooCommerce template files and have some HTML ( and maybe PHP ) knowledge . <p> If you do n't  know how to edit templates , then you 'll either need the help of a developer , or you can take another route . <p> Send an Additional New Customer Email <p> One of the plugins I find super useful for WooCommerce is AutomateWoo . This let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , such as orders , or fortunately enough , new user accounts . We can trigger workflows based on a user creating a " customer " type account , and either replace the WooCommerce new account email , or send emails in addition to it . <p> I 've set up a workflow to send an email to new customers 15 minutes after registration . First , customers will get the WooCommerce core email that contains their username and password ( but you could disable this email if desired ) . Second , customers will get my AutomateWoo email 15 minutes later with more welcome details , such as helpful links , and a heartfelt thanks for joining my store . <p> Initial New Customer Email <p> Email 1 Sent <p> You could include a discount in this email if desired , but as a customer , I really hate getting a discount right after I buy something , which may be the case for a new registration ( it could happen at checkout ) . Instead , I 'll create another workflow in AutomateWoo with a longer delay ; 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shiny new discount code . <p> New Customer gift email <p> Example gift email <p> AutomateWoo makes it really easy to add your own emails with customized triggers so that you do n't  have to edit your WooCommerce templates , and can take your welcome emails even further with automatically generated coupon codes . <h> Welcome Customers : Easy Digital Downloads <p> If you use Easy Digital Downloads , you can access your email settings from Downloads &gt; Settings &gt; Emails . Youll notice , however , that there 's no " New account " or " New customer " email : <p> You can customize your purchase receipt email text , but Easy Digital Downloads does n't  replace the WordPress " new user " email , and instead sends this to customers when they register for an account on your site . <p> Instead of editing templates , you can use a general WordPress plugin to customize this welcome email for your customers . Just be aware that this will customize all new user emails sent through WordPress , so if you have other users besides customers registering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same email ( which probably wo n't happen for many stores ) . <p> The freeSB Welcome Email Editor plugin gives you a way to edit your WordPress new user emails , and you can add your additional welcome details here . You 'll need to be familiar with basic HTML to do this . If you 're not , you may find it helpful to write your email as a blog post draft using the " Visual " editor , then switch to " Text " editor ( in the top right of the post editor ) , and copy the HTML it generates for you . <p> You can then use this to edit your email under Settings &gt; SB Welcome Email : <p> Now when a new customer ( or any user ) registers on your site , theyll be sent your updated and improved welcome email , while still allowing them to set the password and get username details . <h> Welcome New Customers : Other plugins <p> The SB Welcome Email Editor will work for almost any other eCommerce or membership plugin , as most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want an HTML template to start from , here 's one I used while testing : <p> &lt;p&gt;Hi there firstname , &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for creating an account with blogname !

As your store grows , your customer support team probably gets some questions over and over again .

@@98137900 @2337900/ <h> How to Sell Digital Products using WordPress <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Digital products are some of the most hassle-free items you can sell online . These do n't  require any warehouse costs , inventory count , shipping fees , or ongoing overhead costs . These products cover a wide variety of things images , videos , music , podcasts , eBooks , PDFs , plugins , themes , and more . <p> In this post , well look at four ways you can sell your digital products through WordPress , and highlight some features of each platform . <h> Sell digital products using WordPress : Easy Digital Downloads <p> Easy Digital Downloads ( EDD ) is a free eCommerce plugin for WordPress specifically built for digital products . Like most eCommerce plugins , EDD adds some default pages like Products , Checkout , Cart , etc. and gives you the ability to create digital " downloads " . EDD supports most major file formats that you can upload , create a description for , set a price , and start selling . <p> You will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Amazon Payments . Even though EDD is free , you will still incur transaction costs based on the payment gateways that you use . At the very basic level , once you create a " download " and integrate your payment gateway , you can start selling your digital product . <p> EDD comes out-of-the-box with basic customer management and eCommerce analytics . You can track transactions by each customer and their total spend . You can also keep track of your earnings history , and export all tracking data to a CSV file if you are using third-party analytics software . Take a look at a full list of EDD features on their site , or check out our most recent review . <p> In addition , EDD has a vast library of extensions and integrations . Below are some useful extensions that you can use to enhance your online store . <h> Software licensing <p> If you sell any type of software , including WordPress plugins and themes , an important part of the process is to keep track of authentic licensed files . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase from you , then you probably do n't  want to provide support to someone who did n't  purchase the software and downloaded a pirated copy . <p> The Software Licensing extension for EDD can automatically create license keys that can be used to activate products and keep track of authentications . The extension also allows you to create license keys that require ongoing renewals . <h> Recurring billing <p> If you are selling subscription-based products , you do n't  have to send a reminder invoice each month to every single customer . You can use the Recurring Payments extension to automate this process . You can set the payments to be daily , weekly , monthly , or yearly . You can also allow a single customer to have subscriptions to multiple products . The extension also provides standard emails that are part of the subscription lifecycle upcoming payments , cancellation confirmations , confirmed subscriptions , etc . <p> You can set up a recurring subscription to give people exclusive access to certain or all products on your store , to charge people for a service ( like plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrys razors ) , and more . Subscriptions are a great way to generate and forecast ongoing cash flow . <h> Support forums <p> A big part of running an online store is the support you provide your customers . For your EDD store , you can integrate and use forums using plugins like bbPress to manage support . Forums allow multiple customers to see and search answers for similar questions . You can also help build a community where customers can help other customers solve any issues that come up . <p> You can use the EDD Product Support extension to integrate bbPress forums with your store . <h> Sell digital products using WordPress : WooCommerce <p> WooCommerce is one of the most popular WordPress eCommerce platforms . WooCommerce can be used to sell both physical and " virtual " products . Similar to EDD , WooCommerce is a free plugin that sets up the basic framework of an online store on your WordPress site . At a very basic level , the only cost to you will be the transaction cost via the payment gateways . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through WooThemes , the makers of WooCommerce . WooCommerce also gives you basic customer management and eCommerce analytics . In addition , you can use a number of WooCommerce extensions to enhance your store . <h> Licensing and automatic updates <p> For any virtual products that are susceptible to be pirated or illegally downloaded , you can create license keys through the WooCommerce API Manager extension . The extension automatically generates license keys , and does ongoing monitoring of authenticated products . <h> Memberships <p> If you want to create a membership for customers based on their purchase , you can use the WooCommerce Memberships extension . The extension integrates with WooCommerce products to grant access to the membership when a product is purchased . Based on this purchase , the extension assigns a membership to the product , and customer can now access benefits related to that membership , such as viewing products , viewing content , or purchasing members-only products . <h> Secure uploaded files <p> When you 're using a content management system like WordPress , different types of files are saved under different directories . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the directory your files are stored under ( while pretty difficult to do ) , they can get access to all the files for free . <h> Security <p> The plugin allows you deliver products through a download button on the Thank You page , in addition to sending them via email . For security , the plugin creates an encrypted link to this button where customers can download the product . The encryption makes sure that the downloads are n't  publicly accessed if the link is shared . <h> Pricing <p> Something unique about the plugin is that in addition to setting up pricing for your products , you can also allow customers to pay what they wish . This can create a lot of goodwill from your customers and build your brand loyalty . <h> Forums <p> The plugin also supports membership integrations that can help you create forums , especially for support . <h> Sell digital products using WordPress : Hosted solutions <p> The above three plugins allow you to add and sell digital products on your WordPress website .

@@98137901 @2337901/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is a guest post from Cody Landefeld , founder at Mode Effect and senior web strategist . In 2010 , Cody and his wife Raquel founded Mode Effect after creating WordPress sites for clients over the past 8 years . Theyve since found their stride in providing solutions for enterprise companies , technology innovators , and eCommerce store owners . <p> Creating an eCommerce store that stands out from the competition is not a task to be taken lightly . For example , WooCommerce , the eCommerce platform we specialize in building and optimizing at Mode Effect , now powers over 30% of online stores and has over 11 million downloads . That represents a lot of stores competing for consumer dollars with new online stores joining the Internet ranks daily . <p> In years past , it was enough to simply be online a presence was all that was required to generate sales . Unfortunately , the eCommerce environment is no longer that easy . Running an online store has become a business where you must look for every possible advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand out and generate sales . <p> The good news is that even with all the competition , there are some common mistakes and oversights that many WooCommerce retailers continue to make . More often than not , its the little details the can make a difference between a sale , or not . In a business where low single digit conversions are the norm , every little edge makes a big difference . <p> Weve pulled together three simple design tweaks that might help your WooCommerce store gain a competitive advantage . But first , let 's get a handle on why these tweaks are really important . <h> WooCommerce Design Tweaks : The Big Picture and Continual Improvement <p> Before we jump into some specific ideas , its important to explain where design tweaks fit into the bigger picture . There are a lot of WooCommerce store owners who are under the impression that there is a simple set of rules that apply to all WooCommerce stores . By simply following a predefined set of rules , you 'll be able to maximize your chances for success . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( everyone knows responsive design is critical , right ? ) , its not necessarily the best approach to take . here 's the problem : <p> Every store , every customer , and every interaction is different . There is no hard and fast way of doing things guaranteed to work for every store . In fact , as soon as you adopt the attitude that " this is the right way " , your progress can grind to a halt . <p> A much better approach to take is one where you realize that your WooCommerce store is unique . What works well for a competitor might not benefit you at all . The only way you can figure out what really works is through experimentation and testing . <p> With this big picture concept in mind , let 's discuss three design tweaks that can provide a jumping-off point for your WooCommerce store that you can mold to your unique shopping environment and product offering . <h> 1 . Create an Opt-in to Grab Visitors Contact Information Early in the Process <p> As of the time this article was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate to be 79% . That figure consistently sits between 65% and 90% , depending upon the season . Cart abandonment is a real problem that demands your attention . But how can the design of your site be tweaked to help compensate for this unnerving statistic ? <p> Its more important than ever to build some type of stickiness with your potential customers even if they are in research mode . Create an offer in exchange for an e-mail to encourage a potential customer to buy using a discount code . - <p> One thing you can do is examine your checkout process . The method in which you sequence your checkout and how quickly you grab a visitors contact information can have a dramatic effect upon your long term marketing efforts . <p> When a visitor arrives on your site and fills up their shopping cart , more often than not , they 're just window shopping checking out prices and comparing shipping costs . If they abandon their cart early in the process and leave your website , there is a good chance that theyll never return unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few ways to accomplish this objective . One idea worth considering is to capture some of your visitors information at the very beginning of the checkout process . Even if you start with just a name and email address , you 'll have opened the door to further communication ( such as sending recovery emails following abandonment ) . <p> You could also take a buyers club approach similar to Huckberry : have your visitors register to receive access to your store and special offers . Or , maybe presenting a special offer or coupon in exchange for an email address might be more appropriate ( using your email marketing softwares welcome email is a handy tool for this ) . <p> Whatever method works better for you , the objective remains the same : Find a way to open up a channel of communication between you and your potential customers as quickly as possible . <h> 2 . Use Beautiful and Relevant Images <p> Our Stinkweeds case study showcases a great example of why relevant images are important . While Stinkweeds is not an image-intensive site , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant . If you 'll excuse the pun , they reek of nostalgia . For a record store that 's 27 years old and places a huge emphasis on the local music scene , it was critical to bring as much of the in-store atmosphere and experience to the website as possible . <p> It goes without saying that images are not an optional component of your WooCommerce store . ConversionXL put together a great post that talks about how you can use images to boost your conversion rate . <p> Sites like Made.com , Bestmadeco.com , and even one of our own clients yurbuds.com , do an exemplary job of selling products with great images . Seriously , I challenge you to visit those sites without filling up your shopping cart . <p> If you spend some time looking at sites that use imagery to sell , there are some commonalities worth noting : <p> Professional images are a must . Good quality photographs cost more but quickly separate the amateurs from the professionals . <p> Surroundings and environment are important . Are your products displayed in a context that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an appropriate amount of detail ? When purchasing online , you need to compensate for the fact that your customers are relying on only one sense ( sight ) to make a decision . <p> Use real life scenarios . By showing your products being used in a real life scenario , your visitors will be able to imagine themselves using it . <p> The images on your WooCommerce site deserve as much attention as any other element . People shop with their senses the more you can use that to your advantage , the further ahead of your competition you 'll be . <h> 3 . Communicate Your Value Proposition Quickly and Clearly <p> The final design tweak that well propose is making sure you communicate your value proposition as quickly and clearly as possible . Too many WooCommerce stores take a " me too " approach , and it leaves visitors feeling uninspired and unmotivated . <p> When a visitor lands on your site , you want them to know what makes your store , and your brand , different than your competitors . It could be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . <p> For example , Bose frequently uses " Better Sound Through Research " to convey an image of high-quality , great-sounding speakers . Zappos uses " Powered by Service " to put their amazing customer service at the forefront . <p> Conveying your value proposition is one of the easiest design tweaks you can implement on your WooCommerce site . Its also something that you can easily experiment with in order to discover what resonates best with your visitors . Just remember , your value proposition cant live in a bubble . It has to be backed up and reinforced by the other elements on your website . <h> Endless eCommerce Design Tweaks <p> Weve covered three very specific design tweaks in this post . Hopefully these ideas have you thinking about some potential changes or improvements you might consider implementing on your own WooCommerce site . The possibilities are quite literally endless . <p> Just remember that any change or tweak you make has the potential to give you a competitive advantage . However , the only way you 'll know for sure is by measuring and tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " correct " way of doing things . Different images , different value propositions , and different checkout sequences can all provide you with a leg up on your competition . 11394 @qwx871394 <h> Posted by Cody Landefeld <p> Cody is the founder at Mode Effect and senior web strategist .

In one of my marketing lecture we saw this problem and the solution is to catch the attention of them by any means . Providing them with discount code , price cut option or any other lucrative offer will help to reduce the conversion rate of non-returning customer .

However , the process to do this was changed in a backwards-incompatible way in WooCommerce 2.5 . <p> However , with WooCommerce 2.5 , the filter to change the order items table is still there , but it does not give you all of the data you need to make changes to the order items table in the email in the same way . You do n't  have access to the $args that are used in the template to determine what information to show or hide , so this filter pretty much does n't  allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using WooCommerce 2.5 , its possible to change the information shown in WooCommerce emails , we just have to be a bit more creative in how we use this filter . If you follow this tutorial , be sure you know how to add custom code to your website and that you 're using WooCommerce 2.5 or newer . <h> Add Product Images to WooCommerce Order Emails <p> You can add product images to to your order emails with this filter , but we cant modify the arguments used to get the template directly . Instead , well have to call the **33;91;TOOLONG function again , but with new arguments to use . The reason this gets tricky is because if we call this function , it will call the filter were using , which will again call the function , which will again call our filteryou get the idea .

@@98137903 @2337903/ <h> 8 Tips to Improve your WordPress Store Security <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Cyber security and hacking have become a common part of todays conversations . The media is often abuzz with hacking incidents around the world . It is important to remember that cyber security does n't  just affect big organizations and countries , but also affects your WordPress site and eCommerce store . <p> Here are 8 basic things you can do to beef up the security of your WordPress store . <h> WordPress store security : 1 . Update core <p> The WordPress core forms the foundation of your store . Make sure to update WordPress whenever it is available under Dashboard &gt; Updates . This will make sure that you not only get the latest features of core , but also receive the most up-to-date security patches . <h> WordPress store security : 2 . Update plugins and themes <p> Similar to above , plugin and theme authors will often push updates to their products . Updates will often add the latest security patches and reduce vulnerabilities to these products . Updates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some plugins , you may need to follow some additional steps , for example , using the WooCommerce Helper plugin for official WooCommerce plugins . <h> WordPress store security : 3 . Keep regular backups <p> In case your store does get hacked , or gets damaged due to some other cause , its important to have frequent backups of your files so that you can restore your site to a state prior to the damage . Rather than manually backing up your files , you can invest in automated solutions like VaultPress ( now part of Jetpack ) to create backups , perform repairs , and restore your site . <h> WordPress store security : 4 . Get SSL encryption <p> A secure sockets layer ( SSL ) protocol is used to encrypt transfer of information between your site and other servers . This helps to secure information like credit card numbers , personal customer details , and more . An SSL certificate from a recognized certificate authority on your site will not only add this security , but also show your customers that you care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> WordPress store security : 5 . Purchase official plugins and themes <p> When you 're starting out your business and looking to add the right visual and functionality experience to your site , you may search for a number of different themes and plugins . However , if you know that a certain theme or plugin is premium , you may stumble upon sites offering the same plugin or theme for free . <p> In such cases , always purchase the premium plugin or theme from the official developer . This will make sure that no malicious code has been added to the products , you get access to support , and that youre able to receive security fixes and feature updates . In the long run , the cost of official plugins and themes is a small price to pay . <h> WordPress store security : 6 . Monitor login and changes <p> To prevent denial of service or brute force attacks on your site , and to monitor who logs in and makes changes to your store , you can use free plugins like the Sucuri Scanner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help limit the login attempts for a username , send you email notifications when a login occurs or when something is updated on your site , amongst other things . <h> WordPress store security : 7 . Use strong passwords <p> This is fairly straightforward . For all your users , make sure to create strong randomized passwords either through the WordPress password generator or through other apps . Simple easy-to-remember passwords can make your site easily vulnerable to hacks . <h> WordPress store security : 8 . Pick the right hosting <p> Your hosting provider and plan can determine your sites vulnerability . Shared hosting typically opens you up for more vulnerabilities , whereas private hosting or virtual private servers are more secure . In addition , managed hosting can help take away some of the tasks around backups and updates , making your site more secure . <h> WordPress store security : Summary <p> Your stores security is something that can always be improved . These tips are some of the basic things you can do to beef up security on your store . Part of the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , and part of the effort is to recover the site if it gets hacked . <p> What are some steps you take to secure your WordPress store ? Is there something in particular that you think is extremely important ? Please tell us in the comments below . 11394 @qwx871394 <p> It goes without saying that prevention is the best course of action " keep WordPress , plugins and themes all up to date , harden WordPress by using security plugins such as Sucuri , and regularly backup your website . <p> I also use a couple of other plugins such as WPS Hide Login and Login Lockdown as well as some code to block XML RPC etc to further secure WordPress . <p> If the website is key to your business also consider a CDN and web application firewall such as Cloudflare . <p> Not all web hosts will automatically backup a website so do not assume they have a copy to restore for you . Ask the web host and take your own copy ! 
@@98137904 @2337904/ <h> Use WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things to Add Product and Cart Subscriptions <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Subscription products are becoming increasingly popular . For store owners , these create higher revenues and a consistent cash flow by providing a better line of sight and recurrence on purchases . For customers , these products reduce the effort to reorder for things that are used often , like coffee beans , shaving razors , batteries , etc . In todays post , we will look at the new WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things extension to create subscription options for products . <h> Subscribe All the Things : Easily offer subscriptions on WooCommerce products <p> So far , if you wanted to sell a one-time purchase product , you could do so by creating a simple product in WooCommerce . If you wanted to sell a subscription product , you could do so by creating a separate subscription product . You could also sell these together by including both options through a third product with the other two as linked products . The entire process was a bit cumbersome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew larger . <p> In addition , customers have had no way to add a subscription for products on their entire cart . This can help align receiving different products at the same time from a subscription . <p> The Subscribe All the Things extension allows you to add subscription options on simple products , and for products through extensions like Composite Products , Product Bundles , and Mix n Match Products . You can also add subscription options to the entire cart . <p> We will go over adding subscription options to a simple product , and to the entire cart . In order to use this extension , you will require WooCommerce 2.3 or newer , and the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension version 2.0 or newer . <p> Note that this extension is still pre-beta as of this post date . <h> Subscribe All the Things : Subscriptions on simple products <p> Let 's get started by adding subscription options to a simple WooCommerce product . We will use an example " Happy Ninja " hoodie to which we will add options . <p> Simple product before subscription options <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things plugin on your store . This will add a " Subscriptions " section to the Product Data area within an individual product . In our example , we navigate to the Happy Ninja hoodie product and open the Subscriptions tab in product information . <p> Add subscription options under product data section <p> Here , you can configure subscription details for the product . These include : <p> Force subscription in order to remove the one-time purchase option so that customers will only be able to purchase a subscription . <p> Default to either One-time purchase or the Subscription . This will be the default option selected when customers click on the product or add it to the cart without making an alternate selection . <p> Subscription prompt to specify the text before the purchase options area . <p> Subscription Price where you can Inherit the price from the product and assign a discount percentage , or Override product price to a set value . <p> Save and update the product to have the subscription options reflected on the store . <p> Subscription options for the simple product <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make . You can select the default option to be a subscription if you want to encourage customers towards an ongoing purchase . Typically , subscriptions are priced lower than a one-time purchase , and the discount is higher for longer-duration subscriptions . <p> Once the selection is made , customers can add this product to their cart , where they can still configure their purchase option . <p> Purchase options appear in cart <p> This allows customers to easily evaluate and make changes at different points of their purchase journey . This is for subscription options on an individual product . Now , let 's configure the extension to allow subscriptions on the entire cart . <h> Subscribe All the Things : Subscriptions for entire cart <p> Other than adding subscription options for individual products , you can also allow subscription purchase options on the entire cart . This can help customers easily turn their entire cart to a subscription purchase recurring at the same time . <p> To add options to the entire cart , go to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Subscriptions and scroll down to the Subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , here you can add multiple options . These can be ( every/every 2nd to 6th ) ( day/week/month/year ) for ( all time/ 1 to 24 months ) . You can also configure the order in which these options appear . <p> Cart subscription options for simple products <p> Once you save the cart options , any time customers add simple products to their cart , they will be able to select subscription purchases for the entire cart . Note that the options appear separate from the products in the cart , and get applied to all items in the cart . This is true when individual products in the cart do n't  have their own subscription options . <p> Cart options when a product has subscription options <p> If a customer adds a product to the cart which has subscription options ( for example , the hoodie we created subscriptions for above ) , and simple products without subscription options , the cart options appear on individual products where no subscription options were defined . <p> In our example , the Happy Ninja hoodie at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two products which did not have their own options inherit the options available for the cart . <p> In each case , customers can easily configure their purchase option to be one-time or a subscription . <h> Subscribe All the Things : Summary <p> You can now easily offer subscription options along with one-time purchases for your WooCommerce products through the new WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things extension . The extension also gives you the ability to provide cart subscriptions so that all products in the cart can be purchased as a subscription . You can set multiple options for how the subscription can be purchased . <p> Subscriptions can help create more loyal customers and improve your stores customer lifetime value . The cart subscription makes it easy for customers to receive all their cart items at the same time on a recurring basis . <p> Do you currently offer subscriptions along with individual products ? Tell us in the comments how this extension can help your store . 11394 @qwx871394 <p> This looks very promising . Can I ask how a customer with a subscription in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's say they subscribe to 2 products ( A &amp; B ) monthly , and next month theyd like product C adding to their order ? <p> Hey Mark , I believe customers can remove items , but can not add them to a subscription . However , an administrator could do this manually , so it may be possible to implement in the future . I 'd recommend adding your feedback on the plugins repo to see if it will make it on the roadmap = <p> Hi , thanks for your work and your exaplanations . Is it possible to apply a % discount to all entire subscriptions ? For example , if I choose to subscribe to an entire order for a year , I 've got a 10% discount on the total . Fred <p> Thanks for this plugin. it fullfill my client requirements . it works smoothly . but as subscribers view , when i resubscribe cancelled subscription . it do not resubscribe after successfully checkout. you need to lookup on subscribers view on front-end side . <p> i was told that this extension is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitesis that still the case or is anyone using it live right now ? <p> We have a live site with a ton of variable products already available for purchaseif i purchased just the subscription extension , i would have to redo every product . However if this mini extension is ready it would make my job a lot easier . <p> Improvements and corrections are currently being made to support the latest changes in WooCommerce Subscription 2.1 but as far as I can tell it the plugin does work . It works with variable products on the product level . It is labelled beta because the code is not finalised . <p> When adding subscriptions to a simple product and then forcing subscriptions , is there a way to change the " Add to cart " action to a " Select Options " actions as it does when choosing a Variable Subscription . <p> Hey Jay , I do n't  think that 's possible given the code requirements needed to support opting into the subscription . You could consider just using a regular subscription product instead , for which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since upgrading to WooCommerce 3.0.1 , instead of the option to for " every month " it says " every array " and instead of " every year " it says " every array . " When I downgrade back to WooCommerce 2.6.14 there is not a problem . <p> Hey there , Thanks for sharing ! I downloaded this plugin but have found a problem how do you change the labels of each payment option ? Mine is saying : $13.99 / array but I see in your example of the happy ninja jumper yours says $13.50/ 3 months . <p> Is there a time range , when it will be updated to run with WC 3.0+ ? I 'm really looking forward to use this along with my normal subscriptions and it would be great to see this working with a updated WC setup . <p> hey Thomas , I 'd recommend following this issue as I know the teams behind the plugin have it on their radar , there 's just been bigger fish to fry with WC compat as v3.0 affected the Subscription plugin pretty heavily .

I wanted to move these up on the page in the sidebar , but when I put the related product shortcode in a widget , nothing happens . Is there a way to make it work ? <p> Absolutely . By default , WooCommerce will display a list of related items at the bottom of the product page , below the main product description . <p> WooCommerce also has a relatedproducts shortcode built in that let 's you output the list of related products , determine the maximum number of related products to output , and how many columns should be shown . We can use this to output related products in a different place . You can do something like this : <p> relatedproducts perpage= " 3 " <p> to output related items for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a text widget , nothing will happen : <p> Widget does not expand <p> This is due to the way WordPress handles text widgets by default .

@@98137908 @2337908/ <h> Customer Story Emails to Promote Your Brand <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Customer stories highlight the type of experiences your customers have while using your products . Periodic customer stories can be great additions to your store blog . Customer story emails help promote these posts and drive traffic from your mailing list . <p> In this post , I 'll list the reasons why customer stories are valuable , and break down the customer story email from Allen Edmonds to look at the good and the bad . <h> Customer story emails : Why use them ? <p> First off , customer stories are different than product reviews . Customer stories are centered around the customer and their experience , rather than provide feedback about their usage of your product . This brings a certain authenticity to the story since it is about the experience without a focus on product . <p> These stories can be a great way to engage and amplify customers . It creates an avenue for you to interact with customers and for them to engage with your brand . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , providing them with exposure . And there are many people who like this type of fame . <p> Customer stories highlight your target market and shows potential buyers the type of individuals using your products . This can help enhance your brand as the audience can see some of your customer profiles . <p> Lastly , posts about these stories create a lot of unique user-generated content which can increase your search engine optimization . <h> Customer story emails : What worked well in the email <p> Customer story email from Allen Edmonds ( top ) <h> 1 . Relevant image <p> The large image at the top of the email helps show the type of product the customer used , and the graphical elements tie it with the title of the story . The size of the image helps grab attention as our eyes move from the image to the title , and then onwards to the story . <h> 2 . Customer details <p> Addition of not only the customer name , but also the location , helps the audience to pin the story to an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can attach a name to the customer as we read , and picture him travelling in Chicago . <h> 3 . Navigation <p> Customer story email from Allen Edmonds ( bottom ) <p> The navigation at the bottom of the email is similar to what you would get on the website . This helps maintain consistency if someone wants to navigate to a different part of the site . <h> Customer story emails : What can be improved in the email <h> 1 . Areas of emphasis <p> One thing lacking from the paragraph of the customer story is emphasis on certain words or sentences . Adding emphasis to some key phrases or words throughout any long-form copy can help the audience in skimming through the copy . For those who do n't  end up reading the entire story , this can give them a general sense of what is being said . <h> 2 . Product name <p> Although there are customer details added in the story , the story focuses on the authors shoes . I personally think that the email can benefit from the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story in the email , I am able to find exactly what the author was wearing . This can raise the profile of the products being referred to or used in the stories , but also make it easy for the audience to get to the product . <h> 3 . Social call to action <p> For the social links at the end of the email , it can be helpful to add a call to action or title . Typically , social icons can represent two things : social profiles of the brand , or links to share the content with your followers . Adding context around what type of links are included at the end of the email can help get more clicks as the audience knows exactly what gets triggered . <h> Customer story emails : Takeaway <p> There is a lot of value in showcasing your customers stories while using your products . These can create a lot of unique content which helps with gaining search optimization . This also helps promote your brand as potential and existing customers get to see what type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this email , many things worked really well like the large image , customer name and location , and the footer navigation . Some things that can be improved included adding areas of emphasis in the story , addition of product name , and a call to action for the social links at the end of the email . <p> If you would like to start customer stories for your brand , one of the best places to look for potential candidates is in the reviews section of your store . These are customers who are willing to publicly endorse your products , and care enough to take some time to write about it .

In this post , well go over three email marketing tips that can help you grow your subscriber list , and your conversions . <h> Email marketing tips : Give away content that adds value <p> The basis of any strong email marketing strategy is valuable and relevant content .

However , one of the worst parts about buying apparel online is getting sizing right , which is where a size chart or size guide comes into play . These can help customers determine what size to purchase , reducing confusion for them and increasing sales for you . <p> Displaying a size guide on a product page is expected by your customers when purchasing clothing , and you can add a size guide via several methods . Well focus on creating a WooCommerce size guide in this article , but its important to note that you could use option 2 or option 3 with any eCommerce plugin to display a size chart to your customers . <h> Generating Your Size Guide <p> Many times , shop owners want to display a size guide in table form , but they 're not sure how to create a table they can use on their websites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , you can use a table generator to help you out they typically give you a GUI to create your table so you can add rows , columns , and cell data . <p> Once you 've created your table , you probably want to disable CSS and copy the HTML for the table to your clipboard ( or put it in a text document ) so we can add it to your site . <p> One thing I would add is a unique class to the table element ( like class= " wc-size-chart " or similar ) so you can style this table if needed later . Replace &lt;table&gt; with : &lt;table class= " wc-size-chart " &gt; <h> The Quick Solution : Paste this Table <p> Before we talk about any of the different approaches you can take to add this to your site , note that you can simply paste this HTML table anywhere into the WordPress editor if you 'd like to . Put it right into the product description and you 're done = <p> This is helpful if you only need one or two size guides added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are more helpful if you have several products that need size guides , so keep this in mind . <h> Option 1 : Create a WooCommerce Size Guide Tab <p> This is the only solution here that 's WooCommerce-specific . You can easily display size guides in a product tab using the Tab Manager plugin ( $99 ) . This is especially helpful if you want to show a size guide automatically on all products , or if you have a couple of size guides to choose from that you 'll add to several products . <p> You can create one or more size guide tabs by pasting your HTML table into a new tab . Go to " Add Global Tab " to add a new tab that will be accessible for all products , then add your size guide table and any other text here . <p> Create size guide tab <p> This tab is now available for all products in your shop . If you automatically want to display it on all or most of your products , you can add it to your default tab layout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then add your new global tab to this layout . You can drag and drop the tab order to determine how they 're displayed on your product page . <p> Add tab to default layout <p> If you needed to remove the size guide for a few products , you can override the tab layout for those products alone and remove this default tab . <p> You can also use overriding to add the tab to individual product pages . This is also helpful if you have a few versions of your size chart that you 'll need to add to products . <p> While editing a product , you can override the tab layout , and add your global tab as needed . <p> Add tab to product layout <p> If your size guide only relates to a single product , you can also add a custom tab instead and skip all of the steps to create a global tab , as you wont need to reuse it among other products . <p> Once your size guide tab has been added , you can now view it as one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Size Guide Shortcode <p> If you want to display your size guide elsewhere , such as part of a product description or short description , you could consider creating a custom shortcode to output the style guide . A shortcode approach will work for WooCommerce along with any other eCommerce plugin . However , you should be familiar with adding custom code to your site to use an approach like this . <p> The benefit to using a shortcode is that , if you need to update your table in the future , you can update the contents in one place ( the code that adds the shortcode ) , and the change is immediately reflected across all products . <p> Adding a shortcode is pretty straight forward , and you could use something like this code to create one ( replacing the &lt;table&gt; part with your table HTML of course ) : <p> This will now make the wcsizeguide shortcode available on your site . This shortcode is not specific to WooCommerce , so you could use it anywhere or with any plugin ; it just outputs your table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your product description or short description as desired : <p> When its been added , it will render your WooCommerce size guide where its been placed : <p> Shortcode displayed <p> Note that I did have to add a tiny bit of CSS to my site to fix the table layout , so you may need to add some CSS to your custom stylesheet or custom CSS plugin if your table is too wide for its container . here 's the CSS I used with the Storefront theme : <h> Option 3 : Create a WooCommerce Size Guide Image <p> If your size guide probably wont change much in the future , you can consider using an image since you wont need to update its content . This makes it super easy to put your size guide image anywhere on your site . You can also use this approach with any eCommerce plugin . <p> Once you 've uploaded your site guide image to your media folder , you can add it to your product description or short description . <p> However , it may not display the way you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which you display the image . <p> The good news is that using an image makes it very easy to open your image in a lightbox instead of putting it directly into the page . WooCommerce loads the prettyPhoto lightbox for its product images , so since well be adding the size guide to product pages , we can piggyback off of this . <p> If you use something other than WooCommerce , you might be able to use this trick , but you you 'll need to see if your theme or another plugin makes a lightbox script available , or you 'll need to install a lightbox plugin . <p> In order to use the WooCommerce lightbox on a product page , well need to apply the data-rel= " prettyPhoto " attribute to our image link . The reason I like this is that we can use a text link ( like " View size chart " ) and open the image in a lightbox . Well add our link to the product short description by using the text editor like this : <p> &lt;a data-rel= " prettyPhoto " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open in lightbox <p> This will display in our short description as a text link : <p> When clicked , it will open the size guide image in a lightbox : <p> Lightbox Size Guide <h> Adding Size Guides to Your Products <p> Any eCommerce plugin will allow you to insert size guides by : <p> pasting an HTML table into the product description <p> adding an image of a size guide into the product description ( or using a lightbox ) <p> using a shortcode to output the table HTML <p> If you use WooCommerce , you can use the above strategies to add a WooCommerce size guide , or you can also use a product tab to output your size guide for customers . As they 're very easy to include , there 's no reason to omit them from your products and leave customers wondering which size they should purchase for any apparel that you sell . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98137914 @2337914/ <p> Out of every $100 in turnover , fraudsters currently snatch 5.65 cents . ( Source ) <p> And overall , costs the eCommerce industry billions each year : <p> By 2018 , Aite Group expects card-not-present fraud will reach $6.4 billion , more than three times the $2.1 billion in losses reported in 2011 . Internet Retailer <p> For small eCommerce merchants , fraud can be a significant loss for their business , eating into profits while the business is vulnerable and trying to grow . So how can merchants combat card-not-present fraud ? <p> Verification tools such as 3D Secure can help merchants improve the authenticity of online transactions , and today well look at a plugin that helps WooCommerce and Gravity Forms merchants use 3D Secure . <h> Reduce Payment Fraud : What is 3D Secure ? <p> For merchants running brick-and-mortar stores , card-present transactions provide a fairly dependable and low-risk way of collecting money . The collection of a signature or use of the chip-and-pin system for purchases provides a layer of verification for the merchant : the customer ca n't just know the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a purchase via swipe or chip . Merchants can also choose to verify a purchasers identity further by checking a signature against a photo I 'd . <p> However , for eCommerce transactions ( **29;157;TOOLONG ) , signature , swipe , and chip verification are not present , and thus payment fraud is far more likely for eCommerce merchants . Without these additional verification tools , eCommerce merchants are subject to higher instances of payment fraud and to fraudulent chargebacks . <p> To combat these costly issues , merchants can use 3D Secure to verify transactions before accepting them . 3D Secure is a program created by credit card brands , and it uses consumers previous data to verify transactions in the backend while processing payments . Further , it allows merchants to get verifications from purchasers for suspicious transactions by requiring a password or additional information that is checked with the card issuer ( Mastercard / Visa ) for authenticity . <p> Therefore , when 3D Secure is in use , it shifts the liability from fraud away from the merchant to the customers card issuer instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable for fraudulent transactions if they do occur ( since the transaction was already authorized and verified ) . <p> 3D Secure is not intended to make the transfer of payment details more secure ; instead , it combats payment fraud by adding verification systems to eCommerce systems so that their fraud-resistance is closer to that of a card-present transaction . <p> As a merchant , if you find that you encounter significant fraud or chargebacks , you may want to look into using 3D Secure with your payment processor . <h> Reduce Payment Fraud : PAAY Overview <p> There is typically one hiccup when you look to enable 3D Secure for your WordPress-powered eCommerce store : not many payment gateway plugins support 3D Secure transaction processing . Because of this , you may not be able to enable 3D Secure for transactions without the help of a developer , which can be costly . <p> PAAY was founded in 2014 to help solve this problem . It gives you a processor-agnostic way to use 3D Secure with your eCommerce site . <p> Chances are it does not , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On top of this , every processor handles 3D Secure a bit differently , so its not very easy to develop ( and probably also contributes to the reason that not many plugins support it ) . <p> PAAY , however , has recently created plugins for WooCommerce and Gravity Forms to enable support for 3D Secure for merchants using these plugins for their stores . <p> With PAAY , the process to use 3D Secure is more like this : <p> Ensure PAAY works with your payment processor <p> Contact PAAY to create an account <p> Connect your PAAY account to your processor and gateway using your gateway credentials so that 3D Secure is added into the payment flow <p> Install a PAAY plugin and connect it to your PAAY account ( as PAAY has recently developed a couple WordPress integration plugins ) <p> PAAY works with most major gateways like First Data , Chase Paymentech , Moneris , Global Payments , and Wells Fargo Merchant Services , so you can use it to connect to these payment gateways instead of using a payment gateway extension . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When connected , PAAY authenticates all transactions via 3D Secure , not just high-risk transactions . This reduces fraud and also helps to protect against friendly fraud chargebacks . <p> However , this does n't  look the way you think it does at checkout . Many merchants are hesitant to incorporate 3D Secure because they think the 3DS pop up will be shown at every checkout : <p> This is n't quite the case with PAAY . Using the updated version of 3D Secure that works with risk-based authentication , the majority of eCommerce transactions do n't  need additional verification , as the verification process happens transparently based on the customers previous spending patterns . <p> As a result , the traditional 3D Secure pop-up that prompts for additional verification wont be shown most of the time ; transactions are verified in a way that 's transparent to the customer , but still shifts liability for fraud . <p> However , you can enable the 3DS pop up for that small minority of situations that would require additional verification , or you can leave it disabled depending on your preference for risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce <p> To use PAAY with a WooCommerce store , you can download the free PAAY for WooCommerce plugin and activate it . You 'll then see PAAY as a new payment gateway option for your store . <p> You 'll enter your PAAY merchant credentials , which you can get from your PAAY account . <p> Your PAAY account is also where you 'll connect to your payment processor and configure some settings for the PAAY checkout form . <p> if you 'd like , you can enable the additional verification modal for the minority of transactions that need it , or keep it disabled if you never want it shown and will assume the risk for those transactions yourself <p> choose whether you want to use a modal window ( pop up box ) for PAAYs checkout , or redirect payment to a hosted payment page . Both of these checkout processes let you adjust the colors and form appearance for your brand ( can be done in your PAAY account ) . <p> Once you save your settings , PAAY will be available as a checkout option on your site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either open a modal window for payment or redirect the customers to PAAYs website for payment ( like PayPal standard ) depending on your settings . <p> Checkout step 2 <p> This gives you a seamless checkout system that will authorize transactions transparently , display a verification modal if needed and enabled , and process payments through your merchant account with your processor . <h> Reduce Payment Fraud : PAAY for Gravity Forms <p> The configuration and usage of the PAAY plugin for Gravity Forms is very similar to the WooCommerce plugin . When installed and activated , you 'll be able to configure PAAY settings to connect the plugin to your account . <p> This will allow you to use a checkout form powered by PAAY in your purchasing form , decreasing fraud while providing a built-in payment option . <h> Reduce Payment Fraud : Downsides of Using PAAY Plugins <p> While PAAY is a great tool for fraud prevention and liability reduction , it does remove your payment processing from your eCommerce platform by a step . Since it takes the place of your payment gateway integration plugin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if you use Authorize.Net via your PAAY account for WooCommerce , you ca n't use features offered by comparable WooCommerce Authorize.Net plugins , such as : <p> or other features . The cost of improved fraud prevention is a tighter integration with the eCommerce platform . If you process recurring billing or use features specific to your eCommerce platform , then PAAY may not be an option for your store , as you 'd lose out on these features by replacing your payment gateway with the PAAY connector . <h> Using PAAY to Reduce Payment Fraud <p> PAAY helps merchants reduce fraud , liability , and chargebacks using 3D Secure . PAAY currently supports Verified by Visa and Mastercard Secure 3DS verification methods , while Amex Safekey verification via PAAY is rolling out in the US in October 2016 . <p> PAAY will also update to support 3D Secure 2.0 when it rolls out next year , providing better and more consistent support for Visa , Mastercard , and American Express transactions . <p> While PAAY provides a useful tool for merchants to reduce fraud and chargeback liability , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since your payment processor is connected to PAAY rather than directly to your store , you may not be able to leverage all features that you could use with a dedicated connector plugin for your gateway , such as Subscriptions support . You 'll need to evaluate these features vs your need for liability shift and fraud prevention to determine if PAAY is a good fit for your store . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Clear calls to action <p> The calls to action on your checkout pages should be specific and descriptive of the next steps . This is especially important when your checkout is spread over multiple pages . <p> Instead of using standard language like " Continue " or " Proceed " , define what the next steps are so that customers are not left guessing . For example , when customers are being led to the final order overview before payment , you the button text can say " Review Order " , and the final pay button can be " Pay to Complete Order " . <p> In addition , display the call to action buttons at the top and bottom of the pages to make it easy for customers to navigate forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on the eCommerce platform you use , the standard checkout form may contain fields that you do n't  need .

Granted , there 's no amount shown , but I do n't  want my customers to wonder about whether they 're getting free shipping or not . <p> This is a great question , as this changed with the latest WooCommerce . <p> First , well talk about how Carla has this set up . Because the free shipping is per-product and not by order amount or coupon , the set up with WooCommerce 2.6 is a bit weird . To achieve a set up in which some products are shipped for free , you 'll need to take a few steps : <p> Set up a Shipping Class under WooCommerce &gt; Shipping &gt; Shipping Classes called " Free Shipping " or whatever name you 'd like to indicate this class is for items with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not charge shipping , add them to this shipping class . <p> When you add a method to your shipping zone , set the method fee to $0 . Use $0 for your free shipping item class as well , and then set the rate you want for the " No shipping class " rate . <p> here 's how this will behave : <p> If the cart only contains items in the " Free shipping " class , then this methods cost will be $0 . <p> If the cart only contains items that are not in a shipping class , the methods cost will be whatever you 've set for " No shipping class " . <p> If the cart contains both items in this shipping class and without a shipping class ( or with another class ) , then the shipping method cost will be what you 've set for " No shipping class " . <p> ( Unless of course you have costs for other classes and they 're present , in which case they 're all added up . ) <p> Now here 's where Carlas question comes into play let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item in the cart has free shipping , this is n't necessarily obvious to the customer , as it does n't  say " Free " anywhere : <p> Now the methods label will be replaced with " Free shipping ! " if it has no cost , or will just use the regular label if the cost is not free . <p> Hope this helps Carla and anyone else who 's run into this issue with the WooCommerce free shipping label in WC 2.6 ! <p> I 've also submitted a pull request that would restore the previous behavior of adding " ( Free ) " to the label , so keep an eye on it . If its merged , the next version of WooCommerce will probably adjust this . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> One Comment <p> I 'm so happy to be doing my small part to clarify all the permutations of shipping zones ! <p> But I 'm sad to say that I 'm still flummoxed . After much testing , I realized that your lovely setup suggestions for my free shipping products was n't working because the products are variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variable ones . Tried setting the shipping class both as a parent and with the specific variations . Still no joy . <p> In the meantime , I did find a plugin , WooCommerce Advanced Free Shipping , that at least allowed me to show free shipping for the variable product , although the display in the cart is still confusing ( shows Flat rate as well as Free Shipping ) . <p> Next up , I 'll try this code snippet to see if I can get the cart display the way I want it .

If you 're a WordPress professional , its an excellent membership club that I 'm a part of along with hundreds of WordPress professionals , and one of the reasons we love it is the fantastic Slack community where members chat about their WordPress-based businesses . <p> We recently got an interesting question in the club Slack chat that we thought would make a great tutorial : How do I export WooCommerce orders based on the coupon used so I have a single list ? <p> Its not quite as simple as you may think , as there 's on basic problem with the way WooCommerce gives you a list of coupons used . <h> The Problem : Getting Orders for a Coupon <p> If you view your coupons under WooCommerce &gt; Coupons , you 'll see a " Usage " column for your coupons . If you click on the usage count for a particular coupon , it should give you a list of all orders in which that coupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . Clicking the coupon usage link uses the order search function . This searches all order text for the coupons code , which can be very problematic if your coupon code string is also contained in a product name , a customer name , or other text in the order . <p> Rather than getting an accurate list of coupon usage , you 'll simply get a list of all orders that contain the coupon code text in some way .

Alex is a WordPress freelancer , blogger , and marketer . Check out his weekly blog , or learn how to manage almost everything about your WordPress site at MasterWP . <p> Effective email marketing is the one tool you can use to dramatically increase your sales that you 're probably not utilizing . It 's something that the majority of companies know the value of : email generates more than 10% of sales for 55% of companies , and 42% of businesses say email is one of their most effective lead generation channels ( studies 2014 and 2012 respectively ) . <p> Email is an essential tool in the toolbox of any online business . <p> The good news is if you 're rocking WordPress and WooCommerce , its straightforward to making use of email and put a rocket booster under your sales . <p> The even better news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get going . We 'll start off by covering the best ways of capturing email signups with signup boxes and then move on to look at how you can integrate with your WooCommerce installation . <h> WooCommerce Email Marketing : Capturing email signups <p> The basic tenet of email marketing is capturing email signups . You need signups so you have an email list to market to . For this you 'll need an external service such as MailChimp ( free ) or ConvertKit ( expensive ) . Its important to use an external service so the emails you send definitely arrive ( if you do it yourself they may get stuck in spam filters ) . If you do n't  already have an account with one of these services , sign up for one now . <p> The easiest way of capturing signups is through signup boxes . There are two easy ways to add these to your WordPress site : <p> Signup form widgets <p> Signup form shortcodes ( with a custom plugin ) <p> Well work through each of these to equip you with versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widgets <p> Widgets are perfect for adding signup forms . Using Jetpacks Widget Visibility , you can set your form to display only on the homepage sidebar and after posts . The flexibility is a real asset here . <p> Sadly there 's no free , do-it-all email form solution . This means you need to be flexible : there are some good free plugins for specific email providers or a straightforward DIY solution ( which can draw on some customization knowledge from earlier in the course ) . <p> If your theme has a signup form built in then this should be your preference as the design will fit tightly with the rest of the theme . Moving forwards well assume that you either do n't  have an option built in to your theme or are n't  using it . <h> Capture Subscribers : Free signup form plugins <p> Plugins are the easiest way to add signup widgets ( and hence forms ) to your site . There are a couple of free plugins which can add a widget for you . You 'll want to find one which works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are ones we like : <p> MailChimp for WordPress : if you 're using MailChimp , this is the one to go for . Despite the name , not an official plugin . A premium version is available but you probably do n't  need it . <p> Newsletter Sign-Up : the predecessor to MailChimp for WordPress , this plugin works with CampaignMonitor , ConstantContact , YMLP , Aweber , iContact , PHPList , and Feedblitz . If you 're using any of those services ( bar Aweber ) this is your best free option . <p> All these plugins are free so try them out and see which works best for you . You can install any of these straight from your WordPress Dashboard by heading to Plugins ? Add New and searching for the plugin name . Install and activate ! <p> Connect your account : the MailChimp for WordPress plugin settings <p> You 'll then need to add connect your account . For MailChimp for WordPress and Newsletter Sign-Up , you 'll have a new menu item added . Head to the general settings and connect your account by creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out the other settings to connect the plugin to a specific email list . For WP Subscribe , you can connect your account on the widget . <p> You can use any of these new widgets by heading to Appearance ? Widgets . You 'll find a new widget added ; drag and drop to any widget area to try it out . Customize options as you want them , save , and you 're done ! <p> A customized email signup box in action <p> Final step is to look at your site and enjoy the lovely new email signup form = <h> Capture Subscribers : Premium signup form plugins <p> Customer conversion is big business and there are a lot of premium plugins available which promise various levels of signup utopia . <p> Just be aware that these are marketing products and the most successful options are generally run by people really good at marketing . Bear in mind it may be possible they 're overstating the benefits . <p> These premium options generally get you extra features such as exit-intent popup boxes ( the ones that show up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options ( so you can better customize ) , and A/B testing ( test two versions of your signup boxes and see which gets better results ) . <p> If you 're selling a product or acquiring signups has a decent monetary value to you then these plugins are probably worthwhile . <p> There are a ton of these to choose from , but you 'll find the best options below ( pricing is for mid-level traffic website with comparable features you 'd want at annual cost ) : <p> OptinMonster ( $99 ) : decent option and the admin panel is well laid out , but limited design customization options and can get expensive if you need to upgrade . <p> SumoMe ( $468 ) : feature rich but gets very expensive very quickly . A lot is available on the free plan , but you 'll need to pay to remove branding . Probably not worth it . <p> ThriveLeads ( $67 ) : can be quite difficult to use but if you can deal with that , offers decent selection of features at a reasonable price . <p> Ninja Popups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it deserves a mention as a cheap option with plentiful designs to choose from . Worth taking a look at . <p> The competitive nature of the premium signup plugin business means all these options ( except Ninja Popups ) offer money-back guarantees , so there 's no harm in trying out different options and sending back if they 're not for you . <p> All come with extensive documentation and support for installation . <h> Capture Subscribers : Easy build-your-own <p> There 's a final option which does n't  involve any plugins . WordPress has a text widget which allows you to enter your own HTML to any widget area . If you 're using an email service offering pre-designed signup boxes such as ConvertKit you can just copy the box code and paste into a text widget . Save the widget and you 'll have it on your site immediately . <p> Therell likely be a line of code to load a stylesheet or some inline styles so the box looks nice . You might want to copy these styles into a custom CSS solution such as the one found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load will make your site load faster . Once you 've copied the CSS over , delete the reference in your text widget to stop the styling loading twice . <h> Integrating email marketing with WooCommerce <p> Collecting emails throughout your site is one part of the email marketing puzzle . Once you 've got emails you can start sending out notifications of new products , updates , and promotions . <p> You should see some positive results straight away , but you 'll get even better results if you can personalize your emails more . You want to be able to do things such as : <p> Offer exclusive discounts to existing customers . <p> Entice those who have signed up but not purchased with their own sales emails . <p> With WordPress and WooCommerce all this is possible and pretty straightforward . You 're only wanting to do a couple of things : <p> Add customers to your email list . <p> Make sure your email list knows what was purchased . <p> Segment purchases and customers on your email platform so you can send different emails to each . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing platform . Again , there are a number of plugins which will let you do this and they 're straightforward to use . <p> The WooCommerce MailChimp plugin 's options screen in action <p> The informatively named WooCommerce MailChimp plugin is the best option if you 're using MailChimp . This unofficial plugin is free and let 's you have full and deep integration between the two platforms . As with the widgets , installation is straightforward but requires you create an API key . Make sure you set up interest groups so you can segment customers in MailChimp . <p> Other email marketing services typically have a similar plugin available . A search for WooCommerce + email service name will typically find you the plugin to use . <p> Once youve integrated purchases with email , you 're in a position to massively extend what you can do with your email list " and the potential to generate revenue . <h> Going further with email marketing <p> Were not quite done yet . You also have the option to go a lot further , but this involves more setup and paid products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else you can do with email and WooCommerce : <p> Reduce cart abandonment : automatically contact customers whove entered their email but failed to complete a purchase . This can retain a huge number of sales you would otherwise lose . <p> Retain inactive customers : if and when customers go a long time without a purchase , get in touch and offer them the right deal to get them buying again . <p> Make full usage of receipts : these are emails with huge open rates . Start using them as an opportunity to sell again to customers . <h> Collecting so many emails <p> Email is provides such a powerful revenue generation opportunity . Its well worth spending some time asking how you can use it to most effectively harness it to take your WooCommerce site to the next level . <p> The techniques we 've discussed here offer some powerful ways of connecting with visitors and turning them into loyal readers and subscribers .

@@98137919 @2337919/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> We all know that customer service plays a huge role in purchasing decisions , and is a key to retaining your customers and increasing customer lifetime value . If your service does n't  measure up , your customers are likely to go to a competitor . <p> 85% of customers are willing to pay more for better customer service , and to switch to a business that has a reputation of good customer service . RightNow survey <p> However , offering great customer service is easy when you have great customers . What if you have a not so great customer ? How do you deal with angry customers , and even impress your angriest customers ? <p> You could just fire them and not deal with them , but you 'll risk negative reviews of your business , and turning an negative interaction around can be incredibly powerful and impactful for your customers . <h> Impress Angry Customers : Overview <p> The most difficult customer service interaction I 've had was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling it beautifully . As I was supporting eCommerce software in the interaction , the merchant was frustrated that something was n't going as expected . <p> For background , what the merchant wanted to happen was something that was ( 1 ) covered by sales materials and documentation , ( 2 ) was not remotely related to our software in the first place ( the FAQs explained why , so its not something we were able to fix , and would have been glad to if we could ) . <p> This also happened on July 4 , which is one of the biggest US holidays , and we were working a half day since wed had an unusual amount of customer service emails that week . Despite the holiday , the merchant had waited no longer than 3 hours for a response to any email . By all measures , there were no reasons for the **26;188;TOOLONG this conversation brought on . <p> My teammate stepped up to the plate , and perfectly executed on a resolution by staying calm , empathizing with the merchant , and clearly explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the end of the conversation , the merchant was happy and became an advocate for our brand , going from completely outraged for no apparent reason to happy as a clam . <p> So what systems were in place to handle this persons outrage without losing the customer , prompting a bad review , or going outside of the level of service we can provide included in purchase ? We 've got a few rules in our customer service tone guide that helped . <h> 1 . Impress Angry Customers : Have a North Star <p> The first key to our teams customer service is to have a North Star every team should have a guiding principle that you and your team can refer to and which drives your customer service interactions , especially for when customers are being difficult . Our internal guide is a few very short chapters , but it starts with our service North Stars . <p> We came across this idea from Help Scout , who wrote about how the Ritz-Carlton has a great philosophy and motto : " Ladies and Gentlemen serving ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of their customer interactions . In our case , this became , " We help eCommerce merchants run successful online stores , becoming partners in their success . " <p> From your driving motto , create 3-4 " steps of service " . Here are some Ive used with my customer service teams : <h> 2 . Impress Angry Customers : Manage Your Tone and Voice <p> You have the same voice all the time , but your tone changesYou would n't use the same tone of voice with someone who 's scared or upset as you would with someone who 's laughing . Same goes for MailChimps voice . Our voice does n't change much from day to day , but our tone changes all the time . <p> Have some guidelines on managing your tone . In our team tone guide , we have a few keys to our tone for the majority of conversations , then our tone adapts to the merchants / customers needs . For example , here 's one bullet point : <p> Use positive language whenever possible . No one likes to hear , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do . Merchants read emails , docs , or posts because they want a solution , not an explanation or an excuse . <p> Another part of our tone is empathy . To me , this is the biggest key of quality customer service . Help Scout calls this looking " past the fury for friction " . Instead of " you vs the customer " , this aligns the both of you and puts you on the same side . You want to help the customer to a resolution . It may not be the exact one they want , and it wont be a poor one that hurts your business , but your goal is to help . <p> here 's one of our keys that helps us empathize : <p> If the merchant is upset , apologize for why the merchant is upset , not what the software did . This ensures that you both actually understand the merchants problem , and shows the merchant you care enough to understand . <p> This is tough to do at first , and it definitely takes more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this internally as " Atticus Finch-ing " . One of my favorite quotes from To Kill a Mockingbird ( spoken by Atticus ) is : <p> You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it . <p> Empathize with the merchant so you can understand the problem , and be aligned with them on getting a resolution . If there 's an issue , apologize . As the wise Frank Underwood has said , it requires very little of us and will mean the world to them . <p> Our emails are thus shaped by our tone , and require us to : <p> empathize and be positive <p> take responsibility <p> offer resolution in some form <h> 3 . Impress Angry Customers : Do n't  Take it Personally <p> Part of what makes a positive , empathetic tone difficult is the natural tendency we have to take things personally . We see unhappy customers as a reflection of our brand , company , or products , and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my brand is great . <p> Customers will always respect you more for recommending a different product if it helps them . Separating this is hard to do , which is why we have our North Star and values . Instead of customer service interactions becoming a way to advocate for my product , they instead become a way to help potential customers . <p> By doing so , resolutions may often be the use of my product , but may not be . I 've found that customers will always respect you more for recommending a different product if it helps them , and theyll remember you for the future , versus customers who feel you led them to use your product when it was n't right for them . <p> When you treat every customer service interaction like an opportunity to serve your customers , you do n't  take offense to the slight against your business as often because you understand the customers issues and work to resolve them . Your business is now external to the problem , and will either be a potential solution or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customers needs , not between the customer and your brand . <h> 4 . Impress Angry Customers : Set Clear Expectations <p> You wo n't always resolve the issue in the way they angry customer wants . That is okay , as you shouldnt do harm to your business just to satisfy the customer . You still try to offer a resolution , but its up to the customer to take this resolution as well . <p> If you offer a resolution ( a partial refund , a future coupon , and additional month of service , a recommendation for the right product ) , be clear about what this resolution is . " I will refund this , " may be an okay description of the resolution ; " I will refund the cost of this item on the order and your shipping fee , " is better . There 's no ambiguity about what the resolution is . <p> If you 're intentionally unclear about what the customer can expect , your thoughts and the customer expectations may not align , which is going to eventually spell trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rather than trying to sugar coat language in customer service interactions ( " Well make this right for you " ) , be explicit : " We will make sure you are completely refunded for the damaged item . " <h> 5 . Impress Angry Customers : Blacklist Some Phrases <p> As a final chapter in our customer service team tone guide , we have a " blacklist " of words or phrases we do n't  use , or limit the use of . There are some phrases that can sound condescending , shut conversations down , or do n't  efficiently convey your message . The best way to use these words or phrases is to not use them at all , and remove them from your support lexicon . <p> Our blacklist serves to help us be clear in our communication and set appropriate expectations , maintain positive and empathetic language , and avoid appearing unwilling to help . <p> Here are a few examples from our blacklist . <p> But : Whatever you say before " but " does n't  matter . " I really appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this feature available . " All the customer hears here is " we cant do it " . <p> Instead , let 's make both of those phrases clear : " I really appreciate you writing in ! Unfortunately , we do n't have this feature available . " <p> Related to this , never say , " I 'm sorry , but " . This means you 're not really sorry . If you 're sorry , then be sorry , not with conditions . <p> Just : This one depends on context , but " You just have to log in , " makes it sound like everything should be easy . For some merchants , its not , and we should n't make them feel bad about it . " You can log in , " or " Could you please log in ? " work better . <p> To be honest : You should already be honest . This makes it sound like the rest of what you 've said may not be . <p> Please let me know if I can help with anything else / Hope this helps ! : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants to do something ; we ask if we can help . This keeps the conversation open and welcomes more questions instead of shutting it down . <p> " Can I help out with any other questions ? " or " Before you go , was there anything else I could assist you with today ? I 'm happy to help . " are almost always better choices . <h> Summary <p> It may feel silly to have a tone guide for one or two people in your organization , especially if one of those people is yourself . However , having used this in a small team , its a great reminder for all of us on what standards we hold ourselves to . <p> It also reminds us to empathize with the merchant and not take their anger personally angry customers are not a reflection on your store , but are a reflection on a disconnect between the customers expectations and reality . When you have keys in place that should drive your support interactions , these give you a safety net to fall back on when those interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company , along with your goals for each email . <p> When trying to turn around angry customers , <p> do n't  take their anger personally , <p> give yourself training to fall back on , and <p> keep your conversation goals in mind , <p> which will let you manage angry conversations instead of reacting to them . <p> If you want more resources to build your own tone guide or " angry customer " playbook , here are some resources Ive found really helpful : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

You 'll need the help of two plugins to achieve this set up : <p> Product Vendors is going to give you the ability to set up vendors and let them manage their own products , while Memberships will restrict who can view the products . <p> We wrote about using Product Vendors when we discussed creating a marketplace site with WooCommerce , so I 'd recommend giving that a read if you 're not familiar with Product Vendors . Well be using it to create a vendor per each school , and then vendors can create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vendors . <p> Once vendors have been created , now well get to the part about making the vendors catalogs private or restricted . There are a couple assumptions we need to make : <p> to do this effectively , we need to require customers to log in to see products so we know what they should have access to ( we do n't  know this for a guest user , as we do n't  know anything about them , such as an email address ) <p> we should probably hide vendor products from the catalog until a user is logged in , so they cant see what products would be available from each school / vendor <h> Private Vendor Catalogs : Create Membership Plans <p> First , well set up one membership plan per school or vendor . This plan is going to give customers access to that school / vendors products , but no one elses . Well create a " Product Restriction " for the plan that grants access to the desired vendor . <p> Do this for each vendor , so this may require several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Next , we want to hide these vendors products weve just restricted until a customer logs in so they only see products they should . Memberships has a setting that well want to enable for this called " Hide Restricted Products " . If disabled , it would show a placeholder in the catalog like a " teaser " to encourage signups , but we want to just remove products completely , so well enable it . <h> Private Vendor Catalogs : Provide Customer Access <p> Now you need to determine how customers get access to a plan do they have to apply to shop for a particular vendor ? Or is public sign up allowed ? If manual applications are required , you 'll need a form built with something Gravity Forms that you can use to collect registrations , and then you can manually create these member user accounts . <p> If you want to automate this and allow registration , I 'd recommend using a free WooCommerce product , with variations for each vendor . <p> Then , make sure this product grants access to that vendors membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer " purchases " this registration product , theyll automatically get membership access , and thus be able to buy the products from their vendor / school . <h> Private Vendor Catalogs : Customer Experience <p> So what does this look like when its put together ? If a guest customer , or a customer without vendor access , browses your site , they wo n't see any products that are restricted / assigned to a vendor in the shop pages . <p> If the customer tries to access a vendor or product directly via URL , Memberships will show a " content restricted " message instead of the content . <p> When a customer who has access logs in , this experience will change . The shop / archive pages will now show products they can purchase , and they can access vendor listings directly as well : <p> This gives you a private vendor catalog for your WooCommerce store that only registered customers can access . <p> Hope this points you in the right direction , Dan ! 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98137922 @2337922/ <h> How to Create an Online Learning Community using WordPress <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Online learning provides many benefits to both learners and providers . Learners do n't  have to be physically present at a specific location to receive and participate in the coursework . Typically , they can also learn on their own time , and are not rushed by a set time-structure . For providers , online courses allow the ability to scale the audience for the courses . <p> There are different types of online learning platforms available today , and online learning is growing in popularity . Broadly , there are three different types of popular online platforms . <p> First are massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) that provide free courses to anybody without the need to sign up , like the Open Yale courses . <p> Second are courses that are free , but require learners to sign up for the platform . An example of this is Udacity . <p> Third are online courses that require signing up , and have a cost associated to them . Many individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An example of this is the recent JavaScript for WordPress course by Zac Gordon . <p> You can create your own online learning platform using WordPress to teach something in which you have expertise . <h> Online learning using WordPress : Why create online courses ? <p> There are three main reasons individuals choose to create online courses : <h> 1 . Passive income through scale <p> Online platforms can be a great way to scale your teachings and create passive income . People who teach one-on-one or to a small group can get limited by the time they can allot towards teaching . When you set up an online course , you can put more time into building new course material and marketing , than towards teaching the same course . <p> This can also create a passive stream of income as learners can join the course whenever they want , and you generally do n't  have to put extra effort to up-keep the course . <h> 2 . Value for learners <p> If you have tried to learn something and have found it difficult to get good resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be others who may struggle with learning the specific area that is your forte . <p> You can create an online course to help people accomplish and learn the topic and get results . This creates value for learners as they have a single place to go for this topic . <h> 3 . Build your brand <p> Whether you charge for your courses or not , setting up a course can help build your brand as you establish yourself an expert in the topic . <h> Online learning using WordPress : Set up the platform <p> Now let 's look at how you can set up an online learning platform on a WordPress site . You can use the WooThemes Sensei plugin to create coursework and course structure on a WordPress site . This includes courses , lessons , quizzes , and more . <p> Once you install the plugin , it automatically creates two pages " Courses " and " My Courses " . The Courses page lists all available courses that you 've created . The My Courses page lists all the courses a learner is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce , think of these as similar to the " Shop " and " My Account " pages . <p> You can create a course by going to Lessons &gt; All Courses in the WordPress dashboard . Here you can add a new course , and fill in information like : <p> the title <p> course content where you give an overview of the course <p> course category <p> any prerequisites if you want to restrict access to only those who have completed another course <p> course featured image <p> a video overviewing the course <p> You can then create lessons by filling out similar details creating written content for each lesson and adding a video , if needed . You can then assign this lesson to a specific course and set where it fits within the course . <p> If you are charging for lessons , you can also set certain lessons as free previews so that users can get an idea of the type of content and format used in the course . This helps overcome barriers or objections people may have from purchasing lessons on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quizzes to each lesson and set up a structure for grades . This can help learners keep track of their understanding of key concepts from the lesson . You can also provide course completion certificates with a grade at the end . <p> You can also add existing questions from the question bank for commonly used questions . Learn more about quizzes and the different types of questions you can add in through the Sensei quiz documentation . <p> You can start using the plugin for a single site for $129 , which includes one years access to updates and support . Take a look at the Vitruvian Studio courses that are built with Sensei , or the Sensei live demo to see how the plugin works . <p> There are a number of extensions you can use to add functionality to Sensei . These include timed-content drip within a course rather than all lessons being available at once , display other learners enrolled in courses , and automatic course completion certificates . <h> Online learning using WordPress : Add cost and membership to courses <p> You can integrate Sensei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also use the WooCommerce Memberships to enable a tiered user base where certain members can get access to specific courses , receive discounts on courses , receive discounts on ancillary products or areas , and more . <p> Courses that you create may not all be equal in terms of difficulty for learners , and effort required for you to create them . You can set certain courses as free , and create tiered membership based on pricing for other high-value courses . You can also assign higher access and discounts to your most loyal learners . <h> Online learning using WordPress : Summary <p> Online courses have been increasingly growing in popularity over the last few years . Although early online learning providers were startups and universities , courses taught by individuals for specific topics are also growing in number . Many individuals have shifted from providing tutorials on video services like YouTube , to setting up an online learning environment on their website . <p> These courses can be open and free for all , or based on a paid membership . Instead of spending time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid online course to generate passive income . This also helps your courses to scale as you can free up time to put towards marketing efforts , and building new course materials . <p> You can use the WooThemes Sensei plugin to set up an online learning platform in which you can build and modify courses , lessons , quizzes , and more . You can pair Sensei with the WooCommerce Memberships extension to restrict courses to paid members . In addition , you can use other plugins to add functionality to your courses . For example , you can set up peer-to-peer forums using plugins like BuddyPress . <p> Think of the things you are really good at . These can be anything like car maintenance , Microsoft Office products , gardening , programming , and so on . Now think of what you can teach that can help you generate some passive income , and that would create value for your learners . <p> If there was one course you could set up today , what would it be ?

@@98137924 @2337924/ <h> Beginners Guide to eCommerce Payment Processing <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the most complex areas of launching an eCommerce business is getting set up with payment processing services so that you can accept payments online . <p> While merchants with existing brick-and-mortar businesses are familiar with some of the ins-and-outs of payment processing , they 're not always familiar with how online payments work . <p> There are several payment methods you can accept , along with some terms that you should know to get up and running with eCommerce payment processing . <h> Payment Processing : Types of Online Payments <p> Knowing how payment processing works and what kind of payments you can accept is the first thing you 'll need to consider before signing up for a payment processor . <p> Credit Cards Almost all payment processors will allow you to accept credit card payments from your customers , which is one of the most common ways to pay online . <p> Credit card payments typically go through the following lifecycle : <p> Customer enters payment details on your site <p> These details are sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transaction should be approved or declined <p> Your payment gateway makes the determination on the transaction , and tells your site if its okay or not <p> Your site either accepts the payment and completes checkout , or shows the customer a decline message and rejects the payment <p> Authorize.net has an interesting diagram to provide a more detailed overview of how this works . <p> PayPal PayPal is one of the most trusted payment methods on the internet , and its a huge benefit for merchants to offer it . Nielsen Online Buyer Insights reports that PayPal Merchants benefit from a 27% increase in total customers after integrating PayPal , while total amount spent by customers increases 15% and transactions per customer almost double . ( Source ) . <p> PayPal can process credit card transactions , but they can also act as a money transfer service when PayPal credit is used ( like a digital wallet ) . <p> ACH Transfers / eChecks Bank transfers or eChecks are essentially like paying with cash or checks online . They allow the customer to enter bank details for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your merchant account . <p> There are also some payment methods , such as Dwolla , that can simulate " cash transfers " online , which are typically lower cost for merchants than credit card processing . <p> Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency Bitcoin is still a very small portion of online payments , so many merchants do n't  accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies . However , if your customers may be concerned with privacy , bitcoin may be an option they appreciate having ( though otherwise I probably would n't bother with it for your store ) . <p> Bitcoin transfers are sort of like a secure ACH transfer ( but in a unique currency rather than USD , etc ) , as the transfer is immediate and there are no payment processing fees . However , this really is n't a great option for beginners , so while it can seem like a cutting edge thing to do , you 're better off with PayPal / credit card payments . <h> Payment Processing Terms <p> Let 's take a look at a glossary of eCommerce payment processing terms with which you 'll want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly related to credit card processing , as that 's typically a rabbit hole for many new merchants = <h> Payment Processing : Merchant Account <p> A merchant account is essentially your bank account for transferred payments ; its where the payment coming from the customer goes to first before you can transfer it out to your business bank account ( if you have a separate business bank account ) . The merchant account is n't involved directly in the payment transaction , so you have a lot of flexibility in where you get your merchant account ( i.e. , your local bank ) . <p> If you have a brick-and-mortar location , you most likely already have a merchant account for the payments you accept in-person . If you do n't  already have one , you have a choice between a dedicated or an aggregated account . <p> A dedicated account will be a merchant account only used by you , and is the choice of many merchants ( though you 'll typically need some more set up to get a dedicated account ) . When payments are processed , they 're typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then released to you for transfer to your business bank account within a couple more days . <p> An aggregated account is what many modern processors like Braintree and Stripe offer they 're bundled in with your payment gateway so you do n't  have to sign up for both a merchant account and a payment gateway account . Theyre great for new merchants , as you only sign up for one " payment processing " account , and after payments have cleared , they can just be transferred to your businesss bank account . <h> Payment Processing : Payment Gateway <p> A payment gateway is the online replacement for a point-of-sale terminal ( the thing your credit card is swiped through ) . This is what handles approving and declining transactions and managing responses to and from your website . <p> When you use an eCommerce plugin , you typically need an extension or add-on plugin to connect your payment gateway to your website . The integration plugin is what handles the communication between your website and the payment gateway to check whether transactions should be approved or declined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin and your payment gateway ; if none are available , you need to hire a developer to build one , as your website needs a way to communicate with your payment gateway . <p> If you have a dedicated merchant account , you may be charged fees for it , and your payment gateway fees will be assessed separately . If you sign up for an aggregated account that includes both the merchant account and payment gateway , your fees are typically for the entire " payment processing " package . <p> The payment gateway is where you get differentiation in terms of which features are offered : whether customers can save cards for future purchases , whether you can authorize charges and capture them at a later date , and which credit cards ( or other payment methods , such as eChecks ) you can accept . <h> Payment Processing : Charge vs Authorize <p> Most payment gateways can allow you to either charge or authorize a payment . Charging a payment means that your payment gateway requests funds from the customer immediately ; a charge says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Authorizing a payment means that your payment gateway first asks if the customer can afford the charge ; it says , " does the customer have sufficient funds for the order ? " This let 's you then capture the payment and complete the charge later . <h> Payment Processing : Tokenization <p> Tokenization refers to the ability to securely save a customers payment information for a later date . You should never , ever , ever store customers credit card numbers on your website . Instead , if you want to allow customers to save a payment method for easy use in the future or for recurring payments , your payment gateway will need to offer the ability to tokenize the payment details . <p> This means that the payment gateway securely stores the customers credit card number and personal details , and instead gives your site a " token " to use . <p> This is kind of like how poker chips work the payment processor gives you a token for the credit card number instead of the actual credit card number . At a later time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token your website basically says to the payment gateway , " Please charge token #123456 , " and the payment gateway can then run the credit card details for that token securely since its stored which tokens go with which credit card . <p> That way , if your site is ever compromised , only useless payment tokens are gathered ( since they 're encrypted for your merchant account , they ca n't be used by anyone else ) , rather than very important credit card numbers . <p> If you 'd like to allow customers to save payment methods for future use , or you want to allow things like pre-orders and recurring payments , you 'll want to ensure that your payment processor supports tokenization . They sometimes also refer to this as a " secure vault " or similar . <h> Payment Processing : SSL Certificate <p> Heres what you need to know about SSL Certificates : get one . That 's it . <p> Get one no matter whether your payment processor requires one or not ; its a no-brainer investment , and you can get them starting for less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer information if your payment processing takes-place on site , they also protect login credentials both yours and customers when logging into your site so they ca n't be intercepted . <p> Aside from this , they also improve conversions . Customers are trained to look for the " green lock " at checkout , and even if they 're being taken off-site to complete purchase , they do n't  know that its not necessary . Just get one . <p> If you want a wildcard cert or more features , Digicert is an exceptional company . They offer unlimited duplicates for multiple server setups and free certificate re-issues in case you change DNS services ; more importantly , they 're extremely knowledgeable and have solved any problem I 've had with my SSL certificates super-quick . <h> Payment Processing : PCI Compliance <p> PCI Compliance is one of those terms that many merchants have heard of and know is important , but do n't  really understand what 's related to it or how it works . <p> PCI Compliance refers to regulations that are imposed on merchants in order to be able to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which relate to different layers of security for payment processing , and merchant accounts can require different levels of compliance to accept payments ( or some allow the use of an SSL certificate alone and charge a monthly fee for non-compliance ) . <p> Since payment processing requires communication between your site and a payment processor , it may or may not be related to your payment gateway / eCommerce plugin alone , which is why it tends to be complicated to understand . <p> If payments occur off of your site , and the customer gets redirected back to your site ( like PayPal Standard ) , this is PCI compliant because your site never handles sensitive customer data or credit card numbers . <p> If customers remain on site , then the way your payment gateway integration is built and the features your payment gateway offers will influence PCI compliance . <p> SkyVerge has a good overview of PCI compliance and payment gateway integrations that explains this in further detail ; while its related to WooCommerce , the overview applies to any eCommerce plugin ( for WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and features for many gateway integration plugins in a spreadsheet ) . <h> Payment Processing : Helpful Resources <p> This gives you an introduction to types of processing and terms payment processors use , but decided what processor is right for your store is up to you . It will depend on : <p> what payments you need to accept ( credit cards , ACH / eChecks , etc ) <p> whether you have a merchant account already or not <p> whether you need to be PCI compliant and what level of compliance you need to meet <p> whether or not there 's an integration plugin available for your eCommerce plugin and payment gateway ( you 'll have to fund one if not ) <p> what features the payment gateway offers <p> what features the payment gateway integration plugin supports ( if it can tokenize cards using your payment gateways tokenization , etc ) <h> Payment Processing : Recommendations <p> So which payment processors do I recommend ? That depends on whether you have a merchant account already or not . <p> If you already have a merchant account ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this for your online payments as well , I 'd highly recommend checking out Braintree . While they offer accounts with combined merchant accounts + payment gateways for new merchants , you can also use their payment processing services with an existing merchant account . They have fantastic customer service , and they offer tons of great tools and features for merchants . <p> The built-in integration they have for PayPal is also excellent ( PayPal purchased Braintree a couple of years ago ) . The WooCommerce integration for Braintree was just updated to support many of these features . <p> Many merchants also use Authorize.net , which is a solid choice . They offer lots of features , such as add-ons for tokenization . However , their pricing can be a bit tough to understand and they offer several versions of their payment gateway , so we have a comparison of available Authorize.net products that should help . I 'd recommend Braintree over Authorize.net since their customer service is top-notch . <p> If you do n't  have a merchant account and you 're just getting started , Braintree is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway services , making it easy to set up and understand the processing fees you 'll pay . <p> Stripe is also one of my favorites , and we 've written about why you should use Stripe since its really easy to get set up . They offer combined merchant accounts + payment gateway services , so you 'll be up and running within minutes , and almost every eCommerce platform anywhere integrates with Stripe. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

For example , product management happens at two levels one me , and there is also a team of product managers at WooThemes who help with that . <p> When it comes to time management , its important to have your own roadmap of tasks to do . But , you have to be flexible to adapt <h> Can you tell us about the scale of your extensions at SomewhereWarm ? <p> The extensions get around 20 to 60 support tickets per week . In terms of the scope , these are between 50,000 to 60,000 lines of code . Composite Products takes up about half of that number . <p> The extensions have been purchased by roughly 15,000 to 20,000 WooThemes customers . <h> What 's some advice for new or seasoned developers ? <p> Document your code . Even if nobody else looks at it when you 're starting , at some point you might want to go back and look at something . Its not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't figure out exactly what you were thinking at the time . So , putting some comments or documenting is great for that . <p> Try to work with a designer . We are not designers , and they are not developers . And sometimes we can create a mess when we try to think as designers . So work with designers as itll pay dividends down the road . <p> Spend time on yourself and with your family . Get out of the office often to keep that balance . <p> If somebody is trying to get into development , the most helpful place to start is looking at the code of open-source projects . Get into the code and try to see where each function or line of code takes you . It really helps progression to look at code written by an entire community of developers . Try to get feedback from users of your projects , and other developers . <h> What 's your advice for store owners ? <p> I am seeing a lot of store owners with a tight budget focused too much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe ignoring their products a bit . Start with something simple like the Storefront instead of spending a lot of money on the " perfect " theme . Perhaps at the least , have your company logo done by a good designer . <p> Focus first on your product , and do n't  worry initially too much about the website design or user experience . <h> Where do you see the future of eCommerce ? <p> Over the next few years , I think eCommerce will be encouraging purchasing habits more oriented towards subscriptions not just for services , but for everyday products . I 'm seeing a trend towards that and it is something that Im excited about in the future . <h> Can you share some short- and long-term goals ? <p> Short term is focusing on the release of WooCommerce 2.6 , which is right around the corner . <p> One promising project I 'm working on is developing a mini-extension for WooCommerce Subscriptions that I have co-authored with the Prospress team . Its called Subscribe All the Things and it is still in the experimental phase . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers can allow subscriptions not just for a single product , but also for an entire cart . If you have a few items in your cart that you would like to purchase regularly , it gives you the ability to do that . <p> On a personal level , I would like to spend more time with my family . So creating that work-life balance is an ongoing process , but certainly something I would like to work on . <h> Manos Psychogyiopoulos , any other comments before we finish ? <p> I would just like to emphasize the value of family . I know as a developer , sometimes we get too obsessed with work and getting things done . Its important to have your family behind you and to spend time with them , as it can be easy to forget that . So , make an effort to spend more time with your family . <p> What did you think of the interview ? Were there questions you wanted to ask that werent in the interview ?

@@98137927 @2337927/ <h> How to Create a WooCommerce Wholesale System <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce works out of the box for direct-to-consumer sales , but business-to-business sales require extensions or additional plugins . Creating a WooCommerce wholesale system also requires additional setup , as wholesale customers , pricing , and payment or shipping methods need to be created . <p> Fortunately , there are several plugins that can help you create your WooCommerce wholesale shop , and can create a store that sells wholesale products exclusively , or sells to both regular and wholesale customers . The plugin costs to create this system can range from $129 to $256 ( plus annual renewals at 50% off ) , but this setup can also be customized with the help of a developer . <h> Creating WooCommerce Wholesale Customers <p> When anyone purchases an item in your shop and creates an account , they 're identified with the " Customer " role in WordPress . This ensures that they have only the capabilities on your site that customers should have ( such as the ability to update account information in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't  have further capabilities on your site ( like adding blog posts ) . <p> There are two main ways you can create WooCommerce wholesale customers : create a wholesaler role , or create a wholesaler group . Each can be done with a free plugin . <p> Creating a new wholesaler role is fairly simple , I 'd recommend this approach for most WooCommerce wholesale systems , as user roles are easy to work with and customize or extend , as there are several core WordPress hooks and functions you can leverage around user roles . <p> More WooCommerce extensions also support user roles versus groups , so you gain the ability to use plugins like Catalog Visibility Options with this approach . <p> To create a wholesale role , you can use the free User Role Editor plugin . Go to Users &gt; User Role Editor and click " Add Role " . This will let you select an existing role to clone , so I 'll give wholesale customers all of the same abilities as regular customers by cloning the " Customer " role . <p> Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , but I do n't  recommend using this unless you have a specific reason to avoid using roles . Groups are basically a secondary way of categorizing users , but you wo n't get the built-in WordPress structure that you do around roles , which makes it harder to develop custom code around user groups . There are also a couple of WooCommerce extensions that will integrate with roles , but not groups . <p> A group may be a better fit if your wholesale customers have a specific role on your site due to a subscription or membership ( as they most likely have the " Subscriber " role ) , so you wo n't want to change this . Roles are also used to give access to various parts of your site , so if you have a guest writer contributing to your blog , you probably have them set as an " Author " or " Editor " role , and thus could n't also assign a " Wholesale " role . <p> In this case , user groups can be useful , and can be created using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by installing the plugin , then going to the " Groups " menu and clicking " Add New Group " . You do n't  need to assign any additional capabilities to this group , as well only be using it as user categorization . <p> Create a Wholesale Group <p> If you 'd like to learn more about how I manage wholesale customer creation , applications , and approval , take a look at this more in-depth article . <h> Create WooCommerce Wholesale Pricing <p> Wholesale pricing systems can be created in WooCommerce using the Dynamic Pricing extension ( $129 ) , which will work with either wholesale roles or groups . <p> WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing will allow you to choose how your wholesale pricing roles should be configured . You can create global discounts for wholesalers based on your group or role by going to WooCommerce &gt; Dynamic Pricing . You can turn on price or percentage-based discounts for your role or group here . <p> WooCommerce Group Percentage discount <p> These global discounts will override any other rules youve set ( for example , a product-specific rule ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all products if set . <p> You can also create advanced category rules for wholesale products . These will let you choose how to apply discounts based on product category , and can be applied based on the line item quantity , or the total quantity of products in the category . <p> You can select which category must be purchased , which group or role this pricing applies to , and then which category should be discounted . You can also set minimum and maximum purchase quantities for this pricing to take effect , which is a requirement for many wholesale systems . <p> You can set several quantity rules to tier out discounts , i.e. , quantities of 20-30 provide a 10% discount , while quantities over 30 provide a 15% discount . <p> Advanced Wholesale discounts <p> When these rules are met , the wholesale customer will see a discount reflected in the cart and at checkout : <p> Wholesale pricing applied <p> Order total discounts can be created as well , which are similar to category discounts . Instead of meeting an item quantity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a category must be met instead to trigger a discount . <p> The final method that can be used to change WooCommerce wholesale pricing is per-product pricing . This gives you more granular control over your wholesale pricing , as you set product-specific rules . <p> When editing a product , you can provide discounts based on product quantity , variation quantity , line item quantity ( all variations of a product ) , or category quantity . You can also create quantity tiers for discount amounts as well . <p> Product Wholesale pricing <p> The thing I like about product-specific rules is that you can set a fixed price for the product for wholesale customers rather than creating a discount . This can let you create a system where regular customers pay $30 for a product , but wholesale customers pay $18 , but only if a minimum quantity is purchased . <p> Wholesale Fixed Price <h> WooCommerce Wholesale Product Catalogs <p> If you sell products to both regular customers and wholesale customers , you can probably stop your setup with Dynamic Pricing . However , many shops have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone but wholesale customers . <p> If this is the case , you 'll need another plugin to change your product visibility : Catalog Visibility Options ( $49 ) . Note that this plugin will work with user roles , but not with groups . <p> We covered this plugin more in-depth when we wrote about creating a customers-only store , but the setup for creating wholesale-only products is very similar . When this plugin is installed , you 'll be able to adjust visibility options for your products to determine which roles can see them . <p> You can do this on a per-category basis by viewing the product category and editing the visibility options : <p> Wholesale visibility : Category <p> You can also adjust visibility on a per-product basis with more granular control . You can select which roles are able to view products , which can view price , and which can purchase products , which let 's you limit some products to your wholesale customers . Your regular customers will never see products that are wholesale-only . <p> Wholesale visibility : Product <h> WooCommerce Wholesale Systems : Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are a couple that are particularly relevant for WooCommerce wholesale stores . <p> If you 'd like to offer different payment or shipping methods to wholesale customers ( for example , the ability to be invoiced for an order ) , you can do so using the Role-based methods extension ( $49 ) . This plugin integrates with both roles and groups to limit your shipping and payment methods to particular customers . <p> For example , you can choose to provide invoices to wholesale customers only , while also disallowing free shipping for wholesale purchases . We have an in-depth article on using Role Based Methods here . <p> While Dynamic Pricing allows you to set minimum quantities required for wholesale discounts or pricing , you may also want to completely limit the checkout to minimum purchase quantities . In this case , the Min/Max Quantities extension ( $29 ) should be helpful . This let 's you create minimum and maximum quantities allowed during the checkout process , so orders that contain a quantity lower than the minimum can not be placed . <p> Min/Max Quantities can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities , and you can opt to omit certain products from these rules . <h> Summary : Creating a WooCommerce Wholesale System <p> Creating a basic WooCommerce wholesale system is fairly simple and requires the help of a couple of plugins. 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 64 Comments <p> Great article , thanks ! Timing is perfect , as am about to implement something like this for a client of mine . One element you did n't  cover , was a method for customers to register as a wholesaler with manual approval required by the shop owner . Plus I wondered if you had thoughts on other plugins that could achieve simple wholesale situations , on a much smaller budget , such as Wholesale Prices and its companion Wholesale Register ? Thanks again ! <p> Hey Simon , most shops Ive seen manually register wholesalers as users and set the role to " wholesale " , as they 're most likely in contact with wholesale customers . I 've also used Gravity Forms + the User Registration add-on to create a wholesaler application form I let applicants register as a customer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wholesaler role when I 've reviewed the form submission . Unfortunately most " approve user " plugins will bork your checkout if you let customers register , so manually reviewing applications / adjusting the role is typically the best solution without custom code . <p> I do n't  typically recommend plugins from Code Canyon aside from a few authors due to ( 1 ) plugin quality and ( 2 ) compatibility with other WooCommerce extensions most everything you get from WooThemes.com will be compatible with other WooThemes marketplace plugins , or can be made compatible , and they 're quality-tested and reviewed before being approved . <p> Hey Beka awesome write up . I 'm so close to solving this and I think you could help tip the scales . I have created a separate domain from my regular retail website to run the wholesale side of my business , so the only people shopping on this site will be wholesalers shopping at wholesale prices . Therefore I only need to use one pricing setup on the whole site . here 's where things get tricky . I 'm okay will all site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display any add to cart or checkout functionality until a user has " created an account " and submitted it to be approved by the site admin . Only once they 've been approved will they be able to truly " log in " and view all shopping functionality . It seems that the WooThemes Catalog Visibility extension is able to hide the shopping functions , so I should be okay therebut everything I 've found about approving users before they 're able to login has led me to the point that woocommerce does n't  cooperate with plugins that try to point the login hooks somewhere different ( or something like that ) . Anyway , can you think of any solutions for approving accounts before users can really login and access their My Account pages , etc. ? <p> Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing back ! Dan <p> Hi Beka , Great article ! Thank you ! Just a quick question . I have a wholesale discount set up for the whole site . What would be a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then if the user spends over $500.00 there is an additional 7% off of the cart ? I have it set up currently where in Dynamic Pricing my Order Totals for Cart Discount is 7% then I have a Role based Discount of 40% set to wholesale . I read that one overrides the other so is that the case , or is there a proper way to do it within Dynamic pricing ? Thank you ! I hope all is well ! <p> I love this article I was going round in circles until I found it . I have a little issue that I am not sure if I am missing or not ? So far I have create two types of user . Retail and Wholesale , I have also created two categories with appropriate sub cats named Retail and wholesale . In each of these categories are products unique to those cats . What I want is a non-logged in user to only see the retail cats and products . However , when I set all the retail cats to visibility none they all appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see wholesale , and everyone else to see retail including non signed in members . <p> Hey Adam , I do n't  think Catalog Visibility options will work exclusively like this . If " Retail " products are visible to non-logged in users ( everyone ) , that other roles will be able to see them as well . I can say , " Show this category to only these users , " but not , " Do n't  show this category to only these users " . However , I might submit a ticket to confirm , as Lucas ( the developer ) would be best suited to confirm = <p> Any follow up on this ? I 've got exactly the same situation need to have wholesale customers only seeing wholesale products and public customers only seeing public products . I have the Catalog Visibility options extension , but as you have correctly pointed out , it cant exclude products so the public products are visible to wholesale customers which is not what I want . <p> I have raised a support ticket and will post a comment if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other option I can think of is the membership extension where a membership level would be tied to be a wholesale customer and I then create a product category which only that customer would be able to view I think that would work , however the membership plugin is very expensive at $149 and I 'm not sure if it will solve this issue . <p> Hey Simon , Memberships will not work this way either I 'm afraid . If a product is public , its also shown to non-members along with logged-in members . I do n't  know of any plugin available that would let you set a " non-user " ( guest ) catalog vs a user ( logged in ) catalog , so I might go the route of separating your products by category , and then linking to category archives rather than the full shop . <p> There are plugins that will let you change the navigation depending on whether someone is logged in or not ( or by role ) , and you could also conditionally filter shop links / endpoints by user type with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire catalog , but this way you 're directing them to the right category in most circumstances . Otherwise youd probably need a customized solution for this , or an custom extension to the Memberships plugin to only show restricted products to members . <p> Thanks for this great write-up , it was an eye opener for me . I have a question regarding one of you recommendations . You mentioned that if I were working on a b2c and b2b platform you would consider the Catalog Visibility Options over dynamic pricing . I would ultimatley limit my wholesalers to specific items in the catalog and display their pricing ( wholesale ) only if they are logged in . Is this still possible with this recommendation ? <p> Sure thing , the second screenshot in this section is from Catalog Visibility Options you can enable purchasing , viewing , and viewing price for specific roles only . You can let everyone view it , but only show pricing / allow purchasing for wholesalers , which requires them to be logged into the account ( to be recognized as a wholesaler ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have one price for wholesale and one price for retail . The price is not based on any general rules nor on quantity . There is a specific set price for wholesale and another for retail . You must be approved to be a wholesale buyer . If you login as wholesale , you see the wholesale price . Otherwise you see the retail price . Both can purchase the same items . So from what you wrote I think I set up roles using a free plugin . Do I need the dynamic pricing plugin to display different prices , or is there another way to tell the program which price to display based on roles ? Thank you ! <p> Yep , roles can be set up with a free plugin . Dynamic Pricing will definitely let you setup a price per role rather than discount if desired , and you can do that for each product . For example , my regular price could be $19.99 , but the wholesale price is $18.49 . You can do this for every product in your shop while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin , Catalogue Visibility and Dynamic Pricing . I have fixed prices for wholesale and retail customers . I do n't  like the way Dynamic Pricing shows the price on the site . It shows the retail price until you get to checkout , and then shows the retail price crossed out , and shows wholesale price . <p> If retail customers are logged in I want it to show retail prices only , and if wholesale customers are logged in I want it to show wholesale prices only . So I 'm not sure if Dynamic Pricing is the right plugin . <p> In the Dynamic Pricing documentation it says that the reason they display the sale prices only at checkout is because all of the various ways the wholesale price may be determined . If its by quantity , then they do n't  know the price until checkout . But mine is a fixed price . So maybe Dynamic Pricing is not the best plugin for what I want to do . Do you know of a fix , or can you recommend another plugin ? <p> Maybe WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member discount per product to deduct from the price , and this shows on the product page . However , you lose the other roles integrations that you may or may not be using , as Memberships does n't  leverage user roles . <p> Thank you for this great article ! It answered a few of my questions , but also created new ones = Our situation : we are a small toy manufacturer and run a combination of two stores based on OpenCart with the B2C store on the main domain ( only in catalog mode ) and the B2B store on the sub-domain . For a variety of reasons I decided to migrate the two stores from Opencart to Woocommerce . <p> 1 ) From the approach you describe I conclude that it only works for one domain . Adding futher distinction betweeen B2B and B2C through the use of different domains would n't work I guess ! ? 2 ) If not do you know of a best practise to do so ? 3 ) And last do you know of a plugin that can handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sell single items , and in B2B mode we sell in packs ( usually multiples of 3 , 5 , or 10 ) ? <p> 1 / 2 ) depends on if you want to have orders / inventory / etc aggregated , or if you 're okay with them being two separate stores . If you want this aggregated , youd need a multisite installation , which WooCommerce does n't  yet support . 3 ) Yep , check out Min / Max Quantities , which does groups on a per-product or per-category basis . <p> 1/2 ) I 'd actually need them aggregated , but was " scared " of a multisite installation anyway since I heard that it can cause some " interferences " . On the other hand its good ( actually bad ) to know that there is no WooCommerce-based multi-site solution , so I do n't  have to look any further I actually found a few tool that just claim this , but they are all sold directly by the developers and not through marketplaces like Envato , so no guarantee if the tools really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Etsy I decided to use an external inventory sync tool like TradeGecko or the like at least in theory it sounds like a smooth and easy solution . <p> The solution Wendell posted here is interesting . But I need to collect sales tax on orders shipping to each state that I have nexus in , except when the customer has provided a resale certificate and is somehow flagged as exempt . Am I missing something here ? Without the ability to add/subtract tax based on exemption status , Woocommerce is n't viable for us . <p> Maybe a role for resale wholesale and a role for taxable b2bis that doable with Roles and Woo alone ? <p> Hey Scott , WooCommerce does n't  have core support for tracking customer tax exemptions , only tax classes on a per-product level . I 'd recommend looking into a solution like AvaTax ( has a free connector plugin ) , which would give you more advanced tax handling and customer exemptions . <p> Quick question pls , you mention that the global discount rules override any other rules such as the product specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced category rules I would then need to disable them all to see how the product specific rules apply . I mainly just want to know though when using product specific rules that only apply to Wholesaler roles , the Wholesaler immediately sees that products fixed price or percentage discounted price as set by me on the product page , or does this price only show at checkout as with the global discounts only showing at checkout ? <p> I do n't  mind setting up per product pricing as opposed to global discount pricing if it means that the price is immediately seen on the product page upon logging in as a Wholesaler and not only at checkout <p> Thanks for sharing this article . I 've got everything setup and running smoothly . By the way , Gravity Forms now has an option for user approval so you do n't  need the New User Approve " plugin anymore . <p> Anyway , ive been scratching my head lately and cant seem to find a solution for the following issue : Scenario I have applied dynamic pricing rules on a per-product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Wholesale " role is applied to adjust min/max quantities with discounts ( this part works fine ) . I 've also set a " sale price " in the variations for regular customers . Problem The " sale price " is applied to wholesale roles aswell , rather than the dynamic pricing rules . <p> RE the sales pricing , I do n't  believe you can scope that to only certain roles . Perhaps you can create a discount for the " customer " role to act like the sale price instead ? That way wholesalers do n't  see it . <p> I would use Dynamic Pricing to display discounts for the " Wholesale Category " . <p> However , my question : how do I make so on the front-end , " Retail " customers do not see that " Product A " is assigned to the " Wholesale Category " ? <p> I thought perhaps " Catalog Visibility Options " would be the answer , but it looks like it would hide the complete product ( or category ) from being displayed , so I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wholesale ? I do n't  like having to do that . <p> Hey Wendell , I think you could do the discounts as a function of the customer role instead of the product category . For example , rather than mark a product as " retail category " and " wholesale category " , and give a discount on the wholesale category , why not structure the discount so it checks the role instead ? You could still restrict the discounts for wholesale customers to certain categories so its not on all products , but this way , since you already use different roles , those dictate the prices instead of categories . <p> Thank you for the informative article . Can you help recommend a plug-in(s) . A client catalog website require wholesale customers to login and be able to see pricing and make purchase . What plug-in do you recommend for this purpose ? Also , login account only by approval . <p> I just finished setting up a wholesale system for my WP store , and I would like to recommend the plugin Wholesale Suite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mentioned here with different plugins , and there is a more expansive version for $107 which allows you to add an application where wholesale customers can upload their tax documents and get approved . Super easy to set up too ! <p> Hello , I 'd like to buy this plugin , but I have to ask a few things before . I have " User Role Editor " plugin , and have added " wholesaler " role . <p> I 'd like to give this specific role 10% discount on all products and have bulk pricing in addition . <p> For example , a product costs 100$ . Wholesaler will see it as 90$ ( 10% discount ) If he buys 500-999 I want him to have a 15% discount ( in addition to the global 10$ ) so if he buys 700 products its 700100$0.9*0.85 = price . <p> In addition , I 'd like to have bulk pricing with steps : 500-999 products is 10% discount . 1000-1999 products is 20% discount . If the wholesaler buys 1500 products he will have 999 products with 10% discount and 501 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% on all 1500 products . <p> Hey Jana , I 'm afraid this would most likely require custom development to achieve , as I 'm not aware of a plugin that changes the tax display based on the user role . Sorry I do n't  have better news for you here ! <p> Hi there such a useful article . I set up my wholesale site using the catalog visibility options , minimum purchase rules and new user approve plugins . Heres what I 'd like to accomplish now <p> I 'd like to set it up where my homepage acts as a " gated " landing page where I 'll display a little intro about section , some clothing products , and a form to submit an application .

Have been reading around and haven-t found an answer to a doubt I-m having . Do you know if the Dynamic Pricing plugin has the possibility of changing the price based on the stock available of a product and not on how much a customer in his cart has ? If there are 10 products left in stock a want it at price $5 , if 15 are left , at price $6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would this plugin work in trying to do this ? Thank you so much for your help . <p> My company is playing the middle man between suppliers and chain-stores . For example Supplier " A " sells socks . Our company looks for other businesses or shops ( B , C , D ) that will agree to carry As product . They order the socks thru my website , I forward the order to " A " against a commission . " A " ships the goods to " B , C and D " . My question is , do you know a good email manager system , so when B , C or D passes an order thru my website the order will be forwarded simultaneously to the supplier . As we work with different suppliers , we have different types of customers , and do not want to be overloaded with emails . Thank you for your precious time . <p> Hey Joe , it sounds like a vendor or marketplace set up would work here , as this would let you take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier could be assigned as the vendor for their product(s) . <p> I think Woocommerce is better to run a wholesale business compared to paid services as competition in this space is increasing and e-commerce stores must look unique and organized to distinguish themselves from other websites . A Live Chat plugin for Woocommerce would really take the customer satisfaction to next level . <p> Would you be able to advise how I could go about creating a WordPress with plugins that can do the following : <p> I create a specific set of products Suppliers register add their prices for each of the products ( suppliers are not able to add any new products ) Enable a Request a Quote area on the site A potential customer uses the Request a Quote to get the best price from my list of suppliers for the product they want ( they would need to register to get the email with the quote ) A copy of the quote is also emailed to me The customer then decides to either convert the quote to an order or delete the quote If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order is sent to the customer , supplier and myself Each customer should be able to view all their orders Each supplier should be able to view all the orders they have fulfilled At the end of each month , I invoice the suppliers for my commission on each order 
@@98137929 @2337929/ <h> Allow WooCommerce SKUs in Search Queries <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This question is from Thomas : <p> How can I include my WooCommerce SKUs in my sites search ? Right now , customers enter the SKU and cant find the product in my shop and I do n't  see settings for search . <p> Currently , you can only search for WooCommerce SKUs in the admin of your shop ( the " Products " list ) , and this search is restricted to only parent product SKUs , not variation SKUs . In WooCommerce 2.5 ( due for release in a couple of weeks ) , you 'll be able to search your admin by SKU for parent product SKUs and variation SKUs . <p> However , this search functionality is n't available on the frontend of your site ; customers can not search for product SKUs to return a list of products . If customers search for all or part of a SKU , and the search query is n't contained anywhere else on the site , theyll get no results . <p> We can make some changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site instead using search plugins that modify the default WordPress search . <h> WooCommerce SKU Search : Simple Products <p> If you have mostly simple products , then the easiest way to allow customers to search by SKU is to install the free Relevanssi plugin . This will replace you WordPress and WooCommerce product searches with the Relevanssi search , and will allow you to include product SKUs in the search index . <p> First , go to Settings &gt; Relevanssi and configure your desired settings . The most important one to change right now is to include the " product " post type in your sites search results . <p> Enable products in search results <p> Once you 've done that , you 'll want to add the custom field for your product SKU to your search index . Scroll down to " Custom Fields to index " and add sku to this field ( the underscore matters ) . This will tell Relevanssi to include SKUs in the search index , and let 's customers enter the SKU as a search query . <p> Add SKU to search index <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your simple / parent products SKU , the product will be returned as a result : <p> However , variation SKUs ( if different from the parent products SKU ) , will not be searchable . Product variations are stored with some data separated from the parent product , and the SKU is one of these pieces of data . Therefore , if the variations SKU is different , searching for the variation SKU will not return the product in search results . <h> WooCommerce SKU Search : Variable Product SKUs <p> If you need to have variation SKUs included in your search index as well as simple / parent product SKUs , you 'll need to use SearchWP ( $49+ ) instead of Relevanssi . The WooCommerce add-on / integration for it ( included with any license ) will let you include products within your search . <p> However , you can also add a bit of custom code to store variation SKUs on the parent product , as outlined by the plugin documentation . You can then include this custom field in your search , and variation SKUs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 6 Comments <p> Hi there , tried the free plugin on our site full of simple products and searching for SKUs pulled in the results for seemingly every single product instead of the one in question . Any ideas ? Website included for reference . <p> did you add the sku to the custom fields as well ? is the SKU a generic bit of text that 's present on every product page ? ie in my shop , if I search for a sku of " tee- " , I would get a ton of products because many have " tee-shirt " in the description . <p> Experiencing the same issue and that 's a feature and/or the point of Relevanassi plugin . It intentionally outputs " fuzzy matches " in search results , so if your sku is RLSF-12-B its going to return any product in the output that has RL , SF- or -12-B . <p> So this is n't actually a great solution to the problem of SKU searching . <p> Our website is an online bookshop and each SKU is a unique ISBN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relevansi and included sku as a custom field but when I search by ISBN no results can be found .

Its one of the methods we usually recommend for building trust in your site . <p> You should keep in mind that these badges are here to build trust and confidence in your checkout , so if you 've never modified your site , you may want to enlist the help of a developer to add these to your site . If your trust badges look cheesy or like they do n't  belong in the checkout , their inclusion may have an adverse effect on conversions . <h> Why Use Trust Seals or Badges <p> Trust badges increase buyer confidence , just like seeing the green lock from SSL certificates does : customers are more likely to trust your checkout process and purchase from your site . For example , here 's an ad hoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the https / " green lock " indicator , then for trust badges . <p> As a result , including trust badges can improve your conversion rate . For example , this DistroKid case study shows that trust badges were one of the modifications made to checkout that yielded a 60% increase in conversions . <h> What is a Trust Seal <p> You 'll typically get trust seals or badges from your SSL certificate provider , payment processor , or hosting company . You can also include Better Business Bureau seals or any other credentials that you have permission to use . <p> Typically these services will give you either an image file ( unlikely ) or javascript snippet ( more likely ) you can use to include the trust seal on your site , which may look something like this : <p> If you 're not sure where to add this , it can be challenging to leverage this seal to your advantage , so let 's take a look at how to add trust badges and seals to your checkout process . <h> How to Add Trust Badges to Any Site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add trust seals to your site , you can use a footer widget to display the trust badges in your sites footer .

We had a client ask us to do this for them , and the SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And since it was loading from a third party it was actually slowing down the checkout page . So instead we just designed a nice custom graphicit seems to have done the trick because the client reports fewer support queries about security on the site . <p> Hey Dalton , typically the vendor seal generated by javascript links to a verification page so that customers can get the security information directly from the certificate issuer / hosting company / etc that confirms the website is indeed secured . I 'm pretty sure those verification pages are n't  static so you ca n't link to it directly without the js script , but it could be worth checking . <p> Hi Beka ! Thanks for great post ! Using your code and Code Snippets Plugin I successfully added badge of trust to my Woocommerce checkout and cart .

WooCommerce , by default , hooks that button in a priority of " 20 " , so if making the priority even higher does n't  work , it means you 'd need to dig into your theme further to figure out how its outputting that button as the template may be overridden . <p> Hello Beka , I am very much a beginner at building websites .

@@98137932 @2337932/ <h> How to Show WooCommerce Product Information after Purchase <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Sometimes you 'll sell WooCommerce products that require you to provide some information to the customer after purchase . It does n't  always make sense to provide this information to customers on the product page or to show it before purchasing , as it only relates to customers after they 've purchased . <p> If you sell a membership on your site , you may want to tell customers more about your membership and how to access their benefits . If you sell a product that requires assembly , you may want to forward set up instructions for that product . You may also have products that require special shipping ( such as perfume or freight items ) , and need to provide details on shipping methods and lead time . <p> There are several ways you can provide additional WooCommerce product information to your customers after they 've purchased in your store , such as : <h> Using WooCommerce Redirect Thank You <p> One way you can display WooCommerce product information to customers is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce Redirect Thank You plugin is really helpful for these use cases . <p> You can set up a customized thank you page for a particular product ( with category support coming soon ) , and when the customer purchases this product , theyll be redirected to the thank you page you 've created instead of the default " Order Received " page . <p> This works great for things like membership products , as you can send members right to a dedicated welcome page instead of the thank you page , and you can put the content specific to your product within this page so customers get the information they need . <p> If two products are in the cart that have custom redirects , then the product that appears first will have its custom thank you page used , so this is a great solution if certain products on your site need this thank you page , but not all of them . <h> Using WooCommerce Purchase Notes <p> If you only have a small amount of information for a product you want to add , you can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WooCommerce core , and allow you to add some notes about the product to be displayed to the customer after purchase , such as instructions for downloads , information on product shipping , or links to product manuals . <p> These notes do not require you to use a custom thank you page , and are great for sharing information about several products at once on the Order Received page . <p> Purchase notes can be added by going to Product Data &gt; Advanced and adding a purchase note for the item : <p> Add purchase notes <p> By default these purchase notes will be shown on the order received page for processing or completed orders . Theyll be shown as a separate row after the item in the order items table : <p> Purchase Notes for paid orders <p> However , you can also include purchase notes in WooCommerce emails with a small bit of code . Weve talked about how to add information to WooCommerce emails before , including how to show images or SKUs . You can use an almost identical code snippet to show purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information included in emails . <h> Send a WooCommerce Product Email <p> You can also share product-specific information in a dedicated email using AutomateWoo . You can create a workflow for orders that contain your product , and can use an email action following the purchase . Emails can be sent immediately or after a certain time has passed . <p> These emails can let you send further details about the product so that customers can save the email and refer to it at a later date . <p> The thing I really love about this is that you can delay an email a few days if a membership product is purchased , then send the email to welcome them again and remind them to log in to access their membership perks . <p> There are tons of great things you can do with dedicated emails , and you can set up this kind of workflow for purchases of a specific product , or for purchases of any product in a specific category . <h> Share WooCommerce Product Information Post-Purchase <p> Getting customers the information they need after purchase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , and they have all of the details about their purchases that you can provide . Emails , custom thank you pages , and purchase notes are all great tools to ensure that customers will get all of the details about purchases either immediately after placing the order or within a set time period after purchasing . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Thank you Beka !

@@98137934 @2337934/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> People will choose a payment gateway for a variety of reasons including transaction fees , ease of setup , cards/payment methods accepted , support , and of course " coolness " . Without a doubt the coolest gateway on the block right now , and our unabashed favorite , is Stripe . <p> Born out of a desire to remove the " pain " from payment processing , Stripe has achieved this goal by creating a payment processing option that 's beautiful , simple , and ( dare I say ) fun to use . Those of you with experience with some of the conventional payment gateways are probably questioning the use of the words " fun " and " payment processing " in the same sentence , and having implemented solutions in a number of the most common traditional gateways ( I 'll let you guess who ) I can fully understand the sentiment . Inscrutable , incomplete or downright incorrect documentation , drawn-out and opaque sign-up processes , high fixed monthly costs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the joys commonly experienced with the old school processors , and fortunately avoided with Stripe . <h> Setting Up an Account in 5 Seconds <p> Okay , perhaps it takes a few more than 5 seconds to begin collecting that first payment , but you can have a test account dashboard all of your own with a signup that literally takes seconds . Even your email and password are not required to have access to a Stripe dashboard and start poking around : <p> From Zero to Test Account in Under 5 Seconds . Literally ! <p> Stripe takes the all-important eCommerce principle of reducing friction to the extreme , allowing you to create and start playing around with their account dashboard without any risk or waiting . <p> Finalize your account by providing an email address , phone number , business address , and a bank account to link for transfers and you can start taking payments with Stripe . Within a week or two , a friendly Stripe employee will verify your account and possibly email you with some requests to complete your account creation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a site that we had n't  launched ( or really started on ) yet , and Violet from Stripe requested that we create a list of products or services we were offering , as well as a means for customers to contact us ; both things that we needed to do regardless . After taking care of those two minor requirements , our account was finalized and able to transfer payments to our bank account . <h> Transparent Pricing <p> In keeping with their principle of simplicity and convenience , pricing is 2.9% + $.30 per successful transaction . While the transaction fees are higher than what can perhaps be found with some of the traditional processors , this is offset by the lack of a signup or monthly fee . This lack of a fixed cost was a big selling point for me when choosing a payment processor for my very first eCommerce venture when I had no customers , revenue , and a limited budget to work within . The transaction-based pricing model meant that I was only paying for processing services if I was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Simple Integration <p> Stripe has broad support among all the major eCommerce platforms ( including almost every WordPress platform ) , so integrating it with your cart software is generally as simple as copying and pasting in your secret keys found in your Stripe dashboard . Need a custom integration ? If you 're a developer you 'll find the extremely readable documentation and code samples make taking credit card payments easier than you might expect . Finally , if you just need a simple and quick way to safely collect credit card details for charging later on , you can use Stripe Checkout to add an attractive credit card form popup which handles validation , error handling , and securely transmitting payment information to Stripe servers : <p> Stripe Checkout <h> Miscellaneous <p> Stripe is widely regarded to have outstanding support , and while I wish I could talk about some specific experiences , the truth is that accepting payments with Stripe has been so easy and straightforward that over this past year and a half I have n't yet had any reason to get in touch with their support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as you might expect Stripe makes managing chargebacks frankly as painless as it can be . With a simple notification system and response interface its easy to manage and contest undeserved chargebacks . Just be sure to keep good records and save those server logs ! <h> Who Shouldnt Use Stripe ? <p> If you 're an existing business with an established relationship , especially a brick-and-mortar branching into online sales , and you already work with a processor that supports eCommerce transactions , then I can understand sticking with them . However , if you 're a new e-shop just getting started , or are fed up with your existing payment gateway and want to try something new , we 'd highly recommend giving Stripe a look and a test drive . <h> 12 Comments <p> The only drawback to Stripe is the PCI compliance , even the WP Engine servers do n't  quite count as PCI compliant so Stripe ca n't be used and be compliant . If you send it through Mijireh then sure you 're fine . <p> I cant remember if the Stripe WC gateway uses this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCI compliancy issue is using their javascript library ( https : **37;216;TOOLONG ) which tokenizes the card prior to POSTing it to the server . <p> I put in a support ticket and they said the stripe gateway for WC was using stripe.js . I had assumed it did n't  because I did not see the stripe markup on the form fields . On further investigation , I see that the gateway extension uses a javascript solution that is different from Stripes example and does n't  require the same form field markup . <p> Great post . I 'm really looking forward to the day Stripe replaces PayPal as the default payment gateway people choose to sell online . Its easier to develop against , easier to test , easier to debug , easier to manage , basically a better experience all around for developers and store managers . <p> I 'd love to see WooCommerce take the lead and bundle Stripe free , removing PayPal Standard and offering it as an add-on . Stripe would need to be available in a lot more countries before that can happen though , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now . <p> Hey Brent , totally agree ! A bundled Stripe in WC would be a pretty fabulous deal for WC users . Hopefully Stripe continues to expand their offering throughout the world , they have a fantastic product and I 'm sure adoption would be high . <p> Another reason for choosing Stripe is cost savings . The transparent rates are simple to understand , but at first glance it looks like it might be more expensive than other options . However , I found that not to be the case . I recently compared a year of sales data for thousands of transactions made with PayPal and a traditional card processor to see what it would have cost using Stripe . The traditional processor , in particular , applied the ideal low advertised rate to few of the transactions and added plenty of fees each month . And in both cases it was either negligibly close or Stripe saved money . <p> Hey Doug , thanks for joining in ! Interesting to see the cost comparison ; I know I would n't mind paying a little bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome to see that it may even be more cost effective for people in addition to being easier to use . Thanks so much for sharing that analysis ! <p> We had a very unpleasant experience with Stripe . A week after we chose to partner with them , we received an email accusing us of committing fraud . We barely ran 3 transactions for our guests and they chose to close our account . All this was on Valentines day weekend when we had many customers waiting to pay the invoices we issued . You can imagine how difficult it was lost to find alternative payment methods on a Friday . Not to mention , our app was already integrated with Stripe . We offered to submit to Stripe any kind of document to resolve the issues , including for them to contact our customers and confirm the transactions . They do n't  have any phone support and they replied 5 days later with a standard email . We will not continued to work with them and other companies should be advised of their unprofessional attitude . 11393 @qwx871393

@@98137937 @2337937/ <h> Ask Sell with WP : How do I create WooCommerce Custom Product Sorting ? <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> How can I change the sorting of my products in the WooCommerce shop page ? I want to show important , sale , or featured products that I choose first without using a separate category for these products . <p> WooCommerce includes several options in the core plugin for sorting your products on the Shop page . However , most people do n't  realize that there 's actually an option for WooCommerce custom product sorting . By default , you 're given 6 options : <p> Default Sorting ( custom + name ) <p> Popularity ( sales ) <p> Average rating <p> Most recent <p> Sort by price ( ascending ) <p> Sort by price ( descending ) <p> Were going to focus on the first option for setting up a customized order . Under WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products , change the " Default Product Sorting " to " Default Setting ( custom ordering + name ) " and well get going from there . <p> This setting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can also use this setting to create an entirely customized order for your WooCommerce products . <p> If you click on " Sort Products " at the top of your product listings page , you can start customizing your product order : <p> This will change the screen to allow you to drag and drop products into an order that you choose for your Shop page . Note that if you start to change product order , you 'll want to completely customize your products into an order that you choose , as alphabetical sorting will now be overridden . <p> Why is this ? Dragging and dropping products will change the " Menu Order " under Product Data &gt; Advanced for each product , and there 's no bulk method to reset all menu orders to 0 . If you want to get back to alphabetical sorting , you 'll have to reset the menu order manually for each product to 0 , which can be incredibly time consuming for stores with more than a few products . <p> You can also manually edit menu order rather than dragging and dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu order " 0 " will be displayed first , then 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . You can use this to create your own ordering , or groups of products that will be ordered together alphabetically . For example , if multiple products have menu order = 1 , then theyll be displayed alphabetically together after any products with menu order = 0 and before those with menu order = 2 . The default for all new products is 0 . <p> Does this sound like a pain ? You probably have hundreds of products . In that case , I recommend using an automatic sorting option for WooCommerce that let 's you " weight " what 's important to you price , ratings , etc . This creates an entirely customized sorting order automatically without you dragging and dropping every product in your catalog ( review here ) . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Evan , I 'd recommend going to " Screen Options " in the top right and changing the " Products per Page " setting as needed , or using a plugin that does automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria . <p> I was googling to find a way to allow me to have a selected product at the begining of my product list in the " catalog " view . Alphabetical order is fine for me but I needed one product to be displayed first in the list . I tried checking the featured star but it did n't  worked <p> Your article gave me a clue showing the " Product data &gt; Advanced &gt; Menu order " that i havent seen yet So I wanted to share it with you : in this " Menu order " field , you may put a negative order = By default all products have a 0 order number . I tried to use -1 as my " featured " product menu order and it worked ! The product is displayed first now = <p> Thanks this helped me out as well ! ( my client wanted his products sorted by price ( asc ) , but ( there is always that but ) he wanted the cheapest article displayed at the end ( as it was displaying at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now realize I would n't have had to edit the menu-order of all products just leave them at 0 and change the cheapest one to 1 . ) . <p> I created a page for each category that way I can add custom text above and underneath the products , add a picture etc . This is the code to be inserted : <p> Anyway , made me think ( not being smart enough to code it myself , but also in combination with your other sorting plugin ) for creating a plugin that : 1 : let 's you sort products per product-category on price , name etc. ( regular sorting ) ; 2 : adds to the selected products a menu-order ( starting at 1 , but with an interval , say : 1 , 4 , 7 etc . ) ; <p> The zeros ( 0s if any left ) will display first , but after that , products will show according the menu order . Because of the interval , you can move products around by changing their menu-order-number ( say , 15 can become 5 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware ) , but I feel that for larger categories the above method might be faster you can re-run it each and every time ( setting all back to 0/default ) and start over useful if you want to bump-up specific products for a limited time . <p> I notice sort products is available no matter what default sorting you 've chosen , so does that mean I can drag and drop in a most recent setting ? What about sorting within a specific category ? Is the sorting only global ? <p> Hey Jason , sorting is global rather than within a category . Any time your sort products , the order you select will only be applied to he " Default Sorting " option , no matter which is actually set as the default to display to customers . <p> HELP ! ! ! I have been trying to get this page : LONG ... in order as per her catalog . Everything is defaulted . If i drag them , they look fine , but when i view the page , they are not what i wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products page i 'm missing ? This is the first time ive had trouble with woocommerce .

There 's a built-in plugin that put the sorting options in the shop page , for the guest/client ? ? <p> I found a workaround which may help , depending how many products you have . <p> Use Quick Edit to add a sequential number before the name of each product .

We deal in safety signs so have multiple categories eg Danger , Warning , Mandatory , Hospitality , Laboratory , etc .

As we have over 1400 signs , 30 categories ( and counting ) plus sub-categories is it possible to have both options ? Menu numbering and drag and drop . <p> I have a related but slightly different sorting question . I wanted to show on a page the result of a product sort .

I would be really glad to get your help on this subject ! <p> Afraid that sorting with WP query ( what 's used to get products ) will work like that it can sort alphabetically ( which gives product 1 , product 11 , product 110 , product 2 ) , numerically , but not both . If you wanted to sort them this way , you could manually sort them as this post describes , which sets the menu order , but otherwise sorting by title will produce what you 've outlined . <p> Thank you for your excellent work . I still have a problem : I 've sorted my products with drag&amp;drop method which produced effect in the Shop page . But in the Category page the products remained sorted on the old way . Sorting by " Order number " also do not function in Category page . Please help = 
@@98137939 @2337939/ <h> Ask Sell with WP : How do I restrict products to members only ? <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This question comes from Emily : <p> How can I restrict products to members so that only members can purchase them ? Our site is a club that only offers purchasing to registered members , and customers that are n't  members must sign up before they can purchase . <p> Unfortunately , most people want to be able to list products in their shop catalog so that non-members can see them , but limit purchasing only to members . You can obviously do this with custom code , but finding a solution that works as-is is difficult . It can be done using Exchange ( which we have an upcoming tutorial on ) , but the ability to hide products from non-members is fairly easy . <p> Let 's go through how you can restrict products to members only and prevent access to them from non-members using the Groups plugin and the Groups 404 Redirect , both of which are free plugins . Members will still be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blocked from them ( products will be hidden ) and redirected to a signup page . <h> Restricting Products to Members Only <p> First , let 's see what needs to be done with Groups . When you install the plugin , you 'll want to go to the Groups &gt; Options page to ensure that you 're able to restrict products . As most eCommerce plugins add your products as custom post types , Groups will be be able to restrict access to them . For example , Groups has noticed that I 'm using Easy Digital Downloads on one test site , and allows me to restrict my Downloads if desired : <p> Side note : this is really handy for restricting access to media files as well if this is something you need . <p> Make sure that your " Downloads " or " Products " post types can be restricted so that well be able to enforce access restrictions on our products . <p> Next , you 'll want to make sure you have the right capabilities accessible . Add a capability for your members by going to Groups &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I created " basic " , " silver " , and " gold " capabilities , which correspond to my membership level access levels I 've already created in my membership plugin ( this is important well need to tie these capabilities and groups to the appropriate members later ) . If you 're using WooCommerce or Jigoshop , Groups probably is your membership solution , so you wont have to worry about this . <p> Now create a group . This group can be assigned the capabilities you just created . I made Basic Members , Silver Members , and Gold Members groups . As I 'm using a tiered membership , basic members only have the " basic " access capability , silver members have " basic " and " silver " access capability , and gold members have access to all capabilities . <p> Go back to the Options page . Scroll down to " Capabilities " and ensure that you can limit access using the new capabilities youve just created . This will make sure you can select the appropriate capability on the product page . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add them to your products . In your product page , you 'll now see a meta box for Access restrictions . If you enable the appropriate capability restriction for this product , non-members will not be able to view the product . As I only want Gold Members to be able to purchase restricted products , I 'll only add that capability . <p> Restrict Access to Membership <p> If you 're using Groups for WooCommerce , you can also bulk add restriction rules from the " Products " page by checking the products you want to restrict , then bulk-adding restrictions : <p> Bulk add restrictions in WooCommerce <p> Awesome ! Really easy . <p> There 's just one teeny-tiny problem . Non-members cant see anything , so if they try to visit your product page from a link or elsewhere on your site , theyll just see your 404 page . Well have to make sure we create a landing page and send them there instead so they can purchase a membership . <h> Setting up a Landing Page for Non-members <p> This is where the Groups 404 Redirect plugin will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send users to when they do n't  have the correct access level to purchase a membership . Unfortunately , you ca n't change where members are redirected depending on which level is required , so you 'll have to have one descriptive landing page for all of your membership levels . Obviously , you could customize this with some custom code , but this may work for many of you in the meantime . If you 're only using one membership level for restricting product purchasing , that 's probably not relevant for you . Carry on = . <p> I 've set up a quick sample page where I 've linked to product pages for each membership , but you may want to include details about each membership so customers can quickly find the right one : <p> Pay attention to the postid for this page you can find it really easily by looking at the URL in your address bar while you 're viewing it . You 'll see something like this : LONG ... The part that says ? post=428 is what I need . <p> Now well set up the redirect to this page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go to Settings &gt; Groups 404 and enter this I 'd for the redirection : <p> That 's it ! Once you do this , customers will be directed to this landing page instead of a 404 page if they try to view a product they ca n't purchase . <p> There 's one more thing were forgetting before were done can you guess what it is ? <h> Tying Groups to Members <p> Final step technically everyone right now is a non-member , as you do n't  have anyone assigned to your groups . If you 're using Groups for WooCommerce or Groups for Jigoshop , this is already done for you when customers purchase access to your membership group . You tie groups access to your WooCommerce or Jigoshop products when created , so purchasing triggers addition to the appropriate group . <p> If you 're using a different eCommerce and/or membership plugin , you 'll need to tie group access to the appropriate members since it does n't  happen upon purchasing a membership . <p> Go to the " Users " menu . Unfortunately , well have to do this manually and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than WooCommerce or Jigoshop + Groups . If you have tons of members , you can hire a developer to customize this process to add groups automatically to membership purchases since the development costs will probably make sense for you to automate this process . <p> You can add groups to individual users by viewing the users profile and adding a group at the bottom : <p> Add Group to User <p> You can also do this in bulk ( which I 'd recommend ) by selecting the users that require this purchasing group , then using the bulk Groups actions at the top of the page : <p> Bulk Add Users to Groups <p> I 'm bulk-adding every person that 's bought a gold membership ( I got a list of gold members in my membership plugin ) to my gold-level purchasing group to sync this up with my product restriction . <p> Now your members are tied to the appropriate purchasing group , and these members will be able to view your protected products when logged in , while non-members can not . <h> Take it Further <p> You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your catalog by creating a public product to show in your catalog , then redirecting that to a private one . For example , you could set up the public product as an external/affiliate product , then link to the restricted product . FYI , there 's a free EDD add-on for this . <p> This way , non-members see something in your catalog and are redirected to a signup page , while members will just be able to purchase . Unfortunately , this means members that are logged in will see both products in the catalog , so its not exactly ideal either . <p> This tutorial and usage does n't  provide the smoothest solution to this problem , but its a free one that anyone can set up to restrict their products to members only using almost any eCommerce plugin. 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 8 Comments <p> I am filling this comment after reading your article " Ask Sell with WP : How to resrict products to members only " .

Protection would include the Menu and the Search capability . My enviroment is Woocommerce and Mystile theme . If I was to use the Groups plugin there would only be one tier of membership ( let 's call it Registered ) and all products would be available to view and purchase by a Registrered Customer . <p> Hey David , I think Groups would probably be a great fit for this , as it still has all of the management capabilities you want in terms of restricting products ( even if you 're not selling the access to those products , but instead giving it away ) . If you 're okay with showing products but not allowing purchase , you may also find this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very helpful .

@@98137942 @2337942/ <h> 4 Steps to Easily Create a Content Paywall with WordPress <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We 've already written a lot about creating a membership site with WordPress , and there are several plugins available to help you create an entire member management system , from purchasing access to restricting content and managing members . <p> However , many of these solutions are complete overkill for creating simple content paywalls . For example , youve probably read articles on popular news sites like the New York Times or Wall Street Journal you can often read some content for free , but then you 're required to subscribe or pay a per-article fee to access content on the site . These are simple content paywalls . <p> Creating a paywall is simple , and you can do so without the hassle of signing up for a merchant account , installing a payment gateway integration , managing member accounts , or configuring complex content restriction plugins . <p> If you only want to sell access to content without worrying about other member management tools or processing payments securely , then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with WordPress . One tool that easily integrates with WordPress to do so is CoinTent . <h> Content Paywalls with WordPress : CoinTent Review <p> CoinTent is a content restriction service that let 's you easily sell access to your WordPress posts or other content . CoinTent offers a free WordPress plugin and simple pricing to let you restrict content unless a reader purchases access via a one-time fee or a subscription . This let 's you create a lightweight membership or pay-per-view site with WordPress <p> All you have to do is restrict your content via the CoinTent plugin , and CoinTent will handle hiding this content , managing access to it , and accepting payments . You can set up pricing and access rules in your CoinTent account , track analytics and revenue from your content paywalls , and you 'll get a monthly payment from CoinTent ( for revenues over $10 in a month ) . <p> CoinTent will let you restrict entire categories of posts and can display an excerpt as a teaser or you can restrict portions of content ( such as videos or infographics ) via shortcode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or other parts of your site . <p> Pricing for CoinTent is simple . If you sell subscription access , then CoinTent charges $0.30 + 5% of the transaction to manage the payment processing and content restriction . As payment processors typically charge $0.30 + 3% of transactions for just payment processing ( and may charge additional fees ) , this is comparable to what youd have to pay for only payment processing services without content restriction . <p> If you sell pay-per-view access , you 'll be charged a percentage base fee for any transaction under $2.00 , as micropayments are typically more expensive . Their FAQ explains that you 'll keep 80% of all revenues via one-time purchases made through the CoinTent widget on your site . <p> CoinTent remits to publishers 80% of all money collected on their content . 15% covers credit card fees , fraud protection , security . The last 5% is our fee . <p> This pricing would only kick into effect for very small payments of under $2.00 . <p> Using CoinTent , you can easily create a content paywall on your WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CoinTent Account <p> Creating a CoinTent account was fast , simple , and free . I entered my email and password , and I had access to my publisher dashboard . You 'll only pay for CoinTent when you make sales , so you can set up your account and content restriction for free . <p> When you log into your account and view your account details , you 'll be given a publisher I 'd and token . You 'll use these to connect CoinTent to your WordPress site via their free plugin . <p> CoinTent Account Details <p> Your CoinTent account is also where you 'll set pricing for your content or subscriptions , as well as view analytics on your revenue , so well come back to our CoinTent dashboard after we 've set up the WordPress side of our content paywall . <p> A new CoinTent menu will be added to your WordPress admin when you activate the plugin . There are only a couple of steps you need to take to be up and running . First , you 'll have to enter your CoinTent publisher I 'd and token in the plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Enter CoinTent Credentials <p> You can also restrict your content in the settings , as this let 's you restrict entire categories of content . <p> Restricting categories <p> I liked the ability to set an " Excluded Category " . For example , if I have a post that 's in the " Restricted : Basic " category ( which could be your music or tutorials category ) , and its also in my " Public " category , it wont be paywalled . This let 's you provide public or sample posts to help sell other content within a category . <p> There are a few other basic settings , such as excerpt length and the way purchasing widgets are displayed , that can be configured within minutes . <h> 3 . Restrict Content by Creating a Content Paywall <p> There are two primary methods that you can use to restrict your content : post categories and shortcodes . Restricting entire categories can be done while you 're doing basic plugin configuration , and posts in these categories will show an excerpt and then block the rest of the post until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide longer teasers or only hide certain parts of your content , you can use the restriction shortcode instead to hide portions of posts , pages , or other content . The basic restriction shortcode is simple : <p> **30;321;TOOLONG **29;353;TOOLONG <p> This will display the purchasing widget on my site , and any content within that shortcode will be hidden until the reader buys access via a one-time purchase or subscription . <p> Basic Purchasing Widget <p> You can also customize this purchasing widget by adding some attributes ( which are entirely optional ) to the shortcode . It accepts all of the following attributes : <p> articletitle : By default , the widget uses the post title to display while customers purchase content . Use this if you want to set a custom title for the purchase . <p> title : The title to display above purchasing buttons , i.e. , " Please purchase this content to continue reading . " <p> Now Ive changed to the full ( boxed view ) , and customized the widget text . The default text can be changed in plugin settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be overridden in this shortcode . <p> CoinTent full widget <p> Any content that you 've restricted via the category restrictions or shortcodes can now be managed within your CoinTent dashboard . This will let you change pricing and determine what content is accessible to subscribers ( if you choose to create subscriptions ) . <h> 4 . Manage Content Paywalls with WordPress via CoinTent <p> Once you 're done setting up your content restrictions , you can manage access and pricing in your CoinTent dashboard under Content . You should pay special attention to price , expiry , and labels . <p> Managing Content Access and Pricing <p> Price will change the cost to access the content if the reader has used a pay-per-view purchase . Expiry will set an optional expiration ( in days ) for access to the content . For example , if I set an expiry of 7 days , then any reader who purchases the content via my content paywall will have access for one week . <p> Labels are important if you decide to sell subscriptions in addition to pay-per-view content . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , I 've created a " Basic " and a " Premium " label , which will correspond to basic and premium subscriptions . Premium subscribers will pay more and have access to all of my content , while basic subscribers will be able to access most , but not all , content . <p> In short , labels will determine which posts can be accessed by which subscriber . <p> If you do choose to set up subscription content paywalls , you can do so within your Dashboard under Subscription . Create a new plan for each subscription , set pricing and an optional expiration , and determine which labels the subscriber should be able to access as part of the subscription . <p> Creating Subscription plans <p> For example , if a reader purchases a basic subscription on my site , this will unlock any post with the " basic " label . <h> Other Content Paywall Tools from CoinTent <p> While you wo n't need this to restrict content or sell access to it , its very helpful to have access to analytics in your CoinTent dashboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total revenue for a period : <p> CoinTent Analytics <p> You can select from several reports and date ranges to get an idea of where purchases come from , how revenue is broken down based on payments or subscriptions , and revenue by source . <p> Analytics Views <h> What will Content Paywalls Look like to Readers ? <p> I liked that CoinTent let 's readers stay on my site to make purchases . All purchasing takes place in an overlay so readers simply complete the purchasing form , and they can immediately continue reading . <p> You can customize the form with your logo and header color so that its consistent with your site . <p> Purchasing Paywalled Content <p> Readers create their account , add funds , then purchase the content access . The content is then immediately unlocked and they can stay on your site to continue reading . <p> Subscriptions work in a similar manner readers select the plan theyd like to use , create an account via CoinTent , and complete the subscription purchase . <p> Purchasing a Subscription <p> With either option , theyll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Content Purchased <h> Summary : Use CoinTent to Create a Content Paywall with WordPress <p> CoinTent let me create a lightweight content paywall system with WordPress easily without any upfront costs . Rather than install a membership plugin , get a merchant account and sign up with a payment processor , and worry about managing your plugin and member accounts on your site , you can let CoinTent handle content restriction , payment processing , content access , and optionally allow subscriptions . <p> CoinTent also ensure that you do n't  have to worry about payment processing security , as they handle all payment details for you . You can then focus on what matters to you : your content . <p> Setting up a CoinTent account only took a couple of minutes , and I was able to restrict content easily by restricting my categories . You could take more time to set up restrictions via shortcode if desired , but category restriction made setup fast and simple . <p> The only dislike I had was managing content labels for subscriptions , as I could n't delete or rename @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to help with this and told me they 're working on improving label management . <p> Aside from this small issue , CoinTent let 's you create content paywalls with minimal effort that will only cost money when you generate revenue by selling content .

CoinTent looks flexible and easy to use , but what happens if they go out of business ? Poof , all of my subscribers are gone and I have to do a ton of work to get my site operating normally again . ( Correct me if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and previous experience with other products . ) <p> We generally like to keep things separate and recommend owning the software that runs your site . That often means platform independence ( bring your own payment processor , swap it out if you get better terms from another provider ) and open source ( WordPress vs . Squarespace vs . Shopify ) . There 's more of an up-front cost , but then you own your business and have the ultimate long-term flexibility . <p> Hey Dalton , I think this is a risk to any hosted solution , such as the inability to export Squarespace products , Shopify blog posts , or Gumroad memberships / subscriptions you simply wo n't have access to all data in a hosted solution . If you choose a hosted platform , you gain ease of use and less responsibility for security ( in the case of processing payments anyway ) , but that hosted solution has to store the data for you , process payments for you ( one reason why solutions like Gumroad , Shopify , or CoinTent can have competitive rates , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant necessarily transfer a subscription to you . I 'm not sure if this is planned for the CoinTent API ( accessing / transferring subscriptions ) , but its not always available for hosted solutions or apps . <p> I definitely agree that one of the beauties of self-hosted / open source plugins is the ability to own your data , but with that comes the responsibility for your site and its security . If you 're the kind of person that 's willing to take on the up front costs in set up , managing your own payment processing , investing ( potentially ) in PCI compliance , and being ultimately responsible for any site issues , then there are definitely tons of options available to you . <p> I think services like this are meant for a different person : perhaps someone who 's validating an idea to see if it gains traction ; someone who does n't  have any interest in managing their own payment processing and payments security , or troubleshooting potential incompatibilities that tend to arise between server + plugins + themes ( and having done more than enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / issues that youd never expect to arise , but that we see daily ) ; or someone who simply wants the easiest solution they can find . Hosted solutions mean you do n't  have to worry about updating your software or conflicts that can break important eCommerce functionality . <p> " With great power comes great responsibility , " as Uncle Ben used to say = . You can always gain more flexibility and control over your solution via a self-hosted platform , but then you take on the additional responsibilities associated with them , which ( while it may work for people like you and I who are comfortable doing so ) is n't for everyone . <p> Was keen to hear about other services besides cointent as there are many more WordPress solutions and I was researching options . What are your thoughts using pay walled membership plugins for example ? Or non PayPal solutions such as eWay ? <p> Hey Edwin , I think it depends on how much content you 're restricting , if you 're comfortable setting up your own payment processing with attention to security or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accounts on your site , and how detailed your restrictions need to be . There are definitely a lot of WordPress-specific solutions we 've got a category of posts devoted to them but I 'm in the camp that the site setup / your preference for responsibility dictate what you should choose . 11393 @qwx871393

They increase customer lifetime value , as they ensure that customers repeat purchases in your store . The Prospress blog has some fantastic examples of eCommerce businesses succeeding with a subscription model . <p> Product subscriptions are n't  just good for you they also offer convenience and value for your customers , as customers benefit from having products they use consistently delivered without a second though on their part .

For example , if you 'll be showing the subscription product only as part of a " subscribe and save " on the " individual purchase " products page , then you may want to hide the subscription version from your catalog .

@@98137945 @2337945/ <h> Improve SEO on WooCommerce Product Pages <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Search engine optimization ( SEO ) is the process of improving traffic to a website by ranking it higher on search engines for specific terms ( also called " keywords " ) . Youve probably heard " SEO " and " keywords " thrown around a lot . In this post , well go over some tips to improve SEO for your WooCommerce store , and two useful plugins to accomplish this . <p> But first , some terminology : <p> SEO : refers to the steps taken for a website in order to rank it higher on search engines ( like Google and Bing ) for specific keywords . This is primarily done through having useful content and easy site structure . SEO is largely structured around the user experience and quality information on a website . <p> Keywords : are specific terms that a site or its pages target to improve search optimization upon . For example , if your store sells leather goods , then you do n't  want your website to rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website pages will probably optimize around the keywords related to " leather " goods and products . <h> Improve SEO : 5 tips for product pages <p> Each page of your WordPress website can be optimized for unique keywords relevant to that page . This will help drive traffic to the appropriate page when people search for your site . For example , if somebody searches for your stores blog , search engines should rank your blog page higher than , say , your WooCommerce product pages . <p> For WooCommerce stores , here are a few things you can do to improve SEO for your product pages : <h> 1 . Keyword selection <p> Keywords are the building blocks for SEO . Use unique keywords to optimize content for each product . As example , if you sell leather wallets and handbags , then your wallet and handbag product pages should n't just be optimized for " leather " . Instead , make them specific " leather wallets " and " leather handbags " . This way , when someone searches for " leather wallets " , the handbags page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallets page . <p> When you 're brainstorming ideas for keywords , think about what people may search when they 're looking for your products . You can then include these keywords in your content , product description , title , meta description , etc. to increase SEO for that page . <h> 2 . Title and meta description <p> The title of the product page , and meta description are the two major things that appear on a search page . Try to include the keyword for that page in the title and the meta description . This helps rank the page higher for that keyword as it makes it clear for people what the page is about . <p> Title and meta description on Google <p> Try to keep both the title and the meta description relatively brief so that these appear in entirety on the search results , without the need to have an ellipses appear at the end . <p> For titles , try to keep the length between 50-60 characters . <p> For meta , try to keep the length between 150-160 characters . <h> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands voice to product pages by including meaningful and unique content for product descriptions . Instead of simply copy-pasting the manufacturers product description which is usually boring , and will be given to everybody else selling that product add your own version of the description that contains the keywords and is more user-friendly . <p> You can include specifics of your product like the model number , technical specifications , etc. but also include more general things that people will search who are n't  familiar with the product . <h> 4 . Images and image ALT tags <p> Make sure to include high-quality images of your products from different angles and from different use cases . An image gallery of a stores products is probably one of the first things people browse through to get an idea of the product , thereby spending more time on your page . This can have a positive effect on your sites usability and search ranking . <p> When search engines crawl through your page , they do n't  read any text in the image . This is where ALT tags come in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some context as to what the image is about . You can include unique text for each image that includes the keywords for that page to boost SEO . <p> In addition , the ALT tag is what screen-readers will verbalize in place of the image for visitors with visual disabilities , adding to the accessibility of your store . <h> 5 . Product reviews <p> Reviews can help your store in two main ways . First , people like to see what users of your products have to say about their experience . Reviews are like word-of-mouth that gives potential customers more than just your stores description of the product . People will tend to spend more time on your product page to read reviews instead of searching for reviews of your products elsewhere . <p> Second , product reviews help generate unique content that is specific to that product . Each reviewer brings their own voice and opinion of the product . <h> Improve SEO : Yoast SEO plugin <p> It can become hard to keep track of implementing the above tips on each page of your WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage your SEO strategy by building essential backend elements like XML sitemaps and OpenGraph implementation , and providing you an SEO checklist for each page on your store , including product pages . <p> Yoast SEO page checklist <p> For each page , you first assign a keyword .

@@98137946 @2337946/ <h> Generate Monthly WooCommerce Subscriptions Coupons with AutomateWoo <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Offering perks to your subscribers each month is a great way to provide value for your site subscriptions and limit churn , as members feel that they get benefits for every single monthly payment . A lot of subscription sites want to offer a limited discount ( i.e. , 10% an order per month ) or " gift " products ( i.e. , choose 3 free products from a category each month ) to their subscribers . <p> However , a better way to do this would be to integrate with the renewal payments from WooCommerce Subscriptions ( $199 ) this way , coupons or perks are only sent once a payment is completed each month . <p> As of AutomateWoo version 2.0 , you can now generate WooCommerce Subscriptions Coupons triggered by every renewal payment , which is perfect for subscription sites that want to offer continued perks in exchange for each subscription payment . <p> With this update , you can now provide a coupon for free products following each renewal payment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder on the next payment date , or trigger other workflows with a successful subscription payment , which is a wonderful feature addition for WooCommerce Subscriptions sites . <p> Let 's take a look at how we can use AutomateWoo to generate a unique , user-specific coupon each month to give a subscriber 3 free downloads each month . <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : Create Coupon Template <p> First , well need to create our coupon template . This will allow AutomateWoo to generate a unique coupon code for the subscriber , and it will use the setting from our coupon template along with adding an email restriction for the customers account . <p> I 'd recommend creating a product discount so that the coupon only applies to the products you want it to , and not to the entire cart . This way , if you have a 100% off product , you can discount that without giving customers other products for free , too . <p> Create Coupon Template <p> If the coupon only applies to certain products , do n't  forget to create usage restrictions for it putting products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful . <p> Create Usage Restrictions <p> Finally , if the coupon should have a usage limit ( i.e. , 3x usage ) , then add this as well to the template . <p> Configure Usage Limits <p> All of the template settings will be copied over by AutomateWoo when it generates the unique coupon code for your customer . <p> Now we can use this coupon template for all of our emails . While I 'm going to create a first email and then subsequent emails , you do not have to copy this process . In fact , if you want the same email sent for every subscription payment , just move on to the section for recurring coupon emails and forget my notes about " user tags " and the first email completely . <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : ( Optional ) Create User Tags <p> One thing I 'll leverage is AutomateWoos concept of user tags , which will let me add a tag for a subscriber and run workflows based on the existence of this tag . You do n't  have to use user tags to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this so I can identify a first coupon email vs subsequent coupon emails . <p> If you go to Users &gt; Tags , you can add tags for your users ( similar to a blog post tag ) , which you can then use in your workflows to check if a tag exists for the user or if its missing for the user . <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : First Coupon Email <p> Now I 'll set up my first email , which I want to be different from subsequent coupon emails . Ill welcome the member , and then tell them a bit about the coupon emails theyll get each month . This way , the member will not get a generic coupon email for the first purchase . <p> For the initial email , I 'm going to make sure the user is n't tagged with my subscriber tag , and I 'll add that tag with this workflow . I chose tags for a couple of reasons : <p> If I do n't  limit this workflow in some way , the " first " coupon email will be sent for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to limit it to only the first purchase since I want a unique " first " coupon email . <p> I do n't  want to set a limit per user in case the persons subscription is cancelled and they re-buy at a later time rather than renewing . Ill later remove the tag when the subscription is cancelled or expired so this workflow would then start up again if the subscription is re-bought . <p> If these reasons do n't  apply to you , feel free to scrap the user tags . Do n't  forget to determine when you want to send this email after the order status you 've selected . <p> Initial purchase trigger <p> Once I set up my trigger , I 'll add my actions . I can draft my email , using my coupon template to generate a unique code for the subscriber . <p> First Coupon Email <p> Ill also add the subscriber tag I mentioned , and can run any other actions I want here as well ( such as changing the order status to " completed " or adding the subscriber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now this email will only be dispatched for users who do n't  have the subscriber tag , which means renewal orders will not trigger this workflow , as the tag will already be added . The customers email will be sent according to your schedule , and will have all merge tags completed : <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : Recurring Coupon Emails <p> Now I 'll create my recurring emails . These will be triggered for every renewal payment for the subscription , and I 'll check for the " subscriber " tag . This will prevent the emails from being sent for the original order ( as the tag did n't  exist for the original order ) , but will trigger emails for every renewal . <p> Recurring Trigger <p> This email will be more generic , as its sent every month with a shiny new coupon code . I can even use the same coupon template as I did for my original email , as every email will generate a brand new code . <p> Recurring renewal email <p> If you wanted to send the same email for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments ) , you could only use this section , and skip the " user tagging " idea . This will simply trigger the same exact email for every payment without an initial " welcome " email . ( You could also trigger a separate " welcome " email if you wanted to do so . ) <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : Optional End of Subscription Workflow <p> Finally , as I 'd mentioned previously , I 'll want to remove the user tag if the subscription is expired or cancelled . This way , if its re-purchased , the tag will get re-added and then restarted the email lifecycle . <p> I can do that by triggering a final workflow on subscription status changes . <p> End of subscription trigger <p> And then removing the user tag as an action instead of adding a tag : <p> This workflow basically " resets " my email campaign so that repurchasing a subscription ( in case the customer does n't  just renew ) will still trigger emails and re-add the " subscriber " tag . <h> WooCommerce Subscriber Coupons : Summary <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for subscription sites . Lots of merchants want to give subscribers a number of free products per month , or provide a limited use discount ( for which WooCommerce Memberships does n't  fit the bill , as its intended to generate static discounts ) . <p> You have a ton of flexibility in how your workflows are triggered , and can use subscription status changes , payments ( or payment failures ) , and the trial period ending to trigger status updates , emails , user tagging , and other actions . This let 's you send emails timed with subscription renewals to keep in touch with your subscribers or provide their subscription perks only following successful payment . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Thanks a lot for that tutorial ! Just what I need to conclude my project ! One doubt:Am I able to generate two diferent coupons and put in the same monthly renewal automatic email ? Because I 'd like to offer 3 gift products of one category and just two for another . <p> We are going to give all our subscribers one uniqe coupon each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webpages . Therefore we need to generate codes from a bulk that we can export to other extern pages . <p> Hey Fredrik , so the generated coupons need to be tied to this email sent by AutomateWoo ? That changes things if they need to go out in the automated email vs just sent independently to customers . <p> I 'm not aware of a way you could use a " pool " of coupons with AutomateWoo if you can let it generate the codes , then export those codes to external system ( Smart Coupons will let you export codes ) , that 's probably the easiest . If this needed to be instant , you could either look into customizing AutomateWoo to use a certain coupon ( for which you could pre-generate codes ) instead of generating them itself , or customizing the coupon export to be triggered right away . <p> There 's no integration at present to generate vouchers on a schedule like there is with coupons . Looks like Subscriptions support is scheduled for PDF Vouchers though , so I 'd keep an eye on that changelog.

@@98137948 @2337948/ <h> How to Add Information to WooCommerce Emails <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce emails include each line item in an order by default within an " order items " table . This table is automatically included in almost every WooCommerce transactional email , and displays the product quantity , price , and total . <p> Default Email Order items <p> However , this is n't the only data that WooCommerce has available for the order items table in its emails . There are actually other pieces of product data that can be included , but they 're " turned off " by default . WooCommerce can include information like the SKU and product image very easily by switching the defaults for these pieces of data to " on " instead , letting you add more information to WooCommerce emails . <h> Add Product Images to WooCommerce Emails <p> WooCommerce includes the ability to add your product images to the order items within your shops transactional emails , and turning them on is possible via filter . <p> Well need to use the **31;384;TOOLONG filter to change which data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us change the default values for the items in the " Email Order Items " template so that we can make changes like turning SKUs on or turning on product images . <p> This filter passes in all of the default values for the email order items table . SKUs , purchase notes , images , and download links are all set to false ( " off " ) by default . WooCommerce conditionally handles turning some of these on itself , such as download links when downloadable access should be granted , but SKUs and images will need to be turned on manually . <p> Let 's first enable product images within our email order items template . We can do so my taking the data passed into this filter and returning it , but changing the showimage value to true instead with this snippet ( in a custom plugin or functions.php ) : <p> When this code is used , a 32px by 32px product image is automatically inserted in the order items table with WooCommerce emails : <p> Images added to email <p> This snippet could also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $imagesize for this value , we can pass in an array of sizes . The first number in the array will be the width , then the second number is the image height ( its best if you keep the aspect ratio for your product thumbnails , which is probably 1:1 ) . <p> Let 's change the image size to 150px by 150px instead of the default 32px by 32px . Change : <p> ' imagesize ' =&gt; $imagesize <p> to <p> ' imagesize ' =&gt; array ( 150 , 150 ) <p> This will give us larger images in the order items table within emails : <p> Large images included <p> This can let you show a picture to customers side by side with the product name in emails to confirm the purchase . <h> Add Product SKUs to WooCommerce Emails <p> Product SKUs can also be turned on easily within emails using the same snippet . If you enable SKUs within the email order items table , they will display as #sku ( the hash before the SKU will always be shown ) . <p> To enable SKUs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> to <p> ' showsku ' =&gt; true , <p> When SKUs are enabled , they 're added right after the product name . <p> Show SKUs in emails <p> Notice that I 've kept images enabled here , but you do n't  have to do so leave the snippet as <p> ' showimage ' =&gt; $showimage , <p> instead of <p> ' showimage ' =&gt; true , <p> if you do n't  want to show images . <p> As a final note on adding SKUs to emails , I dislike that they 're shown inline with the product name . We can use the woocommerceorderitemname to adjust the product name and add a line break after it easily : <h> Adding Information to WooCommerce Emails <p> While adding other information to your WooCommerce emails is possible , it requires more advanced customization to do so .

Since email-order-items.php is common to both email notifications templates ( customer and admin ) , the modifications in email-order-items.php will be visible by both users , and there 's some info relevant to admins , and that same info should n't be seen for the customers . <p> I have followed the instructions above and it does get the image to show in the email , but all of the information such as image/product title/sku/product attributes are all crammed together in one TD in my table . <p> How can I get it so the image is on top with the text underneath to make it look neater ? Or but the image in a TD or its own ? <p> With Woocommerce 2.5.2 the SKU shows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes to the customer . <p> What do I need to change so that the SKUs are shown in the customer email ? Also , the SKUs do not show in the customers account order details on the site . What do I need to change so that the SKUs are displayed ? <p> Oh , it was so easy . I do n't  know what I was worried about . I re-read your article and saw that I just needed to add the code to the functions.php file ( yes , I am using a child theme ) and it worked . <p> So now I have a question . I read elsewhere about the way to change things is by copying a woocommerce directory to the child theme and nesting down until I get to the file that needs to be changed . I thought that file was the email template email-order-details.php <p> If you can avoid overriding templates and changing via hooks instead , that 's usually preferable because the changes are upgrade-safe .

@@98137949 @2337949/ <h> How to Sell iThemes Exchange Umbrella Memberships <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Many memberships sites want the ability to separate content access from the membership purchase in order to allow one purchaser to " give out " memberships to other users . For example , a company may want to purchase 10 memberships for employees , and allow employees to redeem the membership without submitting a separate payment . <p> However , there 's a new plugin to allow you to create a group membership system with iThemes Exchange : Exchange Umbrella Memberships from Iron Bound Designs . Well take a look at how the plugin let 's you set up a group membership with billing managed by one customer , but access given out to several members . <h> Exchange Umbrella Memberships : Overview <p> Setting up Exchange umbrella memberships will allow us to sell a membership product , and if umbrella membership are enabled , purchasing multiple quantities of that product will let the purchaser " give away " additional memberships . <p> The memberships given away ( I 'll call them " child memberships " ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge is cancelled or refunded , all child membership access will stop . The purchaser can also remove child members for the duration of the membership and replace them with others as desired . <p> This is a fantastic way to sell company memberships like course access , product purchasing access , or conference access ( especially if the conference has associated online content ) , as child memberships can be managed , removed , and replaced very easily . <p> If your site will use other Exchange add-ons , I 'd highly recommend looking at the Exchange Pro Pack ( $197 ) as well , which will give you access to the Membership Add-on , Recurring Payments , and a bunch of other add-ons built by the iThemes team . You 'll still need to purchase the Umbrella Memberships add-on separately , but it gives you tons of other great tools . <h> iThemes Exchange Umbrella Memberships : Setup <p> If you 've never used the Exchange Memberships or Recurring Payments add-ons , we previously reviewed them here . I 'm going to assume you have these plugins set up ( which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and then well move on to setting up the Umbrella Memberships plugin . <p> Set up is super-simple , as you 'll only need to customize the plugins email content , and the documentation provides a great resource for additional details . You can change the content for : <p> Invitation Email sent to members when they 're invited to an umbrella membership and already have a site account . <p> Invitation &amp; New User Email sent to members when they 're invited to an umbrella membership and have had an account created for them . <p> Removed Email sent to members when they 're removed from an umbrella membership . <p> Expired Email sent to members when their membership has expired . <p> The default emails are pretty good already , but if you want to change them , there 's a list of template tags that should help . <p> Umbrella Memberships Setup <p> Once you 've customized your email content , you can save the settings , and the hard work is over = <h> iThemes Exchange Umbrella Memberships : Creating Umbrella Memberships <p> Now you 'll need to create your umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership-type product in your store , as the " Umbrella Memberships " menu will be added to these products . All you 'll need to do is enable umbrella memberships for the membership product . <p> Product Settings <p> Once this is enabled , anytime a customer purchases multiple quantities of this product , the customer will be able to " gift " out the additional memberships to other users by entering the user name and email to create " child " memberships . The child memberships will not have any control over their own billing , and will completely respond to the billing of the purchaser . <h> iThemes Exchange Umbrella Memberships : Customer Experience <p> When purchasing an umbrella membership , the customer simply has to adjust the quantity of the membership product . This will trigger an umbrella membership ( for purchases of greater than 1 ) , and the customer will then be able to gift memberships . <p> Purchasing Umbrella Memberships <p> Once the purchase is completed , the customer can now manage his umbrella membership from the account area . Under the membership , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the child members name and email . <p> Managing Umbrella Memberships <p> If the user already exists for the child members email , the membership will be created and an email will be sent ; as soon as the user logs in , the membership access will be available . If a user with that email does not exist , then a new user account will be created , and the invite email will have details to finish account creation and accept the membership . <p> Any child members will see who purchased the membership when viewing it from their own accounts . <p> A " Child " member <p> The " account owner " ( umbrella membership purchaser ) can remove or add child members at any time for the duration of the membership . <h> iThemes Exchange Umbrella Memberships : Other Notes <p> The set up and ease of use of the Umbrella Memberships plugin is fantastic , and I was able to tie Umbrella Memberships into my existing Exchange store in minutes . The set up and simplicity is definitely a huge benefit to using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really any admin management around memberships , though this is a critique of the core Exchange Memberships plugin moreso than Umbrella Memberships . You cant manually add or expire memberships with Exchange Memberships , and thus you cant add or remove umbrella memberships for a particular user ( i.e. , gifting an additional child membership to a company ) . <p> If a user wants to purchase additional child memberships , I do like that they can easily do so by purchasing more memberships , and the " seats " for child members will automatically be added in the customers account . However , the " umbrella " part of the membership is triggered by purchasing quantities greater than " 1 " , so seats will only be added if the purchaser buys 2 or more additional memberships . <h> Selling Umbrella Memberships with Exchange <p> The Exchange Umbrella Memberships plugin is a simple , intuitive way to sell " group " or company memberships so that one user can manage billing while giving out access to and managing " child " members . While its limited in some respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admin management of members ) , it fits into the purchasing workflow and customer experience very nicely , and makes it simple for your customers to manage their child memberships . <p> The integration will billing is great , and is even better than Exchange Memberships itself , as cancelled or refunded subscriptions will cancel child membership access seamlessly . Emails for membership invites and cancellations are also handy for notifying child members of changes , as they wo n't have access to billing . <p> At $119 , its a great tool for membership sites to expand their offering and make it flexible for companies or groups to manage their child memberships. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98137950 @2337950/ <p> Helpful tips on increasing average order value in your shop , as well as plugins and tools to implement these tips . <p> A lot of the focus on increasing revenue is directed towards either increasing your traffic to get more potential buyers , or towards increasing your conversion rate to increase the number of potential buyers who actually purchase . <p> Increasing traffic typically has high acquisition costs associated with it for advertisements or promotions , so optimizing current traffic can be more cost effective . While conversion rate optimization is definitely a great way to make the most of the traffic you already get , there 's another way you can optimize current traffic to increase revenue without increasing traffic or conversions : increase your average order value ( AOV ) . <p> Average order value is pretty self-explanatory : its the average value of every order in your shop . You can calculate it by dividing your total revenue for a period by your number of orders in that period . If you 're having trouble getting more orders ( by either driving more traffic or increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do get is a great way to increase your bottom line . <p> Were going to do a short series on strategies to increase Average Order Value so that you can immediately implement improvements in your store . This article will cover helpful tips and strategies . Well then publish articles to show you how to use these strategies in your store the exact plugins or tools you 'll need to do so for stores using WooCommerce , WP eCommerce , Easy Digital Downloads , or Shopp. <h> 1 . Use Free Shipping Thresholds <p> Let 's say your average order value is currently $41 . To raise this value , you can offer free shipping or discounts that are only available for orders of $50 or more , encouraging customers to hit this limit . <p> The trick is to use a threshold close to your average order value so that you incentivize customers who would n't otherwise meet it . If you set the threshold at $100 with an AOV of $41 , many customers are likely to blow it off since they 're not close to spending that amount anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivate 7 in 10 shoppers according to some statistics on free shipping from Deloittes holiday survey : <p> 71% of customers say they 're more likely to purchase from retailers that offer free shipping <p> 40% say theyll buy more items to qualify for free shipping . <p> To be honest , I found myself doing this for an online order less than two weeks ago I planned to buy 2 items , but figured I might as well buy 3 for the free shipping . <p> An excellent Journal of Retailingstudy on shipping rates confirms that this is typical behavior , as a " free shipping for large orders " policy yields the largest order values in comparison to other shipping policies and discounts : <p> In sum , both existing and first time customers respond to order size incentives and higher base shipping fees lead to larger orders . <h> 2 . Use Discount Thresholds <p> This follows the same principle as the free shipping threshold , but you could offer a discount instead of free shipping . This can be a coupon code you advertise on your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets your threshold . here 's a case study in which discounts tied to a minimum order amount increased sales by 25% . <p> Approximately 34.1% of respondents aged 25-34 preferred online discounts over free shipping , making them the largest demographic to favor online discounts . Conversely , only 18.5% of that age group preferred free shipping over online discounts , making them the smallest group to prefer free shipping . <p> The trick with discounting is to make sure that the discount does n't  the lower the order value below your current average . For example , if my average order value is currently $41 and I set a discount for orders above $50 , it does n't  make much sense to then provide a 20% discount or higher , as this drops my AOV back to where it was . You may want to set discount thresholds higher than free shipping thresholds , or provide tiered discounts e.g. , spend more , save more : <p> spend $50 = 5% discount <p> spend $75 = 10% discount <p> and so on <h> 3 . Provide Volume Discounts <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of requiring the entire order to meet a certain amount , you can give discounts for purchasing products in larger quantities to encourage bulk purchase . For example , here 's a VWO case study in which bulk discounts increased AOV by 18.94% . <p> Volume discounts are n't  a great fit for everyone , as it depends on what kind of product you sell . If you sell products that customers will typically buy more than one of , they can be a solid strategy for increasing order value . For example , if you sell nail polish , customers will typically want multiple colors , so you can offer a discount for purchasing 3 or more polishes . <p> First , determine the average quantity purchased of a particular product in your shop . If customers typically purchase only one of an item , its probably not a good candidate for a volume discount . If customers purchase 2-3 of an item regularly , this is probably a good item to offer volume discounts for you can start discounting at 3-5 items to encourage purchasing larger quantities at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart quantity of items purchased , and provide a bulk discount based on the cart quantity instead , though this is sometimes harder to implement depending on which eCommerce plugin you use . <h> 4 . Bundle Related Products <p> Product bundling can encourage customers to purchase a bundle of a product that contains a product they 're already looking to purchase . By encouraging the customer to purchase the bundle , you can increase the order value by selling products you may not have otherwise sold . Bundles can also be helpful for customers , as they typically contain related products , such as cases for headphones or cameras . <p> Amazon Product Bundle <p> According to Harvard Business Review , bundling tends to favor the seller , which is good news . Bundling reframes the pricing of each part of the bundle in terms of total value of the overall package rather than forcing the customer to evaluate the value of each line item individually . <p> A good example is free breakfast bundled with a hotel stay : while a customer may not balk at a difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include breakfast , a $20 breakfast for one person may seem expensive when evaluated as a stand-alone purchase . <p> Your stand-alone products also assist with this to act as a price anchor for the bundles . If the single product is $100 and its part of a bundle at $120 which includes a few other products , the bundle has a higher perceived value and looks more attractive to purchase , even if customers may not have been looking to buy the other products in the bundle . <p> Typically bundles come with a discount , but the amount of the discount can be nominal . For example , a study on the effects of bundling strategy from Virginia Tech showed that 5% discounts performed as well as 20% discounts for bundles : <p> The results indicated that as long as a discount is offered , consumers perceive a 5% and a 20% discount as similar in value adding to a package any price discount ( either a 5% discount or a 20% discount ) is a bonus and increases the value perception . <h> 5 . Upsell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , so this probably wont be a new concept . However , what does it actually mean ? If you 're new to upselling and cross-selling , or are n't  sure how to implement them , Shopify has a great introduction explaining the differences and when each is a good fit . <p> Upsells let you offer customers an improved or higher " tiered " version of an item . Let 's say you sell flash drives : for a 32GB flashdrive , you can offer an upsell for a 64GB flashdrive . This asks the customer to evaluate the price of both , and determine if they want to " upgrade " the purchase for the higher ticket item . <p> Upselling on the product page is usually a great way to prompt customers to compare the product to its upsell , as chances are that the customer will not purchase both products , so an upsell is typically framed as a choice . Customers may be willing to purchase a higher ticket item if it appears to be a good comparative value , and simply asking or offering this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross-sells let you offer customers compatible or related products , and therefore are great to offer on the product and cart / checkout pages . The concept behind cross-selling can be similar to bundling it let 's you offer related products , and can be helpful to the customer as a way of saying , " Here , you may also like or want this as part of your purchase . " here 's a great example of a cross-sell I came across recently : <p> As most customers who purchase foundation will need a way to apply it , recommending a brush to apply it is helpful to the customer , and can prompt an additional purchase that may not have occurred . <h> 6 . Create a Loyalty Program <p> Creating a loyalty program is a great way to reward customers , but it can also help drive average order values since customers feel like they get something in return for their purchase . <p> Loyalty programs are great for building loyalty and repeat purchases , but you can also use loyalty points in the same way that you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher order values , such as 300 extra bonus points for all orders over $60 , or for your higher ticket items . <p> This is another way to encourage customers to spend more and meet order thresholds , and its typically a low-cost incentive to offer . <h> 7 . Sell Add-ons or Services <p> You can sell add-ons or additional services on both product pages and at checkout . These can be small fees that have little or no costs to you , but will provide value to the customer . <p> On product pages , you can offer add-ons like : <p> personalization or monogramming <p> companion services such as applying a screen protector for a phone purchase <p> At checkout , you may want to offer additional services that can also boost the revenue generated from the order : <p> rush shipping or handling ( which really means , " go to the front of the shipping queue " ) <p> shipping insurance <p> gift wrapping <p> add-on or sample products <p> For example , if you sell beauty products or toiletries like foundation , shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product page or checkout for a travel-size of the same item if available . ( Can you tell I 've been makeup shopping lately ? ) <p> While this example uses complimentary items , a similar set up would be great to sell sample or travel-sized items : <p> This can let customers test out new products for a future purchase at a minimal costs , or offer a helpful add-on ( as I probably want a travel-size item just like my " home " item ) . <h> 8 . Raise Prices <p> Have you raised your prices lately ? Have they stayed the same for 1-2 years ? You may want to consider incrementally raising prices each year on your products . I 'm sure your operational costs go up periodically , and you can reflect these increased costs in your product prices so they do n't  eat in to your margins . <p> A good time of year to do this is before holiday sales . As you 'll probably be discounting all products in your store for the holiday season , raising your regular / non-sale price at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then discounting items for holiday sales , ensures that customers wont " feel " the effects of this price increase immediately , but theyll still see the " new " regular price so its not a shock . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Its tough to launch your eCommerce business , but marketing and customer acquisition are actually where the real battle begins . <h> 1 .

This way , you wo n't spend time recruiting and managing affiliates . You also wo n't have to worry about updates or maintaining the software . <p> You can read a bit more about the pros and cons of using ShareASale from WPBeginner , but some of the cons are that it will be expensive to set up ( at least $550 ) , and that you 're bound by the programs capabilities ( no extensions / add-ons here ) . <p> If you 'd like to recruit and manage affiliates yourself , or extend the capabilities of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's a review ) .

You may not want certain types of sites promoting your shop , such as those that are sexually explicit or those that contain libelous or defamatory materials . <p> Can I buy advertisements for search phrases that use your trademark ? I 'd recommend disallowing this . For example , if SellwithWP had an affiliate program , I could state that affiliates can not bid on the search term " SellwithWP " , " sell with wp " , or similar . <p> What can I use to promote your product ? Give affiliates a list of approved methods , or a list of banned promotion methods . For example , you may want to allow affiliates to use blog posts , advertisements on their own site , social media promotion , email and newsletter campaigns , or other forms of marketing . Conversely , you may just want to ban certain forms of marketing , such as PPC campaigns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should I use your assets ? I 'd recommend that you approve any images used in marketing your products if affiliates do n't  want to use your banners rather than allowing anything they want . <p> What violates your affiliate policy ? Be clear in practices that you do n't  accept , such as making purchases via your own affiliate link . <p> When will I be paid ? Clarify any minimum payout amounts , such as , " $50 needed for payout " , as well as when payouts are expected . You may want to hold payments for a minimum of 30 days to account for returns or invalid purchases . <p> For example , Amazon has a highly successful affiliate program , and they prohibit PPC campaigns that bid on their trademarks or misspellings of those trademarks. <h> 4 . Provide Assets for Affiliates <p> Along the same vein as your affiliate policy , you should also have brand assets available for affiliates to use to promote your products . This will make promotion easy on your affiliates , as they have images and text links pre-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Gravity Forms provides banners and images for affiliates to use . <p> You can also allow affiliates to use their own assets upon approval . This way , you know exactly how your store is being represented in advertisements or other images . You can provide a style guide of brand colors and logos to use so that affiliates are able to ensure consistency with your brand image . <h> 5 . Provide a Compelling Reason for Sales <p> Affiliate marketers are essentially a commission-only sales force . While this mitigates your risk since you only pay for real sales and not leads , it also means that they have to have a compelling reason to help sell your product or drive traffic to your store . As a result , extremely low commission rates may not attract marketers to your store . <p> Shopify has some great advice here : affiliates are bringing new customers , not just sales , so look at paying out affiliate commissions in terms of your overall customer value rather than the profits it eats into on a single sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while setting referral rates . <p> You can always experiment with rate , but it should depend on your profit margin per-product and customer LTV . You also may want to consider whether or not you would have had these sales otherwise , and how much that new customer will be worth over time to determine the appropriate rate or amount for commissions . <h> 6 . Incentivize More Sales <p> Once you 've got affiliates in your network , you can incentivize sales of your products and leads to your store . There are several tactics you can take to encourage affiliates to send quality traffic your way , and ways to reward them for great performance . <p> You can also make coupons exclusive to affiliates with ShareASale so that they get a referral for discounts used in the same way . <p> Adjusting rates for high performers can also be done with both platforms . You can set a specific rate for an affiliate that 's higher than the default referral rate to encourage sales from that affiliate , or to reward them for sending high-quality leads . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a prize let 's say that you reward the affiliate with the highest conversion rate each month ( provided they have 3 or more sales ) . You can set a higher rate for the next month as a bonus and keep your affiliates in the loop about who has won . <p> Want to drive traffic towards a particular product ? You can increase the per-product referral rate , though this is far easier to do with AffiliateWP than ShareASale . However , this only works with WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads currently while using AffiliateWP . You can also use this to disable referrals for a particular product if needed , but be sure to make your affiliates aware of this policy . <p> AffiliateWP and ShareASale can both do recurring referrals ( AffiliateWP is currently expanding which integrations support this add-on ) so that affiliates can be rewarded monthly while a customer is subscribed to your plan , site , or membership . <h> Tips to Use Affiliate Marketing : In Summary <p> Affiliate marketing can be an excellent way to drive sales to your eCommerce store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new customers to your product . While there are some tips and insights you should bear in mind when creating an affiliate program to ensure its success , its fairly easy to expand your sales team with commission-only affiliate marketers . <p> AffiliateWP and ShareASale both provide excellent solutions for shops looking to use affiliate marketing networks to promote themselves . While there are tradeoffs to using each platform , you 'll be able to create an affiliate network that fits your shop and sales needs . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> One thing Ive been doing for our product , Conductor , is creating more co-branded assets for our affiliates .

@@98137955 @2337955/ <h> Ask Us : How to Sell WooCommerce Product Groups <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We had n't  published any Ask Sell with WP questions for some time , so were catching up on a copy from last week and this week . <p> Todays question is from Duriez : <p> My WooCommerce site sells 5 types of wine but we make shipping by a box of 6 bottles . Is there a way way get customers order any wine but they have to order in groups of 6 ? So in checkout , we have to be able to have order multiples of 6 bottles with the 5 different products . Minimum order of 6 . No maximum . <p> Selling WooCommerce product groups definitely doable , and there are a few ways to approach this problem depending on how your minimum quantity should be enforced . <p> The WooCommerce Min/Max Quantities plugin ( $29 ) will help out with a couple potential set ups , and its a nifty little plugin for setting order minimums , maximums , and product groupings ( i.e. , order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order Minimum Quantity <p> Min/Max Quantities can easily set order quantity minimums . If wine is the only product in the shop being sold in this scenario , then limiting the order to minimums of 6 bottoms will be very straightforward . <p> The plugin documentation is very helpful for this and has tons of screenshots . In order to set up an order minimum , you can set the " Minimum order quantity " field under WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products &gt; General : <p> This will restrict any order to require a minimum of 6 total items in the cart . <p> With that said , what if other products aside from wine are being sold in the store ? Well need a category restriction instead , which our next two scenarios will cover . <h> WooCommerce Product Groups : Require Category Groups <p> Min/Max Quantities can also sell your products in category groups . If you only want to sell the wine in multiples of 6 bottles , then you can create a category group by editing the product category and setting the " Group of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any product in the " Wine " category , and will allow purchases of 6 , 12 , 18 , etc bottles at one time , requiring both a category minimum and groups of 6 to order . <h> WooCommerce Product Groups : Require Category Minimum <p> Now the final scenario : what if you want to require only a category minimum ? For example , you want to require 6 products from the " wine " category , but allow any quantity above this amount ? <p> This is where it gets tricky to do , as I 'm not aware of any plugin that handles this use-case ( Min/Max Quantities only does category groups , not minimums ) . <p> This seemed like an interesting problem to tackle , so I wrote up a tiny custom code snippet to do just this . You should only use this snippet if you know how to add custom code to your site , as it worked for me in my test store but I 'm not taking responsibility for your site = <p> This snippet consists of two functions : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a particular category , and one function to compare that amount our category minimum , then render a notice and block checkout if it does n't  meet the minimum . <p> For those of you interested in how WooCommerce restricts or allows checkout , there 's a really easy way to block checkout : render a notice with the " error " type in the cart check , as WooCommerce will throw its own Exception at checkout to stop the checkout from occurring if an error notice is present . <p> Ill use this to my advantage to render a notice if my category quantity is below my minimum quantity . <p> First , the function to get the category quantity in the cart : well get the quantities of the line items , check the category for each line item , and if it belongs to our desired category , well add it to the running " category total " . <p> Now , let 's use this function to compare it against a minimum . You wont have to change a single thing about the above function , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the next function , you 'll adjust the minimum quantity and your desired category I 'd . Well compare our minimum to the category count in the cart , and throw our error notice if we have n't met the minimum . <p> That 's all we need ! This function will pass the right information to our " get category quantity " function , so the only values you need to change at all are $minquantity and $categoryid . <p> Now if I have less than my minimum in the cart , the cart page will have a notice explaining what 's required : <p> WooCommerce helpfully notices that there 's and error , and prevents checkout until whatever set off this error notice disappears . <p> Once the category count meets my minimum , the notice is removed , and the customer can proceed with checkout normally . <p> You could certainly modify this for multiple product categories , or all product categories if desired . Feel free to borrow this code -- the full snippet is here -- or use it as a starting point . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customization jobs like this . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98137956 @2337956/ <h> How to Create a WooCommerce Custom Order Status <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We 'd previously written about how to create a custom WooCommerce order status , but this tutorial has become outdated with the WooCommerce 2.2 release . Since some of our readers asked for an update , we 've re-written this tutorial to reflect how to add a custom order status , WooCommerce 2.2-style . <p> If you 're using WooCommerce 2.1.12 or earlier , you 'll want to check out our previous tutorial to do so . This tutorial will focus on creating WooCommerce 2.2-compatible custom order statuses . <h> WooCommerce Custom Order Status <p> While WooCommerce includes several different order statuses , these may not fit the flow for your shop . With WooCommerce core , you can mark orders with one of the following statuses : <p> Completed <p> Processing <p> Pending payment <p> On hold <p> Refunded <p> Cancelled <p> Failed <p> However , some shops need more order statuses , such as " Awaiting shipment " , " Building " , or others to fit their fulfillment needs . You can easily add these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go over how to both add a WooCommerce custom order status and to remove an order status . <h> Adding a WooCommerce Custom Order Status <p> In WooCommerce 2.1 or earlier , order statuses were stored as a taxonomy for the " Order " post type . WordPress taxonomies are categorizations , such as post categories and tags . However , WooCommerce 2.2 required a change to the order structure to support partial and automatic refunds from the WooCommerce admin . Order statuses are now saved as a custom post status , just like draft , scheduled , or published for posts . <p> Adding a custom post status necessitates a bit more code now than it did for WooCommerce 2.1 , but this is actually a bit more straight-forward from a development perspective ( you do n't  have to run the code once then delete it ) . Be sure to properly add this code to your site I 'd recommend creating a plugin or using the Code Snippets plugin . I wrote tutorials on how to add custom code to your site in this post and in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you impatient folks = . This will add an " Awaiting shipment " order status to your shop . Ill then break it down to explain what each part of this snippet does . <p> This function is registering our custom status as a post status in WordPress . You can rename the function to suit your needs , but were going to build an " Awaiting shipment " order status , so we 've called it **37;473;TOOLONG to reflect this . <p> We then build the post status using the WordPress registerpoststatus() function . Notice that the first thing in this function is the slug for our order status , prefixed by " wc- " for " WooCommerce " . If you want a different name for your order status , you 'll want to change this to a hyphenated , all lower-cased slug , such as wc-building or wc-packing-order . <p> Your custom status slug can only be a maximum of 20 characters , including dashes ( as per the codex on registerpoststatus ) , so you need to be aware of this when creating your own slug . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data that defines our custom post status . The label is what will be displayed , so you can change that to the exact name of your order status . You 'll then also want to insert this in the labelcount instead of " Awaiting shipment " , but leave the rest of this array unchanged . <p> Finally , the action at the end runs this function and adds this order status to WordPress as our custom post status . <p> The **36;512;TOOLONG function is going to add this new custom post status into the list of available order statuses within the WooCommerce " Orders " and " Edit Orders " pages so that we can actually use it . We want to pass in the current order statuses so that we can go through them and insert our order status into the list where wed like it . <p> We create an array for our new order statuses first , which will be our final product . Well then go through all order statuses and insert our own , so that by the time we spit out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is included . <p> The foreach loop here goes through the list of current order statuses until we find the one we want . In this case , I 'm going to insert " Awaiting shipment " after the " Processing " order status . That 's what the if() part is doing here we say , " If the order status is processing , add in Awaiting shipment here , then continue going through order statuses . " <p> Notice that I use the slug and label I created in the first function to add this order status . Ill now have " Awaiting shipment " displayed after " Processing " for my orders : <p> You can insert your new status after any of the existing statuses you can find a list of them here . For example , I could have looked for wc-pending instead and added my status after that . <p> That 's it ! You can now add your own status and insert it anywhere into the order status list . <h> Removing a WooCommerce Order Status <p> If you 'd like to remove your custom order status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . If you 're using the Code Snippets plugin , you can simply deactivate the snippet . If you do so , your order statuses will default to " Pending payment " . <p> However , orders using your new status may not appear in your orders list when the code is removed since they 're using an unrecognized post status . I 'd recommend changing the order statuses to a core status before deactivating or removing this snippet . The orders will still exist regardless , and you could navigate to them directly using the post i 'd , but they wont be recognized in the Orders list without this code unless they use a core order status . <p> I 'm not going to go over how to remove any of the core order statuses , because this is a very bad idea . Even if you think you may not use any of them , most plugins ( especially payment gateways or other plugins that tie to orders ) , expect them to be there . <p> For example , you may not think you 'll need the " Pending payment " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the default order status until a valid payment is confirmed . For example , PayPal or other gateways that use IPNs to notify your site that a payment has been completed use " Pending payment " , then the status is updated to processing once the payment is received . For many extensions to work correctly , these core statuses must all be available even if you do n't  actively use them in your fulfillment cycle . <h> Read More <p> That 's all there is to adding a WooCommerce custom order status ! Credit goes to Max Rice for most of the code , and to me for explaining it = . If you want to see a slightly simpler approach , here 's another snippet that will help you achieve this from one of the WooCommerce lead developers , Claudio Sanches. 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 58 Comments <p> Thanks for this update ! However , Ive run into some serious issues implementing it . <p> I made two new order statuses . They show up in my list , but I 'm having trouble saving the orders with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different everytime the wp-includes/plugin.php got blamed once and then wp-includes/cache.php got blamed another time ) and then when I try to go back , the order has disappeared entirely ! Its happening on my local setup as well as ( unfortunately ) my clients page . I know the orders have not disappeared from the database , but for some reason WooCommerce is n't registering them as orders anymore . <p> I cant make new orders with those order statuses either . <p> I thought it might be my caching plugin , and I deactivated that , but no dice so far . Any help would be appreciated ! <p> Actually I figured it out I had to deactivate all of my plugins first , then reactivate them to load the custom order statuses correctly . Weird ! <p> I also had to find my lost orders in the wpposts table in the database via phpMyAdmin , then change them manually to a default order status to get them to show up again . I was then able to save them with my custom status . What a pain , haha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plugins but its not working . The order no longer shows up in the list and if I refresh the View Order page , it shows the slug , not the label , as the order status . <p> So evidently , as someone mentioned below , the post type can not exceed a certain number of characters ( mine was cutting off at 17 ) . I had to change " wc-awaiting-shipment " to " wc-shipped " and I also shortened the function names . I did also have to go into PHP MyAdmin to find the orders that got labeled wrong from the first time and change their statuses manually . <p> I have one more question though : Is there a way to add a button to the Actions column of the main orders list ? It would be nice not to have to actually go into each order just to mark them as " Shipped . " <p> Hey Doug , the best way to do it would probably be to do an upgrade routine to convert old taxonomies to new post statuses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if theyd blow up , and thankfully they did n't  = . The post status is listed as " publish " rather than as an order status , so you can still access orders and change to a core status , but I think an upgrade routine instead would work well here . I plan on messing around and writing one if I find some free time this week I 'll add a link if I do . <p> Hi , Thanks for your post . I want that if I change the order status to " Awaiting Shipment " , an email should be sent to the customer as an email sent when we change the order status to " Completed " . I mean to say that it should be custom order status with email notification to customer . <p> Hey David , this sounds like there 's a plugin/server conflict somewhere , as I 've not seen this on any test / live site . I 'd recommend deactivating plugins then activating one-by-one to see where the conflict comes from . <p> As for emails , that becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statuses + linked emails for a status to do this since youre not the first person to have that question = . <p> Hi Beka ! I placed an order manually . Total is equal to zero G. This happened because I set it as " Awaiting payment " , but after a few hours woocommerce set it as " expired " . Useless to say that I hate this thing Is there a way to change order totals ? I hope so = <p> I 'm wondering is there an easy way to add a custom icon to the admin columns thru css , like the other order statuses have ( blue tick etc ) . There is a unique class in the tr for the new status I have created but is there an easy way to load in some custom css to style it ? <p> woohoo ! Glad to hear its worked out = . The company I work for has also just released a plugin that will do this ( add statuses , icons , and order status actions ) as well for those of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more integrated order status workflow : WooCommerce Order Status Manager . <p> cant see your screenshot , but this is definitely still working for me . I 'd double check the second function in the snippet to make sure nothing was missed , as that 's where the status is inserted into the list ( slug is right , no missing semicolons , etc ) . <p> it 's possible to make a custom " delivered " with same abilities as statut completed ' for review ? in my website , only customer bought product can leave a review . in woocommerce the review is only avaible with the statut completed ' when you check " only customer can review " i want add a statut delivered ' and want this statut can be set to allow member to review product . <p> Hey Martin , I 'd recommend checking out this plugin , as the order statuses you add can be added to reports , have custom icons , be used in emails , etc. , as the code to include them in reports is a bit more involved . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for single order status , I want to create atleast 10 custom order status , so i am thinking instead of writing it 10 times can we manage it in single function ? so that we can create multiple order status . <p> a ) This is n't really possible at present , nor is it something that a plugin should change since its a massive departure from core behavior that would affect payment gateways , shipping , etc . We 've suggested this set up in the past , and I 'd recommend keeping an eye on this issue . b ) Sure , this article will probably be helpful = <p> It works . Sort of . How to set an icon for new order status ? For hold there is in circle , for completed there is check in circle . For new one there is nothing . What is more important how to make custom email for this status because in WC options there is none after using this code . <p> Hey Piotr , youd need a lot more code around this to trigger emails and fully integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorials . I 'd recommend checking out the Order Status Manager plugin ( $49 ) , which does all of what you 're asking . <p> I have made my custom order status thanks to your tutorial:D , but i need to have an automated email notification ( actually the customer invoice email action ) when the order changes to mycustomorderstatus . I have found this snippet but it does not work . <p> Hi I followed this tutorial to create awaiting shipment custom status and it worked perfectly . However , when I added another custom status ( Partially Refunded ) , I can see it in the drop down menu on the order page , but if I try and save the order with this new status , the status goes back to Complete upon save Any ideas or advise why this might be ?

@@98137957 @2337957/ <h> Selling Custom Files with WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Most any eCommerce platform can make it simple to sell a downloadable file to your customers , but what if that file is part of a service ? For example , what if your customers purchase a custom logo design or voiceover work for a video ? <p> You wont be able to provide the file link at the time of purchase , and will instead provide it at a later time after the order is placed . Once the file is removed from the product and is instead tied to the order , it becomes very difficult to add and manage files to share with your customers . <p> We tried to tackle this concept a bit in a previous post on sending download links to customers after purchase , but this requires the use of a customer-facing order note , which is n't available in most eCommerce plugins , and requires you to just drop a plan link to an email . <p> You can still use a customer order note to inform the customer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a bit more finesse over managing the files you share with the customer . Let 's take a look at a slightly more advanced way sell custom files your customers . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce : Overview <p> Were going to focus on WooCommerce in this tutorial because its very simple to add custom fields to an order , display them to the customer , and notify the customer of changes . Well also need another free plugin to help us manage our customers files : Download Monitor . <p> If you do n't  use Download Monitor , the only real file management for customers exists as part of a product . If you want to add downloadable files to an order , you 'd have to create a unique ( private ) product for every custom job you do , then add that to the " Download Permissions " for the order . This gets to be hard to manage very quickly . <p> Download Monitor is going to add a layer of file management that will help us restrict downloads , manage file versions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce product for every customer . It does n't  tie into WooCommerce by default , but we can use an order custom field to do this for us . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce : Create Your Product <p> Step 1 : create your WooCommerce product(s) for your custom digital service . Well make this a virtual product that will let us collect payment from our customer and create an order , but we wo n't need to tie any downloadable files to this product . Well be adding them to Download Monitor instead later . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce : Create Your Download <p> Step 2 : Configure Download Monitor and create a new Download for every custom job . This has the benefit of making downloads simple to manage in your site while separating them from your products . <p> First , I 'm going to adjust my download template to the " Version list " I want to show this in the " View Order " part of the account section . You can adjust other settings as desired here . <p> Change Download Template <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For every revision I make , I can add a new file as an updated version . A version can also contain multiple files , which is handy if you 'll have several components of a version to share , like both horizontal and vertical versions of the logo . <p> Versions are very helpful if you 'll need some back and forth with your customer , as they can access different versions as part of the same download . <p> The great thing about Download Monitor is that you can also restrict downloads to logged in users . This means that the regular download link will not work for a guest user , and will only work for a logged in customer on your site . <p> Create Download for the Order <p> If a non-logged-in user tries to use a download link that 's been shared with them , theyll be redirected to the " No access " page ( you can adjust the message in the settings ) . <p> All addition of your files and updates will take place on the download . This way , you can manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always keep the same download I 'd , so you wont need to constantly update your order . <p> Take note of your download I 'd , and head over to your customers order . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce : Add Download I 'd to the Order <p> here 's why I like using Download Monitor for selling custom files : all I have to do tie my download to the order is add one custom field . This let 's me share the latest version or all versions , I can share multiple files as part of a single version easily , and I can limit downloads to logged in users . <p> In the order " Custom Fields " box , add a new custom field titled customfile ( you 'll have to click " Enter New " the first time you do this ) . For the order , enter the I 'd of your download . <p> Add Download I 'd to order <p> This will tie the order to your download , and now well add a couple small code snippets to make these accessible to your customers . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer sees the " Recent Orders " list in the account section , let 's add an action button ( only if the order is paid for ) to download the most recent version of the file(s) . You can add this where you keep your custom code . <p> ( If you do n't  want the first check for paid orders , feel free to remove it ! ) <p> This code will add an action button to my orders list only if the order is paid for , and if I 've added the customfile field to the order . <p> Add " Get Files " action <p> Now customers can download the most recent version of my file(s) with one click . <p> We may want to show all revisions , so we can also add the files to the " View Order " screen . If a customer clicks the " View " action , let 's show a list of all versions to the customer . <p> We can do so with a bit of code to add a " Custom Files " section to the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions for the customer to access . <p> Now you can manage files with a dedicated system , version those files , add multiple files in a version for download , and restrict access to those files . They can be tied to your WooCommerce orders with one field , making it easier for you to manage files and for your customers to access them from the account . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce : Taking it Further <p> The one thing this wont do is notify customers . This is where the customer-facing order note still comes in handy . However , this can serve purely as a notification now , and no longer as both notification and file management . You can add an order note each time a new revision is made to the associated download , and customers can quickly and easily get all information in their accounts . <p> If you want fine-grained control over download access , there are also premium extensions available for Download Monitor that can help with this . <p> For example , the Advanced Access Manager plugin ( $39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain number of downloads , or restrict them to a specific users ( not just anyone who 's logged in ) . This let 's you take your file management and restriction further than you can with order notes . <h> Sell Custom Files with WooCommerce <p> Selling custom files with WooCommerce ( or any eCommerce plugin ! ) is no easy feat since downloadable files are always attached to products rather than orders .

In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin or extension for this type of service . But in the meantime , I 'll give this a shot and see how it works on voicemagic.studio . Thanks for the article . <p> I followed these instructions to the letter and it worked flawlessly . Thank you for the tip , research , and thorough instruction . As my previous comment stated , this is a little bit of a convoluted process , but it only took me about an hour to setup and test thoroughly . Now I just have to create the download page and attach the i 'd to the order . And add a notification note of course . I believe it is most definitely worth the small amount of time it took to do this . The purchase note for delivering files does work , but its a little frustrating for the client when trying to manage those files . This article is to my knowledge to the solution to date . <p> I have one quick question . I have completely scoured the web for more than a week and find it hard to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom products and deliver the files via download monitor post order , I have the need to put an " approve " and " request revision " button on the order details page . When the customer clicks " approve " it would change the woocommerce status to something like " approved " , so we know it has been approved . If the customer clicks " request revision " , a box should open so they can describe the revision . When they submit the revision , the status would change to " revision requested " and their revision note would show in the Woocommerce order notes section . <p> Sounds like a lot but it is very simple . Do you know of any plugins that would do that , or if there is a developer that could write that script for me for a small fee ? <p> This is a crucial part of my ordering and approval process . I can of course make notes to the customer through the backend , but then they would have to email me with change requests or approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer . <p> If you have any suggestions , I would greatly appreciate it . If I can get this resolved , I 'm in business ! = <p> I have gotten stuck on this code . I use " my Custom Functions " as a way of keeping all my php code in one place . It automatically checks the code before installing it . When I place either one of these snippits in there it comes back with the following message . <p> 403 Forbidden <p> A potentially unsafe operation has been detected in your request to this site , and has been blocked by Wordfence . <p> If you are an administrator and you are certain this is a false positive , you can automatically whitelist this request and repeat the same action . <p> I can white list the code but wanted to make sure there would not be a problem .. I copied and pasted it exactly . The plugin automatically puts in the php front and end brackets . <p> wp version . 4.5.2 woocommerce version 2.6.1 <p> I have spent so much money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Hey Sandy and Steven , I 'm not having any issues while adding this to my site . Check if you 're including the &lt; ? php in the top and if its needed at all , I 'm not sure if your plugin will handle that properly . I use " Code Snippets " for this as it will check for opening PHP tags like this automatically = <p> Thank you Beka this is extremely helpful . However , I also second Marks last question as this is almost crucial in managing approvals from customers . Any thoughts on plugs ins that I can incorporate to include the control of approvals/revisions of quotes on customer downloadable products ? Basically would be integrating workflow tool that updates status of the order . <p> Hello , Thank you very much , this is a great match of my needs . but I 'm sorry to say that I 've made all your steps but my client couldnt download the file . I see " get files " button . also , I see the file " asdasdads.docx " in the recent orders , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message " Oops ! That page below or a search ? " <p> What could be the problem ? how should I fix this ? Is there a problem with download path ? or my server , or authorisation etc . Where should be the problem ? <p> Hey Zihni , it sound server-specific , like that file is n't readable . Try unchecking " Members Only " on the file , and if you still ca n't download it , youd likely need to look at the permissions on the folder where that file is stored with the hosting company ( I think its in the dlmuploads directory but not 100% sure since I have n't used it in a bit ) . <p> Hi . Do you know if I could use this to do the following : I want to use woo to sell software licenses on a site . The licenses will be in the form of text files the buyer downloads after purchase . But I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each code is unique . I want to do it with one product on the site that has multiple text files that can be downloaded , one each time someone buys a product and then this gets removed from the available text files . For example , I have a software product that has 50 available license codes . I put the product live with an inventory of 50 and each time someone buys a license the inventory drops and each buyer gets to download one of the 50 text files and once they have bought , it no longer becomes available to buy again . <p> Hey Ken , this solution would likely be inadequate for that use case , as you 'd need to manually give out license keys after purchase since its not generating or sending anything after purchase automatically . I 'm not sure if the Software Add-on would do this , but I 'd start the search there . 
@@98137958 @2337958/ <h> Email Case Study : WooCommerce Order Confirmation Email <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In our first email case study of the year , we take a look at one of the transactional emails present in all eCommerce platforms . This is the WooCommerce order confirmation email from the WooCommerce store that outlines a purchase and provides details about the billing information . <p> We break down the email into what works , what can be improved , and what grabbed our attention to click . <h> WooCommerce order confirmation email : What works ? <p> WooCommerce order confirmation email top half <h> 1 . Conversational tone <p> One of the first things that stands out in the email is the conversational tone and personalized content . The image at the top highlights this tone and has the customer name included to show the extra effort put into creating the template . <p> Each section heading continues the conversation making the email easy to read and skim . This not only helps customers absorb the information more easily , but makes your brand stand out from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When customers receive the order confirmation email , it typically is the last stage of their purchase before they receive their products . However , you can continue the interaction by adding a next steps section in the email . <p> In this example , the next step section clearly outlines what customers can do to make their purchase and product experience smoother . You can add a call to action as well that links customers to helpful articles , use cases , product manuals , or anything else that can help them get the best out of their purchases . <p> WooCommerce order confirmation email bottom half <h> 3 . Links to resources <p> From the download links , to main call to action , to billing documents , and social media , this email contains plenty of links to useful resources so that customers do n't  have to look for these separately . This email acts as a dashboard where customers can get to most of the resources related to the brand and their purchase . <p> This creates a better customer experience as you reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . <h> WooCommerce order confirmation email : What can be improved ? <h> 1 . Product descriptions <p> The product description in this email can be improved , especially if customers purchase a number of products at the same time . This is a balance between adding enough information about customers purchase and keeping the layout clean . <p> You can add short single-sentence descriptions or images next to the products so that they are clearly differentiated in the email . <h> 2 . Recommendations <p> Order confirmation emails are an opportunity to highlight some recommended or complementary products in your store . This email is an additional customer touchpoint , and can be used to market your products even further . This is similar to the " People also viewed " section on Amazon . <p> This can not only increase a customers lifetime value , but also provide customers with a glance at products they may have missed . <h> WooCommerce order confirmation email : What got us to click ? <p> The next steps section guides customers where to go once theyve completed their purchase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional plugin to manage their products . <p> Even if you do n't  have digital products , you can add next steps like reading an article about how best to use the products , how other customers are using products , etc . This engages customers , keeps the interaction going beyond the purchase , and provides them clear directions on where to go next so that they 're not spending energy later when they receive their shipment . <h> WooCommerce order confirmation email : Takeaway <p> The order confirmation is a transactional email that has a standard template for most eCommerce platforms . You can improve this experience by adding a conversational tone , clear next steps , and links to additional resources in this email . This provides customers with all the information they need related to their purchase . <p> You can add some recommended products to this email to show customers what other products people typically purchase , and to showcase complementary products that improve the customers experience . 11394 @qwx871394 <h> 3 Comments <p> Hey Frizzy , from what I can see theyve completely overridden the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small change to implement .

@@98137960 @2337960/ <h> Create Effective WooCommerce Product Carousels with WooThumbs <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I know immediately that advocating for a carousel or slider of any kind in the title of this blog post may have already stirred some people up . And with good reason ! Image carousels or sliders take a lot of heat for being ineffective . <p> For the most part , I agree with that viewpoint this ConversionXL article has some great points about why they 're not effective , nor are they easy for visitors to use . <p> However , for product pages , a carousel that changes on gesture can be a great tool to let users easily browse product images , especially on mobile . Rather than clicking individual thumbnails or images to open a full-screen view , then closing that view , then picking a new image to start again , mobile viewers can simply swipe between product images quickly when you use an effective carousel . <p> An on-gesture carousel for product images improves your customer experience and helps them quickly scroll through available images for a product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , if you 'll already be improving your WooCommerce product image display , why stop there ? Along with putting images into an on-gesture carousel , you can make some other WooCommerce product image enhancements with WooThumbs . <h> WooThumbs Review : WooCommerce Product Carousels <p> WooThumbs ( $18 ) is a really useful little plugin to improve your WooCommerce product image display . WooThumbs gives you a few tools to make product photos easier to navigate and more contextual for customers . With WooThumbs installed , you can : <p> display product images in an on-gesture carousel that works well on desktop and mobile for easy navigation ( while you can make the carousel scroll automatically , I would avoid this ) <p> allow customers to " cloud zoom " or hover to zoom on product images to view greater detail <p> open images in a full-screen view to get a better look <p> add variation-specific images so that , when a variation is selected , customers only see the relevant images for that variation <p> add product videos that will open full-screen so customers do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products in action <p> If you want to check out a live demo of the plugin you can get a feel for how it modifies and upgrades the default product image display . You can even use the " customize " icon to the left to see what settings are available . <h> WooThumbs Review : Setup &amp; Configuration <p> Once you have the plugin installed , you can begin with basic configuration under WooCommerce &gt; WooThumbs . Since WooThumbs uses the Redux Framework for its settings , you 'll need to install the Redux Framework plugin as well to get to this page and activate the enhanced product images . <p> I was n't a fan of installing another plugin to use WooThumbs , but I got in touch with the plugin author , and he s already in progress on removing this settings framework , and thus the need for the additional plugin , which is nice to hear . <p> Once you 've got both plugins up and running , the WooThumbs settings page will let you adjust everything from how the main image and thumbnails are displayed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend having a look at a product page while you adjust configuration so you can see what each setting does after you 've saved it . <p> General Settings <p> ( That top notice is only displayed because I 'm using a development shop , you most likely will not see it . ) <p> While you 're viewing the settings page , you can go through each tab to configure settings on what transitions your product images use , what color the icons for navigation are , what kind of image zoom is used , and others . <p> Configure settings <p> I went through and adjusted some settings , then refreshed my sample product page after saving , to get an idea of how I wanted my WooCommerce product carousel , carousel navigation , and thumbnails to look and transition from one image to another . For example , you may want to adjust the zoom appearance or tweak other display settings for your product images . <h> WooThumbs Review : Product Videos <p> Once you 've configured the general plugin settings , you can have a look at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you can disable WooThumbs for a particular product , or add a product video ( via entering the URL to your video ) . <p> Add a Product Video <p> If you add a URL for a product video , this will add a video icon to the WooThumbs display . <p> Video Icon <p> When clicked , it will open a full-screen video lightbox for the customer to view your product video without ever leaving your site ( very handy if you want to upload your videos to services like YouTube or Wistia ) . <h> WooThumbs Review : Variation Images <p> For variable products , you 'll also have a very cool new setting : add additional images per variation . This makes it easier for your customers to see variation-specific images for your product . <p> Default Variation Images <p> Additional Variation images <p> For example , the default WooCommerce variations will adjust the main product image when a variation is selected , but that 's it . All other thumbnails / product images are shown , regardless of which variation they relate to . <p> Default Variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images much more specific . When the product initially loads , all product images will still be shown . However , when a variation is selected , the main variation image will be shown in the large image preview , and the images youve marked as additional images will be shown as thumbnails , letting the customer scroll through these images . <p> Updated Variation Display <p> This way , when a specific variation is selected , the customer can view all of the images specific to that variation only , giving them better context for the different versions of your product . <p> There 's also a bulk tool to assign these additional images to your product variations . If you go to WooCommerce &gt; WooThumbs Bulk , you can add additional images for several product variations at once . Enter a comma-separated list of image IDs ( you can see these in your media folder ) for the variation to apply all images to that variation at one time . <p> Bulk variation images <p> This is definitely a neat feature to make sure customers get confirmation on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images are filtered based on which variation is selected , rather than throwing all images at the customer at once . <h> WooThumbs Review : Customer View <p> The image section looks pretty similar to the way it normally does , but you can use an image slider to show all images , the customer can hover to zoom in , and can also click to see an image in full screen . If you want to check out what it looks like when used , the demo site for the plugin has some examples . <p> However , the place WooThumbs shines ( for me anyway ) is in the mobile-view of your store . In a typical WooCommerce store , your customers will see all product images on mobile . However , to view a different image than the main one in more detail , they must click on the thumbnail and see the image opened in a lightbox , then click on the arrow to move through images no swiping or scrolling support . <p> Heres what this looks like in action : ( click this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image display with unsuccessful swipe attempts = ) <p> WooCommerce Product on Mobile <p> Not really great , and not really the way mobile viewers want to experience your site . <p> With WooThumbs active , customers can instead swipe left and right to easily browse full size images , and clicking a product thumbnail makes it the main image rather than opening a lightbox . ( Click this image to see a gif of the WooThumbs-enhanced product image display . ) <p> WooThumbs Product on Mobile <p> You do n't  lose the full-image lightbox if customers want to click the full view , but it makes for a much better mobile browsing experience to swipe through product images and to not force the lightbox to see greater detail unless needed . <h> WooThumbs Review : Theme Compatibility <p> I tested WooThumbs in several WooCommerce themes , and it worked well in each one I tested . Most of the themes did n't  require tweaks , but it looks like you could possibly run into one or two small issues that are fixed easily . <p> First , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your theme . <p> WooThumbs in Twenty Sixteen <p> Its pretty easy to move " on sale " badges back in front of the product images with a bit of CSS in your themes stylesheet or custom CSS plugin : <p> . woocommerce . onsale z-index : 10000 ; <p> The only other thing I saw was that you may run into issues with the slider being too wide , which can push your content lower on the screen . <p> This can be adjusted easily to a smaller width under the " Slider Dimensions " settings , which fixed the issue for me . <p> These were the only display hiccups I saw across the 6 themes I have installed in my development shop , but they 're simple enough to patch up , and the plugin is advertised as compatible with pretty much any WooCommerce theme . <h> WooThumbs Review : Other Comments <p> While WooThumbs gives your product images some nice upgrades and context for variations , there are a couple things I 'd love to see improved . <p> First , there are lots of settings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what the settings are doing and have to keep refreshing a product page to see them , it can take some time to configure . <p> Several settings would benefit from using the WordPress Customizer many settings directly modify the frontend appearance , and thus seeing how they change a sample product page in real time would make setup far quicker and prevent flipping back and forth between settings and a frontend product page . <p> Next , settings that do n't  modify appearance could leverage the WooCommerce settings API to add them in a settings tab . This would also give the added benefit of removing the need for the Redux Framework plugin completely , which is apparently a change that 's already in progress for the plugin . <p> I would also love to see some bulk actions for WooThumbs product settings . For example , a bulk action to disable WooThumbs for the product would be helpful if you want to disable the enhanced product images for an entire product category . Likewise , you may want to re-use a video URL for a category , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review : Upgraded Product Images <p> Overall , WooThumbs is an easy-to-use plugin that enhances your WooCommerce product images . Images are easier to navigate using a mobile-friendly image slider , as customers can use the expected swipes to navigate images , and click on thumbnails to make them the main product image . Swiping to scroll through images is also much easier than using the tiny " arrow " tap target in the image lightbox . <p> Images can also be viewed in full screen ( mobile and desktop ) , and can be inspected closer with a " hover to zoom " feature . The enhanced image section blends into most themes , and can be adjusted easily for each theme . <p> Adding variation images is a nice bonus to give product images more context , as they can be tied to a specific variation . Product videos are also handy to give your customers more visual representations of your products without sending them off to YouTube or another site , keeping them where the purchasing happens . <p> Note : This . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98137962 @2337962/ <h> Partner <p> According to Power Reviews , 70% of shoppers are more likely to purchase if a site has reviews . Reviews also help with your product SEO , as customer-generated content helps to target long-tail keywords . Even if customers sometimes leave bad reviews , sales can increase , according to CNN . <p> In short , its hard not to come out on top by implementing and encouraging product reviews on your site . However , there 's one glaring question here : How do you encourage them ? <p> Let 's take a look at 4 ways to get more product reviews on your eCommerce site . <h> 1 . Get More Product Reviews : Ask ! <p> This should be easy and obvious , but so often we forget to ask customers to leave product reviews . Asking is one of the most efficient ways to generate reviews , and if you 've had contact with the customer already ( such as a pre-sales email ) , following up to ask for a review is effective since you 've already built a relationship . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about a product in your store , then you notice she 's placed an order for the product after having her question answered . Set a remind for a week later to follow back up with Susan : <p> Hey Susan , Thanks again for getting in touch the other day about product -- so glad we were able to point you in the right direction here ! I did notice you 'd purchased after our conversation , and I just wanted to follow up to see how this worked out for you and if you were happy with your purchase = Any additional questions I can help out with ? <p> Many times , your customer will respond to this email . First , if the customer is n't happy , this gives you a fantastic opportunity to solve the issue ( which relates to tip #4 ) . If your customer is happy , you now have a perfect opportunity to ask for a review : <p> Hiya Susan , Perfect , thank you so much for letting me know this worked out for you ! Definitely happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , would you mind sharing your experience and thoughts in a product review ? Feedback like this is really important to us , and we 'd totally love it if you share it = You can leave a review here : review form link Thanks again for your purchase ! Have a great week , <p> If you do n't  have a perfect opening like this from an existing conversation , sending automated emails can also help to serve as a reminder for customers to leave a review . There are some helpful plugins to do this for you already . <p> WooCommerce stores can use the WooCommerce Follow Up Emails plugin ( $99 ) to trigger an email a set time after an order . You can create a trigger on " Order complete " to email the customer ( e.g. , 7 days after the order is completed ) , and customize our email text to ask for a product review . <p> Follow Up Emails : Order Complete trigger <p> The great part about this is that the process is completely automated , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's also another really useful tool to do this : AutomateWoo ( $99 ) . You can create a workflow for completed orders to do the same thing send an email a certain time after the order is completed . <p> AutomateWoo : Order Complete trigger <p> I prefer this option , as it will also let us take advantage of tip #2 . <p> There 's not really a great way to automate emails to customers whove purchased from you , but you could consider using the EDD Product Updates ( $49 ) to periodically send manual emails to everyone who 's purchased a given product . Its a bit of a hack-y use of this plugin , but something to consider . <p> My favored method for asking for reviews in non-WooCommerce shops is to use MailChimp . While this is n't perfect , you can easily target new customers by segmenting your list by sign up date : <p> Segment new signups <p> You can then send emails to these new customers occasionally to ask for product reviews on their first purchase . You could also probably segment by purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration configured already . <h> 2 . Get More Product Reviews : Offer Incentives <p> While asking for reviews will get you some product reviews , not everyone wants to do something for free . In fact , a lot of users expect something in return for writing a product review : <p> Power Reviews recommends offering an incentive for these customers to leave a review ( as does Bigcommerce ) , so incentives like discount coupons , free shipping coupons , thank you gifts , or loyalty points can help encourage reviews . <p> WooCommerce store owners are in luck here , as there are a couple ways you can automatically reward product reviewers . First , AutomateWoo can help us out again . You can trigger a workflow based on a customer leaving a review in your store , and determine when to fire the workflow ( e.g. , a day later ) : <p> AutomateWoo : Review Trigger <p> If you want to send an email thanking your customer for the review , you can also have AutomateWoo generate and include a unique coupon code as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very nifty system for managing review asks and incentives . <p> You can offer incentives with WooCommerce Points and Rewards ( $129 ) as well , which let 's you automatically give out a certain number of points for each product review the customer leaves in your store . <p> One word of caution with incentives : offer the incentive for all reviews , not just positive reviews all it takes is a couple upset customers taking to the interwebs to talk about how you 're offering " bribes " for good reviews . Youll have some customers to whom this will be a major turn off and will avoid purchasing . <p> Besides , we 've talked about how negative reviews are n't  a bad thing , and you may also get valuable feedback via negative reviews to improve your products . <h> 3 . Get More Product Reviews : Give Product Samples <p> Reach out to bloggers or video reviewers who write about your product type , and offer samples and / or payment in exchange for reviews . Oftentimes , you can also run a giveaway of your product(s) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does this introduce your product to their audience , but you can collect these reviews and add them to your own site . <h> 4 . Get More Product Reviews : Go Above and Beyond <p> The last tip I have for getting reviews is to do something " WOW " -worthy for your customers . Almost any time a company has gone above and beyond for me , Ive written a review , testimonial , or shared positive feedback on Twitter . Impress your customers , and theyll be happy to sing your praises . <p> This can entail : <p> Remembering to follow up with customers whove asked you questions <p> Sending follow up emails after purchase to see how they like the product <p> Asking customers to share a birthday so you can send a gift <p> Including a hand written note with an order thanking them for their business <p> Including a free gift with an order , especially for new customers <p> Upgrading to faster shipping for free <p> Giving customers VIP status if you have it <p> Make your customers happy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocate and share positive feedback about your store . <p> In short , our four keys to getting more product reviews : be sure to ask for reviews in conversations or automated emails , incentivize product reviews , get products in the hands of influencers to share and review , and go above and beyond to ensure your customers have a great experience . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98137965 @2337965/ <h> Email Case Study : Social Proof Email from Allen Edmonds <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Social proof for your products can elevate your brand value and highlight the audience you 're targeting . In this email case study , well take a look at the social proof email from Allen Edmonds around one of their products . <p> Well take a look at what works in the email , what you can consider improving in your emails , and what got our click . <h> Social proof email : What works <p> Social proof email Part 1 <h> 1 . Layout <p> One of the first things that stands out in this email is that it is very visual . There is a tagline of how the product is positioned " Classic Beauty " and an image of the product at the top . This establishes the product being presented . <p> In the first sentence of the copy , the email showcases the names of users who have worn the shoes in the past . Its important that this is done up front so it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This email mentions the names of customers , however , you do n't  have to be limited to just that . You can also mention things like events where your products where used , groups who have backed your products , or even the number of purchasers or advocates who share on their social profiles . <p> Social proof email Part 2 <h> 2 . Long form copy <p> The email almost reads like a stripped down version of sales page with long-form copy . By focusing on just one product , you can dive deeper into the various aspects and features of the product . <p> The copy is easy to read and walks customers through things that they would consider while making a purchasing decision . By providing this information up-front , rather than customers having to go to the site , the email removes objections and effort to purchase . <p> Social proof email Part 3 <p> The copy is complemented with relevant images so that its easy to see what 's being discussed at a glance . <h> 3 . Shipping policy <p> The last piece that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returns policy . If your store has favourable policies , make sure to highlight them in emails to improve conversion rates as the cost of not liking the purchase goes down . <h> Social proof email : What can be improved <h> 1 . Draw attention to differentiating content <p> Although the copy is concise and scannable within the layout , you can consider highlighting specific parts like bolding the names of product users to draw even more attention to them . This helps grab peoples attention and draw them in to read the rest of the copy . <h> 2 . Call to action button <p> One piece missing from this email is a call to action button that stands out . In an email of this length , you can have two buttons one after the first image or paragraph , and another one at the end of the copy . <p> This helps direct people to the next step that would be specific to this purchase . Customers shouldnt have to think about where they need to go once they 're willing to complete the purchase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this email , its a combination of the names of product users and the scannable copy that got our click . Its not every day that you receive an email about products that past presidents of the country have used . In addition , the copy is structured in a way that you can quickly learn more about the product as well . <p> Now , you may not have presidents using your products , but what 's important is to keep up with who your customers are , and how you can encourage people sharing their experience with your products . You can also look at sponsoring influencers in your target market . <p> Depending on what type of social proof you want , you can grow it organically through your social platforms , or approach specific people with paid advertising . <h> Social proof email : Takeaway <p> Emails showing social proof for your products does n't  only showcase who uses your products , but also builds brand value and defines your target audience . In this email , some things that work well are the layout which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details about the product , and the clearly mentioned shipping and return policy . <p> Some things you can consider if you 're modelling off the layout of this email is where you can highlight bold text the names or other relevant information so that it stands out even further . In addition , having a call to action button towards the first half of the email can help capture customers who want to shop right away . 
@@98137966 @2337966/ <h> Selling WooCommerce Product Packages from the Same Inventory <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I 'm selling products that can be sold individually , in a pack of 4 , or in a pack of 12 , which is done in the variables dropdown . The problem is for stock it only shows in the back end as 1 unit sold no matter what people choose rather than selling 4 units for the pack of 4 , or selling 12 unit for the pack of 12 . <p> Say I have 500 items in stock , can I set it so when the 4 pack or 12 pack is sold , it reduces from the single stock ? So if I sell 2 single items , stock goes down to 498 , then selling a pack of 4 reduces stock to 494 ( not 497 like it does now ) ? <p> Sure thing Pete ! To sell WooCommerce product packages like this , you 're looking for a Product Bundle . This will let us use a single product as the inventory source , and we can create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify Petes problem , here 's what happens now : <p> Product A has 3 variations : 1 unit , 4-pack , 12-pack . The stock for these is calculated separately . The stock for each 4-pack purchase deducts " 1 " from the 4-pack stock , not the overall unit stock . <p> To get an overall unit stock , and to have packages deduct from this stock , we need to bundle the items instead of selling them as separate products ( even though variations are tied together by a parent product , they 're still unique products / SKUs ) . <h> 1 . Create the Single Unit Product <p> First we need to create the product by which our inventory will be measured . For the sake of this question , this will be our single unit / item product . I 'm going to sell these as light bulbs for demonstration . <p> This will be a simple product without any bells and whistles really just set the price for a unit of one , and be sure to track all stock for the item here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well bundle this to sell it in packs of 4 or 12 . I 'll make this product page fancier in a bit , but one product down , two to go ! <h> 2 . Create the Bundle Products <p> Now that I have my single product done , I 'll create two bundle products one for the 4-pack , and one for the 12-pack . <p> Since you only care about the stock on the individual item , you do not need to manage stock for the bundle . You only need to manage stock here if you need to track bundle stock separately from the item stock . <p> Let 's set the product type to " Product bundle " , and then set the price of the entire bundle for the product . <p> Set bundle price <p> Now add your single product under the " Bundled Products " tab . When doing so , you 'll set the min quantity = maximum quantity = your quantity for the bundle ( 4 or 12 in this case ) . <p> Add Bundled Products <p> That 's all we need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 of my individual light bulb product . <p> Once you do the same thing for a 12-pack , you 're done ! You have 3 WooCommerce product packages that are sold individually for different prices , but all deducting from the same inventory / SKU . <p> I 'm going to take this just a bit further to cross-promote bundles . This way if someone finds my single product , they 're aware that there are other purchasing options . <h> 3 . Cross Promote Bundles <p> To cross-promote my bundles , I 'm going to use the product IDs shortcode built into WooCommerce . This gives you a way to show thumbnail views of multiple products at once . <p> I 'm going to add the thumbnails for my 2 bundles on my individually-sold lightbulb to promote these as purchasing options . <p> Cross-promotion via shortcode <p> Now my product page will provide all 3 purchasing options for my visitors so they can choose the quantity that fits their needs . <p> Once a bundle is in the cart , customers will see that they 're paying for the bundle , but its made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once purchased , the quantity in the bundle will deduct inventory from your main or individually-sold product . <p> Bundle reducing individual stock <h> Selling WooCommerce Product Packages <p> That 's it , Pete ! Hope that points you in the right direction . <p> If you wanted to take this further to show all bundle choices on a page , you could look to use Product Bundles alongside of Composite Products , as shown in this tutorial . This would give you a way to show all bundles like a variation if desired on a single page . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 5 Comments <p> Thank you Beka ! Your posts are always so helpful this plugin sounds like it would almost fit my needs , but not quite . After struggling for the solution I need , Ive come to realize just how daunting a task it is to design a shopping cart system that accommodates all the possible needs out there . <p> For instance , I would like to provide bundles of a given product , but allow the customer to decide ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bundle . So I 'd like to start with maybe 6 and let them choose any number up to 12 . Ive been searching for days but havent found the plugin or code that does exactly this . <p> The following code posted on the Woo site does exactly what I 'd like , but it applies to all products instead of a specific product . I 'm completely new to all this and learning as fast as I can , but I 'm unsure how to have this filter affect a single , specific product : <p> code removed <p> I looked at the Min/Max Quantities extension , but it seems cart-based and I 'd prefer this happen on the single product page before placing the item in the cart . Using error messages at the cart stage seems like a rather negative approach ( error messages to the customer are not a positive experience IMO ) . <p> Yes I saw this but my understanding of the way the Min/Max works is that if a minimum of , say , 6 is specified , the amount shown on the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to bump it to 6 until they receive an error message in the shopping cart . <p> If this is n't the case , I apologize I read it in a comment thread somewhere . <p> What I would like ( and yes its crazy specific ) is the ability to set a minimum or 6 and a maximum of 12 , and have the amount shown on the product page be 6 , but still be able to be bumped to 12 and no higher . <p> The code I included in my first comment ( forgive me if that was bad style ) does this exact thing very simply , but unfortunately it does it to all products . <p> Is there some way to get this to happen with selected products ? <p> Thanks again , and hope I 'm not being too irritating with this followup question = <p> It will show the quantity input on the bundle page if you have a min / max set here 's what it looks like if I use the built-in setting with 6 / 12 for the min and max : http : **30;550;TOOLONG

@@98137971 @2337971/ <h> Increase Customer Lifetime Value with Subscriptions <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the challenges of growing an online store is to get repeat customers . Repeat customers are 25 times less expensive than new customers when it comes to acquisition . Offering subscription products is a growing trend that helps overcome this challenge . Subscription products can help increase your stores revenue , bring predictable cash flow , and help increase your customer lifetime value . <p> So what are subscription products ? <p> These can be physical products like Harrys razors or many box-of-the-month products , or virtual/digital products like Netflix , magazines , or support subscriptions . Most of these tend to be affordably-priced so that subscribing is not a barrier for most customers . <p> Let 's take a look at what 's needed for getting subscription products set up for your store . <h> Customer lifetime value and subscriptions : What you will need <p> You can set up a subscription business or products using the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension . The extension allows you to set up subscription products subscription price , recurrence period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can offer subscriptions for one or multiple products . Within each product , you can offer different terms for the subscription . For example , you can offer a monthly subscription at a higher per-order price , and a yearly subscription of the same product at a lower per-order price . This will provide customers with options to fit their needs . <p> Customers can easily modify any of their subscriptions through their account . You can take a look at all the features in WooCommerce Subscriptions in this review of the extension . <p> If you want to add subscription options to existing products , you can also take a look at the WooCommerce Subscribe All the Things extension which let 's you add a subscription option to your products . Read more about the extension and how you can use it in this post . <p> Although subscription products have a lot of benefits , you have to be careful about which products you can offer as subscriptions . There are a few things to keep in mind : <p> Affordable An advantage of offering subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per item than you would otherwise . This is because you know the customer will be receiving multiple orders . However , the subscription has to be affordably priced for customers to see the initial value . <p> Many variants If you are offering a subscription to a category of products ( like shirts , socks , ties , etc. ) , you have to make sure you have enough variety in the inventory to fulfill orders on an ongoing basis . <p> Ongoing need Subscriptions are well served for products which run out or are needed on an ongoing basis . For example , shaving razors , weekly groceries , coffee beans , etc. make good subscription products , but mattresses probably do n't  since they last for a long time . <p> Whichever product or category you choose to offer subscriptions on , remember to test out the market to see if people would consider purchasing it on an ongoing basis . You also need to make sure that your business is set up to fulfill the subscription orders at the recurrence you offer so that customers find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with subscription for a single product or category before you branch into other products . <p> Check out stories from businesses built on subscriptions on the Small Woorld blog . <h> Customer lifetime value and subscriptions : Benefits <p> As you promote your subscriptions , you can tie these to benefits to further create value for customers . You can integrate WooCommerce Subscriptions with WooCommerce Memberships to create exclusive membership perks to subscribers . These can be lower-priced items on your store , or access to purchase certain items on your store . You can learn more about the integration of Memberships with Subscriptions here . <p> As you 're testing out new products , you can include them in the orders of existing subscribers to gauge their reaction . This can help you get useful feedback about new products , and your subscribers receive a bonus item and a preview of products to come on your store . <p> You can also consider offering discounts and coupons for subscriptions , especially long-standing subscribers to reward their loyalty .

These products are typically more profitable as well as you do n't  have to spend marketing dollars to get the orders . This allows you to focus on developing and delivering the products rather than worry about where your next customers are going to come from . <p> You can set up subscription products using WooCommerce Subscriptions for both physical and digital products .

This has been released as a mini-extension since most sites running Subscriptions wo n't need this functionality , but there are still a significant number that can benefit from it . <p> The ability to gift subscriptions will allow you to sell a subscription to one customer while providing the benefits of the subscription to another customer . <p> For example , let 's say I want to buy my brother an " album game of the month " club subscription for his birthday , which provides both vinyl records and a digital download . I want to be able to give him direct access to the downloads rather than tying them to my own account , so I want to essentially gift this subscription to him . This is now possible with WooCommerce Subscriptions in an automated gifting process . <p> I can set him up as a recipient of the subscription , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as resubscribing , upgrading , and downgrading ) , while he gets the subscription benefits ( such as the shipped items and download access ) . <p> Once you have it installed , that 's all you have to do = Any subscription-type product in your store can now be gifted to others when purchased . There a few things I 'd recommend configuring , however . <p> A new setting is added under WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Subscriptions you can opt to only allow recipients to access downloads if tied to the subscription product , or give the purchaser access as well . <p> Settings <p> If you 'll be gifting subscriptions , I 'd recommend marking the product as Sold Individually in the product data . As a recipient needs to be entered for each gifted subscription , this forces the customer to enter a recipient for each gift subscription purchased . Without this , customers may adjust quantity expecting to be able to add another email , but this would just give multiple subscriptions to the same recipient . <p> Suggested Setting <p> Once you have your settings and products configured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no additional effort on your part . <h> Gift Subscriptions : Purchasing Gift Subscriptions <p> When a customer comes to the store , theyll see a new " This is a gift " option for a subscription-type product . If enabled , this will allow the customer to enter a recipient for the subscription . <p> This recipient information can be changed in the cart and checkout process if needed . If the recipient email exists as a customer account already on your site , that customers shipping address will be filled at checkout and the existing account used for the subscription . <p> Cart View <p> Once a gifted subscription is purchased , only the purchaser can manage the billing for the subscription , such as making upgrades or changing payment methods . Recipients can only cancel or suspend a gifted subscription . <p> Purchasers account view <p> The purchaser will see the recipient details for any gifted subscriptions , along with renewal orders , from the account section . <h> Gift Subscriptions : Receiving Gift Subscriptions <p> When a recipient received a gift subscription , the recipient will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the recipient does n't  yet have an account , the plugin will create a new customer account automatically and email the account details to the new subscription recipient : <p> Login details of the account , as well as information about where they can manage their new subscription , is sent to the recipient via email . <p> These automated emails can all managed under the WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Emails section of the store . <p> Once the recipient logs in , they can see the subscription details , pause subscriptions , and cancel subscriptions , but can not change payment methods or upgrade / downgrade . When the subscription expires , the recipient can not resubscribe . S/he will see the purchaser details for the subscription in the account section . <p> Recipient View <h> Gift Subscriptions : Order Management <p> As a store owner , you 'll know when a subscription has been gifted because the line item for the order will have the recipient details listed . The recipient email is added , and the shipping address for the recipient can be viewed via tooltip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main shipping address for the subscription . <p> Order Details <p> Viewing the subscription order will look very similar , as the recipient details are added here as well . <h> Gift Subscriptions : Memberships Integration <p> Another great perk of using WooCommerce Subscription Gifting is automatic compatibility with WooCommerce Memberships . If a subscription product grants access to a membership plan , and that subscription product is gifted to a recipient , the recipient will have the membership created , not the purchaser . <p> This means that the recipient gets all of the benefits of the membership , such as product access or discounts , while the purchaser still manages billing . <h> Gift Subscriptions with WooCommerce <p> The ability to gift subscriptions with WooCommerce is a huge step forward for subscription and membership stores . Being able to completely automate gift subscription creation and billing will make store owners lives much easier while opening up their stores for customers to give subscription and membership benefits to friends . <p> If you do use the plugin , I 'd recommend subscribing to the GitHub repo for updates so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're added , then manually update the plugin in your shop . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> 1 ) Yes , gifted subscriptions must be purchased individually since recipients are added when the product goes into the cart , not later . 2 ) I do n't  believe there 's a way to limit a customer to 10 overall purchases for all time , but you could limit this to 10 at a time with Min / Max Quantities to limit the single-purchase to 10 of the item . <p> I 'm still struggling with selling group subscriptions . What I want to sell is a subscription for ( say ) 7 , 20 or 50 members of an organisation ( team , unit , etc. ) with options for various periods ( 1 month , quarter , year ) . <p> So what I need is for the manager of a team ( or something like that ) to be able to give a subscription to all their team members , possibly identified by email addresses . <p> I had thought this might be a solution but reading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to do the above ( which is , I would have thought , quite an ordinary thing in b2b sales ) ? <p> Hey Richard , agreed that WooCommerce is n't really designed for b2b sales , there are definitely places it could improve for b2b . <p> In this case , if you want the manager to be able to give out subscriptions to the team , it should be possible with this set up they just have to be purchased one at a time . Unless you 're saying the manager is n't the same as the purchaser ? In that case , there 's no great solution , I might check this guide out though to see if it fits your use case = <p> Hey Abby , I believe this can be done so long as its not in the same transaction , but not 100% sure here . If you have a staging site , I 'd recommend giving it a go = Would love it if you let us know if you do test it ! <p> Thank you for your great articles . I am about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership problem . I am wondering how a purchaser who alreay purchased and paid for a subscription ( tied to a membership ) can gift that subscription without repaying that membership ? In other words , how is he going to tie the gift to a previously purchased and currently active subscription ? <p> As I have Business Members or BM ( admins ) who buy memberships and gives them to attached Person Members or PM ( who get the benefits and do n't  pay any membership ) , I guess I need more of a Group Membership solution . This obviously means that if the BM does n't  renew a membership through a subscription , then she and the attached PMs lose automatically the benefits of the membership . <p> Does this not work with variable products ( ie variable subscriptions ) ? I 've got the variable subscription setup but the gift option is not visible ( and not in the source code for the page ) . The Gifting plugin is definitely enabled ( I have the option of changing the gifting message in Woos Subscription settings ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all subscription products at present . This could be customized to only apply to certain products as there are appropriate hooks in place , but this would require some custom code .

@@98137978 @2337978/ <p> Communication with your members is vital for keeping them informed of benefits or new content , but getting member data into your marketing email service is necessary to send member emails . While MailChimp is my preferred email service ( so that 's what our tutorial will cover ) , the tips were outlining here can be used with most marketing email services . <h> Why Segment Member Emails <p> When a member joins your site , theyve agreed to trade your membership fee for the benefits offered . If you want members to continue making that choice , you 'll need to keep them engaged with your site , and deliver consistent value . <p> Segmenting member emails gives you an excellent tool for creating value you can personalize emails to the access or benefits a member has , informing them of helpful information or new benefits and products . <p> Segmenting your member emails by memberships status or plan / access type is usually helpful for these kind of emails , but you could also consider segmenting by signup or expiration date as well , depending on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segmenting emails with WooCommerce Memberships , we can run into a problem : as your members can have more than one membership , segmenting emails for these memberships can be difficult . For example , if you want to email " active silver members " , but a member has an active gold membership + an expired silver one , this can get tricky with MailChimp . <p> Well take a look at how you can set up your membership lists and segments to target members via email with relevant , personalized information . <p> The first thing you 'll need to do is determine how you 'd like your MailChimp account set up whether you want an email list per plan , or if you want to use one combined email list . <p> The benefit to using one list per plan is that you can have more advanced segmentation . As every merge tag / field in MailChimp will correspond to one type of membership , you can segment based on status , start date , expiration date , or other membership data easily . However , this could cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if a member has multiple memberships and is part of more than one list , theyll be counted twice towards your total subscriber count . <p> Having multiple lists also makes it difficult to email all members at once if you have site-wide announcements . <p> You 'll need to determine whether you want to use one list or multiple lists , as this will determine how you set up your member fields . In my example , I 'm going to use a single list for all of my members , so Ill only have fields for the membership plan . The value of the field will be the status active , pending , expired , etc so I can target certain members using this field set . <p> Add a MailChimp field for each membership plan available on your site . <p> Now we need to get your member data into MailChimp and allow member data to update these fields . To do so , well need to export members to a CSV file so we can upload this file to MailChimp . <p> The Memberships documentation has several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is pretty easy . You 'll go to WooCommerce &gt; Memberships &gt; Import / Export to find the " Export to CSV " section . This will allow you to set export conditions and get your member list . <p> The member list will have one row per membership , not one row per user . As a result , one user could have multiple rows in your file . As a result , I recommend breaking the export up on a per-plan basis so that you export only one plan-type at a time ( regardless of how you have MailChimp set up ) . <p> Export by Plan <p> You can also export by status if you 'd like to only export active members . Likewise , if you want to mass-unsubscribe inactive members in MailChimp , you could export all inactive statuses instead . <p> Export by Status <p> If you only want to export a few members manually , you can use a bulk action from the Members list to do so as well . <p> Bulk Action export <p> Once you 've exported your members , you 'll download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though your CSV will probably only have one plans member data for now . ) <p> I 'm going to delete most columns from this except for the member name , email , and status , as that 's all Ill use within MailChimp to create email segments . <p> You should now have one CSV file per membership plan . If you 're using separate lists with MailChimp , getting these members into MailChimp is simple : import the appropriate CSV to each list . You may want to keep more of the columns in the CSV file and create merge tags for them , such as start / end date , if you 're going this route for more advanced segments . <p> If you 're using one list , well do multiple imports . Each time , you 'll import the " status " column to the appropriate merge tag . For example , when I upload my CSV of " Platinum " members , I 'll map the status column to the " Platinum " merge tag . Likewise , when I import my gold members , I 'll map this to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get the status assigned for each merge tag / plan field : <p> Now when you do future imports , these merge tags can be updated by your CSV file for current membership statuses . <h> Member Emails with WooCommerce Memberships : Create Email Segments <p> Now that your member data is in MailChimp , you can create segments for different kinds of member emails . <p> All Members in a Specific Plan To email all members in a specific plan is fairly straight-forward . Since a plans merge tag will only be blank if the person has never had a membership for that plan , we can check , " Plan is not blank " in MailChimp . <p> This will send an email to anyone who has an active or inactive membership for this plan . <p> Active Members in a Specific Plan If you want to email active members for a specific plan , then well need to do some checking around membership status . While selecting " Active " statuses is up to you , WooCommerce Memberships will let anyone with the following statuses access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend adding a saved segment so you can re-use it for each plan that checks for each of these statuses . <p> You can have this segment auto-update in case a members status changes in the future . That way , you 're able to select this as a saved segment when creating a campaign . <p> Recently Expired Members Since you ca n't segment based on status and end date if you use one member email list , you could try to approximate a " recently expired " segment . <p> If you 're only updating members via CSV import , then its reasonable to assume that an " info changed " date would correspond to your latest upload / import . Therefore , you could use the status + the info changed date to determine whose information was recently changed via import . <p> While this is n't a perfect measure of whose memberships have recently expired ( as they could have updated their own information , such as last name ) , it can be a rough way to send " win-back " emails for expired members . <h> Segment Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memberships can be tricky since your users can have more than one membership . As a result , its not too clean to create email segments within MailChimp , as the member data in MailChimp can correspond to different plans . <p> Exporting members of a particular plan , then using a plan name = status merge tag set up let 's you segment emails by plan and active / inactive status to keep your members informed . <p> You can then update this data in the future via re-importing members before sending campaigns , or you could bulk-unsubscribe a list of expired members ( as you could target these statuses with an export ) . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Ive been trying to find a solution to sync up WooCommerce Memberships with our Mailchimp list .

I have n't seen the MailChimp sync myself . <p> At first glance , I do n't  think it would work , but it depends on how it " listens " for changes . As a membership is n't saved as user data , I 'm not sure that it would trigger updates when a membership status or plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you could change how it listens , then you can certainly get member data from the user object to set the merge tag value . <p> If you 're using Subscriptions , one thing you can note is that it handles role changes from " customer " to " subscriber " and back again when a subscription is inactive , so you could sync the " subscriber " role to get all active members . I know that does n't  give you the additional data on membership type , but it would work out of the box .

I 'd use one regardless since many eCommerce plugins sell services just fine , but this is n't your only option . <h> Gravity Forms <p> If you 're only selling a few services , you could start with something like Gravity Forms . Gravity Forms includes the ability to set pricing fields as part of your forms , and chances are you 'd probably be using it ( or another form builder ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal license , you can create forms for your site so that customers can enter the information needed and upload any product details to receive a quote for your services . You could then invoice customers after you send a quote or theyve expressed interest in using your service . You could also use PayPal " Buy Now " buttons to accept payments , but that 's going to be a bit cheesy if you have them all over the place . <p> With add-ons , you can also accept payment as part of these forms ( for example , if you sell services at a set price , such as installation services , or you just want to be like Fiverr and sell random services at a fixed price ) . The Developer License for Gravity Forms includes several payment gateway integrations for you to accept payments , and there 's also a free Stripe add-on available you could check out ( newsflash : we love Stripe ) . <p> This is a pretty quick and easy way to sell services via your site , as you can simply create pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either accept quote inquiries or to accept payments . You can also use the FreshBooks add-on , which is part of the developer license , to automatically add clients and create invoices in your FreshBooks account when a form is submitted . <h> eCommerce Plugins <p> For services-based sites , there are four eCommerce plugins I 'd recommend that you take a look at using : <p> Each of this plugins will provide you the flexibility needed to sell services or products ( digital or physical , though selling physical products is tougher with EDD ) . Theyll also offer the management tools needed to successfully run your service-based business . <p> WooCommerce can sell almost anything , and there are tons of extensions available to help you do so . For example , you could look at the Bookings extension , which allows you to sell appointments or your time . This could be great for service businesses that have offerings like installations , coaching , appointments ( i.e. , hair salons ) , and other products that require set time commitments . WooCommerce also offers tons of payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual products and services , or easily sell physical products if needed . <p> Easy Digital Downloads can be transformed into an extremely lightweight services plugin using a free plugin to remove the downloadable files notice on the confirmation page . EDD also boasts lots of payment gateway choices and add-ons for your store , and is a great choice if you know that you wont need to sell physical products in the future . While the plugin could do it , its far better suited to all-digital shops . <p> Shopp offers a lot of flexibility right in the core plugin , as recurring payments are included , along with several other features . While Shopp does n't  boast as large of a marketplace , it does offer great options for both digital and physical products , and has good order management capabilities . <p> Cart66 Cloud is the only solution of these without a free core offering or reporting as part of the plugin , but it does provide some features that make it a contender for a different kind of site . Cart66 Cloud costs $25-$30 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any gateway offered , and can also protect content as a membership solution . Its a solid choice for shops that will sell services , products , and potentially offer membership content to customers . here 's an article on using Cart66 for a store that sells both services and products . <h> Do Customers Pay Now or Later ? <p> This is a pretty integral problem to solve when setting up your eCommerce site . Will customers pay when they book services , or will they be getting a quote to pay later ? Do you also sell anything for which customers will pay now ? Managing all of your incoming revenue within your eCommerce site could be a really great system for you , so you 'll probably want to keep payments coming in through your site rather than through invoices , via PayPal , and all over the place . This will help you out when we talk about reporting . <p> If customers will end up paying when they book services ( i.e. , you sell services for a fixed fee ) , you 'll probably want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as products , accept payments , and manage any orders placed . The four plugins we 've mentioned can definitely help you to do this , as all can take payment for your services up front . <p> If you 'd like to instead invoice services and have customers pay them later , you may want to look at an invoicing solution that integrates with your eCommerce plugin . My favorite is FreshBooks they offer free trials if you 'd like to check them out . FreshBooks can integrate with either WooCommerce or EDD . <p> If you use WooCommerce FreshBooks , you 'll have complete synchronization between your WooCommerce shop and FreshBooks . You can use orders to generate invoices , and can even generate a new client for every single WooCommerce customer , or create all invoices under a default client . You can create or send invoices right from your WooCommerce admin . Invoices can be saved or sent automatically , and payments will even stay synced between the two systems whether customers pay via WooCommerce or FreshBooks . This is really helpful so that all revenue is tracked within WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a business overview at a glance . <p> If you use FreshBooks for EDD , an invoice , payment , and client are created in FreshBooks for each purchase . This will allow you to ensure that every download purchase can create or send an invoice . If you use the free Downloads to Services plugin we mentioned , this provides a really simple solution to managing both up-front payments and those that must be invoiced while still ensuring EDD reporting tracks all revenue . <h> Do You Need Recurring Payments ? <p> All four of the solutions mentioned can also use recurring payments for services that require monthly payments , such as utilities , website management plans , or retainers . Cart66 Cloud and Shopp have recurring payment capabilities built into their respective platforms , which can be tied to product or service purchases . <h> Managing Customers and " Orders " <p> Each of this plugins will allow you to effectively manage orders , view customer information , and add internal notes to orders . While your eCommerce plugin will not provide a full CRM system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , to resend emails , update customer information , view past orders , and view internal notes will be really helpful in managing services . <p> Cart66 Cloud will require you to leave your WordPress site to manage orders , while the other 3 plugins will allow you to view all orders right from the plugin admin . Of the other 3 , I think WooCommerce and Shopp slightly edge out EDD , as they allow you to view customer lists in the same place that you can view orders , but EDD requires you to view customer reports instead . WooCommerce can do this by filtering by customer , while Shopp provides a customer list . WooCommerce also does include a separate customer list under reports in addition to the information available with orders . <p> As a side note , WooCommerce also has a plugin that creates the ability to add custom fields to orders for easier administration Admin Custom Order Fields . This may help replace some of what 's needed from a CRM , as it allows administrators to create new order fields for better management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Using Reporting for a Business Overview <p> Reporting is a super helpful feature of WooCommerce , Shopp , and EDD . Using the built in reports , you can view revenue by date range , view customer lists , details on shipping and taxes , and more . WooCommerce will even let you view sales by product and category . <p> By keeping payment for all services and products located in one place , you can leverage reports to get information about your customers and the products or services offered . You 'll also see all revenue in one convenient place , which can then be exported to your accounting system as needed . <p> Here are some examples of reporting with each : <p> WooCommerce Sales Reporting <p> EDD Reports <p> Shopp Reporting <h> Conclusion : Go Sell Services using WordPress <p> Gravity Forms is probably best for sites that only sell a few services and have no need for recurring payments or order management . Its a very handy tool you probably already use , and it will allow you to collect project details and potentially collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to FreshBooks invoicing for " pay-later " capabilities . <p> WooCommerce is extremely flexible and is a great all-around choice . The tight integration with FreshBooks makes it a compelling choice for shops that want to use FreshBooks for invoicing or to sell via the store checkout , but it may be overkill if you sell nothing else besides a few services . However , the availability of extensions and other tools is a big positive . <p> Easy Digital Downloads will also allow you to integrate with FreshBooks to support immediate or future payments . Its more lightweight than WooCommerce but also offers several add-ons so you can get the extra shop tools you need . Its also flexible and provides a great choice for shops that wont be selling physical products . <p> Shopp does n't  offer as many integrations as other plugins , but does include recurring billing , easy order management , and the ability to sell both services and products . Its handy for those of you that want these capabilities within one plugin . <p> Cart66 Cloud rounds out our list to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sell products , services , memberships , and use recurring billing for almost any payment gateway . However , integrations are hard to come by , it does n't  do a great job with order management , and has no reporting capabilities . It provides a good all-around alternative to WooCommerce if you prefer to use a hosted solution instead , or require recurring payments with a particular gateway . <p> If you 're using any of these plugins or services , do n't  forget to check out our coupons and special offers !

Very helpful . Wondering if you know the answer to any of these : <p> I am a high school student starting a business with my brother . We are launching a company that finds refunds for customers on late packages . Essentially we have software that analyzes data , determines which packages are late , then submits those to shipping companies ( such as FedEx ) to get refunds for our customers . The refund gets charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then wants to be able to charge the customers credit card for a percent of the refund ( they would sign an agreement up front that we would be allowed to do so ) . Is there a way ( that you know of ) to use **30;646;TOOLONG else to be able to charge credit cards a varying amount only when we find refunds ? And then have the customer be able to sign into their account to see the packages we checked , the ones that were refunded , and how much they were charged etc ? <p> This is kind of a long winded and complicated question , but thank you for any input you may have . <p> Hey Abigail , youd need to use a payment gateway that will allow you to tokenize the customer card information ( such as Authorize.net CIM or Stripe ) , and you can use the saved token to run transactions later for the recovery fees . <p> As for an account system , that sounds pretty custom / niche , so afraid I do n't  know of a pre-built solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at buying the Woocommerce Subscriptions and I read articles you write .

@@98137984 @2337984/ <h> Creating WooCommerce Grouped Products in version 3.0+ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We 'd previously written a tutorial on setting up WooCommerce grouped products that many readers have referenced over time , as the concept of a " grouped " product can be a bit difficult to understand for a new shop owner . WooCommerce 3.0 changed the way grouped products are created in the shop , so were going to revisit this tutorial today , as we 've gotten some version of this question from many shop owners : <p> The way I set up my product groups in WooCommerce 3.0 has completely changed what 's the easiest way to do this now ? <p> Grouped products are a very useful feature for stores , as they give store owners a way of showing customers multiple products on the same page . Using a grouped product is helpful to : <p> show cross-sells or related items immediately together on one page , such as batteries for a camera or a screen protectors for a cell phone case <p> show various versions or options available for a product , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newest versions of WooCommerce have been welcome in my eyes , as they may setting up grouped products much easier for merchants who are just getting started with WooCommerce , but the new system is definitely a departure from the old one . here 's the main difference : <p> Before WooCommerce 3.0 , a merchant had to take these steps to set up a grouped product : <p> Create the parent grouped product , which just served as a " holder " or shell for other products that will belong in the group <p> Create each product that will belong to the group . For example if you wanted to offer a set of camera , batteries , and case , you would first create a " holder " product for the group , then the product for the camera , batteries , and case separately . <p> Youd then add each item to the group under " Linked products " when creating the group . <p> Now this process is essentially reversed in WooCommerce 3.0 and later . Rather than creating the grouped " holder " first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group to your store ( ie camera , batteries , and case first ) <p> Then add a new product to hold the group together . <p> On the new grouped product , add each item in the group to " Linked Products " . <p> So its definitely a new concept , but I think it makes more sense for new store owners to think this way " I 'll create my products and group them together " instead of " I 'll create the placeholder group , then add the products to it " . <p> So here 's what the new process looks like to create a grouped product with new versions of WooCommerce . <h> WooCommerce Grouped Products in version 3.0+ <p> The first thing you 'll now do is create each product that will belong to the group . I 'm going to stick with my camera example , and add each camera item and related product as a separate product listing in my store . <p> If you want these items to show up individually in your catalog , you can publish them and leave the items alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of your group , you should consider changing the catalog visibility of each item to make them " hidden " from the catalog : <p> Once you 've added all products that will belong to the group and determined whether they should be shown individually in your shop or not , you 're now ready to group them together . <p> here 's the most powerful thing about the changes to grouped products : because you no longer have to add the group on the individual item ; but rather , products are added to the group , well , through the group , you can add more product types into a group . This means that , while you could n't add a variable product to the group in previous versions , you can with WooCommerce 3.0+ . <p> So you can prepare your group by adding your final product : a grouped product . You 'll then add all of the items you just made to the group under " Linked products " . <p> Once you 've added all items to the group , you 're done = <p> You 'll now see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've added a variable product to the group , you 'll see that it shows " Select options " like the shop page instead of a quantity selector ( to ensure customers add a specific variation to the cart ) . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 11 Comments <p> Been building a new WooCommerce website for my company this past year , which includes a lot of grouped products . Finally updated both WooCommerce and my DIVI theme that connects to a child theme this past week . Even though there are some nice improvements , it unfortunately caused all the simple products in my groups to display the same group name for the simple products instead of the different product names .

@@98137986 @2337986/ <h> Key Value Metrics for new eCommerce Stores <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> There are a lot of things to keep in mind when you start an eCommerce business . It is an exciting , but also a challenging time . On the one hand , it is exciting as online stores open up a lot of possibilities options to sell different types of products to markets that were previously out of reach . Part of the challenge though is to transition from simply an online store , to a viable business . That 's where three key value metrics come in : gross revenue , gross profit , and net profit . <p> There are three things on your eCommerce store that you can to focus on right from the start . These are also generally the easiest to measure on most eCommerce platforms , like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads . <p> Gross revenue = the total amount customers spend on your store , including taxes and shipping costs . <p> Gross sales in WooCommerce default reports <p> Gross revenue , also called gross sales or total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store . This is part of the built-in reporting on both WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads . This gives you a measure of how much money customers are spending on your store . The more orders you have , whether small or big , the more gross revenue you generate . <p> Before anything else , you will need to make sales , which is what gross revenue measures . This means people need to find out about your store , like your products , and trust your store enough to spend their money . Once your store is getting orders , next step is to see whether you make any money off of those sales . <p> Gross profit = gross revenue - cost of goods <p> To find out whether you make any money from the sale of a product , you will need to subtract the cost of the product from its selling price . The cost of goods can include costs like cost of materials , labor costs , equipment used , etc. that help create a product . It is up to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , you may be selling a physical product and a digital product on your store . For the physical product , your cost of goods can include cost of product , cost of assembly , and equipment , whereas for your digital product , the cost may just be the labor time to produce the good . Again , depending on your business , it is up to you to determine what you include in your cost of goods . <p> The first two key value metrics have to do mostly with the individual products and their sale . The last thing to measure is for your business , which is your net profit . <p> Net profit = gross profit - overhead costs <p> The cost of goods are typically not the only costs that your business incurs . There can be overhead costs like website domain and server costs , warehousing fees , office rental costs , support staff fees , administrative fees like human resources , lawyers , accountants , etc . <p> The net profit measures how much money your business makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Net profit is what is often referred to as the bottom line . And net profit is how much money you will typically have to put towards expanding your business , and your product line-up . <p> There are many ways to measure these key metrics on your WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads stores . <h> Gross Revenue <p> You can use the basic reporting to measure the gross revenue and number of sales . You can also use free services like Google Analytics to track some information . <p> If you 're interested in using Google Analytics , we have an overview of available plugins or integrations in our article on getting average order value . <p> If you want to track gross revenue with more detail , the Advanced Reports plugin for Easy Digital Downloads will be helpful . <p> By default , you can access product specific reporting for individual products on Easy Digital Downloads . With the Advanced Reports extension , you can compare multiple products within the same report . <p> The extension also provides more enhanced information about earnings , sales , and store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track profit , there are n't  many plugins available on different platforms that can track item costs . WooCommerce offers a Cost of Goods plugin to do so . <p> The Cost of Goods extension allows you to add the cost of individual products , including variations , in the product dashboard . The extension uses this information to calculate and create enhanced reporting about your gross revenues and your gross profits . <p> Gross Profits overview <p> The extension adds detailed reporting about profitability during different periods , total value of inventory in stock , and a break down of profitability by product . <p> Profit per product <p> Since you can include cost of goods for individual products , the extension measures your most ( and least ) profitable sellers . <p> Your net profit will be measured by subtracting overhead ( such as salaries , website hosting costs , domain name costs , SSL certificates , and any other operational costs ) from your gross profits from sales . <h> Key value metrics for new eCommerce stores : Summary <p> For new eCommerce stores , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays afloat or not . These are gross revenue ( or gross sales ) , gross profits , and net profits . <p> Other metrics like customer satisfaction , or social return on investment , etc. are secondary to these when it comes to the viability of your business ( which is why these 3 are generally asked about on Shark Tank ! ) . This does n't  mean that other metrics are n't  important , as they can help improve the three key metrics . <p> You can easily calculate and monitor your gross sales and gross profits for your WooCommerce store using the Cost of Goods plugin . The plugin let 's you easily see your most profitable products so that you can focus on those , and work to make other products as profitable . <p> If you want detailed sales reports by product or other factores , the Advanced Reports extension for Easy Digital Downloads will be helpful . <p> While profit reporting is n't available within other platforms themselves , you can export sales data and do these calculations manually in a spreadsheet or accounting software . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started your eCommerce store ?

For example , if they purchase custom design services , I 'd like to send them a proof or final download in the " Account " section rather than emailing so I have it in my records . <p> This is a great question , but one that does n't  really have a definitive answer . If you 'd like to show a download in the " My Account " or " My downloads " section , no matter which eCommerce plugin you 're using , you 'll need to attach this download to a product . <p> This means that youd probably have to create a product that contains your custom download and assign it to the customers order ( not ideal as you 'll quickly rack up products unless you 're deleting them once the project is complete ) . The customer could then see this downloadable file in the " My account " section with plugins like WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are ways around this using WooCommerce or Shopp . Let 's discuss another method you could use to send download links to customers after purchase . <h> WooCommerce <p> You can use WooCommerce to add custom downloads to a customers account via a customer note . This can be added as a public order note while editing the order for your customer . You can include a link to the file , whether in your media drive or somewhere like Amazon S3 , so that the customer can download the file via this link . This wo n't set expirations or download limits , but they 're probably not as much of a concern with a customized product as they would be with something like software or an ebook . <p> When you add this note , be sure its a " Customer " type note . <p> WooCommerce add customer note <p> You 'll also see that it uses a different color in your order notes to signify that it was a public note shared with the customer . <p> Order Notes updated <p> This will do two things . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the order has been updated . <p> Second , this will now show in the " My Account " section if a customer views the details for that order : <p> Note in " My Account " <p> While this does n't  add the custom file under the " Downloads " section , it will be accessible both by email and the " My Account " section . <h> Shopp <p> You can also add customer notes using Shopp . These notes will not be displayed anywhere in the customers account , but the note will be emailed to the customer in relationship to the order being updated . <p> You can add a customer note while editing the order and checking that it should go to the customer : <p> Shopp Add Note <h> Other plugins <p> I 'm not aware of a similar solution for other eCommerce platforms ( to send customer notes ) , but most eCommerce plugin will include the customer email , so youd have to simply email your customized files and reference the appropriate order number in your email .

@@98137991 @2337991/ <h> How to create a vendor marketplace with WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Maintaining a unique , profitable product line is really hard . Pricing those products , managing an eCommerce store , and dealing with administrative tasks like shipping or website hosting can add to the burden of many entrepreneurs , which is why eCommerce marketplaces have become so popular . <p> Merchants can sell via Amazon , Etsy , Shapeways , and other marketplaces to avoid the hassle of creating their own store . For example , if you 're an EU merchant , the new VAT regulations that were imposed on January 1st may have made it difficult for you to sell digital products , as the administrative burden of doing so significantly increased . You may have been looking for such a marketplace to sell in = . <p> Managing a marketplace can be a great way to start an eCommerce business without the need to create your own product line instead , you can manage the site and sales community . Merchants benefit from a reduced administrative burden and the traffic or audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace takes a commission for each product sold to cover the costs of that administration ( such as time , shipping costs if you 'll ship products , etc ) . While managing a marketplace requires the level of dedication of running your own store ( and can very well take more ! ) , it can provide a source of revenue that does n't  require the up-front investment in products . <p> If you already manage your own store and have a thriving community , it can also be a way to diversify your revenue , as you can invite other merchants to sell via your site . This provides a commission for you in exchange for administration , which you 're probably already doing anyway if you 're running your own store . <p> You 'll need to decide how much administration you 'll take on : will you just manage incoming orders ? Will you handle customer pre-sales questions or issues ? Will you ship products or simply forward orders to the vendor ? Adjust the commission accordingly to account for the administration you 'll take on . <p> If you 're creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the WooCommerce Product Vendors extension could be the solution you 're looking for . Well walk through how to create a marketplace with WooCommerce using this extension , and what marketplace owners and vendors can do in this setup . <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Setup <p> Creating your marketplace with WooCommerce will require the $79 Product Vendors extension , but any other setup costs will be optional . Product Vendors will cover adding vendor information and tracking commissions . <p> If you sell your own products , you can allow vendor products to be displayed alongside of them within your catalog , or you can hide vendor products and manually display them elsewhere . You 'll also determine the base commission rate for your marketplace how much do vendors make from each sale ? This can be overridden for a particular vendor or for a product as well . <p> Product Vendors Settings <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Creating a Vendor <p> Once you 've determined your basic configuration , you can add vendors . Vendor products can be managed exclusively by shop administrators and managers , or vendors can be given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admin is set , then that user will be able to log into the site and manage his/her products ( but not others ) . If not , only the shop employees can manage products . <p> Add Vendors <p> Making a user a vendor admin will give them some additional capabilities that will let them manage their own products and submit them to you for approval ( or publish them if you 've allowed this ) . <p> Vendor Capabilities <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Assign Vendors <p> When vendors have been created , theyll be able to add their own products , or you can manually assign vendors to a particular product . This can be done while editing a product by checking one or more vendors for a product . <p> Assign Vendor <p> If more than one vendor is selected , then the commission will be split evenly , though you may want to adjust the per-product commission rate . For example , if vendors typically get 40% commission , but there are two vendors for a product , you may want to change the rate to 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've set a user as a vendor admin , theyll be able to manage any products associated with them , or any product they add . Theyll see a pared-down version of your shops admin dashboard to edit and add their own products . <p> Vendors : Product Management <p> If you require approval , vendors wont be able to publish products . Instead , they can submit them for approval : <p> Vendors : Add Products <p> Vendors also cant assign other vendors to the product , nor can they adjust commission rates for a product . Theyll have access to the information needed to manage the product and that 's it . <p> Once a vendor submits a product , you 'll be able to see it in " pending " status , and can then choose to edit or publish it as needed . <p> Products awaiting approval <p> If you do n't  want to allow vendors to edit their own products , you could require them to submit products via a form . We have a tutorial on doing so with Formidable Pro and WooCommerce . <h> WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside with the rest of your catalog if desired . For any product that has a vendor associated with it , the vendor information will be displayed in a product tab ( and could optionally be show with a widget instead or in addition to this ) . <p> Vendor Product <p> Customers can also view all products by a vendor by visiting the vendor page : <p> Vendor page <p> If a product has multiple vendors , then each vendors information will be displayed to the customer on the product page . <p> Product with Multiple Vendors <p> Other than the vendor information , customers wont see any other inner-workings of your marketplace , as the rest of the commissions process takes place behind the scenes . <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Managing Vendors and Commissions <p> When vendors sell a product , they wont be assigned a commission until the order is completed . Once the order reaches this status , commissions will be assigned using the vendors rate ( or your default if not set ) . If a product rate was set , it will override this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been generated will be visible in the new " Commissions " menu . You can view commissions , edit them , or manually add new ones . The commission will also link to the appropriate order so you can view full purchasing information for that commission . <p> Vendor Commissions <p> Product Vendors includes reports as well so you can get an overall view of vendor sales and commissions . These reports will show a graph of vendor sales and commissions , as well as earnings per month by vendor . <p> Vendors wont have access to any of their commission information , including these reports , unless you choose to share it . You can do so using a couple of shortcodes to optionally display commissions to vendors . These shortcodes will display nothing unless the logged in user is a vendor . If so , the user can see month-to-date sales totals or a complete earnings table : <p> Vendor Earnings display <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Paying Vendors <p> Paying vendors will be up to you . The easiest way to do so is via PayPal , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to PayPal Mass Payments . <p> Commissions will typically have an " Unpaid " status . Once youve exported commissions to a CSV and paid them out , you can then mark all commissions as " paid " with a bulk action . <p> Depending on the products in your marketplace , you may want to delay commission payments in case of returns . Many marketplaces hold commissions for a month and then pay them out monthly to account for refunds or returns . <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Pros and Cons <p> That covers most of marketplace creation and management . While Product Vendors provides a simple , all-in-one solution for setting up your marketplace and commissions , there are upsides and downsides to using it . <p> Pros <p> Cons <p> Vendors can manage own products <p> No automatic vendor payment <p> Commissions can be exported / status bulk-changed <p> No default page to display all vendors <p> Adds a " Vendor " tab and info to products <p> No vendor application <p> Can assign multiple vendors <p> Vendor earnings not automatically displayed ( needs shortcode ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could have vendors register for an account using your WooCommerce customer registration form ( typically on the Checkout and My Account pages ) . Vendors could then get in touch with you to upgrade to a vendor account via another form on your site . However , I was n't a fan of this and would prefer a " Vendor " application form instead . <p> You can use any form generator to gather more information about your vendors in your application , and youd then manually create users . However , I created users automatically with my form builder instead to cut out a step the way I did this in my test shop was to use Gravity Forms ( developer license needed ) + the User Registration Add-on ( hence the developer license ) . <p> I created a customized " Vendor Application " form that created a new user account ( with a role of " customer " ) when the application was submitted . This let me review the information I wanted , such as why the vendor is a good fit for the marketplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer account . You can delete the user if you reject the application , or you can edit the user and set him/her as a vendor admin when you approve the vendor . <p> This certainly is n't a necessary step , but if you want an " Application " process that can help to automate things a bit , this is one option . Without it , you 'll simply have to manually add user accounts for vendors and assign them as admins , or require a customer account to be created , then upgrade it . <p> here 's a sample form you can download from Dropbox ( and import to Gravity Forms ) and the setup I had in the User Registration Add-on to get you started if you choose to go this route : <h> WooCommerce Marketplace : Summary <p> You can create you own eCommerce marketplace using WooCommerce and the Product Vendors extension . While it may not have all of the features on my wishlist , it does provide a complete solution for adding and managing vendors , allowing vendors to manage their own products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vendor admins can manage and add their own products , which reduces the amount of management you need to do , and let 's vendors take control of their products . <p> Regardless of whether you 're simply managing a marketplace or allowing vendors to sell products alongside of your own , Product Vendors will support your setup to help you create your marketplace with WooCommerce. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Enrico , you can indeed use it with WooCommerce Bookings . Bookings can have vendors and commissions attached , and vendors can create their own bookable products . Youd have to pay out commissions to vendors , or use something like PayPal Adaptive Payments to split payments automatically . <p> What most authors / users forget are the seller review / rating functions . Many of the marketplace plugins either do n't  have this function or is not fully functional . There really is n't any rating / review plugins that works with marketplace plugins , at least not that I know of . <p> Thanks for your reply Beka . When you say limited compatibility what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woocommerce of a marketplace build with product vendor and bookings it seems to work . However as the booking plugins is expensive i prefer to be sure of the compatibility before buying it . <p> I think right now it includes the base booking price in vendor commissions , but I have n't really tried these together myself in some time . I 'd recommend pinging the Woo team with this question to be sure = <p> will the plugin work in a way that only list all one vendor product in a time and send the vendor email or other notice when the order is done . But only one vendor check out at a time ? it will become a separate order if the customer ship a product with different order ? Thanks . <p> Hey Ryan , its more one or the other , they 're two ways of solving the same problem : how to create a multi-seller marketplace . I 'm not very familiar with WC Marketplace myself , so afraid I do n't  really have insights for that , sorry ! <p> Can this work with the Woocommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , can a vendor receive a booking request , confirms it , before the customer gets an email/invoice for payment ? <p> The scenario is that vendors set up products , admin set up a commission for site owner , customer request availability , vendor confirms availability , customer gets notified for payment . <p> Our products have multiple vendors for a single product . We would like the users to be able to choose the vendor from a drop down menu while buying the product . In the backend the vendor get notified automatically of the order recieved <p> Hey Divya , I 'm afraid that products ca n't be associated with multiple vendors . My recommended way of approaching this would be : ( 1 ) set up all vendor products , and make them hidden from the catalog . ( 2 ) make a " master " product , and use something like Product Retailers for it to sell via retailers and not your site . ( 3 ) For each vendor , list them as a " retailer " on your master product . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " link for the vendors hidden product . <p> This would let you hide each vendors version of the product , but then sell it via the " master " product , giving the customer the choice in vendor , while keeping the purchase within your site . Definitely an abstracted process , but the only other choice is a fair bit of custom code to set your system up . <p> Hey , I need a multi-vendor setup allows files to be uploaded and then sent to end user . Is this an appropriate plugin to do that ? I notice you have to use product enquiry to communicate with customers , or order notes , but do either of these support image attachments . <p> This plugin would let you set up and manage vendors , but sharing files with customers is n't an easy thing to do via WooCommerce . I 'd check this tutorial out and use it in conjunction with Product Vendors . <p> Sure thing ! The commission that Product Vendors sets up is the amount that goes to the vendor , so if you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set that to something other than 100% . <p> Your article was very usefull to me . About taxonomy , i do n't  understand , which one is gets the commision , because i understand that the store owner , me , is the one tha gets the commission from the sales , the money of the byers are coming first to me and then its me that i 'm going to pay the vendors , or the opossite , the money goes to their account and then the amount of 5% of the sale to my account ? Thank you for your time . Iam going to have very soon an e marketplace in Greece and i need that answer . regards <p> Hey Tasos , in this kind of set up , you 'd be responsible for processing payments and paying out to the vendors . You could also use something like PayPal Adaptive payments to automatically distribute the commissions for you at the time of purchase . <p> Let 's suppose I have a digital products marketplace , and at the end of the month I send payments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is : do they have to send me invoices previous I send the money ? Or does this plugin make self invoices for each one of the vendors ? . In this case how the plugin deals with different tax and laws of invoicing of different vendors countries ? <p> Hey Antonio , if you wanted to pay vendors monthly , you could set up recurring payouts with PayPal , or you can export unpaid commissions manually each month ( see details here ) . If you need invoices from your vendors , theyll have to generate them and send them to you manually , but invoices are not required to make payouts . <p> As for taxes , I believe the tax is always assessed on the marketplaces location rather than the vendors , but that 's not something I 'm too familiar with myself , so I 'd recommend consulting with your attorney or accountant on that point .

You may not be thinking about what other products you could offer , or how you can expand your catalogue with minimal cost and effort . <p> Gift certificates provide the ability to do just that : expand your catalogue . Best of all , there are no extra inventory costs , minimal fulfillment costs ( if any ) , and they can be an excellent supplement for holiday shoppers or gift-givers . Today well cover : <p> I also have a case study centered around selling gift certificates posting on Wednesday of this week , which highlights some of the reasons outlined here . <h> 3 Reasons You Should Already Sell Gift Cards <p> Gift cards can make a tremendous addition to your shop catalog without the need to expand your product line . Not only do customers look to purchase gift certificates around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to your shop , keeping existing customers happy and helping you acquire new ones . <p> The only investment you 'll have to make to sell gift certificates is to add a gift card plugin to your store . Fortunately , many eCommerce plugins for WordPress have gift certificates or voucher add-ons that can help you achieve this with a turnkey ( or close to it ) solution . <p> Let 's start with some reasons to sell gift certificates and statistics you should know about gift cards , then I 'll include a list of helpful plugins . <p> More than half of consumers bought at least one gift card for the holidays in 2011 , something for retailers to keep in mind as the holiday shopping season approaches . <p> Gift cards are a popular holiday choice , but they 're also great for birthdays , anniversaries , and other gifts . By offering gift cards , you can capture orders you would n't otherwise get from gift givers who are specifically interested in sending certificates or cards . <p> Gift certificates also help you capture new customers . When someone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store to redeem it , giving you the opportunity to turn them into a loyal customer in the hopes of a repeat visit , future purchase , or word-of-mouth referral . <p> This is actually how I 'd originally found Etsy , as I was given a gift certificate for it as it became popular , and I revisited the site to make my own purchases and send gift cards to friends . <h> 2 . Increase Order Value <p> This is one of the best reasons to include gift certificates in your store : gift card purchases typically exceed the gift card amount . Customers tend to want to use entire gift certificate amount , and will frequently order items that exceed this amount . First Datas research backs this up : <p> the majority of gift card recipients ( 71 percent ) spend more than the amount of the card . <p> Basically , by selling a gift certificate , you have a 7 in 10 chance that you 'll also get additional revenue out of that sale . <p> Gift certificate amounts have also increased . First Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop card certificate specific to one store purchased in 2011 rose more than 23 percent year over year , from $34 in 2010 to $42 in 2011 . <p> Not only can gift certificates yield additional revenue when redeemed , but the amount purchased for gift certificates tends to increase over time . <h> 3 . Offer Product Choices <p> Gift cards are a win for both the purchasers and the gift card recipients . Gift card givers love them because they can show thoughtfulness by giving a gift for a specific retailer rather than cash , but gift-giving is still easy . <p> When asked why they choose to purchase gift cards rather than a gift , 83 percent of respondents said that gift cards make gift-giving easy , and more than half said they save shopping time . Almost three quarters of consumers liked the ease of mailing gift cards to recipients who live far away . First Data <p> Gift cards also have a higher perceived value than gift certificates : <p> When asked whether they would prefer a gift with a value ranging from $20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred the gift card even compared to a gift at a higher price point . <p> Gift recipients also appreciate the choice that a gift card affords them . Rather than going through a returns process for unwanted gifts , they can choose their own gift , and are encouraged to do so with a gift card rather than cash . <p> Gift certificate-giving is split between e-cards and physical cards , so offering both may not be a bad idea . Most customers like to print out a card or voucher , or receive one in the mail , so they have a physical " gift " to give . <p> Since selling gift certificates can be a great benefit to your store without forcing you to add products to your catalog , how can you create a gift card system ? <h> Gift Certificate Add-ons for WordPress eCommerce <p> While you can achieve a gift card solution with custom code , there are some pre-built add-ons that can either create a gift card system for you , or provide a starting point for customizing your own gift card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-ons or integrations you may find helpful to create gift card , gift certificates , or e-card systems . <h> Selling Gift Certificates with WooCommerce <p> Redeeming certificates online:Smart Coupons ( $99 ) is a comprehensive solution for both coupons and gifting . You can create a store credit system , send e-gift certificates to customers , and gift certificates can even be sent to multiple recipients . <p> To sell a gift certificate , you can create a " store credit / certificate coupon " , and use the product price instead of a coupon amount .

While one has been on the roadmap for sometime , this is the topic of several past forum posts . <p> However , there are a couple of workarounds that you can use instead . <p> Redeeming certificates online : To allow customers to purchase gift certificates online , you can use a manual creation process to add store credit to customer accounts , which wont provide a certificate code or automatic email to customers , so you should disclose this up-front .

This will also be added under your " Products List " with the unique code . Gift certificates are treated like store cash , so part of the certificate can be redeemed , and the rest will be saved . <p> They could also be redeemed in-person , as you 'll be able to see the amount left on the certificate in your admin , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certificates with WP EasyCart <p> I have n't used gift certificates with WP EasyStore , but documentation on gift cards is fairly straight-forward , and they 're built into the core offering . I do n't  believe that gift codes are automatically sent to recipients , but they can be manually emailed or printed by the gift giver . They can be redeemed online during checkout . <p> Gift certificates are also treated like cash with EasyCart , as they can be partially redeemed and saved for later . Cards can be viewed from the admin so you can see the remainder , and I 'm not sure if they can be deleted if redeemed in person . <h> Gift Certificates with WP eStore <p> You can generate online redeemable vouchers for your store using the Voucher Add-on ( $39 ) . This will allow you to set up a voucher than can be printed or emailed , and the voucher can be used like cash in your store . If redeemed for less than the voucher amount , the remainder can still be used at a later time . <p> You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number against the list of issued vouchers in your admin . This list will show you which vouchers have been issued and which have been redeemed . I 'm not sure if there are manual actions that would allow you to redeem the voucher via the admin , but I 'm guessing you can delete the voucher if redeemed in person . <h> Selling Gift Certificates with WordPress eCommerce <p> Selling gift certificates in your WordPress eCommerce store is a great way to increase revenue without adding anything to your product line or catalogue , as you can instead capture gift orders . Gift certificates can provide extra value as well when redeemed by the recipient , as they tend to spend more than what the voucher is worth when redeeming it . <p> There are several solutions available for WordPress eCommerce stores to sell gift cards that can be redeemed online , in person , or both . While each may not be a turnkey solution , they 're relatively inexpensive ways to expand your offering to capture more revenue , and I 'm excited to bring you a case study next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from gift certificate sales . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98137994 @2337994/ <h> How to Use WooCommerce Shipping Classes <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce includes several core shipping methods , but you may need to extend your general shipping rules with the ability to add additional costs . If simple flat rate shipping wo n't work for you , you should consider using the WooCommerce shipping classes . <p> Shipping classes will allow you to add classes to items or variations that can control how costs are calculated . For example , this can allow you to add shipping or handling surcharges for certain items in addition to your standard shipping costs . <p> They can be used with several shipping method types . As far as built-in options go , WooCommerce shipping classes can be used with the Flat Rate option , but they can also be use with the Table Rate shipping plugin , or other shipping plugins that take advantage of shipping classes . Some other shipping methods may also add their own information to the shipping classes options , such as FedEx classes to correspond to FedEx class codes . <p> Theres documentation on using shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in this WooCommerce shipping classes tutorial so you can see how theyll work throughout the purchasing and checkout processes , and how each cost option is calculated . <h> WooCommerce Shipping Classes : Basic Setup <p> To use shipping classes , youd first need to create some classes under Products &gt; Shipping Classes . Add a class for any " criteria " that will add a cost . For example , if you 'd like to charge a " freight " rate for oversized items , you can add a class for this . This can also be helpful for items that require rush shipping , insurance , or specialized packaging . Each class can add an additional shipping and / or handling fee . <p> Once you 've added your classes , you can add them to products from the " Product Data " box under Shipping : <p> One of the best parts of this is that you can use different shipping classes for different variations . You can choose to adopt the parent shipping class , or change it for a particular variation . This can be great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ship with tracking " for a particular product : you can simply make this one of the purchasing options and add the right shipping class . <p> Once you 're done , you 'll then need to add the costs for your shipping classes for both shipping and handling . These costs will be applied if an item from the class is in the order based on the " Cost added " rules . <h> WooCommerce Shipping Classes : " Costs Added " Settings <p> This setting will be used to determine how the additional costs generated by these classes will be added to your WooCommerce orders . here 's a quick explanation of how each cost option will be used . For each example , I 'll use the built-in Flat Rate shipping method with a base cost of $3.00 per order . My shipping class costs will be added on top of this $3 charge . <p> Base Flat Rate <h> Per Order charge shipping for the entire order as a whole <p> If you select Per Order , any additional costs will be charged only once for the entire cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains one of your shipping classes , a single charge will be added to the order for the cost you 've specified for that class . Quantity for the item can increase , but the fee will only be added to the cart once . <p> If an order contains items in more than one shipping class , only the highest charge will be added . For example , if one item has a shipping class that adds a $30 charge and another item is in a class that adds a $10 charge , only $30 will be added to the order total for shipping costs ( on top of your flat rate and handling fees ) . This means that per order shipping is best if you only want the highest charge to be the one that 's added . <p> Sample Use Case:Insuring the shipping parcel <p> Let 's assume that some items that you ship will require shipping insurance , which should add a charge . In this example , I 'm going to ship a mug , which wed like to insure in case it breaks . The per-order total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to the mug , will be $3.97 . Notice that with a mug added to the cart , my total is $3 flat rate + $3.97 insurance fee to get $6.97 : <p> Since this is a per-order charge because I only have to insure the package once , the shipping cost will remain the same , no matter how many mugs are ordered . <p> This can be handy if you have a couple of insurance classes only the highest insurance class fee will be added to the order . If you 'd want a fee added for each insurance class , check out Per Class additions below . <h> Per Item charge shipping for each item individually <p> Selecting Per Item will add a charge for every single item in a shipping class . The charge is added on a per-item basis , so adding additional quantities of an item will add an extra charge for each item that 's added to the cart . If you have items from different shipping classes , the charge will be added for each item . <p> For example , let 's return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class fee and a $10 shipping class fee are added to the cart . With this setting , the total shipping fee addition will be $40 , and will increase if the quantities of the items are increased . <p> Sample Use Case:Freight item shipping <p> If you 're shipping freight items , you may want a class that adds a shipping fee for each of these items , as these are expensive shipping costs you probably do n't  want to absorb . Each time and item with this shipping class is added to the cart , the order total will increase as the shipping class fee is added . <p> Let 's use a " Freight " class item , which should add a $30 shipping fee and a $5 handling fee on a per item basis . If one of these is added to my cart , the base $3 fee will have $35 added to it : <p> If I increase the quantity of the item , $35 will be added for each quantity increase . <h> Per Class charge shipping for each shipping class in an order <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two methods . The shipping class fee will be added if an item from the class is in the cart , but will only be added once , regardless of item quantity . The difference between per order and per class cost additions is that per order fees are only ever added once : the highest fee is used . Per class fees will add a fee for each class in the cart , not just the highest one . <p> If I have a item in a class with a $30 fee and an item in a class with a $10 fee added to my cart , $40 will be added to my shipping total . I can increase the quantities of the items I 'm ordering , but the total fee will remain the same since its only added once per class . <p> Sample Use Case:Hazardous materials or perishable goods <p> Let 's assume you 're selling womens accessories and jewelry . If you sell perfume above 30mL , youd need to abide by hazardous shipping standards in your packaging since the item is flammable . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume containers are ordered , so you only want to assess this fee if a Hazmat article is in the cart . <p> However , you may want to then also charge if insurance is needed ( for example , on a high-end jewelry item ) . If you 'd used a " per order " basis for costs , only the higher cost would be used . Per class will instead add a fee once each time a new shipping class ( i.e. , Hazmat and Insurance ) is present in the cart . <p> I 've also seen this used for perishable food goods to add a cost to the order if a cooler or similar will be needed for packaging , as the cooler would only be required once when a perishable item was ordered . <p> Heres what it would look like in action : if items from different shipping classes are added to the cart , notice that the fee per class is added once to the shipping total . In the example below , my $3 flat rate fee will have $35 added for my " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insured " class . <p> Increasing the item quantities will not change the total shipping costs . However , the cost will increase if an item from a different class is added to the cart . <h> WooCommerce Shipping Classes : Summary <p> Per order and per item fees are typically used when your shipping classes are adding costs for one thing , such as a tiered insurance fee or a per-item " heavy shipping " fee . Per class fees are helpful if you 'll have classes doing different things , and you need to charge once for each class if an applicable item is in the cart . <p> The downside to using shipping classes is that you cant determine how to add costs on a per-class basis . For example , you ca n't set rules for each class , i.e. , " Freight " rates should be added per item , but " Insured " rates are per order . <p> If you need this sort of fine-grained control , I recommend using something like Table Rate Shipping rather than the core Flat Rate shipping so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98137999 @2337999/ <p> Earlier in this series , we 've talked about how important segmentation can be to your membership site ; you can give members plan-specific information , and target emails to only active members . This keeps your members engaged and gives them a reason to keep renewing their memberships . <p> Well look at how to get member data from MemberPress into MailChimp , then segment emails using these membership fields . <h> Set Up MemberPress MailChimp List <p> The first thing well need is a list for our site members . While MemberPress can allow your members to hold multiple memberships , you can still use one MailChimp list for all of your members . Well determine which membership a member has based on a MailChimp merge tag . <p> Within your MailChimp list , add a text field for each membership for which you plan to segment emails . For example , if I have a " Silver Membership " , I 'll add a list field ( type = text ) for this membership . MemberPress will update this field automatically if someone becomes a member with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership , inactive . <p> You 'll also notice a field for " Site Member " on my list . You can have one " catch-all " merge tag as well . This field will get an update for anyone who becomes a member , regardless of status , to give you a quick way to email any one who is , or has been , a site member . <p> Once these fields are set up in MailChimp , you 're ready to move onto the MemberPress side of things . <h> Set up MemberPress MailChimp Add-on <p> MemberPress has some useful documentation around getting members into MailChimp that I 'd recommend checking out . Well go over the basics of integrating MailChimp here . <p> When you purchase a MemberPress license ( $99-$199 ) , you 'll have access to several add-ons for free in your account . As not every user will integrate with every email list , this gives you a way to pick which email service you want to use without running a lot of unneeded code on your site . <p> I downloaded and installed the MailChimp add-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MemberPress site connected pretty quickly . You can go to MemberPress &gt; Marketing and enable the MailChimp integration . You 'll enter your MailChimp API Key here , and set some site-wide settings . <p> Select your email list that all members should be subscribed to , along with the " catch-all " merge tag for site members you have set up . This will take effect for anyone who purchases a membership . <p> Now you can set up some membership-specific rules . Any membership for which you 've created a MailChimp merge tag can be viewed and updated now . Go to MemberPress &gt; Memberships , and select the membership you 'd like to sync with MailChimp . Under the " Advanced " options for the membership , select the merge tag you created in MailChimp . <p> Now any time a user purchases this membership , theyll be added to your MailChimp list , and will also have this merge tag updated to active . If the membership ends , then this field will automatically update to inactive , ensuring that you 're able to easily email all active members only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Set Up Member Email Segments <p> We can use these values to schedule targeted emails for member communications . <p> 1 . Email All Active Members Sometimes new content is available to all members on your site , and you want to inform everyone of this new benefit . Rather than emailing members of each plan individually , you can email all active members at once . <p> You 'll create a new segment where subscribers match any of the conditions . This acts as an " or " scenario ; in my example below , anyone who has an active silver membership or an active gold membership will get this email . <p> Just be sure you use " membership is active " for your rule , not something like " membership contains active " , as this would include inactive members = <p> 2 . Email Active Members of a particular plan Sometimes your announcements are plan-specific , and you want to let only people with that membership or plan access know about updates or changes . You can create segments for specific memberships in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold members : <p> However , I could add another " any " rule if I wanted to email both active and inactive members about new benefits . <p> 3 . Email All Members If you have broad announcements that youd like to share with all members , you can do this in a couple of ways . <p> First , if you only want to inform active members , you can follow example one . However , let 's say you want to email anyone who 's been a member the announcement or email may have the potential to entice some expired members to re-subscribe . While you could check for all active / inactive merge tags , a quicker way to segment emails with this is to use your " catch-all " tag . <p> If someone on your list has purchased a membership , this tag will be equal to 1 , so you can use this to segment the email . <h> Creating Advanced Segments <p> You may want to create segments based on other data , such as a sign up date . However , this becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one membership . For example , if you have a " signup date " field in MailChimp , there 's no way to know which membership this signup date belongs to is it for the silver membership ? The gold one ? <p> If you 'd need more advanced segments , you could consider coupling member exports with multiple lists in MailChimp . You could create one list per membership , and then import your members via CSV to MailChimp . This would let you use more member data for segments , since the list would be tailored to one membership alone . <p> This process is definitely more complicated and manual ( as opposed to the really useful automatic syncing with one list ) , so I would n't really recommend going this route unless its absolutely necessary . <p> If you do need to have more advanced segments , you can add more merge tags into your membership-specific lists , then export members to CSV from MemberPress &gt; Subscriptions . You can manually sort and break this CSV up by membership type to then import into MailChimp . <h> Segment Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sync your members with external email services , including services like MailChimp . While you ca n't segment on anything other than membership type or status , for many sites this will be all that 's needed in terms of segmenting member emails . <p> The ability to keep members in one list is useful , as you 'll save money on subscriber count ( when subscribers are in separate lists , they 're counted towards your account total multiple times ) . The fact that the membership status is synced to your site is a huge bonus as well , making this integration simple and efficient to use . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

While not every customer type finds them helpful , they 're a lifecycle email that can directly drive revenue by : <p> reminding customers to buy in case they 've been distracted during purchase <p> incentivizing purchase via free shipping , coupons , or other offers <p> drive more sales by including up-sells , cross-sells , or coupons on additional items aside from what was in the cart <p> uncovering issues in your purchase funnel for improved conversions <p> There are several best practices for recovery emails to ensure you 're both overcoming purchasing hurdles and encourage purchase ( or higher order values ) , such as iterating return / shipping policies , asking about checkout issues , or offering free shipping in later emails . <p> Weve written about using Jilt for WooCommerce or EDD recovery emails , through which most merchants see 15 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if your store sells $10,000 a month , you could expect to earn about $1,000 $3,000 in additional revenue per month . <h> Lifecycle Emails : Post-Purchase Emails <p> Follow-up emails help facilitate positive brand sentiment which , in turn , leads to more sales ConversionXLSending an email to customers after a purchase has been completed not only improves their experience overall with your store , but is also a valuable time to ask for feedback , gather product reviews , or cross-sell related products . <p> Ensuring customers had a great experience also drives future sales , as according to HBR , " customers who had the best past experiences spend 140% more compared to those who had the poorest past experience " . <p> You can implement a post-purchase email with MailChimp automation or a plugin like AutomateWoo to send an email to customers after an order has been marked " completed " . <h> Driving Additional Sales with Lifecycle Emails <p> There are several other kinds of lifecycle emails that can be used more effectively for your store , but these are 3 that are easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store . <p> If you 'd like to keep learning about other lifecycle email opportunities , I share my top 5 and go into more detail about what selling opportunities each provides in the WooCurve Summit , which can be viewed June 1 to June 4 for free !

@@98138003 @2338003/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Running successful membership sites requires constant optimization and sometimes involves restructuring to maximize revenue from the membership model . Jason recently made the decision to migrate his wildly popular membership site , Paleo Plan , to a different membership platform , and agreed to share his thoughts with us on that process and what points he had to consider in the move . <h> Why I 'm switching from WooCommerce to MemberMouse for my subscription-based company <p> Four years ago when I started Paleo Plan there were very few solutions for someone building a membership site using WordPress . I chose a ( now discontinued ) plugin that integrated with PayPals recurring payments , and created membership levels that allowed me to protect content from non-members . At the time , this was about as much sophistication as I thought I needed , and it was about all that was offered . <p> Skip ahead two years , and my side-project was now my full-time job . It had grown up a bit , and my needs were suddenly significantly larger than what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I found WooCommerce and their recently released Subscriptions extension . I was ecstatic . <p> After migrating to WooCommerce , and making the decision to only offer new subscriptions via Stripe and move away from PayPal , our little company continued to grow and we rapidly increased in sophistication as I worked with better marketers and learned more about running a membership site . I also had the pleasure of being one of the largest sites using the Subscriptions extension , and therefore was regularly pushing it to its boundaries . <p> I still love the tool , but I 've now found WooCommerce to now be less than I need , and now I 'm moving on to MemberMouse , a tool 100% focused on membership sites built with WordPress , and with a keen eye to the needs of those running the sites . <p> I want to stop for a moment and make sure I give proper respect where its due . WooCommerce is still a fantastic product , and one that I think will serve many people very , very well . Its very easy to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser-focused on maximizing membership revenue , it solves the Subscriptions problem very well . <p> Its also still my go-to solution for any physical good , or for non-recurring products . However , for what I 'm looking these days , it cant seem to give me . <p> There were a few things specifically that finally pushed me over the edge and get me to migrate to MemberMouse . In no particular order : <p> Member Communication : Our product is one that people either get or they do n't  within the first few days . And thus staying in touch with them over the course of their first few days as a member will have an enormous impact on how long they stay an active member . We tried to use the Follow-Up Emails extension as a way to schedule emails to go out at specific intervals after signup , but we have enough users that it was pretty much killing our site because of the way Follow-up Emails schedules its events . <p> At MemberMouse , rather than building an emailing system , they simply chose to integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to use MailChimps scheduler and email templates . As a bonus , part of that integration can move members around to different MailChimp lists based on their current purchase history , or if they 're still an active member or not . Now , were using a tool specifically designed for email communication and our Subscription tool just has to sync with it . This is a huge win and a consistent philosophy of the MemberMouse team . <p> Upsells and Confirmation-Page Add-ons : <p> This was probably the biggest thing for us . We have a few specific products that go very well together , but we never had a simple way to communicate the complimentary products at checkout , which could allow the user to add to their cart while checking out . Part of that is because WooCommerce does n't  allow membership and non-membership products in the cart at the same time ( I hear this is changing with an upcoming release ) , and partly because some of our add-ons would actually change the product membership they were buying . <p> At MemberMouse , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current product in the cart with the new one , and you make that product a bundle of the two different complimentary products . It automatically adjusts the payment info and any other details that the extra product would change . Its very seamless . <p> Also , when using Stripe , you can save the customers card data at Stripe . This allows you to create an Add-on sales event on the confirmation page . You simply add in a short code to the confirmation page , and suddenly you 're offering another product . And because the user is now logged in , and their credit card is on file , there 's no need for the customer to go back and re-check out ; they simply hit Buy and then confirm , and the new product is sold . You can even configure a one-click purchase without the confirmation , but I think well use the confirmation to make sure people do n't  accidentally buy something . I have huge expectations for this feature alone as its well documented that its up to 60% easier to sell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of purchase is precisely the time to offer more to buy . <p> Support : <p> While WooCommerce has made huge improvements to their support system , one of the problems that will always plague them is that they rely so heavily on 3rd party developers to create extensions for their core product . Its a great model , but what happens when the 3rd party developer is n't as good at support as you need ? On more than one occasion , a WooCommerce extension I was using was n't working correctly , and I had to wait until they got around to fixing it and testing it and releasing an update . My site is my livelihood , and that was sometimes a bummer . There 's nothing you can do but wait , and cross your fingers . <p> With MemberMouse , its one company , providing one service . And since you 're paying them monthly , they take care of you and make sure you 're problems are solved themselves ( MemberMouse itself is a subscription service , compared with Woos one-off payments for their plugins ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified me as the site with the most active users utilizing their Subscriptions extension . Because of this , there are scaling issues that I 've discovered that they werent aware of previously . While it sounds minor , waiting 10 seconds every time you try and pull up your Subscribers list or search for an order can become tiresome very quick when dealing with an active support load . Theyve already issued one update specifically because I was breaking the plugin when trying to search , but its still slow and unresponsive when you have thousands of members . <p> MemberMouse happens to be built for companies with hundreds of thousands of users , which makes my load seem light and manageable to their service . <p> Little Things : <p> Then , there are the little things . With MemberMouse , I can cancel an account AND refund a payment from the same screen . Currently , I have to cancel at my WP Admin , and then login to Stripe to do the refund . I can also upgrade membership levels , change payment info , and tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to when billing time comes . When you have thousands of customers , dealing with them is time consuming , and every little thing that makes that quicker and easier counts . Plus , its demonstrative of their approach to the business . <p> Not Being Biased : <p> Now , this article sounds like a sales pitch for MemberMouse , and its not meant to be ; its simply my thoughts and the pros and cons of why I left WooCommerce . There are some things that are n't  yet available in MemberMouse , or that are a small step backwards from WooCommerce . For instance , if a user cancels their account , its immediately terminated and even if they have paid for a month and have two weeks left , their access to paid content ends . This is a step back , but MemberMouse says they 're bringing a fix to that in the new year . <p> Update : The newest version of MemberMouse addresses this issue . Member status now becomes " Pending Cancellation " but the user retains access until the end of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> There are a few small things like this , however , the other advantages make small things like this tolerable . I 'd rather give a disgruntled user a complete refund if they expected sustained access until their payment terms ended rather than lose sales on other customers because of limits to the platform . And plus , with MemberMouse , the refund only takes a second = . <p> Note : There are several other services out there that may have equal or superior offerings than either of the companies I mentioned in this article . This is not meant to be an overview of the marketplace , but rather , my experience running a company , and why I chose the services I did . I also will say that a huge part of my decision was I was able to chat with the founder and CEO of MemberMouse , Eric Turnnessen , and hear his vision for the company , how he s built what they already have , and what 's in near-term pipeline , and I was convinced . They were also instrumental in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find any other company offering that level of service and product . <p> Paleo Plan is a membership site helping people to follow the Paleo diet by offering meal plans , shopping lists , and recipes . They also have several ebooks about eating Paleo as well as fitness products as well .

Over the next 5 months , we worked on that transition to get all of our previous content and membership ready for the new website . <p> MemberMouse has allowed me to customize the user experience , and streamline the processes that were so frustrating before , with relative ease . <p> Suddenly the world was my oyster , being allowed to do essentially anything I put my mind to with the use of push notifications , tight integration with Mailchimp , Stripe , Paypal and so on . lts been really amazing ! <p> I 'm not sure if you 've actually made the transition yet .

Ca n't wait to see them grow and get rewarded . <p> Furthermore , I find it interesting that the title of this article is " Running Successful Membership Sites " , yet , it talks about why youre switching to MemberMouse . <p> Well , I could n't agree more ! <p> Unlike you , I 'm completely biased .

When I check out at Amazon , I do n't  typically question whether or not my purchase is protected , and I know that hundreds of thousands of customers just like me use Amazon to order almost anything and everything . <p> As an independent eCommerce retailer , you wo n't get the benefit of the doubt that large sites get , and you 'll need to build customer trust from the ground up . Improved trust yields increased buying comfort and conversions , and there are several strategies you can use to improve trust on your eCommerce site . <p> Each of this is definitely worth split testing on your site to see how conversions are affected . If you do run these test , I 'd love to hear about it in the comments ! <h> 1 . Use an SSL Certificate <p> Even if your payment gateway integration does not require you to use an SSL certificate ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site to build customer trust . Many customers have been trained to look for the " little green lock " in the address bar when entering sensitive payment details , and they wont excuse the lack of security reassurance just because you 're sending them off site for payment details . In fact , they wo n't even know this until reaching checkout , and should be reassured before reaching this page . <p> Showing customers that your site is secure increases comfort and confidence in purchasing . <p> If you 're not sure what kind of SSL certificate to purchase , we have an overview of different types available . My preferred source of inexpensive SSL certificates is NameCheap you can pick up a Comodo domain validated SSL certificate for as little as $9 per year ( which includes a free site seal ) . The small investment is completely worth it to improve trust on your site . <h> 2 . Include Payment and Shipping Logos <p> When you display logos from payment or shipping providers on your site , you show customers that you use popular methods they 're comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method logos can be added to your site manually , such as in your footer or on your cart page . You can display the methods you use so customers know who will be delivering their packages and this eliminates uncertainty about shipping . <p> Most popular platforms , such as WooCommerce , EDD , and WP eCommerce , will display accepted payment icons on the checkout page or with particular payment method ( as do many extensions or add-ons for these platforms ) . However , you can also display these accepted payment methods elsewhere on your site , such as in your footer . <p> Even if your eCommerce plugin does not display card icons , you can add them manually ( or enlist the help of a developer to do so ) . Here are some free payment icons from Shopify that can help out . There may also be plugins that will do this for you . For example , here 's a free WooCommerce plugin to add payment methods via shortcode or widget . <p> here 's an example I 've added to my themes footer area with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Digital Downloads also has accepted payment methods built in that you can enable in your settings and display at checkout : <p> Adding EDD Payment methods <p> You can make these available to use elsewhere on your site with a custom snippet ( added via plugin or your functions.php ) : <h> 3 . Display Security Seals <p> When you purchase an SSL certificate , you 'll also typically gain access to security seals . These are icons that you 'll have permission to add to your site to build customer trust in your checkout process ( be sure you have permission to use them first ! ) . They may look something like this : <p> You can also get security seals from your payment processor . Processors like Authorize.net have " Verified merchant " seals available to increase your credibility and build customer trust . <p> Purchasing security seals is also possible via services like Symantec / Norton ( you can get Safe Site certified ) or McAfee Secure , though these are typically more expensive and can involve a security audit ( which can be valuable in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most trusted in comparison to other seals . <h> 4 . Display Total Number of Orders Shipped <p> Social proof is a useful motivator for eCommerce stores , and it can be used to build customer trust as well . When you show that other customers have purchased from your site , new customers assume that your site or products are safe and buying confidence increases . <p> KISSmetrics suggests using social proof to build trust , such as displaying the number of orders placed on your site or the number of customers who have completed a purchase . You can easily show this on your homepage or in a widget by adding text like , " over 12,000 orders processed ! " You can update the text monthly to ensure its accurate . <p> Social Proof : Order Count <p> If you 'd like to display an exact order count , here 's a free plugin that can do so with WooCommerce , and generates a shortcode to insert the exact order count . <h> 5 . Borrow Media Trust <p> If you 've been mentioned in a news outlet or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to build your own . For example , if you 've been quoted in a publication , show that quote . If a news outlet has written about you or one of your products , show that you 've been featured in this news site . <p> You shouldnt be dishonest about this ( for example , including a media badge when you 've only been mentioned in the comments section or something ) , but its a great way to borrow trust from reputable sources . <h> 6 . Use Reviews or Testimonials <p> Product reviews and testimonials are another great way to use social proof to your advantage . Reviews show customers they 're not the first one to the party ; other customers have purchased your products and enjoyed using them . We 've already written about the importance of reviews if you 'd like to read more , as 7 out of 10 customers read them before purchasing . <h> Build Customer Trust via Security and Social Proof <p> Each of these tips on building customer trust boils down to 3 common themes : improve ( and show ! ) security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security indicators , such as SSL certificates or trust seals , make customers more comfortable about sharing personal and payment details , removing a very large barrier to purchase . <p> Borrowing trust can come in the form of security seals , payment icons , shipment logos , or media quotes / " As featured in " sections .

@@98138006 @2338006/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> We now live in an era where you can sell almost anything online , from real jetpacks to Han Solo phone covers . Regardless of how crazy some ideas may seem , selling online is not as simple as setting up shop and slapping the virtual " Open " sign on the door . If you 're going to create an online store and accept virtual ( card not present ) payments , you have to have the capability and security to do so ( see our SSL article for more detail on security ) . In a place where bitcoin is more common that cash , this can be as confusing as an LA freeway . <p> Payment processors do n't  exactly make this process any easier . Some include merchant accounts , some require extra fees to set up a merchant account , pricing structures are inconsistent , and the features each payment solution offers can vary . ( Side note : Cart66 posted a solid overview of fees you can watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some common questions to ask yourself when selecting a processor and list some major companies to consider for your online store . Curious about how the online payment process takes place ? Authorize.net has a good diagram to show how online payments are handled . <h> How are Merchant Accounts and Payment Gateways Different ? <p> First of all , online stores must abide by some of the same rules as brick-and-mortar stores . Your store has to have a merchant account to process credit card payments . Your merchant account has nothing to do with the way that you accept payments ; its your " bank account " for accepting credit card purchases , and involves an agreement between you and the credit card company establishing your ability to accept payments and the fees associated with doing so . The money involved in a payment transfer is held in your merchant account until its transferred to your bank account . <p> There are two types of merchant accounts : dedicated and aggregated accounts . Setting up a dedicated account , which is an account set up for only your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to negotiate customized rates for your transactions . If you 're processing really large transaction volumes , this may be a worthwhile process for you , but chances are you should never have to do this . If you 're just starting out , an aggregated merchant account will suit you better and will probably be what you stick with unless your store gets pretty huge . Aggregated accounts are typically managed by a processing company ( such as Stripe ) , where your money is held in a large account until being transferred to you . Setup is far less involved than a dedicated account , but you wont be able to negotiate rates or how quickly transfers occur . However , you 'll at least know exactly what your costs will be and can plan accordingly . <p> So where does the payment gateway come in ? All the payment gateway does is replace the physical point-of-sale terminal , allowing you to send sensitive information to the processor or acquiring bank , and sometimes reducing the responsibility on your website for security . The payment gateway is essentially your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the process behind gathering and sending sensitive payment information is complex , and investing in a quality payment processor may be one of the most important decisions you make for your store . Still confused ? Cart66 posted a good overview of the differences between merchant accounts and payment gateways that I 'd recommend checking out . <h> Which Payment Processor is for me ? <p> My favorite payment processor to use is Stripe ( see our Stripe article for more details ) . Setting up an account is easy , and they handle almost every step of setting up a merchant account and payment gateway for you . They also have integrations with almost every eCommerce platform for WordPress . However , Stripe is currently only available for merchants in the US , Canada , UK , and Ireland . They 're in the process of supporting merchants from other countries , but that may eliminate it for some of you . <p> Some questions I would ask myself before settling on a payment processor include : <p> Do I have a merchant account already ? If not , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a lot of headache . <p> What card types do I want to accept ? If you already have a merchant account , this may already be determined for you , and you may have different fees for different card types ( for example , American Express typically charges higher fees than Visa ) . However , if you 're looking for a new payment processor and merchant account , you 'll want to consider this . <p> Does the payment gateway / merchant account operate in my home region ? If you 're in the US you probably wo n't have to worry about this , but if not you 'll need to check . <p> Am I willing to pay a monthly cost or setup fees ? <p> Do I need the ability to save cards ( tokenization ) or process recurring payments ? <p> Will I be processing a lot of international transactions ? ( Some services , such as PayPal , charge high international fees even though the payments are accepted ) <p> Instead of going through a rundown of payment processors to check out , I 'd invite you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processors with some notes so that they 're easier to compare . If you 're new to the game , just use Stripe . If you already have a merchant account , then take a look at the document and see which gateway you 'd prefer instead ; I 'd probably go with Authorize.net or Payflow in that case . <p> As always , if you have other suggestions or companies you 've had good experiences with , please let us know in the comments = <p> PS : I find my wacky online purchase ideas from This is Why Im Broke .

I 'm your target audience for sure I 'm currently building a WooCommerce website for my small business , so I 'm researching payment solutions up , down , and sideways . Stripe looks like a really great option , and now I 'm leaning that way . But can you recommend a shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My e-store will be really small , so a shipping service with even a low monthly fee would probably be too expensive for me . I 'd really appreciate your thoughts ! Thank you ! <p> If you 'll be shipping internationally a lot , I think your cheapest option is probably USPS International shipping . You could get real-time rates with the USPS extension , or you could use the built-in flat rate + international delivery rates to set a fixed cost for this ( though you 'll be over / under on most shipments , and will probably have to adjust as you get an idea of your average shipping costs per order ) . <p> That 's excellent advice ! Ill look into both options I really like the simplicity of fixed costs , especially if it kind of evened out over time . But either way I agree that USPS will be the way to go . Thank you Beka ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138007 @2338007/ <h> WooCommerce Themes : Free Storefront Extensions <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Shopping for a new theme can be exciting , and you can completely refresh the design of your site without sacrificing the way it works . While changing themes is n't typically a quick and easy process , it can be very valuable in terms of presenting the brand and design that should reflect your business . <p> However , not all themes are created equal . Weve discussed what to look for in a WooCommerce theme , but its hard to know if the theme you 're buying is as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside . There are themes that override all WooCommerce templates without updating them and therefore can break with new versions of WooCommerce ; there are themes that include shop styles that look nothing like the rest of your site ; there are even themes that have broken the WooCommerce REST API because they 're improperly coded . <p> Choosing a theme from a reputable author can help you avoid issues , and I frequently recommend using Storefront . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects because its well-built and extensible . Storefront can be used for many sites as-is , but the extensions available can be a huge help to non-developers while customizing their design . <h> Storefront Extensions <p> The extension model for themes is n't a novel concept , as other authors like Andrew Munro and Theme Foundry ( with Make Plus ) have built plugins or extensions to add functionality to their themes . However , this is the first time WooThemes has made this move with a theme , and I like that this model supports both developers and non-developers whod like to customize Storefront themselves . <p> While Storefront is a great starter theme on which to build custom child themes , the several Storefront Extensions help non-developers tweak their sites to make them their own . Using the built-in options for color and design can help you adjust the way your shop looks , and Storefront-specific extensions can take this further by helping you customize the layout of your product pages or blog posts . <p> While most Storefront extensions are paid plugins , there are a few new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today I 'll take a look at 3 free Storefront extensions from WooAssist ( you may recognize them from the Storefront support forums , as they donate time there occasionally ) . <h> Free Storefront Extension : Site Logo <p> While you can add a logo to your site using Jetpacks site logo , I prefer to use the Storefront Site Logo extension instead . <p> This plugin adds a " Branding " section to the theme customizer while using Storefront so that you can opt to display your site title and tagline , or use an image for your logo . I liked that the logo image will automatically be resized to the correct width for the theme no matter which size is uploaded . <h> Free Storefront Extension : Top Bar <p> Storefront includes 2 menu areas that can be used for separate navigation . The primary menu is at the bottom of the header , while the secondary menu is next to the search box . <p> Many themes will display a secondary menu at the top of the page instead of within the header area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its more noticeable . The Storefront Top Bar extension can help you do this by adding a widget area to the top of your site . This can let you add one or two widgets above your site header , and they 're very handy for menus or notices . <p> For example , here 's a setup using Top Bar to add a menu on the left and a notice on free shipping to the right . <p> Storefront has a header widget that will appear below navigation that can be used for notices as well , but Top Bar gives you another display option . <h> Free Storefront Extension : Title Toggle <p> Storefront Title Toggle can be used to remove the title from a Storefront static home page or to adjust your blog post layout .

@@98138008 @2338008/ <h> Ask Sell with WP : Should I raise prices to cover shipping costs ? <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This question comes from Jordan : <p> I think that customers are leaving my site because the shipping costs are too high I 'm using a UPS plugin to get rates . I do n't  want to absorb all of the shipping costs and offer free shipping for everything , but I 'm not sure what to do . Should I raise prices to cover shipping costs ? What are the pros and cons to doing this ? <p> This is a great question we discussed this a bit when we talked about creating effective shipping methods , and I highly recommend checking out those suggestions . Shipping costs make up the some of the top reasons that customers abandon your checkout nobody wants to be presented with unexpected costs . Many times , customers see shipping as an unexpected cost since so many stores offer free shipping . However , higher product prices are not as big of a risk factor in terms of abandonment . Free shipping tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your store . <p> If you can raise prices marginally to cover shipping , its a solid strategy . Look at shipping as a cost of doing business rather than something you should pass onto the customer . " Free " does crazy things to people for example , see the Hersheys kiss vs truffle comparison here . Free shipping will almost always be one of the most powerful perks you can offer customers . ( Bonus tip : try changing the wording of your free shipping offer . ) <p> However , if you raise prices to offer everyone free shipping , there may be unintended consequences . First , consider refunds : if customers return a product , you 'll have to refund the purchase price , inflated or not . If you have a low volume of returned orders , this can probably work for you . Second , tracking margins for your orders and products becomes more difficult , as shipping is now built into the price instead of neatly being excluded from your product pricing . <p> Also , your product price and how up-front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiffanys selling jewelry online , your customers probably are n't  the type to balk at an $8 shipping charge . If you 're Zales , youve probably got a problem . Premium products have a different audience with different expectatins , so lost sales are probably coming from something else rather than a shipping charge . <p> I usually recommend that stores offer free shipping only for certain order values say , orders of $50 and up . This way , you not only offer the shipping options that customers expect , but you can also increase your average order value ; most customers are willing to add products to their carts to get free shipping . The amount should be up to your store set it higher than your current average order value . This way , the increase in average orders will hopefully cover any costs you 'll be eating from offering that shipping . This could be potentially coupled with a small price increase to make sure you do n't  lose money on shipping . <p> As with anything , my final consideration is this : TEST . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( average order value , company shipping costs , average profit , margins ) before and after you make a change like this to ensure you 're doing what 's best for your store . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138009 @2338009/ <p> These posts show you how to get member lists from different WordPress membership plugins , import members into MailChimp , and segment emails based on member data . <p> In part 1 of our series on segmenting member emails , we talked about how email can help you reduce churn for your membership site . <p> In order to keep members as paying users of your site , you 'll need to ensure that they consistently get value out of their site memberships , which justifies the cost of renewing again and again . This recurring revenue is key to your growth and sustainability , so keeping members around for the long term should be a priority . <p> In order to keep offering value , you can provide new content , offer new deals or partnerships , add products to a members-only catalog , or keep members engaged in a community . Regardless of how you continuously offer value to your members , you 'll need to ensure that this value and benefits are communicated effectively , and nothing is better for this than email . <p> In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can segment member emails based on data like membership type or status using email services like MailChimp . <h> Setting up MailChimp Lists <p> Since Paid Memberships Pro only allows members to have one membership at a time , I 'd recommend using one " members " list in MailChimp for all of your members . This will let you mass-email all members if needed , and you can segment emails to email specific membership levels . <p> Paid Memberships Pro will add a PMPLEVEL field automatically to show the level the member belongs to , which will let you segment your emails easily . The larger benefit to using one list is that you wont pay for subscribers being counted twice when you get to a paid account = If subscribers belong to more than one list , they 're counted multiple times in your overall subscriber count . <p> However , it may be useful to have additional lists for promotions , or for members to opt into communication ( ie a " Product Testers / Feedback " list ) . You can both add members automatically to lists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Getting Paid Memberships Pro Members into MailChimp <p> Getting your members into MailChimp from Paid Memberships Pro is simple . There 's a free MailChimp integration plugin that let 's you automatically add members to lists based on level , or let 's you give members the choice to join lists when they register . <p> Once you install this plugin , you can add your MailChimp API Key to pull in your list data . You can determine if : <p> members should be added to an " all members " list when signing up ( I recommend this ) ; <p> if members should be able to opt into a list ( helpful if you have testers or non-level related communication ) ; <p> and if members should be automatically unsubscribed when leaving a level / membership . <p> While the level information is added automatically to member profiles so you can segment emails , you can also add members to specific lists automatically by level as well . <p> When a member joins your site , theyll be subscribed to the lists youve selected , and the member profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Create Member Segments in MailChimp <p> Now we 've got members imported as subscribers along with member data in MailChimp , we can segment an email based on member data . Let 's take a look at examples of segments that we can create to communicate with members . <p> 1 . Email All Active Members Since members can be unsubscribed when they change or cancel a level , you can safely email your " all members " list and be sure that you 're emailing only active members . <p> " All-member " emails are great for announcing new content or benefits that are available to everyone . <p> 2 . Email Active Members of a Plan You can segment emails based on subscriber data / fields within MailChimp to email only a subsection of your list . In this case , we can email subscribers who match a desired " PMPLEVEL " in MailChimp . When you send an email , you can match subscribers based on if their level is the desired one , and can even email multiple levels at the same time . <p> Plan-specific emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that members hear about the benefits or changes most relevant to them without sending information they ca n't access based on their level . <p> Other Segments If you want to create other segments , such as emails based on sign up date or discount code used , then well need more data in MailChimp to do so . This is where a member export can come in handy , as it contains more information about your members . <h> Exporting Paid Memberships Pro Members <p> If you wanted to include more member data in MailChimp , such as the sign up date or expiration date of a member , then you can export a CSV of your members to import into MailChimp , as we did in our Restrict Content Pro tutorial . <p> Paid Memberships Pro has a built-in member exporter that 's going to be extremely useful for this . This will give us a CSV file of all members on the site , including data about each users membership that we can use in MailChimp . <p> To export your members , go to Memberships &amp;t ; Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CSV " button will give you a CSV of all members . <p> Once you 've exported your member CSV file , you may want to delete some of the fields you wo n't end up needing for MailChimp , such as billing address fields . This is n't a necessary step , as you can skip the extra columns in MailChimp , it just feels cleaner to me this way = <p> You can determine whatever you want to use in MailChimp , and re-save your member CSV . For example , I 'm not going to use the " Discount code " column , but you may want to if members signed up from a certain promotion with this discount code . <p> You could also sort this CSV by status and only import active members ; MailChimp will let you merge the data in the CSV with the subscriber profile to add more data to the existing member data . <p> This could let you create more advanced emails , such as emails for new members or members who signed up with a particular discount code . <h> Segment Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin for Paid Memberships Pro makes subscribing members to email lists extremely simple , and the automatic addition of membership level data also let 's you segment emails effectively . You can email all members , or only members of a certain plan . You can also unsubscribe members when their levels change so that your list is always current . <p> While you may not get all member data out of this plugin into MailChimp , you can also use member CSV exports to update member profiles in MailChimp with other data , such as sign up date , discount used , and expiration date , in order to segment member emails in more advanced ways . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> This came just a few weeks after I set this up for a membership website with over 6,000 members in Paid Membership Pro using this exact method .

@@98138011 @2338011/ <p> If you have an online store built with WooCommerce , you can easily discount prices for special occasions or promotions by inputting the Sale Price of a product . This allows you to create extra incentive for customers to make a purchase . But , what if you did n't  want to discount the price for everyone , and only want to focus on a specific set of users ? You can implement role-based pricing with a simple-to-use free plugin ! <p> In this post , we will go over using the Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce plugin . Well look at how you can incentivize engagement with your store , how to set up the plugin , and how you can create a private shopping club using the plugin . <h> Role-based pricing : Reward customers for engaging with your store <p> Your store customers can have different levels of engagement with your store .

@@98138012 @2338012/ <h> Shopify and WordPress eCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Most people looking to set up an eCommerce site with WordPress are familiar with the eCommerce plugins built for WordPress and therefore install WordPress and their plugin of choice on a self-hosted site . There are some popular platforms , such as Cart66 Cloud and Ecwid , that offer services that are more integrations rather than plugins , but many users tend to enjoy using a native plugin so that all store maintenance is done from the same admin dashboard . <p> However , integrations and SaaS-style eCommerce solutions are making a splash recently with the announcement from Automattic that WordPress.com users now have options to use eCommerce platforms for their WordPress.com websites . If you 're not familiar with WordPress.com , you should know that websites are hosted ( not self-hosted like downloading WordPress from WordPress.org ) and therefore you cant install eCommerce plugins like WooCommerce , Shopp , or EDD . <p> Instead , WordPress.com users can now integrate their sites with Ecwid , Shopify , or ShopLocket . While we 've already written about integrating Ecwid with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eCommerce selection available for WordPress.com is interesting . <p> Why not use native plugins ? There are probably a lot of structural concerns , such as setting up SSL certificates and sending payments through their servers . Using a SaaS solution eliminates many of these issues , as payments are routed through the providers servers ( i.e. , payments go through Shopify , not your sites servers ) . <p> There 's certainly a mixed reception to the new offerings , but the upside for me is the ability to run a WordPress site and take advantage of easy management and SEO compatibility while running a shop that 's also easy to use , but requires less setup and maintenance on my part . If you 're already using your own WordPress site , you can actually integrate with these services already and run your store in a subdomain . While I would n't recommend this approach for large stores , I think it may be an interesting for small-to-medium sized shop owners . <p> This tutorial will describe how to integrate Shopify with a self-hosted WordPress site . <h> Shopify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may think . There are some pre-made tools that make integrating these two platforms fairly easy . I 'm going to assume that you have both a WordPress site and Shopify account with basic store settings ready to go . <p> Once you have some Shopify products and collections ready to go , you 'll need to install the freeShopify Widgets app , which will create embeddable widgets for your other blogs or websites . Once the app is installed , you 'll be able to access it from your Shopify dashboard under " Apps " : <p> Shopify Dashboard : Apps <h> Embedding the Store <p> When you click on the app , you 'll be taken to a menu where you can choose options for what you want to embed on your WordPress site . Let 's start with the entire store , as that 's the most complicated integration , but shouldnt take too long . <p> Creating a Shopify " widget " <p> When you click Embed a Shop , you 'll be asked to select which product collections you want to include . If you 've never used Shopify before , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the type of product or where you want it to be displayed , such as " Frontpage " . Products can belong to multiple collections , and if you add new products to these collections , they will still be displayed even after you embed the Shopify widget . Select the collections you want to embed in your WordPress site , then we can move on . <p> Choose Collections to Embed <p> Now that you 've selected the collections you want to embed , you can then generate the embed code by clicking " Get Embed Code " . You 'll copy everything and place this code in your themes header.php file just before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag ( do this via FTP in case something goes wrong = ) . Once that file is saved , you have one step left . <p> Grabbing the Embed Code <p> The code you 've embedded will open your entire catalog in a lightbox ( drilled down by collection ) , so you merely need to add the link to open that lightbox on whatever page or posts youd like . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &lt;a href= ' #shopify-store ' &gt;&lt;/a&gt; to your page , post , menu , or widget . I 've created a button for myself to open the store : <p> Create a link to open your store <p> Finally , you can check out the collections you 've embedded by clicking your link or button ! <p> Store Lightbox <p> The benefit to using this method is that the entire shopping experience can be done without leaving your site , then customers are routed to a distraction-free checkout , hosted by Shopify , to complete the purchase . The only downside is that customers are not redirected to your site when completing the purchase , so you may want to create a link back to your WordPress site from your Shopify site . An easy way to do that , as well as personalize the order confirmation page , is to use the Happy Ending App . <h> Embedding Individual Products <p> Embedding individual products is far easier , and may be preferable for stores with few products . The downside is that clicking individual products will take customers to the Shopify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To embed a single product , you 'll open the same app . Instead of clicking the " Embed a Shop " widget option , you 'll click on Embed a Product . This will allow you to select a product to get the embed code for , and to adjust some of the display settings . <p> Embedding a Product <p> Once you have the code to embed your product ( which will be iframed on your page ) , you can then place the product embed code in your post , page , or widget . You can have multiple products on one page , but will have to organize them yourself into columns or a grid layout ( I 'm using a column shortcode in this example to begin creating a grid ) . <p> Embedding Individual Products <h> Embedding Buy Now Buttons <p> Embedding a Buy Now button on a post or page is done in a very similar manner to embedding a product . You can embed a buy now button for any type of product , but if you 're using a variable product , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy now button . Once you 've selected the product to create your link for , you 'll grab the code to embed the button . Be aware , however , that this code only creates the button and does not include product images or details , so you 'll have to include those yourself . <p> Buy Now Buttons Frontend <p> Embed Buy Now Buttons <p> Note that clicking on an individual embedded product or buy now button with these widgets will take customers to your Shopify store , so I 'd recommend a similar domain ( ideally a subdomain , but this is a bit tricker to do ) and styling on your Shopify site so that customers do n't  get confused or uncomfortable with leaving your site . Conversely , you can avoid this by embedding the shop instead . <h> Other Options or Approaches <p> While I have n't attempted this at all , if you 're interested a different integration , you can take a look at using Zapier to integrate Shopify and WordPress . Zapier helps to connect different services to one another , and is a super useful service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication between your WordPress site and Shopify store , and could be an interesting management solution . <p> You could also look at using a subdomain , such as shop.mystore.com to host your Shopify site so that customers do n't  feel that they 're leaving your site , but as we said before , this process is far more involved . <h> Conclusions <p> That 's it ! While I do n't  think this would be a solution for stores that sell several products , it could be a very easy way to sell a small product set with minimal effort needed on the part of the store administrator . Shopify is a popular and easy-to-use platform , and has a lot of great apps available , though it may be a bit pricier than using a solution like Ecwid . <p> For a quick comparison : both platforms have $30 per month plans that would probably fit the needs of most stores , but the $30 per month plan for Ecwid includes all store functionality while the Shopify plan at the same cost is the introductory plan and excludes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your site , using WordPress for the rest of the site management gives you a powerful solution for your content . <p> The downside to using Shopify and WordPress is that you have to pay monthly for your eCommerce solution and will have to manage your store and site from separate admin dashboards . However , one of the major upsides is that this solution is entirely PCI compliant , you wont need to bother with SSL certificates or any other security issues . The software is also very easy to use and support is included , which may not be the case for a WordPress plugin. 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Great advice thanks !

@@98138014 @2338014/ <p> This series pits plugins and services against one another in head-to-head comparisons . <p> The flexibility of WordPress as a platform makes it a great choice for eCommerce , but choosing the right eCommerce plugin for you can sometimes be a difficult task . If you 're selling digital goods or services , there are a few great options available , such as WooCommerce , Easy Digital Downloads , Jigoshop , and more . In this comparison , well take a look at two common contenders for those of you setting up a digital products shop : Easy Digital Downloads ( EDD ) vs WP eStore . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs WP eStore <p> Both Easy Digital Downloads and WP eStore are growing eCommerce platforms designed with digital products in mind . Selling physical products with either platform is possible , but if your store sells more than a few physical products , you may want to try a different platform . Here are some pros and cons for each plugin while selling digital goods to help you decide which is right for your store . <h> Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can download the core Easy Digital Downloads plugin for free from WordPress.org or the EDD website . Extensions or add-ons that provide more functionality are premium plugins and therefore will require purchases . Each extension purchase through the EDD marketplace includes updates and support for one year , and renewals are discounted 30% . Since you 'll probably want to purchase extensions such as payment gateway integrations or marketing tools , we estimate that store costs will probably be around $200 ( for single-site licenses ) . <p> WP eStore is a premium plugin , so a $50 purchase is required to use the plugin , which provides a license for an unlimited number of sites and support . Note that this purchase is n't a developer license , so you can only use the plugin on sites that you own , and will need licenses for client sites . This includes all of the built-in functionality for the plugin , and you do n't  have to renew for updates or support . A few add-ons are available , such as free add-ons for functionality such as bulk discounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment processing . <p> So since these plugins use different pricing structures , a direct cost comparison is difficult . If we look at feature parity , WP eStore will be the cheaper option . However , the core EDD plugin does have features that WP eStore cant replicate , such as more advanced tax rules and reporting , product tags , and order handling and editing . EDD is also more extensible in terms of available add-ons and being developer-friendly . <p> Nevertheless , here are the total costs for the closest feature parity I can come up with ( bearing in mind the previous paragraph ) . The total cost Ive marked for EDD is different than the sum of the individual costs because I 'll assume you 'd buy these together , which yields a 10% discount . I 'm also assuming you only need one email service integration and would choose one for EDD , and that you 'd need shipping capabilities , which probably wont be the case if you 're comparing these for selling digital goods . <p> The EDD Recurring Payments extension includes more flexible payment options when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate keys , while WP eStore requires you to create a pool of license keys for the product . <p> EDD offers other add-ons that you may want to purchase , but you could also cut some plugins from the above list as you probably wo n't need exact feature parity , so pricing will be up to you . <h> Security <p> While selling digital products , security is usually a major concern , and both plugins encrypt download links to ensure that customers can not find the location of your files . Here are examples of what each download link will look like : <p> Note that the EDD download link ties the download to the customer account with which the download is purchased . As WP eStore does not create customer accounts , file downloads can not be tied to the account . You can also use a free extension for EDD to instead lock a download to an IP address . <p> In terms of other security features , both plugins will allow you to set download limits , which set a maximum number of times files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which set how long download links should be valid for . Each also allows you to override these settings for an individual product . <p> While security features are very comparable , there is a difference in the way each plugin keeps your digital products protected . If users are familiar with WordPress and your file naming structure , they could potentially gain access to your files if they 're stored in the general media folder(s) by guessing the exact URL though this is pretty unlikely if you use year/month folders in your media directory and a unique naming structure . WP eStore and EDD can store your downloadable files outside of the default WP media folder to combat this . However , EDD does this automatically ( and hides the directory from listings ) , while you 'll need to protect these files manually using WP eStore . <p> When you upload a file for a downloadable product , EDD automatically saves and serves uploads from its own folder in the /wp-content/uploads directory . While this could still potentially open up your files to someone familiar with EDD and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , you can help by using a non-obvious naming structure ) , it makes it less likely than when using the default media folder . The benefit to storing downloadable files this way is that you can still access this directory from your WordPress admin while creating or managing downloads ( so that you do n't  have to remember and / or manually insert links for your downloadable content ) and thus greatly simplifies store management . <p> If you upload a file for a WP eStore downloadable product , the file is automatically saved in the general media folder , which ( as stated earlier ) is n't ideal . Download links for WP eStore will still be encrypted if you use this tact , but files could be accessible . You 'll need to get around this by digging into the WP eStore plugin a bit it creates a downloads folder within its own plugin folder in the /wp-content/plugins directory that is password protected . <p> You can upload your digital products to that folder via FTP for storage . However , this will require you to manually get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look like LONG ... rather than selecting them from a list , but they 're not publicly accessible in most cases ( even if customers guess the exact URL ) . The download links for the products will still be encrypted using this method . <p> However , there is an issue with storing digital files this way . While the /uploads folder is always writeable ( which is why your uploads should be stored here as a best practice ) , the /plugins folder may not be writeable depending on your server configuration ( where this /downloads directory is located ) , and thus WP eStore wont be able to serve your files from this folder if your server does n't  allow it to write the /plugins directory . This will force you into using the general media folder instead . <p> In short : Using WP eStores /downloads directory is a bit more secure than EDDs directory in the /uploads directory , but it makes store management more difficult since you have to manually get and insert all download links ( rather than select them from within WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any server environment , while WP eStores may not . <h> Products <p> Both plugins add your products as custom post types , and both can require that customers acknowledge Terms &amp; Conditions for a product before purchase . <p> However , product creation is very different between the two plugins . WP eStore organizes product options into an accordion-style menu , while EDDs product editor looks similar to the post / page editor . <p> eStore Adding Products <p> EDD Add Product <p> Assuming you have the EDD plugins installed that we mentioned for feature parity , similar functionality can be achieved on these product creation pages with some minor differences . Here are some things you can do in the product editor : <p> Unique to eStore <p> Things both do <p> Unique to EDD <p> Override download expiration time <p> Create image gallery <p> Create old/sale pricing <p> Manage inventory if needed <p> Set product name , price , descriptions , featured image <p> Override tax settings / download limits <p> Bundle products <p> Create product variations <p> Create / assign product tags <p> Create new categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a personal perspective , I find creating / editing products easier in Easy Digital Downloads since I do n't  like feeling as if infinite scroll is turned on in the product editor when I have to scroll through all settings ( half of which I do n't  need for most products in WP eStore ) . Settings for WP eStore could probably be reduced as a result , or some would be better off as global options . Yes , this allows for customization ( and you can clone/replicate product setup ) , but it makes for a far more complex UI . The more products you sell , the more inconvenient this will become . <h> Customer Experience <p> Customer experience will really be up to you for either of these plugins . Both play well with many themes , and will require you to set up your catalog in the way you choose . While EDD will automatically create individual product pages , you will need to do this manually for WP eStore if you want a page dedicated solely to your product ( probably a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eStore is that you have to create the product , then embed its listing / buttons with a shortcode on the product page , while EDD does this automatically . <p> You can also embed products on any post or page with either plugin , and both can create " Buy Now " buttons for your products . As for catalog pages , but have the ability to create shop pages with all products or categories of products . EDD allows you to create a list or grid format ( by adding columns= " x " to the downloads shortcode ) while WP eStore only creates a list-layout for products in a catalog page . <p> Both can have cart widgets and pages . In terms of checkout , EDD uses a more traditional checkout flow , while WP eStore usually employs an on-page checkout directly from your cart ( which redirects users to an offsite checkout form or your manual checkout form ) . The EDD catalog has a more modern look with the built-in styles , but again , they both leave store structure up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Managing your purchases is a big part of your customer relationships . Both plugins automatically send out emails to customers with the appropriate download links , and can create a " Thank you " page that shows the link to customers as well . You can also view a list of orders with each plugin . <p> The customer / order list for EDD is more detailed , and includes several order statuses besides " Paid " and " Unpaid " ( such as " Pending " or " Refunded " ) so that you can keep track of customer information even if the order has failed or been refunded . You can also manually add products to an order and add individual purchase notes ( as opposed to a simple text block for all notes in eStore ) . <p> eStore Order Page <p> EDD Order Page <p> One major difference is that EDD can create customer accounts for all purchases , which allows users to log back into a site to view previously purchased products ( via a " My Account " page ) . Many customers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details . If you allow it , they can also re-download these products themselves from this page . This allows you to tie orders to a customer account for easy customer management . <p> However , one of the biggest upsides to using customer accounts is the ability to save payment details for future purchases if you 're using a payment gateway that supports tokenization . Simplifying the checkout process for customers helps to improve conversions for repeat visitors , so having customer accounts is a great addition to the plugin . <p> Since WP eStore does n't  create customer accounts , every new order generates a new " customer " record , even if these purchases are made by someone using the same email address . This also prevents customers from saving payment data to an account ( though you 'd need to purchase a different gateway than the built-in ones for this to be relevant , as the standard gateways all redirect the checkout process ) . <h> Membership and Subscriptions <p> Both plugins have the ability to create products that use recurring billing , but WP eStore has subscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an $83 add-on for recurring payments . This will allow you to sell access to a product for a given amount of time , break services into a set of multiple payments , and more . <p> The most common need for recurring billing is for memberships . As both plugins are geared towards digital goods , membership sites are a natural fit . Both require a paid membership plugin to create membership functionality , such as content restriction . WP eStore is fully integrated with WP eMember for memberships , while EDD requires the Recurring Payments add-on and the $29 Content Restriction add-on . <p> You could also use EDD with Restrict Content Pro for $42 instead if you prefer . However , recurring billing for memberships will go through Restrict Content Pro instead of the Easy Digital Downloads billing . <h> Integrations <p> WP eStore and EDD can integrate with a variety of services , but they go about doing this in very different ways . WP eStores includes several integrations with the core plugin , while EDD offers a lightweight core plugin , and you purchase add-ons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , as there 's not a bunch of code running on your server for integrations that you do n't  need . <p> In terms of transactional and autoresponder email services , WP eStore integrates with Mailchimp , GetResponse , and AWeber , which are all very popular platforms . Easy Digital Downloads can integrate with each of these platforms as well through add-ons , but also has integrations available with other email services . <p> Both can also integrate with Amazon S3 for digital file delivery as previously mentioned . <p> As EDD is monetized through an add-on marketplace , there are several other integrations available that are n't  in the core WP eStore plugin , such as integrations for Dropbox and Gravity Forms . There are also several marketing and analytics add-ons available . <h> Support <p> Both plugins are supported by the development team . As WP eStore requires a purchase for plugin usage , support is included in that purchase via a customer support forum . Updates are included for life as well . There 's also tons of plugin documentation available for you to read through for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support is slightly different . Basic support is offered free to all customers , regardless of whether or not they 've purchased an add-on . Add-on purchases include support for one-year , then require a renewal at 70% of purchase price for each subsequent year ( this also includes updates ) . If you want priority support , you can purchase it on a monthly or yearly basis . EDD also offers detailed documentation and tutorials . <p> As far as quality of support is concerned , I cant speak to WP eStore since I did n't  need to use support . On the outside looking it , it seems that support in their forums is active , and customers can search forums in case their concerns have already been addressed elsewhere . I have read that support is great and very responsive , but do n't  have first hand knowledge here . EDD support is always great , and you can also get basic help on WordPress.org . <h> Other Comments <p> If you 'd like to give away digital products for free , both plugins can help you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through the checkout so that you can collect customer information and provide the option to create an account , while WP eStore can use a " squeeze page " to collect an email before serving up a download link . <h> Conclusions <p> If cost is your biggest determining factor , then WP eStore will probably be your plugin of choice , as you only have to pay once for all features and for use on all of your sites , while EDD requires several purchases and multi-site licenses for use on several sites . However , as a side note , if you cant invest more than $50-100 in your store setup or testing your store idea , I really think you should reconsider embarking on your sales venture . <p> Security is comparable between the two plugins , but each has pros and cons to its security setup . You can also achieve much of the same functionality with each plugin . However , EDD is more extensible due to the number of add-ons available , and is developer-friendly in case you 'll need customizations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with better order management and reporting . <p> So when should you use each plugin ? As I said previously , WP eStore will probably be the choice for you if budget is your main concern especially if you 're planning on using the plugin on more than one site ( costs for EDD increase with multi-site licenses ) . If you do n't  have many products or orders coming through your store , but need a lot of functionality , WP eStore will handle all of your needs in a one-stop purchase . You 'll also have updates and support for life , while EDD requires renewals after the first year at a 30% discount . <p> In most other cases , I 'd choose Easy Digital Downloads . Its easy to setup , use as an admin , and navigate as a customer , and offers a lot of options for customization via extensions . Its also easy for developers to tweak as we mentioned under Security , best practices for development are followed . Order and product management are also more efficient , as you have more options for editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The detailed sales and product reports are really useful as well . <p> As always , the choice comes down to the needs of your store . Have questions about either plugin ? Please ask in the comments and well do our best to help out ! <h> Read More <p> We do have full reviews of each plugin if you 're interested in more information on each : 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> I have WP-estore and its great . I integrate it with WP-emember which is also very good . There are some restrictions with WP-estore and in particular the inability to create " User Accounts " for members is a bummer because it means having to create a variety of member level options for various product bundles and then doing the upgrades manually in the admin panel . This occasionally irritates customers as well as me as administrator . <p> EDD seems great and the range of add on plugins is EXTENSIVE even though a somewhat pricey alternative its probably a good option for serious e-commerce businesses that want seamless processing and reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks so much for the kind words and insights ! There 's nothing like the experience of someone who 's run a business with these plugins and discovered the pain points that only arise from using something each day , so I really appreciate comments like this = . <p> I totally agree with Russell , this review was written by an expert , Beka Rice . Honestly , I rarely find such brilliant and very deep review . Most of reviewers just describe features that already explained in plugin website . Thank you . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138015 @2338015/ <h> Creating Member Directories : Ultimate Member Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Most membership plugins focus entirely on restricting content to members : who can access the content , when , how much does access cost , and what to do if a member does n't  have access . However , they do n't  make it easy to build a community of members : showing directories of members , publicly displaying member profiles or only displaying profiles to other members , and showing member information . <p> Building directory-type sites is difficult , and I did n't  really have a great recommendation for most types of membership sites looking to get this kind of functionality . However , the fairly new Ultimate Member plugin provides a great member directory and frontend member profile solution . Even better : you can get the core plugin for free . <h> Ultimate Member Review : Overview <p> Ultimate Member adds the ability to manage members on your site , but also enables members to manage themselves . You can create roles for members , directories , and profile forms so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your directory . Members can then edit their own profiles easily and view any content accessible to their member roles . <p> The core Ultimate Member plugin will let you register members , add and update profiles , create member directories , and restrict content to members . Posts , pages , and custom post types ( such as products from most eCommerce platforms ) can be restricted to member roles . <p> If you need additional functionality , you can check out the Ultimate Member extensions . There are already several extensions available , such as a social login extension and a bbPress add-on to add your content restriction to bbPress forums . <h> Ultimate Member Review : Setup <p> I was a bit overwhelmed with the plugin setup , as there are a lot of configuration options , and the plugin uses a customized settings page rather than one that blends in with WordPress . However , you 'll only go through setup once , so its worth taking the time to go through each settings tab . You can determine what profile components are available to members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance settings . <p> General Settings <p> Once you 've gone through all settings , you 'll also want to create your member " roles " . These are your membership types , and they dictate how content is restricted on your site . Each role has the ability to change what access the member has to his or her own profile , as well as the profiles of other members ( i.e. , can they view other profiles ) . <p> Add a new role <p> The " Admin " and " Member " roles are automatically created , but you can add as many other roles as needed . Site administrators will automatically have " Admin " community roles , while your subscribers or other users will be " Members " unless you change them to a newly created role . <p> Community Roles <p> These roles will be integrated into the WordPress " Users " screen , and you can use this to adjust community roles , as well as review and approve new member registrations ( if you do n't  auto-approve new members ) . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk here , as they ca n't be changed from the " Edit User " screen , but this is n't a major drawback . <h> Ultimate Member Review : Member Profiles <p> If you allow members to create and edit their profiles , they can do so directly from the frontend of your site . You 'll need to create a profile form to include any information about the member , which you can do from Ultimate Member &gt; Forms . <p> Create Profile Forms <p> You can add predefined fields to this form , such as fields for some social profiles , or you can add your own custom fields . This is helpful , for example , to add a " biography " field for a longer user biography . <p> Profile / Registration fields <p> You can adjust settings for your custom fields before saving them , or use conditional logic to display or hide fields depending on the other fields used in the profile . <p> Custom fields <p> All forms you add here will be used within the main user profile . These profiles are the public-facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member directory will link to for each member . <p> User Profile <p> Users can visit their profile pages and edit them directly from the frontend of your site . Profile editing is extremely easy , and this is one of my favorite features of Ultimate Member . Members can adjust profile and cover images , as well as any of the profile fields you 've created . <p> Edit Profile <h> Ultimate Member Review : Member Directories <p> If you 'd like to display all of your members or members of a particular role , you can create a custom member directory . This directory can have rules as to which members are included , how they 're sorted , and what member information is displayed . The member directory will link to the member profile for more details . <p> Create a Directory <p> Your directory will show a grid of member profiles with the information you 've opted to include , and will also include search options if you 've enabled search . <p> Member Directory <h> Ultimate Member Review : Content Restriction <p> Basic content restriction is included in Ultimate Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict posts , pages , or custom post types such as products in a shop or portfolio items . You can also restrict the user profiles generated by the plugin by restricting the " Users " page , or restrict the member directory by restricting its page . <p> You can restrict a page using the Ultimate Member meta box while editing a page or post to make it public , for logged out users ( nonmembers ) , or for logged in members with specific member roles . <p> Restricting content <p> As you may include some items in your navigation that are only for members , you can also restrict menu items so they only appear for members / non-members . For example , you can restrict the " Register " page to non-members , but the " My Account " page to members . <p> Restrict menu items <p> Content restriction is fairly limited , as you cant add restrictions in bulk to pages , posts , or taxonomies ( such as a category of posts ) . There 's also no way to schedule the delayed release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access over time . Restrictions are very easy to add and effective for member roles , and I liked that I could apply them to products in my store . <p> When a user tries to visit a page he does n't  have access to , hell see a login form instead of the content on that page . <p> Restricted post <p> If a member tries to visit a page while logged in that 's for a different member role , shell simply see basic account information instead of the " login " form . <p> A restricted post for another role <p> While I liked how easy content restriction was , it feels a bit incomplete , as there are no notices to inform non-members why the content is restricted ( such as a " This content is only for members " notice ) , and no what to tell the user what kind of membership is required to view the content . There 's also no way to tell a logged-in member why content for other membership roles is n't displayed , as the " Login " / basic account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to why the page is inaccessible . <h> Selling Memberships with Ultimate Member <p> Ultimate Member includes all membership capabilities , but does n't  provide the ability to sell any of your memberships . Its a great member and community management tool , but does help you to monetize your memberships . <p> Fortunately , you can do this by replacing your registration form with a purchase / checkout form . Ill use Gravity Forms because of the User Registration add-on I have with my developer license ( $199 ) . This will let me create a purchase form that will automatically create a member and assign the correct role , which let 's me sell access to memberships . <p> You 'll need to get a bit fancy with your form to automatically assign the right membership role when its purchased , as well need to ensure that the form sets the " role " user meta correctly . To do so , you cant use a Product field ( this would include the price in the user meta , which we do n't  want ) . Instead , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then conditionally show the associated product . <p> I know it sounds a bit confusing , but basically I cant create a product dropdown with " Silver membership $25 " and " Gold membership $50 " because this field wont set the member data correctly . Instead , I 'll create a " Membership Types " field with " Silver membership " and " Gold membership " , then , depending on which is selected , I 'll show the correct " product " field . <p> Form Fields to sell your membership <p> This ensures that the correct meta will be set for the membership role . When you create this " Membership Types " field , you 'll set the values as the slugs for the correlated memberships . My " members " role is sold as a " silver membership " , while an upgraded role is sold as a " gold membership " . I 've created the role " Gold Member " in Ultimate Member , so I 'll set this as the value for my field . <p> If I 'd created a role for " Platinum Member " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set its value to platinum-member . This will ensure that the purchase form automatically creates your user , and that the user is assigned to the right member role immediately . <p> The only other field you 'll need to include is an admin-only field for the account status , and set the default value to approved . This ensures that your members are n't  held for your review when they 've paid to register . <p> If you want a head start , you can download a sample form by viewing that link and clicking " Download " in the top right . You can then import this form into Gravity Forms and use it as a starting point . This sample form includes the hidden " account status " field as well as the Membership Types field and conditional logic so you can see how its done . <p> Once you 've got a registration form with your member details , payment info ( I 'm going to integrate Gravity Forms with Stripe ) , and credit card number , you 'll need to do two things : tie this to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form to your payment ( Stripe in my case , but there are other payment add-ons ) . <p> When you set up your user registration , add the two special fields we 'd mentioned earlier : the " role " should be set to the membership type selected by the customer ( this is why we were picky about the value ) , and the " accountstatus " should just use your hidden fields so its automatically " approved " . <p> Connect user registration to your form <p> Do n't  forget to tie the payment fields in your form to Stripe so they 're sent to pay for the registration ! <p> Connect payment gateway to your form <p> This process is a bit difficult if you 've never used the User Registration add-on ( though I highly recommend it ; I find it very useful ) . However , its a simple way to sell registrations for a membership , as you can simply replace the Ultimate Member Registration form with your Gravity Form and charge for registration . This will automatically register the user and provide the selected membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Member does an excellent job of creating a type of site that previously required a ton of custom code to create : directory sites . <p> Despite the lack of purchasing functionality ( though you can make this work with Gravity Forms , the GF User Registration Add-on , and a payment gateway add-on ) , Ultimate Member is a great member-management plugin , and I think its best served for sites that want to focus on member directories and communities . UM easily let 's members update their profile information , and can create customized profiles with the information you 'd like to use in your community . The frontend profile-editing is one of my favorite features , and its very well done . <p> Member directories will be created automatically using your directory rules , providing a handy way to show the members in your site , or just members with a certain role . I like that you can create several different directories , restrict who can view them , and then just drop the shortcode for the directory on a page . <p> The content restriction is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your site . It does exactly what its supposed to do , but definitely has room for improvement in terms of bulk applying rules ( to make setup faster ) and informing nonmembers ( or members that do n't  have access ) why content is restricted . It also does n't  let you drip out content or expire memberships after a certain period of time . <p> Ultimate Member is young and its great to see several extensions already available . For example , the integration with bbPress is helpful to build your community via forums and restrict them to members . While there are a few downsides to using it , its overall a very polished plugin that makes building a directory extremely simple . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 13 Comments <p> So , based upon the areas where there are gaps here , what other products might you recommend to consider ? <p> Here are my quick needs : Sell membership by category . Allow payments . Automatically place into a member " Class " . Auto generate I 'd and Password for the new membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have the Class provide access to some content vs other content as the membership dictates . Do that by content categories . Handle membership renewals Exist on a WordPress base <p> Pretty simple needs . Any other questions to consider for functionality that I left out ? <p> Hey Greg , if you want to sell access and restrict content by category , I 'd recommend checking out something like Paid Membership Pro instead . You can do memberships for each " class " and set up restriction rules for each . It can also sell memberships with a few payment gateway options . Not sure about auto-generating passwords , but that could be done fairly easily with custom code since WordPress has a function that can help out . <p> Hi Beka thank for you for writing this amazing article ! ! , I have found this very useful for a project I 'm currently doing . Just one quick question , will the membership access stop if payment stops from the member on a Paypal monthly/yearly subscription ? . <p> Hi Beka , thank you for your reply . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a member stops payment for access to the site , will the member stop getting access or will this have to be done manually with Ultimate Member ? . <p> Gravity Forms does n't  communicate with Ultimate Member , so while you can accept payment as part of a custom registration form , the subscription / payment is n't tied to Ultimate Member in any way . Youd need a custom plugin to hook into the payment status and then trigger the membership expiration in Ultimate Member . <p> This is super . Thanks . I 'm currently in the process of setting up something like this . However , I 'm interested in including the email activation for GF registration . I figured out how to customize the terrible WP activation email , but not sure how that will integrate with UM . <p> Thank you for the fantastic reviews on this site ! Ill be coming back frequently . <p> I am working on a site for an organization that offers a physical course and then provides online content . They need attractive user profiles and ways to interact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need a way to enroll and admit students that includes a recurring tuition payment plan option and the ability to include add-ons ( like sessions with a practitioner ) . Buying additional categories ( like a lodging reservation for the offline class ) is ideal . Non-students need to be able to buy one-off options like a session or pay for an event . Currently they are set up with Authorize.net . <p> Ultimate Member now has a WooCommerce extension . I 'm wondering if you have tried those two together and whether what I 'm describing above is possible ? Gravity Forms obviously works for a simpler approach but I need more <p> I 've got Paid Memberships Pro but getting the attractive user interfaces is proving a hassle and setup and the code recipes are a bit above my pay grade . Any suggestions on alternative approaches that have the front-end beauty of Ultimate Member with recurring payment options ? 
@@98138016 @2338016/ <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce version 3.0 was released this week , which brings about a major update to WooCommerces internal structure . This release hits some immediate performance improvements for stores , while it lays a lot of groundwork for future improvements , especially at large scale . <p> You 'll notice the version jump from WooCommerce 2.6.14 to 3.0.0 to reflect the scope of these internal changes . While there are n't  a ton of merchant-facing changes , well go through those and some of what 's changed structurally for developers . <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Overview <p> Version 3.0 of WooCommerce is focused mostly on performance enhancements along with foundation for future improved performance at scale . This ensures that , as stores grow , they wont run into data bottlenecks while managing or adding WooCommerce products and orders . <p> While most stores do n't  run into these issues , large eCommerce retailers may see performance deterioration with thousands of concurrent users or when processing more than a couple of orders per second . While these may be champagne problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with nonetheless , and this release helps to make strides towards improving the data structure of WooCommerce to make far larger performance gains in the future . <p> In the immediate release , the frontend product filters ( such as " in stock " or " featured " ) have been optimized to make product sorting and filtering up to 94% faster ( tested with 8000 products ) . These same improvements also help for stores that hide out of stock products . <p> Variable product syncing has also been improved to remove some of the data checks that were not needed to sync prices or child product data . <p> If you want more complete details on some of these changes , you can check out the overview posts from the WooCommerce development blog : <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Product Photo Gallery <p> WooCommerce has an overview of the new product image galleries you can watch on YouTube . Basically , there are some major improvements to photos on product pages : <p> Visitors can now magnify , zoom , and open images in a lightbox ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is improved clicking on a thumbnail updates the main image instead of opening a lightbox directly <p> Mobile browsing is vastly improvement to support touch gestures , such as pinch-to-zoom , swiping between images , and others <p> Mobile lightboxes are also more relevant now , as theyll open the image in a size larger than its display size , which did n't  happen in previous versions ( the image was constrained by the screen ) <p> You can see the mobile gallery changes in action here : ( Click an image to view a gif ) <p> WC 2.6 Mobile gallery <p> WC 3.0 Mobile gallery <p> The gallery improvements make it easier to highlight product photography on any device , but the mobile improvements are especially welcome . <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Product Structured Data Markup <p> Structured data allows Google and other search engines to learn information about your products . Having this data available on product pages gives search engines the tools they need to find and display information about your product , which can lead to showing rich snippets in search results . Youve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that they have a star rating next to them in the search listings . <p> While having structured data is n't a guarantee that a search engine will show rich snippets , it is a requirement to even have the possibility of showing them . In WooCommerce 3.0 , the structured data for products has upgraded to the newer JSON-LD format . <p> This moves the structured data for products out of template files and into its own bit of code that 's output as part of your page source , making structured data more resilient to theme overrides and more consistent , regardless of theme . <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Shipping Zones <p> The shipping zone creation and management UI has been refined in WooCommerce 3.0 to make it easier to add or update a shipping zone . You 'll notice that the zones screen is slightly different when you first visit WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping . In version 3.0 , you 'll see a description of zones , and a new " Add Shipping Zone " button at the top instead of at the bottom of the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Previously , adding a zone was done in-line on the zones list . Youd have to ( 1 ) add a zone and name it , then save the new zone ; ( 2 ) you could then add rates , and then youd have to click each rate to edit its settings . <p> WC 2.6 : Add zone <p> WC 3.0 : Add zone <p> In WooCommerce 3.0 , you can now add all of your rates to a zone at once , and click the rate name to open a modal , letting you add its settings . While this is n't a huge change , it cuts down on the steps needed to update a zone or rate , and makes it a bit easier for new users to work with . <p> If you click on each image below , you 'll see a gif to illustrate how zone creation has changed . <p> WC 2.6 New zone <p> WC 3.0 New zone <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Grouped Products <p> Grouped product management has changed with WooCommerce 3.0 to simplify creating a grouped product in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grouped " product type as the " holder " for the grouped product . This would be the product page that shows the group options . <p> For any simple product that should belong to the group , go to that simple product now and add it to the group under " Linked Products " . <p> WC 2.6 Grouped product <p> Repeat this process with any simple product that should be shown in the group . <p> This was a long process if you wanted to show several products as part of the grouped product , as you had to edit every product in the group individually to add them to the group . <p> Now , you 'll notice that " Linked Products " will no longer show a " Grouped products " selector . <p> WC 3.0 : Linked Products <p> Instead , you can now add all products that belong to a group when you create the " Grouped " product parent / holder . The " Grouped " product now let 's you use a multi-select to add all items that should be in the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product <p> This significantly cuts down the number of steps required to create a grouped product , as you no longer have to edit every single product in the group to add it . <p> However , there 's a small improvement here : because the search input is on the grouped product page and not while editing a product in the group , you can now add a variable product to a grouped product . Previously , this wasnt possible , as the group selector wasnt shown for a variable product . <p> If a variable product is in the group , this will show the " select options " button instead of a quantity selector : <p> WC 3.0 Grouped product page <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Other Changes <p> One change to note is that " product percent " discounts are no longer available . Because the same thing can be used with a cart percentage discount and a product restriction , these coupon types were redundant . These have now been merged into a " Percentage " coupon type instead . <p> WC 2.6 Add coupon <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinements in the WooCommerce 3.0 admin . First , you 'll notice that the " Purchased " column in the orders list has been removed : <p> WC 2.6 : Orders list <p> This was done for performance reasons . To show this count / item list , when you viewed orders , every order had to be loaded , its items counted , and the item names grabbed . This led to performance issues for stores that sold a lot of items in an order and displayed a large number of orders per page . <p> Now , this page can load much faster because each order does n't  have to load all of its items when displaying the orders list . <p> There are also two other small refinements . First , tax rates are now sorted automatically , putting the most specific rates first , so you no longer have to drag-and-drop to sort tax rates . <p> WC 2.6 Tax rates <p> WC 3.0 Tax rates <p> Next , the " enhanced " selects you see for dropdowns , searchable inputs , and multi-selects have been updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that generates these ) , so theyll look slightly different . <p> WC 2.6 Enhanced select <p> WC 3.0 Enhanced select <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : Debugging Tools <p> Several of the debugging tools built into WooCommerce have been updated in version 3.0 . While these typically are n't  used by merchants on a regular basis , they 're very helpful when getting support for WooCommerce or extensions . <p> First , here 's one merchants may actually use : you can now delete orphaned variations right from WooCommerce &gt; System Status &gt; Tools : <p> WC 2.6 Tools <p> WC 3.0 Tools <p> This will remove variations from your store that have no parent product . This can happen occasionally if an item that was variable has been changed to a simple product or different type , as these variations still exist in your site database . Since this can affect reporting or other queries on your site , this tool will make it easy to delete them . <p> Other debug tools , such as " shipping debug mode " have moved or been removed in WooCommerce 3.0 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping &gt; Shipping options : <p> WC 2.6 Debug tools <p> WC 3.0 Debug tools <p> Logging has also changed slightly in WooCommerce 3.0 from a merchant perspective , and you can now delete logs right from the " logs " list . This is helpful if you 've enabled logging for a time period to resolve an issue , but can now delete the log , as logs can fill up with data over time that you likely do n't  want to keep . <p> WC 3.0 Logs <h> WooCommerce 3.0 Review : For Developers <p> Most of the changes in WooCommerce 3.0 are under-the-hood , so developers should definitely take note of these . The introduction to CRUD methods from the developer blog is an important primer on writing WooCommerce 3.0+ compatible code , and this is where the largest amount of changes have been made , basically refactoring several core objects ( products , coupons , customers , and orders ) in WooCommerce . The consistency between these is welcome , but there are plenty of new things to learn . <p> As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updating , getting , and deleting data , several hooks and methods have been deprecated in WooCommerce , so updating to newer hooks and functions is recommended . <p> The CRUD system will allow WooCommerce to change its backend data stores in the future without affecting developers , letting WooCommerce optimize for scalability at a very large level , which is n't possible with its current database schema . <p> Developers may also want to check out a few other posts on the developer blog : <p> The 2.6 -&gt; 3.0 migration notes are an essential read for developers updating custom plugins , themes , or snippets ( especially pay attention to order dates , select2 version changes , and new data stores , as some items now use objects for data instead of arrays ) . <p> Extension developers who still need to update plugins for compatibility should check out examples from the dev blog : <p> The performance enhancements in this release also speed up the shop frontend and browsing experience , helping customers get to the improved product pages even faster . <p> While the admin UI changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other changes in this release are structural , massively updating the internals in WooCommerce to provide it more flexibility in the future for even further performance upgrades . While store owners wont see the full effects of this immediately , it clears the way for WooCommerce to make more aggressive changes to the way it handles data for performance gains while leaving plugins or custom code unaffected . <p> However , if you have put customizations in place on your site , you 'll want to update them for WooCommerce 3.0 compatibility at some point , as likely these would break with WooCommerce 4.0 ( when the way data is stored for your orders or other items actually changes ) . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98138020 @2338020/ <h> 8 Strategies for More Effective Coupons <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Being able to use a coupon on an order makes you feel like you 've won something . It can be a pretty great feeling , right ? Here I thought I was going to spend $56.42 on my order , and BAM ! I 've got a 10% discount or free shipping . <p> Your customers love this feeling too . According to an e-Tailing study , 56% of customers say coupons or discounts are a " very important " factor in determining whether theyll purchase or not . People like getting discounts for online orders , so much that they may not purchase without a coupon . <p> However , coupons can be conversion killers . KISSmetrics shows that coupon boxes can encourage customers to leave your site in the checkout funnel , and a study by PayPal and comScore confirms this , finding that 27% percent of abandoned carts are due to customers searching for a coupon . <p> I know I 'm very often guilty of this : I get to a checkout page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be getting my order for less : " Got a discount ? Apply Coupon . " Off to Google I go for " Site + Coupon " . <p> So how do you battle the conversion killer ? There are some changes you can make to your site or checkout page to help reduce cart abandonment from coupon searches while still maintaining customer satisfaction and saving sales that depend on discounts . <h> Coupon Strategy 1 : Disable Coupons <p> Okay , this probably is n't the strategy you 're looking for immediately . However , disabling discounts or limiting their availability can benefit your shop . If you constantly offer coupons , your customers may be trained to look for them and wo n't purchase unless they have a coupon code . Customers that will purchase without a code are typically more loyal and have higher lifetime values . <p> Even if you do n't  disable coupons on a permanent basis , you can remove them from time-to-time to make sure customers do n't  expect them , and to create some urgency around when they 're offered because they 're a limited time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupons due to the conversion benefits that come from offering them , you should also make sure that the increase in conversion rate the coupon(s) yield increases profits . Certified Knowledge has some great insights here , but basically you should ensure that the increase in orders from coupons ( which have decreased profitability ) outweigh the higher profitability of non-discounted orders . <p> There is such a thing as over-offering discounts , and you should make sure you 're not unintentionally ruining your profitability by offering them . <p> So how can you remove them ? Most plugins have a way for you to disable coupons : <p> Easy Digital Downloads : If you have no active coupons ( no coupons , or all are deactivated / expired ) , EDD will remove the coupon field at checkout automatically <p> WP eCommerce : Will remove coupon fields if you have no active coupons <p> Exchange : You can disable the " Coupons " add-on to remove coupons from the store <p> Jigoshop : Will remove coupon fields without an active coupon <p> Shopp : Will remove coupon fields without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Reward <p> Instead of giving out a discount code to enter at checkout , you can limit your discounts to apply them when a customer takes a desired action . For example , you can give out a coupon if a customer completes a survey , signs up for your email list , or shares a product via social media . <p> This can help you still offer discounts to customers who want them , but also get something in return : a tweet , Facebook like , or email list signup . For example , Bed Bath &amp; Beyond offers coupons to anyone who signs up for their email list : <p> You could do the same thing and include coupons in your " Welcome " email that confirms sign up . You can also delay sending the coupon until a day after the sign up ( as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond does ) , which may help reduce the number of people who sign up and immediately unsubscribe once the coupon is in hand . <h> Coupon Strategy 3 : Rename Coupon Fields <p> Renaming coupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " Coupon " is practically a huge notice to leave the site and search for codes . However , if you use a different term , such as " Promo code " , customers can be less likely to leave your site to look for a code as it implies theyd need one as part of a promotion or group . <p> If you choose to call your discounts something else , be sure to remain consistent in that naming convention . If you call them " Voucher codes " , always use that term in your emails and communication with customers , as theyll look for that phrase on your cart / checkout page to enter the code . You do n't  want to rename your coupon fields , then upset customers that do have a discount because they do n't  know where to apply it . <p> Weve written a tutorial on how to rename coupon fields using WooCommerce , but its a pretty simple change to make with most plugins . The free Say What plugin is incredibly helpful for doing this , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than translate them into a different language , you can change them to your desired wording . <p> Enter Coupon term changes <p> This will adjust the wording on your site for coupon fields : <p> Before <p> After <p> here 's a list of text domains for popular eCommerce plugins that will help out if you 've never translated text . <h> Coupon Strategy 4 : Hide Coupons and Apply via URL <p> If you really hate that coupon code field but still want to offer loyal customers discounts , you can take a middle-of-the-road approach rather than disabling coupons completely . <p> Instead of requiring customers to enter a code to apply a coupon , you can give them a URL to apply the coupon instead . This can let you remove the coupon field from your cart and checkout pages , but let you give out links to apply a coupon that existing customers can use . This can help you put the link on your site , send it via email , or give it out to partners or affiliates to let them promote your store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in special links embedded in your email newsletters and automatically transfer the coupon to the users shopping cart . Jakob Nielson <h> Coupon Strategy 5 : Move Coupon Fields to Be Less Obvious <p> If you want to keep your coupon fields at checkout , you might want to put them in a less obvious place than at the top of the checkout page . This keeps the field there for people that need it , but ensures that new customers have to start filling out the checkout before they leave the page to start searching for codes . As they 've started the checkout process already at this point , they 're more likely to continue to complete it . <p> This strategy can be a partner to renaming the coupon field as well . <p> We 've got a tutorial on how to move the coupon field on the checkout page with WooCommerce , but for many plugins , youd need to edit the checkout template to move the field where you 'd like it ( which may require the help of a developer / web designer ) . <h> Coupon Strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're already going to be offering deals , you can ensure that customers do n't  leave your site to look for them by listing them on your site or advertising that you share them with your email list . This can help you get new email signups , or simply keep customers on-site while offering a discount . <p> The discount can be something as simple as a free shipping coupon , but that way customers wo n't leave and go elsewhere for the discount . <p> If you 're using WooCommerce , you can do this pretty easily with the free Coupon Shortcodes plugin we 've got a tutorial on using it as well . This let 's you easily show all of your discounts on one page with a shortcode . The plugin slo let 's you conditionally display content based on whether a coupon applies , does n't  apply , or has been applied by a customer to personalize the coupon experience . <p> A deals page could also be created and updated manually so its styled to your liking . A good strategy might be to show both sales and discounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cater to bargain hunters . <h> Coupon Strategy 7 : Automatically Apply Coupons <p> This could be a strategy you take instead of a " deals " page : apply a coupon automatically to the cart page to give every customer a discount . If you 're thinking of offering free shipping anyway , adding a flat shipping cost but then applying a free shipping coupon can be a low-cost way of doing so . <p> To prevent this , do n't  just show coupon codes at the front of your page , but fill one in for the customer at checkout . Even if its something small " shoppers will appreciate the discount or freebie and will continue ordering without feeling interrupted . <p> If you 're using WooCommerce , you could easily use the URL Coupons extension for this as well , as it can automatically apply a coupon when a certain URL ( such as the cart page ) is visited . <h> Coupon Strategy 8 : Always Set Expiration Dates <p> As a final strategy , you should always set expiration dates for your discounts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways : <p> it creates a sense of urgency , encouraging customers to make the purchase so they do n't  miss the discount <p> it ensures that deals or coupon sites cant list a discount in perpetuity <p> it ensures that customers are n't  trained to always use coupons if they 're not always running <h> More Effective Coupons <p> For some customers , coupons can make or break the purchasing experience . While offering coupons can be a great way to boost sales and increase customer happiness , it can also lead to cart abandonment and discourage purchasing without a discount . <p> Planning out an effective coupon strategy and making minor site changes to improve coupon field presentation can help you ensure that couponing keeps customers happy , but does n't  wipe out your profitability . <h> Read More 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138021 @2338021/ <p> This series pits plugins and services against one another in head-to-head comparisons . <p> While there are free options available for creating contact forms and other form types , I 've yet to find a free WordPress form builder that I really enjoy using and that can do everything I need it to do . As a result , I 've tried a couple of different premium form builders to get an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each , so today I 'm bringing you another head-to-head plugin comparison : Gravity Forms vs Formidable Pro . <h> Price &amp; Licensing <p> Pricing is almost always a concern for store owners when it comes to the tools they need to build their stores . While I 'll do the best I can to show the pros and cons of each of these plugins , I 'd make sure you have an idea in mind of everything you think you 'd be using forms for before you purchase , as available features is a far more important metric . Since Gravity Forms and Formidable Pro do n't  have total feature parity , you 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . As the investment in purchasing each of these is pretty small , its worth it to make sure you purchase the plugin that will be the best fit for your store . <p> Also , take a look at our Special Offers page we do have a Gravity Forms exclusive coupon code available for any new license , but Formidable Pro does not offer coupon codes . <p> As for the free version of Formidable , I do n't  really consider it a serious contender , so Ill limit this review to the Pro version . As the free version only includes 6 fields ( and no email fields that can be validated ) , its more like trial-ware than anything else : <p> Formidable Free <h> Basic Forms <p> Basic forms , such as contact forms or inquiry forms , are needed by almost every website . For example , many eCommerce stores have pre-sales forms used on product pages so that customers can quickly and easily get more information about products . This is the kind of stuff that your form builder should be handling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general input fields , such as text , name , and email fields . Let 's take a look at what each plugin can do with these forms . <h> Gravity Forms <p> No matter which license you use with Gravity Forms , you 'll have access to all form fields . When you create a form , you 'll enter a name and description , then view a blank page with all possible form fields on the right : <p> New Gravity Form <p> For many forms , you 'll probably be using the Standard and Advanced fields . Advanced fields will be validated ( i.e. , check for valid email address formats or phone numbers ) , and you can include some cool things such as date-pickers . <p> Gravity Forms Standard Fields <p> Gravity Forms Advanced Fields <p> Simply clicking these fields will add them to the form . You can drag and drop fields into the order you choose , mark certain fields as required , set field names and descriptions , and set up options for some field types , such as dropdowns and radio buttons . Using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact forms that some plugins ( such as Jetpack ) allow . <p> You can then embed your new form on any page or post using the " Add Forms " button , or make this a part of your page template using the gravityforms id= " " shortcode . <p> Embed Gravity Forms <p> As a final note , one cool thing you can do with forms is to include some default values in a field . For example , I like to embed one standard pre-sales form on all product pages , then use a field that 's only visible to the admin to set the name . As my product names are indicated in the post name , I use a text field with a default value that embeds the post name . This way , any pre-sales questions will have the information I need to answer them without forcing customers to type in the product name . <p> Admin Fields with Default Values <p> For example , I do this using WooCommerce by adding a global " Pre-Sales " tab with the Tab Manager , then embedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only work for static forms ( no conditional logic ) . <h> Formidable Pro <p> Creating basic forms with Formidable is easy as well . When you create a form , you can simply drag and drop fields onto the form to use and some form fields will be validated ( such as phone or email ) . <p> Create a New Form <p> There are several form fields you can use for all new forms . Basic forms could end up leveraging any of these fields : <p> Field Types <p> Editing fields is pretty simple , and you have several options for each field . You can mark fields as required , drag and drop fields into the correct order , edit names and optionally set descriptions , and create options for some field types : <p> Formidable form fields <p> You can even pre-fill some of these forms ( such as email ) for logged in users to save your customers some time . Once you 've added the options youd like and saved your form , you can edit some form settings and its ready to embed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formidable id= shortcode , or use the " Add Form " button to insert the form in a page or post . <p> Adding a form <p> Again , there are some cool things you can do with default values and hidden fields . The pre-sales form trick I previously mentioned will work here as well . You can set a text field to be filled with a default value ( in this case , the Post Title again ) , then make sure that only administrators can see that form field . This gives your customers one less thing to worry about when trying to get in touch , and you can embed the form within your product page template . <p> Set Default Values <p> That 's it ! Basic forms are easy to make and use with both Gravity Forms and Formidable Pro . <h> Advanced Forms <p> There are several advanced uses for forms as well , such as the ability to dynamically populate fields , use conditional logic to only display required fields , submit posts , and use pricing fields . Add-ons are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of that separately . <h> Gravity Forms <p> Using Gravity Forms will give you some pretty cool advanced options for your form fields . Most advanced fields are under Post or Pricing fields : <p> Gravity Forms Post Fields <p> Gravity Forms Pricing Fields <p> Post fields will allow you to create post drafts right from the submitted form . This could be really handy , for example , if your site accepts guest posts about your products or does case studies for people that use your products . Users can submit the requisite fields on the frontend , such as post titles and body , as well as select post categories . You can determine if posts should be created as pending / drafts when submitted so that you can review and edit them , and assign them to a default author as well ( such as a guest author or someone on your staff ) . <p> Pricing fields are my favorite . You can use them to sell additional products at checkout , accept donations anywhere on your site , and more . Theyll allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. a " tee shirt " product that has options for " size ) , set quantity , choose shipping prices , and calculate the total . You can even accept payment using a payment gateway add-on . This can be a handy addition to your checkout page or blog posts . <p> Aside from fields , there are a couple other advanced options . You can enable conditional logic for a form field , which will allow you to hide or display any of your fields based on what 's been entered for other fields . This is really handy if you want to sort incoming contact requests by type , but only display fields that are absolutely needed . <p> Setting logic rules <p> You can also dynamically populate form fields . This will allow you to pass in values via the URL so that forms are already filled in for customers . You can assign the field a parameter name , and then populate it by appending ? parametername=value to your URLs . You can use this to automatically select an option in a dropdown , pre-fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous example , let 's say you want to use one form to sort contact requests ( e.g. , pre-sales , general questions , and more ) . Ill use the parameter name " formtype " , and can now fill in that field easily when sending customers to my form . <p> Setting Parameter Names <p> For example , I can preselect the " Pre-Sales " dropdown by using this URL : mystore.com/contact/ ? formtype=presales . This is very helpful if you 're linking to a form from product pages or blog posts so that you can eliminate some of the work for customers . <h> Formidable Pro <p> Advanced uses for Formidable are n't  quite as obvious . You can also create posts from your forms , but there are n't  necessarily dedicated fields for this . Instead , you 'll create a form , then assign your fields to the post properties under the Form Settings . You can map form fields to properties such as titles and excerpts . <p> Create a post <p> A super cool feature for this is the ability to easily create custom post types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formidable will detect which post types are available and allow you to select them when you 're mapping form fields to post properties . This is really awesome for marketplaces , as it provides an easy way for your vendors to submit their own products ( you could even protect the page this form is on to only allow logged-in vendors ) . <p> You can also use conditional logic with Formidable to hide or show form fields based on what 's populated in other fields . This makes sure you can use one form for all incoming inquiries , but only show the necessary fields for each inquiry type . <p> Conditional Logic <p> I do have to point out that using this conditional logic is n't as smooth as the experience with Gravity Forms , as I 've sometimes had trouble with it even using default themes / no other plugins . <p> Finally , Formidable does give you control over your form styling in the general settings . As themes do n't  typically support Formidable out of the box , this can be really helpful to adjust the way your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Styling Options <h> Using Add-ons <p> Add-ons provide some cool features for both of these plugins , and can really extend what you can do with each form . <h> Gravity Forms <p> The basic add-ons are fairly limited ( comes with the $99 license ) , as three of them are mailing list integrations ( 4 total ) . I do use the MailChimp add-on to add opt-ins to my forms , so that 's not to say they are n't  useful . I just do n't  think it adds a ton of value to the package when there are usually free plugins available for mailing list signups . <p> However , the advanced add-ons ( 14 total ) can let you do some nifty stuff . The payment gateway add-ons will allow you to take payments directly on your site , which is great for donations or any of the products you 're using Gravity Forms for . In fact , if you do n't  have many products and do n't  need to manage inventory or orders , Gravity Forms can stand in as your entire eCommerce solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products or those selling a few services . <p> My favorite add-ons are the Polls , Survey , and Quiz add-ons , which give you some really powerful ways to get feedback or information from your customers . Including interactive quizzes for your content or product pages is a great way to get customers to engage with your brand . They 're also very handy for membership or e-Learning sites if you have checkpoints following sections or chapters . The polling and survey add-ons can help you easily get feedback from customers about your products or services in a quick and easy way so that you can improve your offering . <p> There are also two other add-ons that I 've found very useful : the Signatures add-on and the Zapier add-on . Signatures helps you collect a signature as part of your form , and works for touch-screen devices . This can be very handy for product deliveries , as delivery personal can fill out the delivery form and have customers sign from an iPad or other device . <p> The Zapier add-on let 's you integrate Gravity Forms with virtually any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool tutorial on using Gravity Forms + Zapier to manage incoming contact requests in Trello . <h> Formidable Pro <p> There are 12 add-ons available for both paid versions of Formidable Pro . Again , one of my favorites is the MailChimp integration , which allows you to add opt-ins for your email lists to your forms . You can also accept payments using your forms , but must use PayPal ( which is n't my favorite payment gateway ) . <p> Other cool add-ons include the Highrise integration , which adds users to your Highrise CRM account when they complete a form , and the Signatures add-on , which allows typed signatures , or signatures that use a trackpad or mouse . Again , this is great for delivery personnel or forms that require signature confirmation ( potentially for pre-signed deliveries , as Apple does ) . <p> The Zapier add-on is also very handy , and let 's you integrate Formidable with a host of other services . Formidable even has a collection of popular zaps to get you started . <p> Finally , the Bootstrap add-on is very handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formidable styling . You can disable the Formidable styling and use Bootstrap instead . <h> General Tips <p> Before we discuss support and wrap up , here a couple of tips for those of you looking to use these forms based on my experience . <h> Gravity Forms <p> One thing that I dislike as a default option and find counter-intuitive in many forms is the placement of descriptions . By default , Gravity Forms descriptions are displayed after the form field ( this is true of Formidable Pro , but you cant change it ) . For many fields , I find it helpful to read a description of what I should do before I fill out the field . I usually change this under my form settings for each form : <p> Second tip : Make sure you update your admin notifications for every form under the " Form Settings " . You may want to send notifications to an email other than the admin email ( such as a support desk ) or to multiple emails . You probably also want to change the from and reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your form . <p> Final tip : Always set your own option values for forms that will use ( or may someday use ) conditional logic or allow fields to be populated dynamically . This will make it far easier to change the wording of these forms in the future , as the logic is related to the value rather than the name . If you do n't  do this and then tweak your form , you 'll break the conditional logic and its a pain to update everything . <p> Set Option Values <h> Formidable Pro <p> Admin notifications are something to pay attention to here as well do n't  forget to change them when you create your form so that you 're getting emails from your customers addresses rather than your own . You can also send incoming forms to your helpdesk software or other email addresses . <p> I also do the same thing with Formidable Pro that I do with Gravity Forms in terms of setting my own option values . Again , this makes it easier to change the title of options without breaking conditional logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are reports for number of entries , which forms they come from , etc. within your admin . This is kind of handy if you want to split test forms to see how responses stack up with one another . <p> Finally , as I mentioned before , you 'll want to tweak either the styling settings or use the Bootstrap add-on for styling to make sure your forms look good in your theme . <h> Other Comments <p> One thing to also bear in mind is the ability to integrate other plugins and themes with your form builder . For example , there are far more integrations available for Gravity Forms than there are Formidable , especially among eCommerce plugins and free add-ons . You can use Gravity Forms to customize WooCommerce products or to replace the Easy Digital Downloads checkout process . Many themes also support Gravity Forms out of the box since its so popular . <h> Support <p> Purchasing a license for either plugin will include a year of support the only version of either that does n't  include support is the free version of Formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to pay attention to updates . If you grab Formidable Pro , you 'll get updates for the lifetime of the plugin and will only have to renew your license for support . If you use Gravity Forms , renewals are for both support and updates , as updates expire after one year . For both plugins you can use them as long as you want to , but this is something to note to ensure that you have the most up-to-date copies and all new features . <p> Finally , I can say that I 've not really needed frequent access to support with either of these plugins . In the few times our team has contacted them , support teams for both plugins have responded quickly and been very helpful and friendly . They both also have forums and documentation available for all users , though you can no longer ask questions in Gravity Forms forums . Their support is ticketed , while Formidable Pro uses forums ( posting is restricted to paid users ) . I do n't  think that support will necessarily be a point of differentiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The biggest decisions you 'll have to make for your eCommerce site when choosing a form builder is what features you 'll absolutely need , which I 'd do before worrying about pricing . Both plugins can do some of the same things , such as creating conditional logic , adding or creating bulk sets of options ( such as US states ) , or limiting form entries . However , there are a few points of differentiation to consider . <p> For the single site license , you 'll get all add-ons for Formidable Pro , while you 'll need a developer license for Gravity Forms to get all add-ons ( I use this its worth it ) . <p> Gravity Forms allows you to schedule forms so they 're only available for certain dates . <p> Both can allow you to view form entries , but Gravity Forms will allow the administrator to add notes ( helpful for returned products , etc ) . <p> Gravity Forms allows you to create multi-page forms with progress status . Formidable kind of does this , but without progress status . <p> Formidable Pro can pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that create posts to create a checkbox , while Gravity Forms will only be able to select post categories . However , Gravity Forms can create a featured image , while Formidable Pro allows for an image upload but cant set this as the featured image . <p> Conditional content is better with Gravity Forms , and you can dynamically populate your fields . <p> Gravity Forms can be used for limited eCommerce with pricing fields / more payment integrations . <p> Gravity Forms has more integrations and is usually pre-styled for themes , but Formidable will allow you to customize styling . <p> In short , if you need add-ons for one site or want to easily allow forms to create custom post types , such as products , portfolios , or testimonials , then Formidable Pro is a great choice . If conditional logic , multipage forms , and eCommerce matter more to you , then go with Gravity Forms . I also really like the quiz and survey add-ons for Gravity Forms . As a personal preference , I do find Gravity Forms easier to use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Formidable Pro so I would n't put much stock into it = . <p> Have questions ? Ask in the comments and I 'll try to clarify what I can ! <p> For those of you that are researching these , weve already done a full Gravity Forms review that has more information , but have not written a stand-alone review for Formidable yet . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Thanks for the write up ! Just a couple notes . Formidable allows dynamic default values and the description location can be changed . The dynamic default values are listed in a sidebar tab , and can come from a lot of locations in addition to the URL . The form HTML is customizable and the description can be moved from there . Notes can also be added when you go to view an entry on the back-end . <p> Also , have you used the graphing and views at all in Formidable . You can setup pretty much anything you want on the front-end using views , including editing entries for only the entry submitter or any group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editing and views . <p> Hi Stephanie , thanks for clearing these up + the added tips ! Definitely helpful to know you can add dynamic default values via URL , that was something I was looking for and must have missed = Will check out the graphing for next time ! <p> Beka , I also want to second Stephanies note about Formidable Pros Views feature . This component is an absolutely HUGE advantage and its difficult to cover all its capabilities in a brief comment . GF also has a separate " Views " addon product , but its very pricey and requires a separate license . This type of customizable content query and front-end presentation tool more-or-less replicates Drupals Views plugin , which has historically been a big draw for those users . I 'd reinforce not to underestimate the value of that built-in feature of Formidable Pro . <p> Hi Beka , fantastic and detailed comparison ! I have Gravity Forms ( developer license ) , but I could never manage to create a post using it . Turns out the add-on ( Gravity Forms + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gravity Forms well , useless for me . <p> I went ahead and bought Formidable after reading your post because I wanted the ability to create products ( Woocommerce ) via frontend . I 'm a bit stumped though with the process . Would be great if you can post a tutorial . = <p> Hey Sunit ! Thanks for the update on the Gravity Forms add-on , as I have n't had to use this myself in a while . I do have a tutorial on using Formidable Pro for this on my list , so Ill bump it up higher on our idea board : ) . There is documentation on this that can hopefully help in the meantime ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138022 @2338022/ <h> Which Authorize.net Version Should I Use with WordPress ? <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Were not surprised that we get asked about Authorize.net for WordPress eCommerce frequently , as it provides a lot of flexibility in processing options and integrates easily with many merchant accounts . However , there are several options and we get this question a lot : " Which Authorize.net payment gateway version should I use ? " <p> There are a lot of options ( AIM , SIM , CIM , etc ) and its tough to be sure which one is right for your store . PCI compliance is also a concern for some merchants , though Authorize.net does not require merchants to be PCI compliant ( you simply get charged a monthly fee for non-compliance ) . <p> Here well discuss what each version does , and we 've got a chart at the end that shows which versions are available for each WordPress eCommerce plugin . <h> Which Authorize.net Version is for me ? <p> There are four major versions of Authorize.net payment gateways available for purchase to integrate with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? Below is an overview of what each version does , and which are available for each eCommerce platform . Authorize.net also provides a comparison chart for most of these integration methods . <p> The only integration that is PCI compliant is the DPM version . The SIM implementation can be PCI compliant depending on how its implemented if payments are routed through your servers and an SSL is needed , than its not . If payments are routed through Authorize.net and you have no need of an SSL certificate , then the integration you 're using is most likely PCI compliant always ask the author if you 're not sure . <p> We 've covered this a bit when we talked about WooCommerce Payment Gateways , but basically WordPress integrations can not be totally compliant unless they ( 1 ) direct payment through the processors servers via a hosted or iframed page , or ( 2 ) tokenize information before posting it to your servers ( as Braintree and Stripe can ) . <h> Authorize.net AIM <p> The AIM API provides the most common integration for Authorize.net . Typically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AIM API . This version of the integration allows for the most seamless checkout , as it keeps customers on your site and supports mobile checkout , but therefore requires an SSL certificate to be used . <p> Some AIM implementations also support ARB ( Automated recurring billing ) , which allows you to set up recurring transactions for an additional $10 per month . Customer payment information is saved on Authorize.nets servers for security and you can manage these recurring payments from your Authorize.net control panel . <h> Authorize.net SIM <p> SIM is an older implementation for Authorize.net that typically allows you to accept payments via Authorize.nets servers . Customers payment information is entered into a hosted form that sends payments through Authorize.nets servers so that merchants typically do not need an SSL certificate . <p> SIM integrations also typically allow for Authorize.net emulation . Some payment processors , such as eProcessing network and Chase Paymentech , build systems that mimic how Authorize.net works so that adoption of their service is easier . Using Authorize.net SIM will typically allow you to enter a URL that your processor gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authorize.nets . <p> Note that you should check with the seller to see how the SIM integration works , as there are several ways of implementing it . For example , I know the WooCommerce version of SIM is included in the Authorize.net AIM extension and supports Authorize.net emulation , but does not route payments through Authorize.nets servers . An SSL certificate is therefore required and its not a PCI compliant integration . <h> Authorize.net CIM <p> Authorize.net CIM is a $20 per month add-on service for your Authorize.net account that allows you to tokenize and store customer payment information on Authorize.nets secure servers . This helps you to do a couple of different things . First , CIM helps to process payments for returning customers with saved cards , as cards are saved securely on Authorize.nets servers for reuse and your store simply uses a token tied to that card to process payments . This greatly reduces friction at checkout for your returning customers since they do n't  have to continuously enter payment details . <p> CIM is also sometimes used for recurring transactions , as the tokenized information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WooCommerce Subscriptions integrates with CIM rather than ARB . This provides more flexibility in terms of payment intervals , as you 're not subject to the limits in billing periods and trials set by the ARB implementation ( which usually require trials to be set using the same period as renewals i.e. , both in terms of months ) . Using CIM avoids this nuisance by allowing another plugin to set the transaction schedule . <h> Authorize.net DPM <p> The DPM integration of Authorize.net typically uses a hosted pay form that sends payment details directly to Authorize.net rather than routing them through your servers , which means that you do n't  have to worry about security . SSL certificates are recommended , but not required , for this integration . The benefit to using this method is that customers appear to remain on your site for checkout , but payment details are not processed by your websites servers . <p> Not sure which is available for your platform ? here 's a comparison spreadsheet of which versions are available and links to purchase if you need an integration . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

You can add such emails to the pre-purchase portion of your lifecycle emails . <p> Let 's take a look at such an email from Turo and see what works , what can be made better , and what got us to click . <h> Commonly asked questions email from Turo : What works ? <p> Answers to common questions email Top <h> 1 . Layout <p> The email layout is well-crafted big image up top with the topic , clear call-to-action buttons , and answers broken up by sections with large headings . The image is the first thing you see when you open the email and conveys that the insurance policy , in this case , will be summarized in the email . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic , and the copy is easy to scan and read with a good amount of whitespace . <p> You can add customized images to different emails to show that each email is treated as a unique communication with the customer . <p> Answers to common questions Bottom <h> 2 . Link to read further <p> This is an important one even though I mentioned it in the above point . The button appears at the beginning and at the bottom of the email to make it convenient for the audience to go to the logical next step which in this case is to read more about insurance . <p> By adding the buttons twice in your email , especially if its long , you emphasize where you want readers to go next . This can be the FAQ section , a product page , a blog post , etc. based on what you think is the next step in the funnel . <h> Commonly asked questions email from Turo : What can be done better ? <h> 1 .

What customers can expect from social links <p> One thing missing from the email that exists on the Turo site is the reason why customers should go to the social links . The website clearly states that the links are to talk to Turo . <p> Instead of simply adding social links to your emails , you can guide the customers better by mentioning what they can expect to find or do on your social profiles . This can be to see what others are saying , see your posts about product instructions , to contact you , etc . <h> Commonly asked questions email from Turo : What got our attention ? <p> The two major things that captured my attention were the large image at the top with the topic of the email , and the large headings for the questions .

This question is from Jeremy : <p> I have a membership site and I want it to be really easy for the members to log in so they can see their content and benefits . Can you add a login to the sidebar for WooCommerce Memberships so members see this ? <p> Certainly ! You could add a sidebar login for a membership site powered by WooCommerce , Easy Digital Downloads , MemberPress , or pretty much any other membership solution for WordPress . This would let registered users or members log in via the sidebar , and you could optionally link to a " register " page for new users to register . <h> Membership Sidebar Login <p> When you install and activate Sidebar Login , you 'll now have a login widget that can be added to your sites sidebar or another widget area . For logged-out users , this will let you show a login form and optionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a welcome message and some links as a sort of " dashboard " for your customers . <p> By default , this widget will use some WordPress core links for membership information , and will have all features enabled : <p> However , we can adjust this to make it more useful for a membership site . Before we do , here are some helpful notes : <p> Any links in the " Links " field under " Logged out " will be shown to logged-out users . This could be a good place to add a " Register " or " Sign up " link , such as a link to the WP admin , or perhaps a link to purchase a membership . <p> Any links in the " Links " field under " Logged in " will be shown to logged-in users . This is where you can show things like a link to edit a profile or a member dashboard . <p> I would recommend disabling the " register link " setting in favor of adding your own version of this link . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Links " sections listed in the plugin description . Some membership sites may be interested to use these for their logged-in links section : <p> %buddypressprofileurl% BuddyPress Profile URL <p> %bbpressprofileurl% bbPress Profile URL <p> In my case , I 'm going to make a few changes to these widget settings for my members . <p> Change the logged-out title to something less boring <p> Add my own " Register " link under logged out links . I can use %adminurl% as the target for this link by entering Register %adminurl% , but you could target any page on your site with this link ( in case you have a frontend registration form ) . <p> I 'll personalize the logged in title a bit by using the members first name instead of username . <p> I 'll make the logged in links a bit more relevant for my members . <p> Now when a member is logged out , the login form will be shown , along with my custom " Register " link added . <p> Logged out widget <p> Once a member has logged in , the widget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dashboard " or helpful information . <p> Logged in widget <p> That 's it ! You can use this process for any membership site , or you could customize your links a bit for your eCommerce platform as desired . We have some additional tips if you 'd like to modify this widget further . <h> WooCommerce Membership Sidebar Login <p> For WooCommerce membership sites , the account system typically leverages the WooCommerce account . As such , the registration form is typically on the account page . We can point the logged out " Register " link to your account page URL instead of the WP admin url : <p> Register /my-account/ <p> However , what if your membership is a premium one that requires purchase ? You could use this as a " sign up " link instead that adds your membership product to the cart : <p> When members are logged out , theyll see this register or signup link . <p> Now what about the widgets " logged in " settings ? For WooCommerce Memberships in particular , the " Memberships dashboard " is on the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logged in members . As members make purchases in your WooCommerce store , you could also consider linking to the " orders " section of the account as well ( WooCommerce 2.6+ ) . Your " logged in " links could look something like this : <h> Easy Digital Downloads Member Sidebar Login <p> First , if you allow registration , you 'll need a registration form . The eddregister shortcode is handy for this , and I add it to my " Purchase history " page often ( as it shows nothing to logged in users , so its a good complement to the purchase history shortcode ) : <p> Now you could link to this page with a " Register " link in the logged out links section : <p> Register /purchase-history/ <p> For logged in links , you could still link to the purchase history so members can see past purchases , and could also link to the blog or other pages where you have shortcodes for members . <p> My Purchases /purchase-history/ Logout %logouturl% <p> This will look similar to our general set up . Logged-out users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While logged in users will see a link to the purchase history page : <p> On a final note , if you want to upsell a membership or link to a membership purchase , you could use a custom add to cart link with EDD as well . <p> Sign up LONG ... <h> Creating a Membership Sidebar Login <p> No matter what membership plugin you use for your WordPress site , the free Sidebar Login plugin can help you create a membership login widget , giving your members an easy way to log into access member benefits . <p> While the generic set up for the widget can work for most sites , you can customize the widgets links for your own membership plugin , directing non-members to the right place to sign up , and giving members a list of useful links for their membership information . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Thanx Beka for another useful article !

Would be much neater than having them in separate widgets . <p> For example , by adding a line in the Sidebar Login widget to put the already existing " Social Login " shortcode into ? I tried putting it into the " Links " area , but that did n't  work . Kind regards/Stefan <p> Something like this would probably work to start : addaction ( LONG ... ' **29;742;TOOLONG ' ) ; you may need a customization if you want to conditionally change login text but that should give you buttons . <p> Worked like a charm ! Many thanx , Beka ! I only changed it to LONG ... to get it beneath the standard login instead . Gon na give the CSS a little more tweaking , but this will clearly work . Thanx again ! = 
@@98138025 @2338025/ <h> Setting Up Effective Shipping Methods <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Enormous focus is placed on increasing conversions for eCommerce sites . We look at button placement , color , typography , and a host of other design aspects to improve the percentage of customers that complete the checkout process . However , some of the issues introduced in the checkout process are structural and based on the way we run our stores rather than based on design . A leading cause of cart abandonment is the surprise customers experience while checking out and being confronted with shipping costs they did n't  expect , which is why setting up effective shipping methods is important for your eCommerce store . <p> Most customers have no idea how much it actually costs to ship something , as its necessary to hide or decrease shipping rates in order to lower a barrier to purchasing online versus in person . Free shipping offers have also become ubiquitous , which reinforces the idea that shipping should n't be expensive or added onto an order total . While I support the practice of lowering shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so can be difficult and requires some consideration . <p> Here are some tactics you can use to set effective shipping rates for your store to improve conversions and customer happiness while limiting the financial impact on your business . <h> Creating Effective Shipping Methods <p> Increase product prices to hide some shipping costs . <p> This is a frequently recommended practice for eCommerce stores simply increase product prices across the board by say , 5% , to account for some shipping costs , then lower shipping or make it free ( we wrote about using this tactic for the holidays ) . Will customers pass you over for another store if your prices go up ? Only if you underestimate the power of free . If you do this and offer free shipping , customers will more often select your store to take advantage of free shipping , even with increased product prices . <p> First , you can do this easily using WooCommerce , WPeC , and Jigoshop , as you can bulk edit product prices to increase them by a percentage or set amount ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word of caution before blindly accepting this practice . You 'll need to have good data on the frequency of product returns , as you cant very well then back out the shipping costs from the returned product , so you may eat more than the product price on a return ( especially if you sell something like apparel and offer free return shipping , too ) . Testing both approaches to see the impact on profits from increased return costs would probably be necessary before betting on this method to work . <p> Free is a far more powerful motivator than a discount . <p> Speaking along the same lines , free shipping is always better if you can offer it . Customers will more often choose free shipping over a $10 discount , even if the shipping costs would be under $10 . " Free " makes them feel like they 've gotten something additional , and more customers will take advantage of free over any other offer type . <p> Free shipping also eliminates one more customer decision and one more barrier to purchase . Customers have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price you set . However , if you add shipping costs into the equation , they then have to make another decision about whether the shipping costs are reasonable and worthwhile , which introduces a point of exit from your checkout process and can start to leak conversions that your store would otherwise have . <p> Always disclose shipping costs as soon as possible . <p> As we said above , customers do n't  like to be surprised by the shipping costs once they 're ready to check out , and can sometimes upset them so much that they immediately leave the site . Do n't  wait until last part of check out process to tell them what it will cost to ship their order . Include a link to your shipping policy in your hero image on the homepage or in a banner , and always be clear about order minimums , returns , or other nuances in the policy . <p> If you have offers , make them extremely obvious For example , you could use something like the Cart Notices extension for WooCommerce to inform people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of them . This serves the two-fold purpose of informing customers about policies and increasing average order value by encouraging customers to meet an order minimum . ( Disclosure : the company I worked for developed that extension . ) <p> Other companies make shipping offers obvious by placing them in the page header to inform customers that may not come to the site through the homepage . For example , check out the shipping policy notices for Nordstroms and Steve Madden : <p> Nordstrom Shipping Offer <p> Steve Madden Shipping Promo <p> Macys does something similar , but takes this idea a step further they provide a link to a " deals " page , and include this link in the cart / checkout pages to show customers current deals . Not only does this keep customers informed , but it also keeps them on the site , which saves affiliate commissions . According to a statement from Macys , this practice increased sales " larger than we thought it was going to be " ( source : Internet Retailer ) . <p> Macys Discount Page <p> Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add additional items to their carts to meet required minimums for free shipping ( source : L2 ) , so you can both increase happiness by offering this perk and increase average order value by encouraging customers to meet a threshold . <p> The wrinkle in this approach is finding a sweet spot for the free shipping threshold . It should be above the average order value , but not too high to be ignored . For example , if you sell keychains , your average order value probably wont be very high , so setting the free shipping threshold at $75 will simply cause customers to ignore it and could irritate them . <p> Ship by weight , not order total or cost . <p> Allowing free shipping may not be feasible for all stores ( though I would strongly consider it and get creative if possible to offer it ) . If you ca n't offer free shipping , you should try to make shipping rates as accurate as possible and determine what you can eat and what customers will have to pay . <p> Since your shipping rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should set rates based on order weight if you want the most accurate shipping methods . With most eCommerce platforms , you can set weight tiers / table rates to calculate shipping based on the total order weight . This way , the costs you 're charging are in-line with what you 'll be paying to ship the order rather than simply reflecting the order cost , which usually has nothing to do with the cost to ship it . <p> Integrate with fulfillment services or shipping providers for real-time rates . <p> Another option if you ca n't offer free shipping would be to integrate with a shipping provider , such as FedEx or UPS , to pull shipping rates straight from the provider for maximum accuracy when determining order shipping rate . Again , most customers are not aware of how much shipping costs , so this may not always be the best approach and they may think your rates are too high compared to other stores in the space . <p> When selecting a provider , you should consider pickup times and perks as well as shipping costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickups without a premium may be more valuable to you than a slightly lower shipping rate . Also , if you have flexibility in locating your store or fulfillment center , you should know that being near a hub for your provider can save you money on rates and yield more favorable pickup times . <p> You could also use a fulfillment service like Shipwire to store and ship your products and to provide shipping rates for orders . Note that you 'll want to check which providers have integrations available with your cart system , as developing a custom integration will be an expensive venture . <p> Test including a handling fee . <p> Some stores charge a handling fee in addition to shipping costs to account for the man hours used in packing an order plus the shipping materials ( boxes , tape , etc ) . Shopp includes the ability to add a handling fee to orders on top of shipping costs . <p> Note that I say you 'll need to test this approach , as its efficacy will vary based on store type . For less expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , which makes online shopping less attractive . However , customers are more likely to understand handling fees for larger items , such as televisions . <p> Estimate delivery date when possible . <p> One of the things I love so much about Amazon is knowing when my order will arrive . Delivery times can be a deal-breaker for customers , especially when ordering gifts . Showing delivery estimates before an order is placed can save you a customer service headache later , which will suck up valuable time and resources ( real costs to you ! ) . <p> Shopp offers the ability to set estimated delivery times to display in the checkout in your settings , but you could include this on product pages with other platforms by tweaking your theme . <p> Almost three quarters ( 65% ) who abandoned at the checkout because they felt delivery costs were unreasonable went on to search online to see if similar products were available elsewhere from another retailer demonstrating that concerns about delivery can impact shopper loyalty .

@@98138026 @2338026/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> If your eCommerce store is just starting out , chances are that you already offer email customer service ( and hopefully take our advice to use something like Help Scout ) . However , while email service is a staple of eCommerce stores , you probably want to offer other methods of customer service . <p> Offering a multichannel customer service approach let 's customers help themselves to find the answers they need , keeps them informed as to what 's happening with orders , or can provide a quicker answer to a question to improve the overall service experience with your shop . Different customers prefer using different communication methods , so offering a few customer service channels acknowledges this . <p> One of the most difficult customer services channels to offer is phone support . <h> Why Offer Phone Support <p> There are both pros and cons to offering phone support that you should be well aware of before doing so . However , despite the cons of phone support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so ) , there 's one thing that can be said about phone support : it does n't  scale . <p> Normally that would be a bad thing , but sometimes doing things that do n't  scale can provide a completely over-the-top experience of your customers that makes them loyal to your brand for life . This is one of the advantages to being small that Paul Graham cites : <p> That 's one advantage of being small : you can provide a level of service no big company can . <p> Phone support is one way to do this . Not only can you provide a level of service that large companies do n't  provide , but you also get really valuable insight into the pain points your customers are hoping your product can solve . Groove took this approach to talk to all of their users in order to learn about their experience with Grooves product : <p> Early on , there 's nothing you can do thatll inform your strategy better than talking to your customers . There 's no other way to deeply understand their challenges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even though well discuss pros and cons of offering customer service via phone , you 'll need to decide if the cons are obstacles to you offering phone service , or if despite these , it can be a valuable opportunity to learn about customers and grow your business . <h> Phone Customer Service : Pros <p> The most valuable reason to offer phone support is to leverage the human connection it provides , which is absent in many other customer service interactions . While customers can often forget they 're talking to a real human being over something like Twitter , having a phone conversation reminds the customer that a real person is behind the business , helping them relate to you and your company . <p> While it may not be a large source of conversions for your store , phone support can also provide the opportunity to take orders for your shop . The need to accept phone orders will depend on both the product you sell and your average customer , but its an alternate way to order for some customers . <p> Phone support can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge base . Any customer service channel exposes you to issues or questions customers have throughout the shopping experience , which can help you improve this experience on your site , or add common questions to the resources available on your site . <p> Talking to customers on the phone also helps you understand your early customers . Andrew Youderian at eCommerce Fuel cited this as one of the top reasons to offer phone support : <p> Especially early on in a new business , there 's no better way to understand your customers than by talking to them directly . You 'll learn all sorts of things about them through casual conversation that would never come up in an email . <p> He also notes that offering phone support can depend on the pricing of items in your shop . <p> The more expensive the items , the more likely your customers will want to talk to you before pulling the trigger . <p> For shops that offer items at high price points , chances are a customer will want to talk to you before purchasing to ensure they know exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparel purchases can be helpful to customers , it can become essential when they 're ordering tools or hardware worth thousands of dollars . <p> Phone support can also be one of the fastest customer service channels , as customers get answers to their questions immediately ( along with a personal touch ) : <p> The single most important thing to consider for new upcoming eCommerce store owners is to have a physical person , with a telephone , who can be a link to the real world and deliver personal customer care when needed . <p> Too many companies have tried to establish themselves as purely online and do n't  offer telephone support , and take far too long to respond to customer queries by email . Scott Lummes <h> Phone Customer Service : Cons <p> The biggest con to offering phone service is that it can be costly . You can only help one customer at a time via phone support , and it requires knowledge of your company and products . Typically , phone support requires you to hire a part time person if you do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Providing good phone support is downright expensive ( from a staffing perspective ) , which is n't necessarily a problem if you have rich margins or high per-order profits . But if you 're selling smaller items , or working with thin margins as a drop shipper , it can be very difficult to offer phone support and still be profitable . <p> Answering questions on the phone does n't  always afford you the time to look up an answer or compose an appropriate response to an angry customer , which can lower customer satisfaction with phone service . <p> Phone support can also become a time-suck . Customers may start to chat about unrelated things , ask questions about products you do n't  even offer , or default to using the phone to get in touch instead of reading your FAQs because a phone call is low-investment the customer does n't  have to spend time composing an email or reading content . This also increases the cost of offering phone service . <p> Despite their high cost , phone calls also may not result in conversions , meaning that revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phone Customer Service : Tools &amp; Tips <p> If you decide that phone support is valuable to offer , there are some tips you can follow and tools to use . <p> Determine what percentage of orders are generated from phone support to determine its worth to your store . You could note the customers name during the call to see if they ordered after asking questions , or you can view orders that are placed manually via the phone to get an idea of how phone support impacts your revenue . <p> Regardless of whether you offer phone support or not , be sure that your customer service does n't  suffer . <p> While I decided not to offer broad in-bound phone support , I was focusing on other areas to make sure I was offering quality support . Things like sending out free replacements for defective items , upgrading packages to express shipment and quickly replying to emails . <p> I was intentionally choosing not to do business with a small segment of my customers ( those who needed to call in ) , but was making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business.Andrew Youderian <p> List your number on your " about " page and contact page , but link to FAQs or other customer service resources first to encourage customers to use these channels for questions . <p> Make it easy for mobile users to call you by making your phone numbers clickable . You can do this using a telephone link ( use the international format ) : <p> &lt;a href= " tel : +1-555-867-5309 " &gt;Call 555.867.5309&lt;/a&gt; <p> Manage calls via a dedicated number for your store ( either a local number , or a toll-free number ) . There are a few tools that are really useful here : <p> Google Voice can let you register a local number and forward calls to this number to your cell phone , office phone , or elsewhere . <p> Grasshopper let 's you get a local or toll-free number and forward to different numbers at different times <p> Talkroute also let 's you get a local or toll-free number and forward to different numbers at different times <p> I 've used Grasshopper in the past but I 'm looking to switch to Talkroute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and call forwarding . <h> Is Phone Service Right For You ? <p> There 's no right answer for whether phone support is a good fit for your eCommerce business . <p> When your store is small and just starting out , the costs of offering phone support can be minimal in comparison to the benefits that you get , such as a better understanding of your customers . However , this is n't a hard and fast rule for every business , as the type of product you sell , average product cost , as well as your availability all factor into the phone support equation . Ultimately you 'll need to determine if phone support is right for you and your business . <p> If you do n't  choose to offer phone service or you want to start with a smaller time investment , you could look into using callbacks as a lower-risk way to chat with customers via phone . This let 's you take the customers information ( usually via a form on your site ) , and call back within a certain time period ( i.e. , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callbacks can help to ensure that you 're not in the middle of a task that 's interrupted by a customer call , and can still offer the benefits of talking to your customers to understand their needs . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 4 Comments <p> Awesome article and thanks for considering Talkroute as your virtual phone solution !

@@98138027 @2338027/ <p> You probably use ( or have heard of ) Gravity Forms . While its gained popularity as a form builder , Gravity Forms can actually be used as a standalone eCommerce solution for stores that only sell a limited number of products , and can even be used for donations ( or other user-defined pricing ) . If you do n't  need advanced order management or inventory tracking , Gravity Forms can provide an easy solution for creating purchasing forms . <p> I like it best for shops that sell a few simple products , or for shops that sell complex products that are purchased individually ( such as build-your-own computers ) , as you can have a build + purchase form on each product page . <p> All you 'll need to use Gravity Forms for eCommerce is the Gravity Forms developer license , which is regularly $199 ( though if you 're an avid reader , you know we have a 30% off coupon = ) . If you 'd like to use a third party add-on instead , you could use Gravity Forms + Stripe with any GF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So how long will this take you to set up ? If you 're familiar with basic Gravity Forms functionality , you can start using Gravity Forms for eCommerce in as little as 28 minutes by following these steps ( depending on how your site will be structured ) . <h> Step 1 : Accept Payments <p> Time to complete : 4 min <p> Before we get into configuration , let 's quickly discuss how you 'll be accepting payments via Gravity Forms . This is why you 'll need the developer license instead of a lower license tier , as integrations with payment gateways are only available for these licenses ( or a third party add-on for Stripe as stated above ) . Youll be able to choose from : <h> Step 2 : Basic Form Fields <p> Time to complete : 6 to 13 min <p> Before we decide how well structure our store and set up our form , we can create the form and begin to add basic fields . <p> There are some fields we know that well need to add to any form : name and address will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or phone may be necessary as well . You may also want to add a separate address field if you 'll ship to an address other than the billing address ( you 'll probably want to include a recipient name field if you do ) . We can add these fields to our form under " Advanced Fields " : <p> Gravity Forms Advanced Fields <p> Well also want to add a couple fields from the " Pricing Fields " list : <p> Gravity Forms Pricing Fields <p> Regardless of how your form is set up , you 'll need the " Total " and " Credit Card " forms to finish the checkout process , so we can add those now . You may want to also add the " Shipping " field and enter any shipping options ( i.e. , Ground , Expedited , etc ) and the associated fees ( if applicable ) . <p> Finally , well want to configure some of the settings for our form . Go to " Form Settings " . You 'll probably want to change the button text to something like " Place Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to change the default confirmation message under " Confirmations " to something like this : <p> Thanks ! Your order has been received and a receipt will be emailed shortly . <p> Finally , you may want to send a receipt via email . If you 'd like to do so , you can create a user notification by duplicating some of the admin notification and pulling in the email field . For example , you probably want to include customer details , the order details and total , and some info below these fields about contacting your store and return policies . <h> Step 3 : Tying Forms to Payments <p> Time to complete : 3 min <p> Now that we have our basic fields filled in , we can configure this form to work with Authorize.net . Go to Forms &gt; Authorize.net ( or your payment gateway ) , click " Add Form " , and select the form you 're tying to Authorize.net . We need to map our form fields to billing information so that Authorize.net has the information needed to validate our form . <p> Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can simply select which form fields belong to which Authorize.net field . You can also opt to send Authorize.net Receipts via email . <p> The Authorize.net menu is also where you 'll view your entries list and view individual entries ( you can also access them from the " Entries " menu ) . You can click on an order entry to see all customer details , add notes , and print orders from one screen . <p> Gravity Forms eCommerce Entry <p> Great ! Now we 've got a payment gateway connected to Gravity Forms , tied to our form , and we have a start on our form setup . We can proceed by adding the products well sell to our form . <h> Step 4 : Purchasing Structure <p> Time to complete : ? ? ? min ( estimated 10 min ) <p> Before we begin to create our purchasing forms , well need to decide how you want to structure your store . You can use Gravity Forms as a checkout page form , or you can use it as a purchasing form on each product page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , so it depends on which structure suits your store . <p> For example , if you sell only simple products or single purchases , you can probably create one purchasing form for your site . For example , this works great if you 're sending someone from a pricing table you can dynamically populate the product selected and the form is ready to go . <p> However , if you sell products with variations or options , you may need to create multiple forms . Typically , Gravity Forms is best for this if customers only purchase one product at a time . If theyd want to purchase multiple complex products in one sitting , you probably want to look at a different eCommerce solution . <p> Think about your workflow and what kind of products you sell . Think about how many products you sell . If you sell more complex products ( like build-your-own computers , which require options or add-ons ) , you probably want to create a purchasing form on each page for a one-page purchase . If you sell a couple simple products or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best . <p> This section is the wild card . If you have n't settled on Gravity Forms previously and already thought this out , you may need to sit down and plan out your site structure before we start creating forms . <h> Step 5 : Finish Your Form <p> Let 's give two examples here . In one example , I 'm going to pretend that I sell customizable products my customers will purchase directly from the product page , but I do n't  need a cart system . Let 's use 5k race registrations for this , but this type of form is great for any product that would be purchased by itself , and not with other products ( think customized computers , concert tickets , services , etc ) . <p> In the second example , I 'll assume that I sell one major product for which I 'd like to have a select field and checkout form . This is handy for shops with just a handful of products , as you can add all of these products on the same form . I 'm going to use a plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which example we start with , you may want to duplicate the form we 've started building rather than using it . This will keep that form as a starting point for more forms so you do n't  constantly have to keep adding name , credit card , and other fields . <p> Just remember to create a new Authorize.net form ( or change the one we 've already made to use the duplicated form instead ) for each purchasing form . <h> Example 1 : Product Page Purchasing <p> Time to complete : 9 ? ? ? min ( depends on number of forms ) <p> I 'm assuming you 've duplicated our basic form in each of these examples so that we can just start adding fields for our product . Your single-purchase form could look very different when compared to mine , but here are some basic tips . <p> First , use product fields for major aspects of your product ( I 'll use one for registration ) . Each major component of the " sale " ( in this case , a registration ) should use a product field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields if you need to gather more info ( I 'll do this for some of the racer information ) . <p> You can use " Quantity " fields that correspond to your product field . Ill use one here to update the number of registrations that should be processed . The thing I like best about quantity fields is that I can base conditional logic around them . In my example , I 'm going to add extra racer gender / tee shirt size fields when quantity is greater than 1 , greater than 2 , etc . <p> You can also add " Options " fields . These are also tied to product fields . Option fields can be added on to products with optional costs ( I think of them as " add-on " fields ) . In my example , I 'll use an option field to modify the registration I can add a cost if the racer would like to attend the barbecue after the race . This will also change based on quantity if multiple registrations are purchased , then multiple options will be included as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can check out my finished product page ( you may want to open this in a new tab ) : <p> One Page Purchase <p> There are far more options for product page purchasing that you can explore . The beauty of using Gravity Forms for this is that you can sell fairly complex products directly on your sales page , and add costs per item or option . <h> Example 2 : Checkout Page Form <p> Time to complete : 3 ? ? ? min <p> The best part about using a checkout page form is that you probably do n't  need to add many more fields . Well simply need a field for each product that well be selling . Ill only use one field here for Plugin License , which I 'll populate via URL ( well assume Im sending customers to this from a pricing table ) . However , if I want to sell a couple of small products and maybe some add-ons , I could add more fields . Again , we do n't  want to clutter this , and you could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a " Product " field to my form . Product fields have a few types ; since I 'm creating a product with a few versions , I 'll use a dropdown . here 's some helpful documentation on product field types if you have a different kind of product . <p> Adding a product <p> Notice that I 'm showing values and setting them manually . Well need this to pre-populate the field for the customer depending on which pricing table option is selected . Once I 've entered all versions of my product and the corresponding price , I can switch to the " Advanced " tab . <p> Here I 'll enable the ability to dynamically populate the form via URL . The basic structure for this is / ? parametername=value . As I 've set my parameter name to " licensetype " , I can now pass a license type into the form . I 'd use the URL of my checkout page , then append the license type . It will look something like this : <p> mystore.com/gfcheckout/ ? licensetype=business <p> If you have more fields populated dynamically , you can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't  want customers to be able to change their selection , you can opt to have this field accessible to the admin only instead of visible to everyone . <p> Now , my form will display my products , and the total will adjust depending on which option is selected . <p> Checkout Page example <h> Step 6 : Embed Your Form &amp; Start Selling <p> Time to complete : 2 ? ? ? min <p> Last , but not least ! Do n't  forget to add your forms to your pages if you 're using a checkout-style form , you probably want to use a new page for your checkout . If you 're allowing purchasing on a product page , you can simply embed your form on the relevant page(s) . <p> You 'll use the Gravity Forms shortcode ( like this : gravityform id= " 2 " ) , or you can use the " Add Form " button at the top of each post / page edit screen . <h> Conclusions <p> Since you may already be using Gravity Forms , leveraging your forms for eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for complex products that are typically purchased alone , as you can sell them easily and directly from the product page . <p> Its also a handy option for sites that only sell a few products , as you can create a checkout form with a tool that you probably have installed already . While this setup is not for stores that need a cart process , it makes a very handy option for sites that have a limited product offering and do n't  require inventory or order management within WordPress . <p> Want to check this out ?

Was considering using lists with columns ( i.e. , columns for Racer 1 , Racer 2 , etc , and using this for quantities of 2-4 , adding another list for 5-8 , etc ) , but this would be more confusing on the frontend for whoever is filling out the form they have to add their own rows to fill in what I 'm asking for . I 'd love to see something like a " repeater " field that gets added every time quantity ( or another field ) is increased . <p> Totally agree . I have been using Advanced custom fields which does this kind of thing nicely , but of course is not easy to integrate with gravity forms . <p> They do have their own front-end form filler , but that too is not as easy to implement .

I have a custom product that be ordered using gravity forms using manu conditional logic rules .

It sounds like you 'll need a full eCommerce solution here to be able to manage customers and build a customer area to do this . Since you 've already got your form created , I 'd recommend integrating with Easy Digital Downloads and the Gravity Forms Checkout add-on . <p> This will give you the flexibility of your ordering form with the eCommerce capabilities of EDD , such as customer accounts , customer areas , order statuses , etc . We 've got an article on using EDD Gravity Forms Checkout as well . <p> However I have a custom service to offer , it is based on forms , my service is publication of legal ads on official journals .

@@98138029 @2338029/ <h> All-in-one WordPress : WPEka Club <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Whenever you set up a new eCommerce site , you usually focus on the important pages that need to be created : shop , product , about us , and contact pages . However , there are are other pieces of information that should be addressed when you 're ready to launch your eCommerce site that typically get overlooked . <p> I recently launched a site that needed a Terms of Service page , as customers would be subscribing to this service and a TOS was needed to indicate what responsibilities the provider had . This page is super important to ensure that the site protects itself against expectations of what the service should do compared to what 's actually included . <p> For example , many WordPress plugin companies include in their terms of service that products are offered " as-is " with no guarantees that theyll be bug free or work in every environment . This protects the company , as its impossible to guarantee that software will always work for every site in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control ( hosting server environments , supported PHP versions , incompatible plugins or themes , etc . ) . <p> Most businesses ( not just software businesses ) should have a TOS policy to which customers agree by using the site or service to ensure that the business is protected when customers expect something different than what 's offered . However , setting up this page can be a bit of a pain when I did so , I had to find good templates ( which required a lot of time and reading ) and edit them as needed . <p> Sites will also usually want to have Privacy policies and perhaps policies for advertising and refunds , or other disclaimers . Since creating these pages is time-consuming , you may want to use ready-made templates . <p> There 's a plugin that can do this for you from WPEka club : WP Legal pages . It includes templates and can publish legal pages with one click . <h> WP Legal Pages <p> WP Legal Pages includes 17 different templates for Terms of Service , Privacy Policies , Affiliate policies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your WordPress admin , then publish these pages with one click . There are even considerations given to certain laws , such as the EU Cookie Law . <p> Creating these pages is also necessary to use certain services , such as Google Advertisements or ClickBank . The plugin creates these pages for you , and is offered as part of a WPEka Club membership . <h> WPEka Club <p> WPEka club is a theme and plugin club from Hummingbird Web Solutions . Theyd previously sold plugins and themes under several banners , but decided to consolidate them under one brand and offer all products to members . They were recently featured on WP Mayor if you 'd like to check out some more details there . <p> WPEka Club membership gives you access to ( currently ) 24 themes and 18 plugins .

@@98138030 @2338030/ <h> WordPress eCommerce Site Migrations Made Easy <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Adam Warner <p> Eric Hoanshelt <p> Editors Note : This post is crafted from my interview with Adam Warner , co-founder of FooPlugins and brand ambassador for the WP Valet , and Eric Hoanshelt , co-founder and CTO of the WP Valet . Adam is an internet addict and is passionate about web businesses that provide both solutions and empowerment for clients , while Eric is a migrations sorcerer and has carried out over 150 successful migrations , ranging from simple WordPress migrations to custom databases . <h> eCommerce Site Migrations Made Easy <p> Beka : I like to start things and finish them . Completing tasks and crossing them off my to-do list is what really motivates me I need to make sure that list is full of struck-through lines of my accomplishment . My interest in eCommerce seems weird to me in light of that preference , as eCommerce sites are constantly changed , updated , and improved , and are never " complete " . In an ideal world , we could research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never has issues . However , platforms change and some adapt faster than others . New plugins are also introduced to provide more competitive eCommerce solutions for business owners . <p> Why do we care about this ? If you want to make sure you have the best solution for your business , your work on your eCommerce site wont have a clean beginning and end its constantly improving . Sometimes that means that you switch from one platform to another as your business needs change and grow , and sometimes it means you move to better hosting or a site maintenance plan . You cant truly cross " Set up an eCommerce Site " off your list . However , some people leave that list item hanging because migrating between platforms or hosting providers seems like a daunting task . In this interview , well cover some points to consider when migrating your site to make sure your eCommerce solution is the best that it can be . <h> Points to Consider for eCommerce Site Migration <p> Beka : What data and information can be migrated between platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you migrate between cart systems , or do n't  understand the complexity involved in moving over order information , product images and data , and more . <p> Adam : Every piece of data that resides in your current WordPress install can be migrated . This can include : <p> posts <p> pages <p> products ( or any custom post type ) <p> plugins ( and their specific settings ) <p> and any custom meta data associated with the above types of content <p> Beka : The important thing here is that information must be stored within WordPress . For example , if your customer data is n't stored in WordPress user accounts , then moving that data will not be possible without the cooperation of the service storing that data ( for example , moving customers from Cart66 Cloud , which uses its own customer management system you 'd need them to help with that data ) . <p> What about some trickier items , like product data ? Since the way this is handled is different in many platforms , it can pose a problem for those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really depends on what your new system is . This will let you know how to store that data into the database . I always recommend that you create a product in your new system with fake data but in the format you want . Then , check out the database to see how it is all being stored and connected . From there , its just simply writing either a MySQL function or a PHP function to get the data moved over properly so that formatting is consistent . <p> Beka : When do importer plugins work well , and when is a more hands-on approach needed ? <p> Adam : It really depends on what is meant by " importer plugins " . Importer plugins like the WordPress default importer or Tumblr importers only migrate your content . This does not include your theme files or plugins and their settings . It also does n't  account for any custom development work that may have been done on your site . <p> If were talking about migration tools like BackupBuddy or WP Migrate DB Pro , they do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight forward would be that you do not have anything custom and you know all your plugins built with top quality code . <p> An important thing to keep in mind is if you 're moving to a Managed WordPress Hosting environment like WP Engine or Pressable , they have security features in place that limit the usage of certain PHP functions that are required in plugins like BackupBuddy and the like . <p> Beka : More specifically , what about product importers or CSV importers intended to move store information ? What are their limitations ? <p> Eric : BLAH.CSV importers cause a lot of headache ! They can be life savers from time to time , but its all based on whether the export process will be successful or not . If the export process does n't  properly escape commas , for example , then the import will get messed up . Also , large CSVs with thousands of products are hard to import . I would always look to get the data out by using XML instead . You can use the WordPress exporter to export the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into WordPress if that is how your current cart is setup . <p> Really , these solutions can sometimes work well , but there are times that they do n't  , and you 'll have to dig into the issue manually , and can end up having to do even more work to get everything transferred properly . <p> Beka : What 's commonly overlooked in a migration ? <p> Adam : The debugging process . Unfortunately , in our work at WP Valet , we find that people assume that because their site use to work on their old hosting , it should work exactly the same on their new hosting server . This is akin to putting a brand new 2014 Ford engine in a 1973 Volkswagen Bus . Its possible , but not without some detailed work getting things to run smoothly together . <p> The WordPress core software and individual plugins rely on specific server settings , server locations , and other factors that can kill a sites functionality ( or severely limit it ) when moved from one server to another . These items need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to fix them . In other words , hoses , wires and available hood space are n't  likely to be exactly the same so inevitably you 'll will need to do some tweaking . <p> Beka : What are some general tools or tricks that are most helpful in a migration ? <p> Adam : Experience is our most valuable tool . When performing site migrations , it 's important to rely on someone that has experienced the drama and stress of failed migrations , learned from them , and who have the internal processes in place to achieve repeatable successes . The experience of knowing what types of issues could arise and knowing what to do when they happen , is what has allowed us to grow our business and to create the partnerships we have with industry-leading hosts . <p> Another tool that we 've relied on and have learned much from is the Database Search and Replace Script by the fine folks at interconnect/it . This tool can be your best friend or worst enemy . This script will do complete search and replaces of your WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy of many do-it-yourselfers in the past , myself included . <p> In short , developers use serialization to store data in a more efficient manner . The data that is stored in serialized arrays relies on the text length . If you exported your database and did a simple search / replace of text of different lengths ( like changing from the domain myreallyawesomesite.com to mysite.com ) , there 's going to be a problem . If any of the data within that site was stored in serialized arrays , you would simply lose that data . <p> When I said I speak from experience , here 's what I meant . Some years ago I was moving a WordPress Multisite installation that had 8 sites in total . Certainly not much for a Multisite install . However , each one of these sites had over 150 widgets , each with a custom table generated from a plugin containing dozens of rows . That 's over 1,200 widgets . Guess what happened when I did a simple search and replace without accounting for serialized data ? You guessed itPANIC as all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was smart enough to have backups and was able to learn why it happened and how to do it right quickly enough to get the project completed on time . <p> Beka : What risk is involved and how do you mitigate it ? <p> Adam : The risk as I indicated above , is the catastrophic loss of data . But let me phrase that in a way that we can all understand a bit more personally . Imagine you 've spent years writing blog posts , building your site and its traffic ( and most likely , your livelihood ) . Whether that 's a traditional blog or one specifically for marketing your products , communicating with your customers , tutorials , photography portfolios , etc. , its a representative of huge chunks of your valuable time . If a migration is done incorrectly , you could lose hundreds or even thousands of pages of your website . Broken . In an instant . Poof ! <p> Every single day we are dealing with precious data for our customers and we fully understand the risks of losing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create and adhere to processes that mitigate that risk . Before we touch anything , we run backups of the data we are going to move to a secure S3 environment and that backup remains there for 30 days after completion of the migration and of the project itself . <h> Closing Notes <p> Migrating information between different cart systems or hosting providers can be tricky and vital aspects are frequently overlooked or go wrong . However , that does n't  mean you should neglect to improve your business structure when possible if it can improve your bottom line . Learning from the experiences of others or getting help can greatly reduce the friction present in this process and is a valuable investment in your own sanity . For example , WP Engine recommends Erics company , the WP Valet , to do hosting migrations in order to ensure that the process is as smooth as possible . <p> Thanks so much to Eric and Adam for their help and insights ! <h> More eCommerce Site Migration Resources <p> Here are some other resources you may be interested in checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

There are a lot of ways to improve eCommerce conversions in general , so well go through some slight changes you can make to get the most out of this holiday shopping season . <p> First , I hope you 've been paying attention to our series of articles on launching ( or rethinking ) your site and its setup . The most important thing you can do to improve eCommerce conversions and ensure that customers purchase from you is make sure that there 's no hiccups in the shopping process . While its probably too late in the season to change hosting services before you get hit with a lot of shoppers ( unless , hey , you love to take risks like base jumping without a parachute or something ) , you can make sure that your site is prepared to handle increased traffic and sales volume , and ready to convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valid SSL ? If new customers visit your site , you do n't  want to lose conversions because trust is n't high enough . Purchasing an OV or EV SSL certificate takes a couple of days and only $100-$150 . You should also consider ensuring that email marketing campaigns are prepped . If you have an email list already , consider sending out some Cyber Monday email promotions ( if you use MailChimp , you can split test them for performance with a small group first to maximize conversions when you include the entire list ) . <p> If you have a wishlist plugin/extension , invite customers to add items to their carts / lists in preparation for sales . Theyd probably wait until then to buy anyway , but this way you have them engaged and excited . Do n't  forget to send a reminder email so that they return to complete the purchase . If you do n't  already have an email list , that 's okay ! Collecting emails during checkout can be useful , as you can send out last-minute offers before the holidays ( or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases from you before the season ends . <h> Got Some Other Tips to Improve eCommerce Conversions ? <p> A lot of other eCommerce sites have posted holiday tips , so well summarize a few of the good ones , and add some that are WordPress-specific to help you boost conversions from holiday shoppers . <h> General Tips <p> Most general tips for the holiday season remind you to make sure inventory is stocked and ready to go . Chances are you 've already done this , but one thing Ive seen people forget it to stock up on shipping supplies and other items that I call " support inventory " . Do n't  forget that you need enough stuff to sell , but that you also need to get it to the customer ! Looking for other general tips like this ? Check this Practical eCommerce article out . <p> If you can , provide delivery estimates and faster shipping options . If people find that they do n't  know if their gift will arrive in time , theyll probably buy somewhere else . <p> If you can offer free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the WordPress section below , but if you can set minimum price limits for free shipping , or increase product prices to offer free shipping across the board , do it . WooCommerce , WPeC , EDD , and Jigoshop all allow you to bulk edit product prices , so you can increase prices to make up for shipping easily ( though you probably wont need to worry about this with EDD = ) I know some people do n't  like offering free shipping if you have to inflate product price , so I 'd prefer to set cart minimums if possible . <p> Order Accuracy is important . At this time of year , everyone is on a deadline and cant afford to have orders screwed up . Offering a guarantee of order accuracy reduces barriers to purchase . <h> WordPress Tips <p> Let 's go back to the free shipping idea . Everyone else will be offering it , and you can too without hurting your bottom line . First , you can increase all product prices ( regular and sale ) by a small margin to cover shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you use Exchange , you 'll have to use this method , as free shipping is set per product and not for the entire store . If you 'd prefer to set a minimum purchase limit for free shipping instead of increasing prices , you can also increase your average order value . Either approach can help you convert without eating a lot of costs . Using the second method usually requires changes to your shipping settings or the creation of a coupon that provides free shipping with minimum amount , and can be done with most platforms . You can display a banner with the free shipping coupon to advertise the order minimum . For example , you can achieve this in WooCommerce under the Shipping Settings : <p> Enabling Free Shipping for Order Minimums in WooCommerce <p> Now let 's talk about increasing Average Order Value . One way to do this is to offer amount or quantity discounts based on items or total cart value . Increasing value for a single order is more effective than obtaining new customers and shipping to different places , so increasing average order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick . Here are some tips for doing this with different plugins : <p> Using WooCommerce ? Coupons can be configured to offer a discount for an order if a cart total is above a certain amount with rules for exclusions , etc . If you want to offer quantity discounts , the Dynamic Pricing extension will be helpful , as you can set tiered pricing levels ( and can set price by membership as well ) . <p> Using EDD ? Discount codes can be configured similar to WooCommerce to offer a discount for an order if a cart total is above a certain amount . You can also create quantity discounts using the Volume Discounts add-on . <p> Cart66 also allows you to create cart discounts for both amounts and quantities , and you can set minimum amounts/quantities for coupon usage from your Cart66 Cloud dashboard . <p> WPeC allows you to set quantity discounts from the product editor for a single product , but not for any cart quantity . There 's a relatively new plugin called Pricing Deals for WPeC that seems to have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jigoshop discount rules are similar to WooCommerce coupons can be configured to offer a discount for an order if a cart total is above a certain amount with rules for exclusions , etc . <p> Shopp has really flexible coupon rules with conditional logic ( similar to Gravity Forms ) that allow you to set both amount and quantity discounts for the cart . <p> Creating Coupon Rules with Shopp <p> eCommerce conversions can also be improved by applying to a scarcity mentality . Make sure you display stock limits if your plugin allows it , but you can also try setting time limits on coupons or sales to increase buyer urgency . <p> Using WooCommerce , you can achieve this by using the Cart Notices extension , which allows you to display the price needed to get free shipping or the deadline to purchase before a sale ends/shipping today ends . You can also display notices about discounts with Dynamic Pricing using the Conditional Content extension . <p> Jigoshop let 's you do something similar to Groupon with the Limited Time Deals extension . However , this displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy for a discount / fast shipping . <p> How else can you increase order value ? Make sure you 're taking advantage of cross-sells and upsells , and that you 've kept them up-to-date in your product catalog or plugin . <p> In WooCommerce , you can set other products to cross-sell or upsell under " Product Data " . If you leave this blank , products from same tag/category will be displayed as cross-sells ( enable this under your settings ) . You can cross-sell items in a shopping cart using the Cart Add-ons extension . <p> You can create cross-sells and upsells in Easy Digital Downloads via the EDD Cross-sells and Upsells add-on , which let 's you cross-sell related products at checkout , or upsell on the product pages . <p> WPeC has a few related products add-ons , but nothing that allows you to customize cross-sells or upsells that I could find . <p> Jigoshop also has an extension for upsells and cross-sells that allows you to upsell on product pages or cross-sell in the checkout process . <p> How else can you increase value for customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can increase the chance that customers will purchase from you , even if your prices are slightly higher than a competitor . Customers are also less likely to switch to a different store if theyve already accrued loyalty points with you ( leverage loss aversion ! ) . <p> WooCommerce offers the WooCommerce Points and Rewards , which helps you to create a store loyalty program . You can assign both points earned for purchases , and point redemption value . <p> Last , you can try to recover sales . Cart abandonment is something were all used to , as some customers add items just to check out total costs and leave . However , re-engaging those customers with notifications or emails could result in easy conversions . <p> WooCommerce has an extension called Cart Reports that allows you to see which customers have abandoned their carts so that you can email them to re-engage them . I 've found that including a token offer , such as a 5% off coupon , helps with this . Just do n't  do it all the time or people expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-on that automates this process a bit for you called Sales Recovery , which allows you to automatically send re-engagement emails to customers whove abandoned their purchases and optionally include discounts to encourage order completion . <p> Have some tips of your own or great plugins for improving conversions ?

@@98138033 @2338033/ <h> Value Metrics for New Store : Acquire New Customers <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In our ongoing series about value metrics for new eCommerce stores , today well take a look at 3 metrics related to acquiring new customers . <h> Metrics for acquiring new customers : Marketing campaign metrics <p> As you run different marketing campaigns for your store , you should be familiar with the below three metrics . These metrics are commonly used to determine whether your campaigns are successful , and predict the profitability of your store as it grows . <h> Customer acquisition cost <p> One of the critical numbers to consider is going to be the customer acquisition cost . Simply put , this is the cost to convert one potential visitor into a paying customer . Ideally , this cost should become lower as your store grows and your brand becomes more visible . The less it costs to acquire more customers , the higher your profit will be . <p> Let 's take an example . Say you run a Twitter ad campaign for $1,000 for 6 months . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying customers . Then , your customer acquisition cost is $100 . <p> here 's where this cost becomes critical . In the above example , let 's say your average order value is $150 and your average cost of goods is $50 , then your gross profit will be $150 $50 = $100 . But , if this customer is funnelled through your Twitter campaign , then youve only broken even on that sale . <p> In this way , you can measure the degree of success from different marketing campaigns . More importantly , you should strive to lower your customer acquisition cost as this can greatly affect your bottom line , and determine the scalability of your business . <h> Click-through rate <p> Whether you run pay-per-click ads ( such as through Google AdWords ) , or banner ads on your own or third-party sites , you can measure the success of these campaigns by looking at the click-through rate . <p> Click-through rate = number of clicks / number of impressions <p> The click-through rate tells you how appealing the ad/banner is , by comparing the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who click on it . A higher click-through rate means that your campaign is useful and relevant to potential customers . <p> Each ad or banner campaign will have its own click-through rate . The click-through rate tells you how many visitors become potential leads . The higher this number is , the more chances that a lead can be converted to a paying customer . <h> Revenue-per-click <p> The last metric you can use to evaluate the success of your campaigns is revenue-per-click . This number relates how many potential leads end up becoming paying customers . <p> Revenue-per-click = revenue from campaign / clicks from the campaign <p> Over a set period , you can look at how much revenue was generated from people who clicked on a marketing campaign . This can help you determine how whether you are over-paying for a certain ad campaign and whether you make any money from it based on the cost-per-click of the campaign . <h> Metrics for acquiring new customers : How to improve these metrics <h> 1 . Target specific audience <p> As you initiate marketing campaigns online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least objections to purchasing your products . Seek out targeted regions , websites , blogs , etc. for online ads and banners where you are most likely to find sales . <p> Even if you sell something that a large variety of people would be interested in buying , select a smaller subset of people you can market to . This will help lower your customer acquisition cost as your brand recognition grows . In addition , more people are likely to click through and purchase your products . <h> 2 . Keyword planning <p> Part of targeting specific audiences is keyword planning . You can use Googles Keyword Planner tool to see how different keywords measure in terms of popularity for specific audiences . You can use this tool before you set up ad campaigns to ensure you get the most from your ad dollars . <h> 3 . Referrals <p> Implement a referral program for your store to encourage existing customers to share your products with their friends . A common example of this is to reward customers whenever somebody uses a referral link they shared ( think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ads they may see online . <h> 4 . Repeat customers <p> In addition to referrals for new customers , you can target repeat customers by providing incentive for people to continue shopping on your store over time . You can use lifecycle emails to stay in touch with customers , and provide them with promotions or exclusive content . This will help increase the lifetime customer value and have a higher click through since these customers already have a transactional experience with your store . <h> 5 . Social sharing <p> Make it easy for customers to share your products on social sites . Similar to referrals , people usually trust other people than a brand that 's new to them . You can piggy-back on this trust by encouraging people to share your site or products with their friends or followers . <h> Metrics for acquiring new customers : Plugins <p> There are a number of plugins that you can use to help lower your customer acquisition cost , and increase your click-through rate and revenue-per-click . <h> Social Login <p> Use the WooCommerce Social Login or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable customers to login to your store through their social information . This can take away the hassle of creating an additional profile , and make it easy for customers to share on these networks . <h> Automate engagement <p> Keep in touch with customers based on different interactions they 've had with your store . For example , email customers who added items to their cart but never finished the purchase , send thank you emails to customers after they purchase , and more . You can automate these interactions by using the AutomateWoo plugin for WooCommerce , and MailChimp extension for EDD to automate emails . <p> This can help you get a better idea about revenue streams and funnels . You can use this information to more accurately calculate the three metrics regarding new customers . <h> Metrics for acquiring new customers : Summary <p> The cost of customer acquisition can make or break a new business . This is the metric that determines whether your store can become more profitable as you scale , and can help drive your marketing strategy as you grow . Closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revenue per click . These two metrics determine how well your marketing campaigns do for converting visitors into paying customers . <p> There are a number of ways to improve these metrics . The main one is to target specific audiences for your products . For example , if you are selling online college preparation courses , then your target audience may be high school students or parents of such students . If you put up ads on blogs for new parents , chances are that your click-through rate and revenue-per-click are going to be low , and the cost of acquiring a customer will be high . Instead , if you are advertising through a high school ads portal or through an email campaign to parents with high school children , your campaign will be a lot more successful . <p> How do you improve your customer acquisition cost ? Are there ad campaign tips that worked really well for you ? Please tell us in the comments .

These people want help setting up an online store , so I try to point them in the right direction if I can and if I have time . <p> However , there are many times that I 'll suggest a premium plugin option that will do what they need . Sometimes , people thank me for the help at this point , but sometimes people tell me that the plugin is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think its a rip-off so they cant buy it right now . Isnt there a free option ? Or can they just download it ? <p> People , hold the phone . The most expensive plugin I can think of off the top of my head is probably $249 . Seriously , you want to run a business without making a few hundred dollar investment ? <p> I know you may have heard this before . I know its unpopular of me to say . I know that budgets are sensitive , and that obviously you do n't  want to spend more than necessary . I get that you probably have to buy a lot of plugins , and $29 here or $49 there adds up , and you have to pay for hosting and domains and SSL certificates . <p> Your site costs can add up to thousands of dollars .

I mean , you 're getting the same thing , right ? <p> Aside from the fact that if you want updates to your software you should support them ( though that 's a post for another day ) , no . Its not the same . You 're not only putting your business at risk and really , you do n't  think your business is worth a $49 investment ? ! but you could be compromising your customers .

Do you really want backdoors in the plugins you use for payment processing ? For gathering personally identifying information from your customers ? <p> For example , I once had someone say they could n't afford WooCommerce Subscriptions . If you cant afford $199 , you probably do n't  have enough customers yet . Manually create renewal orders for each and customers can log in to pay each month . This is more work for you and you may lose renewals , but you can then purchase the extension to automate this once your revenue supports it .

Favorites <p> Favorites integrates with EDD Wishlists , so its not a standalone plugin . While Wishlists requires a customers to select a list to which they can add a product , Favorites is meant to make this process a bit more streamlined . Rather than using Wishlists to create different lists , favorites can be used for a one-click list addition . Its sort of like allowing your customers to bookmark their favorite products . <h> 5 . EDD VAT Calculator <p> If you use Easy Digital Downloads and Stripe as your payment processor , this extension can help you calculate and invoice the appropriate VAT . This is helpful for any retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a Quaderno.io account , and Quaderno will automatically create and send invoices for Stripe payments to help you be compliant with these regulations . <p> There 's also a Taxamo integration coming via the add-on store as well that could be used instead . <h> 6 .

Add to Cart Redirect <p> Easy Digital Downloads allows you to determine whether or not customers should be directed to checkout after adding an item to the cart , but this setting is global ( for the entire store ) .

You can even use the strategy above to pre-fill the cart with new or on-sale products to which the discount applies , making the shopping ( and purchasing ! ) process easier . <p> When you create the coupon for your email list , this time you can use any URL you want the URL does n't  have to exist on your site . Something like http : **31;882;TOOLONG typically works well to signify this is a coupon . <p> However , you should note one thing : since this URL does not exist on your site , you must set a redirect for the coupon . Without this , email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great way to start off the shopping experience . <h> Offer Personalized Coupons <p> On a final note , you can create personalized URLs for coupons very easily with WooCommerce URL coupons . <p> In every example we 've shown so far , we 've added a trailing slash to our coupons URL . This ensures that only that URL will apply the coupon . <p> However , URL Coupons will let us use a URL without a trailing slash as a generic coupon URL kind of like a " wildcard " URL . This can let you personalize your coupon links for customers when including them in emails . <p> here 's an example : **26;915;TOOLONG will only work if that exact URL is visited . If we remove the trailing slash **25;943;TOOLONG now this will work for **30;970;TOOLONG , **30;1002;TOOLONG or any other URL that begins this way . <p> When you send emails to your customers , you can leverage this to insert their names , personalizing the email and coupon to increase open and click rates . <p> Typically email marketing providers have " merge " tags to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if you 've been collecting them and including them in your list ) . For example , MailChimp can let you do this with the *FNAME* merge tag if you 've been collecting first names . <p> You can personalize the call to action for the discount URL , and could even personalize the URL if you 're showing it as a plain link to customers . <p> For generic URL coupons like the ones we 've outlined in this section and the ones above , its also a great idea to limit their usage per user so that customers cant reuse them over and over . <h> Using Automatic Discounts as Rewards <p> Automatically applying discounts for customers can save them from having to remember or copy and paste discount codes in the middle of the shopping process . It also starts the shopping and browsing process for them , inviting them to continue shopping or to purchase knowing that they already have a discount ( and maybe a product in the cart ) . <p> Automatic discounts are a great way to reward holiday shoppers for visting , reading your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stretch gift budgets and encourages them to spend with your store during the holiday season . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98138041 @2338041/ <h> Gravity Forms : The Ultimate WordPress Form Builder <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> If you ask which WordPress plugins are essential for any site , you 'll get some varied answers , but many recommendations center around Jetpack , WordPress SEO , and others . For many sites , I 'd contend that a quality WordPress form builder is essential as well . There are always a few names thrown into this ring : Contact Form 7 , Gravity Forms , Formidable Pro , Ninja Forms , and the list goes on . A lot of people like Contact Form 7 since the core plugin is free . However , the one we select for all of our projects is Gravity Forms , as it has some features that make it great for eCommerce sites and is easy to work with . <p> Note : Check out our special offers page for our exclusive Gravity Forms coupon code and other special offers . <p> Almost every site will need forms at some point , whether just for contact information , email signups , or surveys . Many themes include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  provide as much information as your business may need . So what makes Gravity Forms special ? It provides multiple options for generic form submissions and is easy to use , but can also be used for almost any kind of information submission from users ( such as surveys , polling , and quizzes ) . <p> Gravity Forms also has an extensive Add-on Offering that greatly expands the possible uses for the plugin . However , access to add-ons is dependent upon the license you purchase . Personal licenses are $39 , but to get access to add-ons , you 'll need a business license at $99 or a developer license ( for access to all add-ons ) at $199 . Pricing provides access to a year worth of updates and support . You can continue using the plugin indefinitely , but will need to renew each year for ongoing updates and support ( at discounted pricing ) . <p> So what do you get in this package , and why recommend it ? Gravity Forms handles basic form functionality so well , but offers a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and add-ons ) that makes it a powerful and flexible plugin . <p> First of all , a form builder should be able to do simple contact and support forms . Well get to some of the more advanced Gravity Forms features later , but will go through some of the basic things that Gravity Forms does very well . <p> Gravity Forms provides several basic forms fields that most forms will take advantage of . This in itself is n't very exciting , but the fact that you can choose when to display each field , or pre-populate each field , is pretty cool . Standard fields include single line or paragraph inputs , as well as checkboxes , drop downs , and multi-selects . <p> Gravity Forms Fields <p> Frontend : Some Standard Fields <p> The ability to use several different fields allows you to create any contact or support form needed for your business . You can segment requests to ensure that the needed information is included , and can even forward form submissions to different email addresses based on how fields are completed by the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields will also be necessary for basic forms , and allow you to capture details such as names , emails , addresses , and to use a CAPTCHA to prevent spam ( there 's an anti-spam honeypot alternative under " Form Settings " if you do n't  want to sign up for a reCAPTCHA account ) . You can also allow file uploads for project details or other submissions . Want to tweak the way a field looks ? You can use the Gravity Forms CSS classes under the advanced field settings to do so . <p> Conditional Logic <p> The advanced field settings is also where some of the magic happens in creating advanced forms . Gravity Forms allows you to use conditional logic , which changes when fields are displayed or hidden ( you can do this for your " submit " button as well ! ) . This is the best way I 've found to create forms that respond to user input , and I also use these fields to route emails to the appropriate team member . <p> Conditional logic allows you to show or hide fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can show or hide fields based on a selected input , using greater than / less than logic , or based on what words or values fields contain . This kind of flexibility let 's you use your forms in almost any way you can imagine . <p> Advanced options also allow you to pre-populate form fields using parameter names that you 've set . For example , if the first option in your form is the type of contact request ( for example , " support " or " questions " ) , you can name this parameter something like formtype , then pre-populate that form using shortcodes , hooks , or queries in URLs ( i.e. , mystore.com/contact/ ? formtype=support ) . This way , you can direct customers to the appropriate form from emails , pages , or other sources . One way Ive seen this used is to select the appropriate quiz form by pre-populating a hidden field , which used the conditional logic to show / hide some questions . <p> Side Note : As a former teacher , the ability to differentiate quizzes using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send each user the link to the appropriate quiz and have questions dynamically displayed for that user or group of users . I 'd love to hear feedback from anyone that uses Gravity Forms for online courses if you 're out there ! <p> Finally , once your form has been created , you 'll need to choose where to put it . You can insert forms into any post , page , or custom post type . You can also display simple forms using the Gravity Forms widget . <p> Inserting forms with Gravity Forms <p> Any eCommerce store should have basic contact or support forms for customers to ask questions or get in touch about issues with products , and Gravity Forms gives you the flexibility to create forms that respond to any business type . However , this only scratches the surface of the ways to use Gravity Forms for your eCommerce site . <p> Nows where we get to some cool uses . Part of selling is removing every barrier to purchase possible . Effective communication and the ability for customers to ask questions can make the difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I typically use Gravity Forms for pre-sales questions . You can a form with typical pre-sales questions and contact info , then create a hidden field with a default value as the page / post title so that you know which page the form is submitted from to respond appropriately . <p> Since the hidden form will tell you where the contact request is coming from , you can embed the same pre-sales form on all of your product pages to save you the trouble of creating forms for each product or forcing customers to go to another page to ask questions . You can embed this form on all product pages by modifying your theme templates . For example , I 've put it in a new product tab when using WooCommerce . <p> Hidden Fields <p> Want to create a portfolio and give out quotes instead of the ability to shop online ? Gravity Forms does a great job for this . Most eCommerce plugins have the ability to remove all add-to-cart functionality if you just want to display a catalog to users . Using the same idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that allows customers to request a quote for an item rather than adding it to the cart and checking out . You can set the default value for the hidden field to the page title or I 'd in the same way so that you send a proper quote and can use the same form for all items in the catalog . <p> You can also use Gravity Forms on your product pages for products that require personalization or customization . Think about ordering a computer you 'll need to select which processor you want , what hard drive , how much RAM , and so on . You could do all of that by embedding one Gravity Form with conditional logic for your products . Integrations with Gravity Forms are available for WooCommerce , Cart66 , and Jigoshop . However , Gravity Forms could also integrate with other eCommerce carts if you 're willing to pay a developer to help out with the integration . <p> Gravity Forms Pricing Fields <p> You could also use Gravity Forms for personalized items without an integration , but wont be able to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . For example , forms for engraving or customization could be emailed to customers after an order is placed , and you could pre-populate a hidden field with the order number to ensure that the order is linked to the correct form . <p> For simple stores , Gravity Forms could actually be the stand-alone eCommerce solution . There are add-ons available for Authorize.net , PayPal , and Freshbooks for invoicing or credit card processing . There 's also a free add-on available to integrate Stripe with Gravity Forms . Youd have to create your own product pages and embed forms on each page , but this could be a great solution for people that already use the extension and want to sell a few small products . Note that the developer license is necessary to use the payment processing add-ons . <p> Quiz Field <p> Do you run a membership site , or offer courses to members or users ? Gravity Forms has a great Quiz Add-on that you could use a checkpoint for each unit or lesson in your courses . You could mix in free-response questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multiple choice question and answer , along with an explanation of why the answer is the correct one . <p> Want to use Gravity Forms with the MailChimp add-on for more effective communication with your customer ? Check out this article from Chris Lema that explains how he used Gravity Forms and MailChimp to segment readers into groups in MailChimp to make sure that readers get the information they want and no more to improve retention on email lists . You can offer customers the option to opt-in to information and emails they want , such as special offers , store updates , and more . This way , customers get only the communications they actually want so that they do n't  unsubscribe entirely , and you can offer the most effective communication possible . <p> Gravity Forms offers the flexibility to create responsive contact and support forms , but does so much more than that . Create as many forms as needed to provide the opportunity for pre-sales questions , quotes , and other information requests . Use Gravity Forms to offer product customizations , or even use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products that require customizations . Create quizzes for membership sites , use the survey add-on to conduct customer happiness surveys , or take polls to see which products customers love most and display them to new visitors . <p> As is the case with many great plugins , the potential uses for Gravity Forms are limited only to what you can come up with . Its helped me improve communication with customers and help clients display product customization options , and I think of new ways to use it every day . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Great article .

Were starting a new section called " Ask Sell with WP " just for you ! <p> Many of you have emailed us with questions while comparing different services , or simply want more information on a plugin or platform . Weve gotten some repeat questions , so well be posting questions that would be relevant to everyone . You can filter these questions using the " Ask Us " link on the navigation menu , or clicking the " Ask Sell with WP " category in the post meta below the title . <p> I have read your MemberMouse review and I could n't agree more ! It is a great system . I was wondering if you could offer your advice ? <p> One problem I have is that we also sell physical goods with our memberships . Do you think it is possible to have WooCommerce installed as well as MemberMouse ? Do you think MemberMouses capabilities for shipping physical products is worth exploring as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise . <p> Ideally our members could log in and view purchases with one login . <p> Hi Rob , thanks for getting in touch ! This is a pretty interesting question . <p> If you only have 20 products available for purchase , I 'd probably just use MemberMouses capabilities for selling those items . While I think WooCommerce is great , if you want customers to be able to use one login to view purchases and their membership content , then it will have to be tied to MemberMouse . Both WooCommerce and MemberMouse use WordPress user roles , but one user ca n't have two different roles ( i.e. , a " customer " role for WooCommerce and a " subscriber " role for MemberMouse ) . <p> With that in mind , it would probably be frustrating for customers to have to use two different logins for the membership side of the site and the store side , as well as two different checkout processes . Theyd also have to re-save payment details , etc . Since MemberMouse makes purchasing so easy with saved payment methods and one-click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my physical products if I were in your shoes . <p> Selling physical products with MemberMouse is n't ideal , but if the membership part of the site is where you 're generating most of your revenue , its worth the slight inconvenience . The benefit you do get from this though is that you can offer some products only to members if you want to have " exclusive " merchandise , plus the ease in having one customer account with payment details already saved . <p> Hope that helps ! <p> UPDATE : Another option that I did n't  mention at first is the ability to use a push notification system with MemberMouse ( see more here ) to send an email to a 3rd party fulfillment provider ( i.e. , a nutritional supplement manufacturer or a drop-shipper ) . This neatly ties shipping into the system . You can also mitigate the need for complex shipping options within the plugin itself ( such as integrations for real-time rates or weight-based shipping ) and simplify pricing by building shipping costs into the membership cost . <p> You 'll lack the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products ) , but will be able to easily offer physical products alongside of your membership content . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138044 @2338044/ <p> Pop-ups have become increasingly popular with many major brands to grow their conversion rate .

@@98138047 @2338047/ <h> Increasing Sales using a WooCommerce List View <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is a guest post by Katie Keith from Barn2 Media . Katie is the operations manager for Barn2 , where she 's focused on giving top-notch advice on how to get the most out of WordPress based on her extensive experience with WordPress &amp; web design . <p> With average eCommerce conversion rates at just 1.33% , there are plenty of opportunities for WooCommerce store owners to increase sales . Page layout has a big impact on customer experience and can make or break an eCommerce site . A WooCommerce list view is an easy way to improve your store layout and quickly direct customers to the products they 're looking for . This has the potential to increase conversion rates and ultimately your sales . <h> What is a WooCommerce List View ? <p> A WooCommerce list view is an alternative way to present your products . <p> Most WooCommerce stores have a fairly traditional page layout 3 or 4 products per row with large featured image , the price , add to cart button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small stores with just a few products . However , if you have many products , then this layout can make it time-consuming for customers to find what they 're looking for . WooCommerce filter widgets are useful to narrow down the selection , but you simply cant see many products on the page at the same time . <p> In contrast , a WooCommerce list view displays products in a more space-saving format . Products are displayed in a sortable grid or table , with structured information such as name , price , category and possibly add to cart buttons . Customers might buy directly from the product list , or they might click through to the single product page . <h> Benefits of a Product List View <p> With a WooCommerce list view , each product takes up significantly less space than a typical store layout . Customers can see many more products at a time , allowing them to make direct comparisons and quickly make buying decisions . They can instantly search the product list by sorting the table , entering a keyword or using product filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products they 're looking for , listing more products per page will help them spot other products they like . This is similar to the " Related Products " commonly displayed at the bottom of the single product page and cart on WooCommerce sites . <p> However , unlike related products , a list view presents lots of products in the same place . Customers will naturally skim read through the list and see what else you have to offer . Hopefully , they will see something else they like but werent actively looking for , increasing the average order value from your store . This is less likely to happen with traditional product layouts as fewer products are visible at a time . <p> A list view of WooCommerce products does n't  have to include your entire inventory . You could list products by category , tag or something else ( e.g. custom taxonomy ) . Perhaps youd like to list your most popular / best-selling products in a grid . You could use traditional category layouts for your retail products and a list view for your WooCommerce wholesale area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the point is that they present products in a compact grid-style layout . This instantly directs customers to the products they want , making them less likely to leave your store and look elsewhere . <h> Which WooCommerce Stores Need a List or Grid View ? <p> I 'll say it now : a WooCommerce list view is n't for everyone . To decide whether to display your products in a list or grid , you need to think about your customers and the type of products you 're selling . <p> A product list view is ideal for WooCommerce stores where customers decide to buy based on information rather than pictures . You can include product images in the list , but they 're typically smaller than traditional store layouts . A list view prioritizes product data and the number of products per page . This can increase sales for WooCommerce stores where customers want to view lots of products at once and make quick buying decisions . For example : <p> Product directory of books or CDs . Customers want to view information about each product and see what 's available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce list views for this use case is that you can embed audio clips or video directly into the list . ) <p> Online food ordering system for a restaurant , with separate lists of the menu items in each category ( e.g. starters , main courses etc . ) . Customers ordering food online want to see everything on a single page , just like a printed menu . <p> WooCommerce wholesale store where trade users buy the same products on a regular basis . They already know which products they need , so they do n't  want to click through to a separate screen for each product . <h> Which Stores Wont Benefit from a WooCommerce List View ? <p> If you 're selling something visual , such as clothing or photography , then your store is better off with a standard WooCommerce layout . For these sort of products , customers need big pictures to choose the products they want . A WooCommerce list view is counter-productive for stores like this , as customers will be less attracted to the images . <p> For products that also require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVs , or other electronics , taking customers to a dedicated product page or landing page can be preferable so they can see all of the information about the product in one place . For these sort of products , customers also tend to want to read product reviews for these sort of items , which can be shown right on the product page . <p> Stores selling high-ticket items , such as furniture or customized products , also likely want to send customers to a dedicated product page so they can read about specification options , see previews , choose customized options , or view / configure other product details . <h> WooCommerce Product Table : The Ultimate List View Plugin <p> There are surprisingly few plugins to create a WooCommerce list view . The free plugins such as Grid/List View for WooCommerce are pretty basic and not very flexible . For example , you cant choose which information is displayed about your products , hide the images or disable the Add to Cart buttons . <p> The WooCommerce Product Table plugin is the most sophisticated way to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lists WooCommerce products in a fully responsive searchable and sortable table with filters . <p> The WooCommerce list view is designed to inherit the styles from your theme . This means that it will look good straight away without any custom styling . If you like , you can use CSS to make any further styling changes via your theme or child theme . <p> The good thing about the WooCommerce Product Table plugin is that you can keep it very simple and stick with the default settings . Or if you prefer , you can use the many options to customize your WooCommerce list view to meet your exact requirements . <h> How Flexible is the Product List View ? <p> There are lots of ways to configure the list view , including : <p> Product Data Choose the information to be included in the product grid . The list view plugin supports most of the product data stored in WooCommerce . The options are : SKU , I 'd , name , description , short description , date , categories , tags , image , reviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart , product attribute , custom field , and custom taxonomy term . These can all be columns in the product table . <p> Attributes and Variable Products You can display each product attribute as a column in the grid layout . For variable products , you can either let customers click a View options button to choose variations on the single product page , or display variation dropdowns directly in the list view . <p> Links By default , customers can click on a product name in the list view to visit the single product page . This is useful for WooCommerce stores selling products where customers need more information . You can disable the links to use the WooCommerce list view plugin as a one-page order form . <p> Add to Cart You can choose to have normal add to cart buttons alongside each product , and/or multi-select check boxes to buy multiple products . Alternatively , you can hide add to cart completely . This is useful to create a read-only product catalog , or to force customers to buy from the single product page instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a choice of filters that can be used to refine the WooCommerce list view . You can add filters for categories , product attributes , tags or custom taxonomies . <p> Multiple Tables You can add several product lists to a page . For example , you might want to structure a page with sub-headings for each category and a grid of products from the relevant category underneath . <p> Show or Hide List View Elements You can play around with the appearance of the WooCommerce list view . Show or hide elements such as the search box , filters , pagination styles , number of products per page etc . <p> Archive Template WooCommerce Product Table is designed to be used on standard WordPress pages . The plugin documentation also includes guidance on modifying your theme templates to automatically display the WooCommerce list view on product archive templates , so this is an option too . <h> How to Create a WooCommerce List View <p> Ill show you how to create a product list view in 2 stages . The first stage is really simple and will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the optional settings to configure the grid in more detail . <p> To create a basic WooCommerce list view , you need the following steps : <p> Once you save your license key and add the shortcode , you 'll see your products listed in a neat table or grid layout . This is the default WooCommerce list view . It includes columns for Name , Short Description ( labelled Summary ) , Price and Add to Cart . Customers can choose how many products display per page ( the default is 25 ) . They can also sort by any column and search for a keyword . <p> This achieves everything that most people would expect from a WooCommerce list view . As we saw earlier , the Product Table plugin has many options to customize the table to suit different needs . If you want , you can use these options to continue configuring the table . <h> Configuring the product list view <p> The easiest way to make changes to the WooCommerce list view is to use the plugin documentation . This describes each option in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . <p> Its also worth looking at examples of different list views in action on the plugin demo site . These show how WooCommerce Product Table can be used to create quick order forms , product catalogs and so on . You can copy the sample shortcodes from under each demo to create identical list views for your own WooCommerce store . <p> Finally , let 's end by looking at ways to use the WooCommerce List View plugin to increase your sales . <h> Tips on using WooCommerce List Views to Boost Sales <p> Listing products in a grid layout will help customers to find what they want without scrolling through lots of pages . This alone can reduce bounce rates . <p> Designing the product grid around customers needs will make an even bigger difference . You need to get into customers heads and think about what they want from your WooCommerce store . For example : <p> Images How important are images to attracting customers to your products ? If images are n't  important , save space by not including an image column . For sites where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbnails . If images are vital , draw attention by increasing the image size . <p> Multimedia content Can you grab customers attention by displaying multimedia content in the list view ? For example , you can embed product videos directly in the table . <p> Filters Think carefully about how customers will sort and find products.The WooCommerce list view plugin includes lots of options for displaying structured data such as attributes , tags and custom taxonomies . You can display these as clickable links in the table or as dropdown filters above . <p> Pricing Some types WooCommerce store benefit from showing prices on the main list view page . Others ( usually stores with higher prices ! ) are better off by making customers click through before they can see prices . <p> Add to cart Customers are more likely to buy low priced products directly from a WooCommerce list view . More expensive items such as furniture work nicely as a list , but customers will normally want to view more information on the single product page before adding to the cart . For this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product page without having add to cart buttons in the list . <h> Increasing sales with the WooCommerce list view <p> As you can see , there are different ways to increase sales based on the nature of your products and customers . A WooCommerce store selling takeaway food will benefit from a one-page order form with add to cart buttons . In contrast , a website selling designer furniture might use a list view to summarize the products , while using the single product layout to provide more information and allow online ordering . <p> By planning a WooCommerce list view around your customers motivations , you can appeal directly to them . This encourages them to buy from you . <p> While pleasing customers wont increase the number of visitors to your site , it will make each one more valuable by improving your conversion rates . With a higher proportion of visitors converting into paying customers , the revenue from your WooCommerce website will increase . Ultimately , this will help to make your store a success . 11394 @qwx871394

To be fair , your conversion rate is a very important metric for your store . However , its not always the most important one ( or even the best one to focus on ) , and your store size , what you sell , and how you get your customers are just as important for many eCommerce stores . <h> eCommerce Store Metrics : Conversion Rate Significance <p> When you measure conversion rate , you typically divide as follows : <p> Conversion rate = ( Number of Sales / Total visits ) x 100 <p> and if you get above 3% , you 're happy with your store performance . <p> You want the percentage of visits that result in a sale for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits , but Google Analytics goes with total visits , so that 's what I use ) . If you want to be more advanced , you could want to only include qualified visits ( e.g. exclude visits that only reach your " jobs " page ) . <p> However , the thing to consider here is that you may not have enough purchases or visits to produce a reliable metric . For example , if I convert 1 of 3 visitors , is my 33% conversion rate amazing or significant ? Not at all . <p> For many new eCommerce stores , the sample sizes used to determine conversion rate ( number of orders and visits ) are not large enough to produce a valuable store metric . <h> eCommerce Metrics : Average Order Value <p> So as a new store , should you be focusing on conversion rates ?

One of the easiest ways to do so is to use Google Analytics ( free ) or other tracking service , as many sites already do . If you have eCommerce tracking on your site , Google Analytics can tell you your average order value easily . <p> There 's a free universal eCommerce tracking plugin available for EDD , which will add basic eCommerce tracking to your store ( checkout viewed , order placed , etc ) .

Well walk through the process of setting up a membership site with Cart66 Cloud and how it relates to our checklist for membership sites . <h> Creating Memberships <p> We went through general store setup in our Cart66 Cloud review , so if you 're new to the platform , you should check it out for some insights . Once you 're ready to start setting up memberships , you should take a look at the Cart66 &gt; Members settings in your WordPress admin and change where members are redirected when they 're logged in . Instead of redirecting to " Order History " , which will log users out of your site ( which is the one thing I really dislike , as I do n't  think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect them somewhere else . <p> Change Members Settings <p> Each membership will be set up as a new product , so you can have an unlimited number of memberships and can restrict content differently for each product . Members can purchase more than one membership type if you 're using a content-based membership ( access to certain topics ) rather than tiered-memberships ( access that increases with each membership level ) . You can also set memberships that expire after a number of days , or memberships that have ongoing/recurring billing for a number of cycles or until the customer cancels . <p> Membership and Subscription Products <p> You can create a membership product or a subscription product . Membership products will be one-time purchases that expire after a certain number of days ( for example , a one-year , one-time purchase ) . Subscription Products are memberships that are ongoing , and can be billed per a number of weeks or months . You can set a number of cycles for the subscription to run , or it can be continuous ( until the customer cancels ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your products , you 'll have to insert them via shortcode into pages or posts on your WordPress site .

Cart66 Cloud allows you to restrict pages , posts , and categories easily for both membership and subscription products . You can set this up for all categories under Cart66 &gt; Members &gt; Category Restriction in your WordPress admin : <p> Restrict Post Categories <p> If you 're using a tiered-membership system , be sure to enable every membership that should have access to each category . If you 'd prefer to do this for each post , you can also restrict content from the post editor : <p> Post Restriction with Cart66 Cloud <p> You can similarly restrict pages from the page editor . However , you have a few more options while restricting pages , such as the ability to display a custom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the appropriate membership . <p> Restricting Pages with Cart66 Cloud <p> Notice in both the page and post editor , you also have the option to " drip " content to your members ( delay when they can view content ) . Dripping is great for those of you who are using evergreen content , such as tutorials or courses , so that members do n't  get access to all content at once . This way , members cant sign up , download everything , and ditch their membership . You can set a delay in days until the page or post is available to members . The only downfall is that you cant change the drip rate based on membership . <h> Recurring / Subscription Billing <p> Cart66 Cloud hosts your shopping cart and checkout for you , so you do n't  have to worry about billing or security . Any of over 50 payment gateways integrated with Cart66 Cloud can be used for subscription products ( and you can use Stripe , which is a plus ) . Subscription products ( not memberships ) can include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can set a number of weeks or months for recurring billing , and decide how many cycles will be in a subscription , or you can make a subscription ongoing / continuous . Setup is easy and done while you 're creating the product . <p> For both membership and subscription products you can sell digital content or physical products . Since Cart66 is an eCommerce platform , shipping options are built in and will be useful if you 're selling subscription boxes , other physical products , or rentals . <p> Customers can add cards or addresses to their accounts and view their order history , but can not pause , resume , upgrade , or downgrade memberships ( since memberships are individual products , you do n't  have an upgrade " path " to follow ) . If customers want to change memberships , theyll have to cancel the current membership and upgrade manually by purchasing the new one . Pricing is not prorated for this process , so youd have to do a manual refund . <p> Other miscellaneous billing information ? You can allow the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role-based pricing for different membership levels . You also cant create a pay-per-post system , unless you 'd like to create a new membership product for each post and restrict the post to only that membership level ( and determine whether it expires , or make access infinite ) . <h> Support <p> If you experience issues with your Cart66 Cloud site , the good news is that support is included with your purchase . Youll have to log in to your Cart66 Cloud account and submit a support ticket for whatever issues you 're experience , but in my experiences with support , answers are prompt ( within a business day ) , and helpful .

@@98138052 @2338052/ <h> Selling Bookings with Easy Digital Downloads <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Easy Digital Downloads is a fantastic platform if you want to sell services with WordPress . As it focuses on virtual products , services are a natural fit , and it provides a solution that does just what you need without a lot of additional stuff like shipping rates . <p> Since Easy Digital Downloads is great for selling services , the ability to sell bookings is a natural fit for the platform , but there was never a comprehensive add-on to do create and manage bookings . With the release of EDD Bookings ( $82 ) last week , Easy Digital Downloads sites can now sell bookings or other scheduled services easily . <p> EDD Bookings let you : <p> create bookings as download products <p> sell sessions that last minutes , hours , days , or weeks <p> limit the number of sessions customers can purchase at a time <p> set rules on when sessions are available based on days , custom dates , months , and time slots <p> view bookings from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality of EDD Bookings and what 's possible for selling bookings with Easy Digital Downloads . <h> Selling Bookings with EDD : Create Bookings <p> In order to sell a booking in your EDD store , you 'll need to create a product / download for this booking . When creating the product , you can set up the usual fields like its title and categories , can enable bookings with a single checkbox . <p> This will disable the regular Easy Digital Downloads pricing and download fields , and opens up the bookings management fields instead . You can set up the session length , cost per session , booking duration , and whether customers can purchase multiple sessions or not ( along with the limit they can purchase ) . <p> Enable Booking <p> Once you 've set up these basic bookings details , you can then move onto availability rules . These will let you configure when the booking sessions are available , and the rules have a really simple mechanism where rules at the bottom of the table override rules higher up . For example , this could let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable further down in the table . <p> You can set up rules for availability based on days of the week , weeks of the year , months , and custom dates . You can also set up time slots or time slot groups on a per day basis , for all days , all weekdays , or weekends . <p> Booking Availability Rules <p> The set up is very simple , and I was able to get my Bookings product up and running within a few minutes . You can drag and drop rules to change priority and which rules override others . <p> I ran into a couple small issues that may help you should you set up your own bookings . First , if you want to enable time slots for certain days ( i.e. , all weekdays ) , you must first make sure you 've listed those days as available with a " Days " rule . <p> Second , time overrides must be done a certain way . If one " weekday " / day time slot is configured ( i.e. , Weekdays 9a to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another " available " slot . This will not work : <p> Weekdays : 9a to 6p ( available ) <p> Fridays : 9a to 3p ( available ) <p> as Fridays will have double sessions 9am to 6pm , and then another list of sessions for 9am to 3pm . Instead , if you want Fridays rules to be overridden , you have to set up : <p> Weekdays : 9a to 6p ( available ) <p> Fridays : 3p to 6p ( not available ) <p> The advanced documentation indicates this is n't expected behavior , so I 'd keep an eye on the changelog for these to be updated . <p> While bookings are simple to set up , there are a few downsides . For example , you can have pricing variations for a booking no " regular " and " pro " sessions within one booking . Youd have to create separate booking products for each price point . Pricing is also based only on session length , and you cant consider other factors like number of people in the booking . <p> As Bookings removes other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This probably is n't a big deal unless you wanted to attach a welcome packet or instructions for the booking , so youd need to use a download note with a link to any files instead . <h> Selling Bookings with EDD : Customer Experience <p> When a customer browses to your bookable product , the customer is presented with a date picker for the booking , and can select any available days . If your sessions are in terms of days or weeks , customers can click the starting date , and the session length is automatically selected . <p> Multiday Booking <p> If you 've set up time slots per day ( sessions in hours or minutes ) , customers can first select an available day , and then time slots will be shown for the customer to choose a session time , and increase the duration ( quantity ) if needed . <p> Timed Booking <p> The customer can then check out normally , and the booking start and end information will be shown throughout the checkout process . <p> Only one session is available per time slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio : one available booking per session . For example , you ca n't offer two bookings from 1pm to 2pm on a day ; while customers can book multiple sessions in a row , there 's no concept of " inventory " for your sessions in case you have multiple coaches , pieces of equipment , or whatever you 're booking . <h> Selling Bookings with EDD : Managing Bookings <p> Once your customers have placed an order that contains a booking , you 'll be able to see the details for that booking from your store admin . If you view the purchase history for the order , the booking details will be added in a new meta box with a link to the booking : <p> Booking Order <p> You can also navigate to bookings directly from Downloads &gt; Bookings to get to your booking list . <p> Bookings list <p> Here you can view relevant details , such as links to the customer profile or booking details , and you can click the " edit " quick action to see the booking screen . <p> View Booking <p> The booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any booking details ( for example , to reassign a booking to a different customer or adjust the time ) , nor can you manually add bookings . <p> You can view a list of bookings from the Bookings screen , but there 's no ability to view a calendar or export these bookings to a calendar format . <h> Selling Bookings with EDD : Pros and Cons <p> EDD Bookings is n't a swiss army knife for bookings . It works very well for sites that need to sell a bookable product with one available session per time slot , and those sessions have only one fixed price . Its a new plugin , so it will work out any kinks or small issues as time goes on , but that also gives it room to grow and add new things based on how its being used . <p> If you need pricing by variation , number of people , or other resources , this is n't the solution for you ( at least not yet ) . If you want an easy-to-use plugin that let 's you sell single sessions for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one-on-one coaching sessions ) , its a great solution and the availability rules are easy to understand and use . <p> I liked how quick set up was and how easy rules are to understand , but this comes at the tradeoff of more advanced pricing rules , which you may or may not need . <p> Pros <p> Easy , fast setup <p> Can sell bookable products alongside other products ( like ebooks ) <p> Flexible , customizable availability rules <p> Can set availability along with excluded dates / times for holidays , vacation , etc <p> Can not have multiple " sessions " per time slot ( e.g. , sell 2 slots from 3-4pm ) <p> No manual booking edits or additions <p> No calendar integrations <p> I 'd love to see improved booking management in the future , especially the ability to edit bookings and get a calendar view or sync them with a calendar . Even without these features , EDD Bookings gives you a simple to use and implement booking solution to sell your services or bookable products . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98138055 @2338055/ <p> There are a number of customization options for shipping in WooCommerce , from selecting vendors to creating different shipping methods . One of these options is the ability to restrict shipping to entire countries . However , what if you need shipping validation based on other , more specific customer selections ? <p> Having shipping validation rules can help you determine when checkout should be blocked for certain shipping methods . For example , you may want to block free shipping from Alaska and Hawaii for US orders , or prevent customers from choosing expedited shipping in certain states . In this case , its helpful to be able to set up shipping validation rules to block checkout . <h> Shipping validation : Advanced Shipping Validation plugin <p> The plugin provides options to prevent checkout based on the items in a customers cart , specific location and region details , and the details of individual products . You can also create multiple shipping validation rules to suit your needs . <p> Since this is a free plugin available from WordPress.org , you can add the plugin through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules <p> Once you are ready to create a rule , you can select from the many options available . You can create validation based on " and " and " or " rules . <p> " And " rules are all grouped together and mean that all of the conditions have to be met for the checkout to be prevented . <p> " Or " rules mean that either group of conditions need to be met for the checkout to be prevented . <p> " and/or " rules can be created for validation <p> In this example , the checkout will be prevented if the city is selected as " Scranton " AND the shipping method is selected as " Local Delivery " , OR if the coupon code " DunderMifflin " is used . In this way , you can tackle multiple use cases where checkout should be prevented for different customers who may have a specific set of criteria . <p> In addition to the rules , you can also create a customized note that is displayed whenever checkout is prevented . You can create different messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a customers selection . <p> Customized validation message appears at the top of the checkout <p> To enhance the customer experience , in your validation note for the reason for not being able to checkout , provide customers with an alternative . Or , create a call to action that directs them towards a resolution . This can be as simple as contacting the store to discuss options . This way , customers do n't  get frustrated by not knowing what it is that 's preventing them from completing their purchase , or where to go for support . <p> As you add products to your store , or provide shipping to more regions , you can get an overview of all the validation rules active on your store . <p> Overview of all validation rules active on your store <p> You can quickly enable or disable these validation rules through the plugin overview screen . <h> Shipping validation : Manage shipping <p> There are a number of reasons for using the plugin to manage shipping for your WooCommerce store . If you know certain products require special handling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may make it clear in the copy of your website , some people may still purchase them . <p> In such cases , it creates added work for you to cancel the order , refund the money , reset the inventory , and provide and explanation to a now-angry customer . It is much easier to stop checkout before the order is put through . <p> Here are some reasons why shipping to certain regions may be an issue : <h> Shipping restrictions on certain products <p> Certain products have restrictions on being shipped within countries , or across borders . Firearms , gasoline , alcohol , perfume , drugs , etc. , are examples of products that you may not be able to ship to all regions or countries . In such cases , you can prevent checkout if standard shipping is selected . Instead , you can provide shipping for local or in-person delivery options . <p> You should check local laws to see if certain items are deemed hazardous or have restrictions . Couriers also have materials that they deem hazardous and have shipping restrictions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Shipping costs <p> There may be cases where shipping of certain products eats into your profit margins due to the high cost of shipping . This is especially true if your store offers free shipping above a certain threshold of order value . If there is an item for which shipping costs are very high , you may be better served by offloading this cost entirely on to the customer . <h> Specialized shipping <p> Some items in your store may need special shipping . These can be oversized , fragile , or heavy items that need special instructions for delivery . For example , if you typically sell keyboards ( the musical instrument kind ) , and you add a full sized piano to your products , you will probably need specialized shipping instructions to deliver to a Manhattan apartment on the 28th floor . <h> Inventory management <p> There may be cases where you do n't  want to sell an item if the stock is low . For example , if you have the same product on your online store , and also sell it at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to stop shipping it from your online store to make sure it is available in other channels . Or , if there is typically a lag in your inventory numbers being updated based on the distribution from the warehouse , you may want to prevent selling items that are actually out of stock . <p> You can also prevent checkout if an item is out of stock to avoid customers having to wait longer than they expected . <h> Shipping validation : Summary <p> If left unchecked , shipping can become a huge drain on your business . Poorly managed shipping can cost your business by chipping away at the profit margins . Shipping can also determine the type of experience your customers have with your brand . Customers can have a negative experience if they end up paying too much , are offered very few shipping options , or get shipping denied to them after they 've checked out and paid due to shipping restrictions . Even if you refund the money , that is extra time and effort that couldve been spent running your business .

@@98138057 @2338057/ <h> Creating Purchasing Forms : CaptainForm Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> When you 're looking to sell a product online , you may want to get started quick , and may not need all of the feature of a full-fledged eCommerce platform . When you 're in this situation , a simple purchasing form may do just fine . <p> Most form builders will offer a way to accept payments with forms , along with other tools that eCommerce sites need like email list integrations , contact forms , or surveys . In some cases , using a purchasing form is a more flexible choice than an eCommerce plugin , as you can completely customize which information you get from customers , and determine how price is calculated in more complex ways than " total price = sum of all products " . <h> CaptainForm Review : Overview <p> CaptainForm is a form-builder app that let 's you create and edit any kind of form , and you can use their WordPress plugin to build and manage forms directly within your WordPress admin . Unlike many form plugins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so files uploaded to your forms are not stored within your sites media folder . <p> This hosted service makes the plugin a bit different from many form plugins , but this does have added security benefits as submissions and uploaded files are n't  stored directly on your site , you 're less at-risk for malicious file uploads vulnerabilities that have affected otherformplugins . The tradeoff is that you pay a yearly subscription rather than a fee to download the plugin . <p> However , in order to use CaptainForm to create purchasing forms , you 'll need to select the Hero plan at $195 per year , which grants you access to payment integrations along with coupon codes . Well take a look at using the Hero plan to create purchasing forms today . <h> CaptainForm Review : Set up <p> The CaptainForm plugin can be installed from WordPress.org , but the forms and all of your submission data are hosted for you off-site . This means that you 'll only get a limited number of form submissions and functionality for free , and you 'll need a license key to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go to CaptainForm &gt; Change Plan to select the " Hero Plan " so you can access the eCommerce features offered by CaptainForm . <p> You can also update any of your account information from within the plugin as needed . <p> Once you have your account set up , and your Hero Plan license entered so you have access to eCommerce features , you can begin with form set up . You 'll get an email from CaptainForm with a whitepaper to get you started with your form creation . <h> CaptainForm Review : Managing Forms <p> Once your account has been created with a Hero plan license , you can get right into form management . Youll be able to create and manage forms from the CaptainForm &gt; My Forms menu in your admin . <p> One thing I really liked about setting up CaptainForm is that it includes template forms to get you started right away . Rather than creating a form entirely from scratch , you can use a template form to get started . This saves you time in set up , and it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form work . <p> I chose an " order form " template to get started with my purchasing form . <p> Form samples <p> However , from the " New Form " page , there are tons of template forms you can choose from instead to get started . <p> Form Templates <p> From here , you can get into your form editing and settings . <p> Sample Order Form <p> At any time , you can manage forms from the " My Forms " list , letting you edit forms , view submissions , change form settings , or view reports for your forms on the aggregated submission data . <h> CaptainForm Review : Creating a Form <p> My template order form had basic details I 'd need from my customers : name , email address , and a radio button selector for my " product " . Regardless of whether you use a template form or create your own , there are basic fields you can add such as text , textarea , email , number , dropdown , radio button , and checkbox fields . Listed under basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales . <p> There are also advanced form fields available , which can support several different kinds of forms . For example , you could use a date field for a delivery service or pickup for local purchases . There are also several other kinds of advanced fields , such as name fields , file uploads , images , page breaks , addresses , and phone numbers . <p> Advanced field types <p> The one advanced field that can be a bit confusing is the Price field type . This is only used if you want a customer-dictated price , such as on a donation form or to submit a budget . You could use this in a payment form , or just as a placeholder , but any price data for options is set under the form settings instead . ( Many other form plugins will have that as a " display " price for customers , but CaptainForm will show the total automatically instead . ) <p> When you add a field to your form , you can then also click on that field to edit its details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values you can edit , such as the labels , descriptions , or whether its required . Some field types have advanced settings , too . For example , radio buttons can let you limit the number of times a particular option can be chosen in a purchasing form , this can act as a pseudo-inventory for an option . <p> Field basic options <p> Field advanced options <p> As you edit your purchasing form , you 'll want form fields for customer name , email , address , and the products being purchased at minimum . Once those are created , well be able to move onto other settings for the form by clicking the " Settings " step at the top , such as the payment settings . <p> Form settings <h> CaptainForm Review : Accepting Payments <p> When you 're ready to edit the payment settings , you 'll need to add prices for any options , and also enter your payment gateway credentials . You can accept both one-time and recurring payments with several payment gateways using CaptainForm : <p> PayPal <p> PayPal Pro <p> PayPal Payflow Pro <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Braintree <p> Payfast <p> FreshBooks <p> SagePay <p> If you go to Settings &gt; Payments for the form , you 'll be able to set up several settings for the form . First , you can assign prices to any of the form fields you 've created . For example , if you have a dropdown or radio button so customers can choose a product , you can now assign a price to each choice . <p> This is where price set up can get a bit weird , but it gives you some flexibility to do some unique pricing . If you want to have a set price for the option or field , you can add it as a value . <p> If you want to do some math and make the field a display field ( ie show the result of a calculation to the customer ) , you can add the field as a formula into the pricing instead . This let 's you do a calculation , and this becomes the field value . For example , if the customer has inputs for width and length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of it length x width . <p> In either case , any values you 've made available can be used to calculate the form total , and you can set up this calculation . For example , should the choice be multiplied by the quantity ? Youll set up those totals here , along with any discounts or mark ups for price option . <p> Payment Summary Setup <p> I 'm not too sure why discounts and markups are used here , as they 're not responding to quantity or anything ; you could just change the price value to get the same thing . However , if you want to show pricing as full price and then advertise a discount , this could be helpful . <p> Now that the pricing and total cost of the form is configured , you 'll want to add at least one payment method . I like that CaptainForm allows you to use more than one payment method so your customers can have the choice of credit cards , PayPal , or their preferred processor . <p> Add Payment method <p> The only thing I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processor name is shown to customers if you enable more than one method . For example , my customer may not know what Braintree is , but if I accept Braintree and PayPal , I may want to just name Braintree " Credit Card " , which is n't possible . The options will show as " Braintree " and " PayPal " . <p> Since payment credentials are entered on a per-form basis , you also have to re-enter gateway credentials for any form you want to enable a gateway on . While this could help you route payments to different accounts easily , it can make set up redundant for using several forms that should leverage the same payment information . <p> Once you 've entered your credentials for any payment gateways and enabled them , you can set up notifications and some final payment-specific settings . <p> Payment Notification settings <p> You could check out other form settings if desired , but at this point , my purchasing form is ready to be tested , and I can hit " Publish " at the top to get a shortcode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a widget , or elsewhere on my site . <p> You can now embed your form , add a widget , or add it directly into your theme . <h> CaptainForm Review : Managing Submissions <p> Submissions for your purchasing forms can be managed from the " My Forms " list . You can view all submissions for a form at once , then you have some options for exporting forms . You can both print and export submissions to a CSV file on an individual basis or in bulk . <p> Printing will give you a simple printout of form fields . If you 'd like a PDF of the entries , you can get one by viewing a submission individually . There are two PDF options : <p> plain PDF : You can use the plain print layout as a PDF of the submission values <p> Form Layout PDF : for a " nicer " PDF , you can use credits to export to a PDF of an individual submission in the form more credits are available for purchase as needed <p> You can also edit form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that you can send customers a public link to edit their form submissions , which is handy if they contact you about mistakes on a form submission . <h> CaptainForm Review : Customer Experience <p> Even though the form is hosted externally by CaptainForm , it will blend in pretty well with your sites content and styling . For example , font styles and sizes are adopted by the form when its embedded . <p> For a purchasing form , customers can select choices , and they 're shown a price preview ( depending on your form settings ) . To complete a purchase , theyll need to first click " Preview Submission " , which shows them an overview of the data that will be submitted , then click " Purchase " to view the purchasing form . This let 's customers fill in an automatically generated ( hosted ) payment form . <p> Payment Summary <p> Customers will then receive an email with submission details automatically . <h> CaptainForm Review : Other Features <p> While using a form builder on your site is great for purchasing forms , chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from contact forms to event registration or booking forms . There are several other useful features that CaptainForm offers in addition to payment capabilities . <p> Your forms can leverage conditional logic to determine when certain fields are shown or hidden . After you 've added all possible fields to your form , you can go to the " Rules " settings for your form , and set up rules to hide or show other fields depending on what 's been selected . <p> Conditional Logic <p> CaptainForm has email list apps , like a MailChimp integration , that allows you to subscribe customers to an email list when submitting a form , or offering customers the choice to opt into different email lists . The email integrations available help you keep purchasers informed . For example , if you sell event tickets , you can email all purchasers if you opt them into a list in case of any changes . There are other integrations like AWeber and GetResponse as well . <p> Feedback is a valuable tool for any eCommerce site , and you can use CaptainForm to create polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to improve your store . For example , you could set up an email in your email marketing tool of choice to send a week after the form is submitted .

@@98138058 @2338058/ <h> How to Sell Group Memberships with WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> When you build a membership site with WordPress , you have lots of good options to choose from when searching for the right plugin . However , almost all membership plugins assume that the customer is buying the membership directly from the site . <p> In the case of corporate or group memberships , one individual may be purchasing memberships for several people . In this scenario , its very difficult ( if not impossible ) to create a membership system that allows one person to purchase memberships , but the recipients of the membership to create an account and gain membership access . Billing is almost always required to be tied to the member account . <p> There 's still no easy way to achieve this kind of setup , but today well show you a work-around that can let you sell group memberships with WooCommerce . This method will require some manual work on your part as a site owner , but you could automate this with custom code . <p> The good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prospress , who built WooCommerce Subscriptions , that will allow you to " gift " subscriptions to another person ( due out in a few months ) . <h> Group Memberships with WooCommerce : Overview <p> This workaround will let you sell corporate memberships with WooCommerce , as one person can purchase the membership , and then employees ( or members of the group ) , can gain membership access . <p> There are two ways we can create this system : employees or group members can be responsible for renewing their own memberships , or the business can be responsible for renewing the membership . <p> This kind of setup works best for memberships that have a long billing period , such as semi-annually or annually , as its not entirely automated and requires some manual management from the store administrator . The shorter the billing period , the more work that 's put on the shop administrator . <h> Group Memberships with WooCommerce : Employee Renews <p> This workflow is easier to set up when selling group memberships with WooCommerce : the " account " owner ( whoever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then employees or group members will renew it themselves in the next billing term . <p> This works really well for companies that want to give employees a certain length of membership , and then employees can choose whether theyd like to renew or not . <p> In fact , this exact setup is used by Post Status to sell memberships for the Post Status club . Members get access to certain areas of the site and the member newsletter , and can choose to renew themselves once their initial term ( which is paid by the company or an account manager ) is over . <p> here 's how we can set up an employee or member-renewal system : <p> Create a simple product in your WooCommerce shop ; this is what you 'll sell to the whoever is purchasing the group of memberships ( it may even have a lower price for a bulk discount ) . You can password protect this product or remove it from your catalog if you do n't  want just anyone to come along and buy it . <p> The person or company purchasing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of memberships . <p> Simple Product for Group Purchase <p> Create a subscription product in your shop ; this will be the product that the member " purchases " . The first billing term will be paid for already so its not truly a purchase , but then the member will pay for each term after this to renew the membership . This could be your public product that members purchase to gain access . <p> Subscription Product for Members <p> Add the subscription product ( the one the employee will sign up for ) to the desired membership plan under WooCommerce Memberships . This ensures that , when the member signs up , the membership is activated and is tied to the members subscription . If the member cancels or chooses not to renew , membership access is stopped . <p> Tie Member Product to Membership Plan <p> Now let 's talk about how the purchasing flow works , as this is where the final steps come in . The employer or person buying the group of memberships will buy the desired quantity of your simple product say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purchase , you 're going to set up a coupon that theyll send to employees . This is where URL coupons makes this very easy to do , as the company can just send a link to employees or group members , and the right item along with the coupon will be added to the cart immediately . I recommend creating a coupon with the company name to make it easy to remember and use . <p> Since 20 memberships were purchased , the coupon limit will be 20 uses . We can also set a usage restriction to limit this coupon to our membership subscription that way , the discount does n't  apply to anything else purchased . <p> Set Coupon Limits <p> The coupon will be a 100% cart % discount , because we want to give the initial purchase ( first billing period ) for free since its already paid for , but the employee will have to pay for renewals . <p> Create this discount , and have the coupon add the subscription product to the cart . You can even send the new members to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Setup <p> Members will have to enter payment details , as the first term of the membership is free ( since it was paid for by the company ) , but renewals are charged to the member . See the total here " $0.00 now and then $129.99 per year " . <p> Member Signup <p> This process could be automated if you 'd like , as you could automatically create the coupon and send it after checkout rather than taking this step manually . This way , the person purchasing the group of memberships can send the link to members immediately . However , this depends on how many group purchases you 'll get and whether this custom code justifies the investment . <h> Group Memberships with WooCommerce : Company Renews <p> You can also let the business or the group purchaser renew for employees , but a system like this is harder to set up , and requires more manual actions . The general idea is the same as the method we 've just outlined above , but with a few key differences : <p> Well need to reverse who gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company / purchaser is in charge of renewals . You should sell a subscription product to this person , and a simple product to the member . The quantity of subscriptions purchased will equal the quantity of memberships to give away . <p> This means that the recurring billing will go to the company , and the employee or member will not renew the membership themselves . <p> Members will purchase a simple product instead : <p> New Member Product <p> As a result , we cant exactly tie membership access to the billing ; the membership access is tied to the member account , but the billing is tied to the account manager / whoever bought the membership group . <p> This poses a problem , and this is why the " business-renews " setup is more complicated . When you create your simple product for the member to purchase , well add that to the membership plan instead . Well also set up an expiration length for the membership : <p> Set Expiration length <p> You 'll still create a URL coupon for a 100% cart discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead so that members get a free account . The company will still give this link to employees for an easy sign up process . <p> We expire the membership after one year so we can keep track of billing ; this is a manual process , but it works . Youll have to pay attention to the companys subscriptions . <p> If the subscriptions are cancelled , you would then need to manually cancel the membership that were purchased from it . As these memberships are not tied to the billing account , this process does not happen automatically . <p> If the subscriptions are renewed , you 'll need to extend these memberships for another year manually . <p> If the subscription is n't renewed , you can simply let the memberships expire after the year is up and access will stop . <p> Is this simple ? Not at all . My point is that it can be done , and if you by chance mess up and miss a subscription cancellation , the worst that happens is that the membership expires at the end of the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin that might help out with this sort of management , as it let 's you filter orders by the coupon used . This could give you a list of all members for a particular company easily , as they would have used the company coupon to sign up . <p> You could also automate membership statuses by the billing subscription via custom code if your site grows large enough to make managing this manually too cumbersome . <h> Group Memberships with WooCommerce : Gift Subscriptions <p> While these solutions are n't  pretty , they work to let you sell group memberships with WooCommerce . However , this can be much simpler . Prospress has a Gift Subscriptions Extension in development that will allow one account to purchase subscriptions ( and therefore memberships ) for another account that 's due out in a few months . <p> Well definitely be reviewing this when its available , as it solves a very unique need for membership sites that 's quite difficult to meet now . <h> Group Memberships with WooCommerce : Summary <p> Selling group memberships with WooCommerce is possible , and these memberships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of memberships . <p> Memberships that are renewed by employees are far simpler to set up , as the billing and membership are part of the same account . The company or purchaser effectively buys a 100% discount for the first terms and shares it with everyone . <p> Group memberships renewed by a company are also possible , though more difficult to set up and manage . Since the billing and access are part of different accounts , this requires manual management on the part of the shop administrator , or custom code to automate changes in billing . <p> Personally , if you want to sell a membership that the company or purchaser renews , I 'd keep an eye out for the Gift Subscriptions extension , as I think this will make managing group memberships with WooCommerce much easier . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Great article ! I 'm in the process of creating a website that offers group memberships and you provide some useful pointers . I have one question relating to your comment about automating the coupon process . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be automated if you 'd like , as you could automatically create the coupon and send it after checkout rather than taking this step manually . This way , the person purchasing the group of memberships can send the link to members immediately . However , this depends on how many group purchases you 'll get and whether this custom code justifies the investment . <p> Thanks = To automate the coupon process , youd need the help of a developer to create the some custom code that would run when your group membership product is purchased . The code would need to create the coupon by generating the code , setting the usage limit to the quantity purchased , and creating the URL for the coupon via URL coupons . Youd then need to output the coupon URL on the thank you page or in the order confirmation email . Basically , it would do the coupon creation steps for you so that the coupon would be immediately available . 
@@98138059 @2338059/ <h> Engage eCommerce Customers through Lifecycle Emails <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> For many eCommerce stores , especially when you 're growing , a lot of effort goes into marketing to acquire new customers . This includes ads , promotions on other sites , website copy , videos , and more . Since you 're spending so many resources on customer acquisition , do n't  drop the ball once the customer is acquired ! The lifetime value of the customer can be much more than a single sale . <p> This is where lifecycle emails come in . <p> A customer who has already purchased from your store trusts your brand enough to have spent their money . It is up to you to grow this trust and build a community of loyal customers who will not only come back to purchase more products , but also recommend your products to others . <h> Lifecycle emails : Introduction and basics <p> Lifecycle emails are targeted emails based on specific points in a customers journey while interacting with your brand . The steady flow of emails over a long term can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurture a relationship with your brand . This can lead to more sales through higher order values , provide valuable feedback about your products , and generate further referrals . <p> Although people are spending more time on social media today than ever before , email is still one of the best marketing channels for conversion . In addition , their lifetime value is 12% higher than the average of different marketing channels . <p> In this way , lifecycle emails can not only build customer loyalty , but also increase sales . In a previous post , we discussed how emails can become a useful tool for customer service . Today , well go over different stages in a customers journey when you can send automated personalized emails , and a few plugins that can help you manage lifecycle emails . <p> One important thing to include in your emails is the unsubscribe link . Most email marketing platforms have this functionality right out of the box . The option to unsubscribe makes sure that you are not " spamming " customers who do n't  wish to receive these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ongoing emails knowing that they can choose to unsubscribe whenever they want . Including the unsubscribe link is also required by law in many countries , like Canada , with the penalty of a fine if you do n't  adhere to the regulations . <p> Let 's look at examples of when you can send customers emails , and some plugins that can help automate lifecycle emails . <h> Lifecycle emails : Points of engagement <p> Based on your business and customer journey , you can pick different points at which to send customers an email . Here is a list of a few stages when we recommend sending customers an email : <h> First-time purchase <p> When a person purchases a product on your store for the first time , try to send them more than just the automated receipt email . If you want to streamline the number of emails you send , you can also customize your receipt email to include a thank you message , a discount for additional purchases , instructions on how to use a physical product , or to start a conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a customer receives something that adds value to their purchase , the customer leaves with a positive experience of your brand . <h> Welcome email <p> One of the most important lifecycle emails is the welcome email . The welcome email can be for customers who make a purchase , sign up for your service , or simply create an account on your store . Welcome emails create long-term engagement from customers as you can tailor the email for a specific action . <p> Welcome emails increase customer engagement with a brand by 33% . <p> You can create different types of emails with different tones based on your brand . Below are two examples of welcome emails one from Stripe and the other from Buffer . <p> A more formal welcome email with instructions <p> Emails can be formal in tone , especially when you are selling to enterprise customers . You can also include instructions or next-steps on what the customers can do , and point them to the FAQs if you typically receive questions after customers purchase your product or services . <p> Your welcome emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tone can be more inviting for conversation with your customers . In addition , an automated email signed by the founders/co-founders can make customers feel more valued and that their feedback or concern will be taken seriously . <p> Emails signed by an individual helps give a face to the interaction <p> Take a look at some more examples of welcome emails by leading brands to get ideas for your own welcome emails . One thing to always include is to thank customers/members for signing up with their email . <h> Left a review <p> You can automate sending an email each time a customer submits a review for your products ( this is another place where WooCommerce stores can benefit from using AutomateWoo ) . <p> You can consider including a reward for the time they took to leave a review , whether favorable or not . If you want to go this route , giving out store points for a review can be a great reward . If it was a positive review , you only take the experience further with the reward . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a positive experience for that customer . <p> Remember , people trust word-of-mouth , reviews and testimonials of other people who have purchased your products . Reviews can be a strong marketing tool for your store . An email thanking people for their review will go a long way in making them feel appreciated . <h> 2-week follow up <p> Schedule an email 2 weeks after a customer receives your product to ask for feedback and their experience . This gives people enough time to get used to your product and develop some useful feedback . <p> This feedback can help you not only see what you are doing right , but also address customer concerns , improve your products , and find areas which are pain points for customers . For example , the customers may be happy with your products , but may have had a bad experience with the courier company you use . <p> For shipped products , note to send the email 2 weeks after the customer has received the product , not made the purchase . <h> Order value <p> You can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a certain amount on your store . <h> Discounts and new products <p> Send customers emails about discounts and promotions at your store throughout the year . For an existing customer , it can be annoying if they missed out on a sale because they werent informed , or if it was advertised elsewhere and not to them . You also get a buy in for emailing customers as they know they do n't  have to check your website again and again to avoid missing promotions . <p> You can inform customers not only about promotions , but also about new products that you add to your store or service . This keeps them in the know of what is happening with your brand . <p> Email about Ubers new service <h> Lifecycle emails : Useful plugins and apps <p> AutomateWoo ( WooCommerce ) starting at $99 The AutomateWoo extension for WooCommerce let 's you send and track emails based on abandoned carts , new discounts , follow ups , order values , wishlist-on-sale , and more , making it super-useful for lifecycle email automation .

You can also track engagement by seeing the number of clicks , opens , etc. to see which emails get the best results . Emails can be personalized by using merge tags and you can customize the layout and design of each email or campaign . <p> Receiptful ( WooCommerce , EDD ) starting at $19 per month The Receiptful extension for WooCommerce , or the corresponding EDD extension , gives you the ability to modify your receipt emails to include special messages , promotions and sharing options . You can also automate emails for abandoned carts , follow-ups , and more . <p> EDD Conditional Emails ( EDD ) starting at $29 The Conditional Emails extension for Easy Digital Downloads helps you create emails that are automatically sent to customers based on triggers like pending payments , abandoned carts , etc . <p> EDD Product Updates ( EDD ) starting at $49 The Product Updates extension for Easy Digital Downloads is a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers when you release an update for a product . You can preview the templates and send test emails to ensure they look the way you want them to on different devices . <h> Lifecycle emails : Summary <p> Great customer experiences happen when its not all about the sale . If customers are being pitched a sale every single time you contact them , then their value is only as good as the sale . When you email customers , try to give them value , rather than ask for value . You can even exchange value for something in return that is not a sale . <p> Use lifecycle emails to engage customers after they 've made their purchase or signed up , and build loyalty . Loyal customers are much more likely to shop again and recommend your brand to others . This will lead to more sales , and more importantly , even more engaged customers . <p> What do you use to stay in touch with your customers ? Have you seen a rise in revenue because of it ? Tell us in the comments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at the importance of educating customers about your products . However , if your product is new and you 're trying to gain trust in the market , preemptively answering commonly asked questions can help grow sales . You can add such emails to the pre-purchase portion of your lifecycle emails.

@@98138061 @2338061/ <h> Email Case Study : Newsletter Confirmation from The Hustle <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this months email case study , we will look at the newsletter confirmation email from The Hustle . The Hustle is a content-focused daily newsletter about latest happenings in business and technology . <p> In this post , well look at what works and what does n't  work in the email , and what got us to click . <h> Newsletter confirmation : What was good about the email ? <p> Tell a story about what 's going on behind the scenes <h> 1 . Interesting copy <p> The Hustles core product is content . And the confirmation email is heavily driven by interesting content . The text has enough whitespace to be easy to read . Towards the beginning of the email , the content provides details of visuals and actions that happen when somebody subscribes to the newsletter . <p> The story itself is quirky which maintains the readers attention . In addition , this sets the fun and casual tone of the brand . The newsletter content maintains this tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will follow . <p> Even if it is n't true , you can include a story about what happens behind the scenes for your store or business . This humanizes your brand , and gives people some amount of insight into the type of environment and people your brand represents . <h> 2 . Personalized signature <p> The beginning of the email establishes the author , and his credibility ( " the leader " ) . <p> Personalize the email through a signature <p> The email is written in first person , and it is easy to inject the voice of the leader as subscribers read the email . The email is then signed by the author with a full cursive signature , which adds another personal touch . <h> 3 . Layout mimics what 's to come <p> Although the email has a very simple layout with all text , it establishes the expectation of the layout for the newsletters . The newsletters are also content-heavy so the confirmation email mimics that well . <p> At the bottom of the email , there are links to resources and social profiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website and newsletters . This keeps the layout consistent between different channels and points-of-contact . <h> Newsletter confirmation : What was bad about the email ? <p> There 's not much wrong with the email for the purpose it tries to achieve . But below are two things you can do to engage your audience even more . <h> 1 . Add visuals <p> The Hustles email is text-only as those are the types of emails they use for the newsletters . However , you can make your stores confirmation emails even better by adding some visuals images , graphics , gifs , etc. to capture peoples attention . <p> Some people may glance at an all-text email and decide not to start reading . Even if you have interesting content , it would n't matter as some people may not be drawn to read it . <h> 2 . Link to existing posts and products <p> Another missed opportunity in the email is linking to some existing posts which are available on the website . You can curate a list of high-value posts , or best-selling products that you can link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving people something immediate to do . This can not only gain more exposure for those posts or products , but also provide your subscribers with valuable information about your store and your brand . <h> Newsletter confirmation : What got you to click ? <p> One of the first things that got me to click was the subject line of the email . It seemed very personal and informal , and I wanted to see what the email said right away . As the email is text-only , the subject line also got me intrigued to read the email rather than skim through it . <p> A catchy subject line gets people to click <p> Most people expect confirmation emails to be auto-generated with standard content . Since your subscribers will get this email no matter what , it can be an opportunity to create a first impression before the first newsletter they receive . You can cover a wider set of things in this email than you may be able to do in the newsletters . <p> You can change the subject line to be unique and interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Newsletter confirmation : Takeaway <p> The Hustles newsletter confirmation email relies heavily on content to keep it interesting . Instead of creating a standard " thank you for signing up " email , this email sets the tone for the brand . It captures attention with the story ( even if it is made up ) of what happens each time somebody signs up for the newsletter . <p> The email also mimics what the newsletters look like content heavy and void of images . The flip side of being so heavily content-driven is that some people may skim over the chunks of text . However , that is probably not the target audience for The Hustle , as it primarily provides information about current events . <p> Newsletter signup confirmations are a great opportunity to establish your brands voice , and provide subscribers with some value . Are you signed up for the Sell with WP newsletter yet ? If so , first you would be directed to a page with a curated list of articles to get you going right away . <p> Sell with WP newsletter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a confirmation email with a link to top resources .

The out-of-the-box solution for creating discounts is to create a discount code that would typically be applied during checkout .

@@98138064 @2338064/ <h> 6 Strategies and Helpful Plugins to Market New Products <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Launching new products in your store is always an exciting time , but the stress of wondering whether the product will be a success , will justify any costs in launching , or will solve your customers needs can be taxing . Fortunately , since your store is powered by WordPress , there are a lot of really useful plugins that can help you market new products for your store , regardless of which eCommerce plugin you use . <p> Here are six strategies that can help you successfully launch and market new products in your shop , and some plugins that can help you implement these strategies . <h> 1 . " Pre-market " : Build anticipation before launch <p> Marketing your new product needs to begin before its even available , so there are some pre-launch strategies you can use before launch . <p> Anticipation is one of your greatest allies when you 're launching a new product . Building up the hype before a product launches can get your customers excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its available . This also gives them the opportunity to share with friends . <p> Accepting pre-orders for your upcoming products is a fantastic way to generate immediate revenue and ensure that customers are interested enough in your new product to purchase . WooCommerce Pre-Orders ( $129 ) is a really useful plugin here , as this let 's you create pre-orders and charge the customer when the order is shipped or charge immediately . <p> WooCommerce Pre-Orders <p> Giving out coupons for the upcoming product can also build anticipation . You can email these to your customers at launch , or you can include them with packing materials for orders before the new product is launched ( using cheap business cards is a great way to do this ) . <p> This let 's customers who are already interested in your shop know what 's coming . You can even continue to include packaging promotions after launch until the word about your new product spreads . <p> If you 're using Easy Digital Downloads , you can generate coupon codes using the Discount Code Generator ( $29 ) , and email these codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2 . Use your email list and existing customers <p> Speaking of discounts , you should be in touch with your existing customers . They 're your most valuable marketing resources , as they 're already interested in your store and have purchased your products before . Send email campaigns prior to launch and once your new product is available . <p> Discount codes are always great to encourage existing customers to purchase your new products , so you can generate them and include them in an email for the customer . Email tools like MailChimp make this simple to do : <p> Import a CSV of your mailing list , and include a " couponcode " column that contains a code you 've generated . <p> This will be added to your members MailChimp profiles . Now you can create a merge tag for this field like *CODE* <p> Include this in your emails , and every customer will have their unique code in the email to use on the new purchase . <p> The EDD Discount Generator can export a CSV of coupons , so you could add this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate codes for you , you can create a spreadsheet of codes to use in MailChimp , then import the coupons using the Customer / Order / Coupon CSV Importer ( $79 ) . <p> You can also make it easy to purchase when you send emails to your existing customers . WooCommerce stores have a couple of options here , as the URL Coupons extension ( $49 ) can let you send a link that adds the new product to the cart , redirects to a page of your choice , and automatically apply a coupon . This minimizes the friction around purchasing . <p> If you have more than one new product , or you just want to use a URL without a discount , the WooCommerce Cart URL extension ( $49 ) is also a very good choice . This plugin let 's you build a cart with multiple products or quantities in it , then get a link that can be shared to automatically create this cart . <h> 3 . Get the word out : bloggers and social media <p> You 're already going to leverage your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc but you 'll need to spread the word about your new product even more . This is where some old-fashioned partnerships can come into play . Get in touch with blogs or online magazines in your industry to help announce your new product(s) ( i.e. , " Apparelisus launches spring clothing line ! " ) . <p> Letting them run giveaways of your products can get customers excited about your products and give you contact information for potential customers who are interested in your products . For people who enter the giveaway and do n't  win , sending a coupon code can also be a great strategy , as this list of entrants is very targeted and they 're definitely interested in your product . <p> You can also agree to cross-promote each other they can help you share your new product with readers , and you can send a promotional card for their site with your shipped orders . <p> You could also host giveaways of your own if you have a large blog or social media following . My favorite plugin to run giveaways is KingSumo Giveaways , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give loyal customers early access <p> While accepting pre-orders is one strategy we already talked about , early access is also something to consider . If your customers typically have repeat purchases , or you can segment customers into your top purchasers , you may want to offer early access to these customers so they can try your product , be rewarded for their loyalty , and share it or write your first reviews . <p> You could give early access in a couple of ways : <p> Most WordPress eCommerce plugins can password protect the product page so that entering the password is needed for the product to be accessed and bought . You can do this and email the password to your VIP list so they can purchase the product first . <p> You could use a membership or content restriction plugin to give purchasing access to certain customers via a membership . WooThemes wrote a great article including this tip recently specific to WooCommerce , but most eCommerce plugins have an add-on that will help restrict content . You could also use the Groups plugin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " group . <h> 5 . Use limited-time value adds like personalization <p> While offering coupons or other promotions for your new product can be one strategy to increase launch sales , creating value adds instead can be effective . This could be something like offering personalization of the product or a small complimentary product that goes with it . <p> You can do this easily with the WooCommerce Product Add-ons extension ( $49 ) , and can offer both free and paid add-ons to the the product . Once your promotional time period is over , you can remove the add-on , or make it paid . <p> WooCommerce Product Add-ons <h> 6 . Encourage product reviews <p> Reviews are extremely important for eCommerce sites , so gathering reviews should be a priority for your new product . While seeding your reviews may seem like an easy solution , you want to ensure that customers trust your reviews , so authentic reviews are your best bet . <p> Many eCommerce plugins include review capabilities already , even if they 're basic . You can add reviews to Easy Digital Downloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or add them to most any plugin with Easy Ecommerce Reviews ( $49 ) . <p> WooCommerce has built in reviews , but also offers an advanced reviews plugin : Product Reviews Pro ( $79 ) . <p> WooCommerce Product Reviews Pro <p> To encourage reviews , make sure you ask your first customers for them , and you can also incentivize them with discounts . You can create these manually and send them to customers , or automate this with WooCommerce Review for Discount ( $29 ) . <h> Market New Products with WordPress eCommerce <p> Building anticipation for new products by creating pre-orders , coupons in advance of launch , or promotional materials included in shipments can help you begin to market your new products before theyve even arrived . Once your product has been launched , you can continue to market it by informing existing customers its available , providing early access for loyal customers , creating value adds or promotions for the launch , partnering for promotions or giveaways , and encouraging product reviews from early customers . <p> There are lots of extensions available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are definitely more that we have n't listed .

@@98138065 @2338065/ <h> Partner <p> The one necessary plugin to create this WooCommerce wholesale system is WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing , which let 's you adjust pricing based on bulk discounts or user roles . However , one of the biggest complaints with Dynamic Pricing is how the wholesale discounts are displayed as sometimes its not possible to show your customers that they can get a discount . <h> WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing : Display Wholesale Pricing <p> First , when does WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing show your customers if they can get a discount ? <p> The plugin will show your customers they can get a discount if ( 1 ) they have the right role for the discount ( such as " Wholesale Customer " ) , and ( 2 ) if its a " simple " discount that does n't  require a minimum quantity . <p> For some shops , wholesale customers will always have a discounted price for some or all products , regardless of the quantity purchased . In this case , Dynamic Pricing will let the customer know that the product is discounted by using a strikethrough on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sale price ) . <p> For example , if a category discount only affects one category , and the minimum quantity required is 0 , your wholesale customers will see a discount available when viewing a product . <p> Create Wholesale Discount <p> Wholesale Discount Displayed <p> Non-wholesale customers will not see this discounted pricing displayed . <p> So what are other situations in which Dynamic Pricing will display a discounted price to wholesale customers ? First , if a role discount is active , as these do not require minimum purchases or complex rules ( they 're shop-wide ) . <p> Create Role Discounts <p> Role Discount Displayed <p> Second , if a category discount is active ( though these discounts do not depend on roles and will be shown to everyone ) . <p> Category Discount Created <p> Category Discounts displayed <p> And last , if a product-specific discount does n't  require a minimum purchase the discounted price is shown . <p> Create Product Discounts <p> Product Discount Displayed <p> However , once rules get more complicated than this , discounts may not be shown . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require minimum quantities or affect multiple categories , Dynamic Pricing does not display discounted prices . For example , I can set a pricing rule that let 's wholesale customers get a discount if 25 or more posters are purchased . <p> In this case , its not clear how the rule should be displayed : should a notice be displayed shop-wide ? Should it show on products in the poster category only ? Should it show for all quantities under 25 , or only when a minimum quantity is already in the cart , such as 10 posters ? <p> When a product has a more complex pricing rule added , it looks like any other product in the shop : <p> This probably is n't ideal , as you want to tell customers that they can get a discount ( especially if they expect a wholesale discount ! ) . If you 'd like to inform customers of more complex discounts , you can do so with a plugin that works alongside of Dynamic Pricing : WooCommerce Conditional Content . <h> Show Complex Discounts with WooCommerce Conditional Content <p> Since some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's you determine what should be shown to customers to inform them of the discount , and when it should be shown . <p> Let 's return to our example above : a 10% discount if 25 or more items in the " Poster " category are purchased . We can go to WooCommerce &gt; Content Blocks to set up a new conditional content message . <p> I can create a message that always displays , or depends on one or more of the following : <p> Product Type or Attributes <p> Product Page being viewed <p> Product Category <p> Product Price <p> Sale Starting / Ending Dates <p> On sale status <p> Stock Status or Level <p> Specific Customer or User Role <p> Cart Total ( Amount ) <p> Cart Product Quantity <p> Cart Category Quantity <p> Customers Country <p> In this case , I 'll create a message that only displays if the customer role is wholesale customer , if the product is in the " Poster " category , and if there are fewer than 25 posters in the cart . <p> New Conditional Content Notice <p> If these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product page : <p> Notice Displayed <p> If a product that 's not in the poster category is viewed , or more than 25 posters are in the cart , then the message will disappear . <p> WooCommerce Conditional Content becomes very helpful for discount rules that span several categories or become far more complex , and shop owners can determine what kind of message they want shown and when . <p> Let 's set up a 10% discount that will be added if 5 products from the " Music " or " Poster " categories are purchased . Well discount products in both of these categories by 10% if they meet the 5 item minimum : <p> Discount for Multiple Categories <p> I want to create a message that displays ( 1 ) if the product being viewed is in either of these categories , and ( 2 ) if there are fewer than 5 items in the cart from both the " Music " and " Poster " categories . I could also restrict the role again to " Wholesale Customer " if I wanted to . <p> Multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of CSS to my stylesheet so my message sticks out : <p> Now a message will be shown if a product is in one of these two categories , and the cart does not yet contain 5 items from either " Posters " or " Music " : <p> Styled Discount Message <p> Once the 5 item minimum is met , the notice will disappear , and items in the cart will be discounted : <p> Message Removed <h> Use Conditional Content to Display WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing Rules <p> WooCommerce Conditional Content is a great companion to WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing , as it let 's you determine how pricing rules and discounts are displayed to your customers , as well as when they 're shown . While Dynamic Pricing will display simple discount rules automatically , it does n't  display complex discount rules automatically , as they 're influenced by several factors and you may only want to display a message if a certain quantity is already in the cart . <p> Conditional Content let 's you create these customized messages to inform customers of potential discounts , and you can also determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Location Changed to Below Price <p> You can set messages based on several factors , such as customer role , product category , cart quantities , and others , and can use and / or logic to determine when these messages are shown . <p> These rules let you determine how youd like to inform customers of your Dynamic Pricing discounts or pricing tiers without the need to add them to product descriptions or via custom code . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138066 @2338066/ <h> How to add social sharing buttons to Easy Digital Downloads <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Your social media marketing can be an important branding and customer service strategy , so weve already discussed how to get better at social eCommerce . One of the things you can do is add sharing buttons to your product pages so that customers can easily share your products when visiting your store . <p> There are a couple of ways you can add social sharing buttons to Easy Digital Downloads to make sharing your products easier . First , there 's a handy Social Links extension available that offers several buttons styles and different social networks , and you can place buttons in a few different spots on the product page . Its only $6 , so its definitely worth the price . However , if you like to tinker with ( read : hack at ) your site , you might want to add these buttons in different places yourself , which well show you how to do today . <p> A couple suggestions before we get started : First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . here 's a tutorial on how to add code to WordPress if you 've never done this . Second , its helpful to ensure that your site is optimized for social sharing . There 's a free plugin ( WPSSO ) that will help with this , but the Pro version supports formatting EDD product shares as well . <h> Using Jetpack Sharing <p> If you 're okay with a more limited selection of buttons than the Social Links plugin ( or with manually adding your own buttons ) , you could use Jetpack sharing to add these buttons instead . You wont have the option to add the buttons in different locations , but this tutorial will walk through how to do this with custom code . Again , you could use the Social Links plugin if you 're not comfortable adding code or CSS to your site . <p> You can use Jetpack for the purposes of this tutorial , or the standalone Jetpack sharing module instead of you do n't  already use Jetpack or if you do n't  want to sign up for a WordPress.com account . <p> When you install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that you 're showing sharing buttons on download pages . <p> Sharing settings <p> This will display the sharing buttons at the bottom of every download page , right after your purchase links . <p> Default button placement <p> Note that I 've added a tiny bit of CSS to my child theme to center the social sharing buttons and remove the top border , which you can add to your own child theme if desired : <p> Ill be using the tiny styling tweak above throughout these examples . Please note that these code examples may not display in exactly the same way as they have here in your own theme , so you may have to tweak them further . <p> Choose one of the following examples to move your Jetpack sharing buttons on Easy Digital Downloads product pages . <h> 1 . Before Download Content <p> Let 's first move the download butttons above my content instead of after it . We can do so using this snippet : <p> Note that there are a couple things going on . First , we check to be sure the sharingdisplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we do n't  have errors . Next , we remove and re-add the sharing buttons in our desired place . In this case , the eddbeforedownloadcontent is used , which is only called on single download pages . This will add social sharing buttons after my download title on every download page . <p> Buttons after title <h> 2 . Before Purchase links <p> What if you want to display the buttons after the description instead ? We can use a very similar snippet , which will allow us to add sharing buttons right before the purchase link . Note that in this case , my snippet has to use an additional check : we have to use issingular ( 'download ' ) to be sure were on a single download page , since the eddpurchaselinktop action were using is also used for the downloads shortcode ( which you may use to create a " shop " page ) . <p> This will add social sharing buttons to all downloads right before the purchase link / " Add to cart " button instead . <p> Buttons before purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently use variable products , you may want to display your sharing buttons between the description and the variable pricing options . We can do this as well , but our snippet is getting a bit more complicated . <p> Well have to still check that our function exists and that were on a download page , but well also need to check that our product has variable pricing options . If it does , well add the buttons before the pricing options using the eddbeforepriceoptions action . If there are no variations , well need to add buttons using the eddpurchaselinktop action again since the eddbeforepriceoptions action wont exist on the page . <p> This will add buttons above and variation pricing options if they exist : <p> Above pricing options <p> Above pricing options <p> If variable pricing is not enabled for the product , the buttons will be added above the purchase link again instead : <p> No options : above purchase link <h> 4 . Below Product Images <p> Finally , what if you frequently use product images ? You may want to add social sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have an image , this probably wo n't apply to many stores , but we can filter the post thumbnail and tack the sharing display after it . <p> First , we check that the function exists and that were on a download page . Next , we see if the post has a thumbnail . If it does , we filter the thumbnail to add the sharing display after it . If there is no thumbnail , were going to add the sharing display right after the title again instead . <p> Now my single downloads will show sharing buttons right after the image if set : <p> Buttons below image <p> If there is no featured image , then sharing buttons will display in the same place as they did in my first snippet right after the download title : <p> No image : below title <p> I 'd love to hear about it if you end up using this trick on your site ! Link up your download page in the comments = . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Great ideas Beka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much about social sharing buttons and its importance when building a website for your business . Also , as I go on with my search for more information about it , I stumble upon this article LONG ... which gives me relevant results and ideas too but your post is much more interesting and is easy to understand . By the way , do you happen to have any more ideas on what kind of social sharing practice would a beginner use when building a site in the near future ? Hope to hear your thoughts about this . Thanks ! <p> Hey Gene , so glad to hear this was helpful ! One of the extensions I like for Easy Digital Downloads is great for a new site because it encourages customers to share your products to get the word out about them . You can give them a discount for sharing your products using Social Discounts . I recommend using sharing buttons near your purchase button ( I prefer to use them after it ) , but this would make a good testing point move them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most shares over time .

@@98138067 @2338067/ <h> How to discount Easy Digital Downloads Payment Methods <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Todays Ask Sell with WP question comes from Piotr : <p> How can I give discounts for using a payment method with Easy Digital Downloads ? I want to encourage my customers to use something other than PayPal , so I want to give a discount for other payment methods or something to discourage paying in PayPal . <p> There 's a really useful Easy Digital Downloads extension that can help out you discount Easy Digital Downloads payment methods : Gateway Fees . This let 's you add a fee based on which gateway is selected at checkout . This can let you easily charge a fee for a particular payment method when its selected at checkout . <p> You simply set the name of the fee , which will be displayed in the cart when its added , and the fee amount ( whether its a flat fee or its based on a cart percentage ) . You can set this fee easily under Settings &gt; Payment Gateways . <p> This could be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be shown in the cart when added . This means that customers would have to pay $0.50 more just to use PayPal , encouraging the use of other payment methods . <p> However , you may not want to display this as a fee , and instead want to use a discount for other payment methods . The best part about the Easy Digital Downloads Fee API ( which is what this extension uses ) is that it accepts negative values . <p> You can add a negative flat fee for other payment methods , and this can serve as a discount for using those methods over PayPal . When customers select a non-PayPal method , the discount is applied , and when PayPal is selected , the discount is removed . <p> I like to make this more obviously , so you can add a simple notice below the payment method selector to do so : <p> This adds a notice to checkout if PayPal is selected . You can change this to another payment mode if you 'd like to change when the notice appears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that discounts are available for using other methods . Nothing will be displayed when a discounted method is selected . <p> PayPal notice <p> No notice <p> You can style your notice however youd like since we 've given it the edd-fee-notice class . here 's the CSS I 've added to my stylesheet in this example , but you can adjust it or change these colors to match your theme . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138068 @2338068/ <h> Partner <p> I 'm looking for advanced options in Coupons . I would like to find how can I disable or use 1 or more coupons depending on the payment gateway in WooCommerce that customers select . Especially , I want to discourage customers from using Cash on Delivery ( but I need to keep offering this payment method ) . If customers want to use this payment method , theyd have to pay more or wont enjoy a discount . <p> Is it possible do this with WooCommerce ? Thanks a lot ! <p> There 's not really an easy way to only apply coupons if a certain gateway is selected unfortunately . While you could probably do this with some custom code , using a fee or discount based on the gateway is probably a far easier solution to implement . There are a couple of ways you could achieve a setup like this . <p> First , you could use the Payment Gateway Based Fees plugin for $49 . This will allow you to add a range of fees , including an additional fee for a payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee for the Cash on Delivery gateway ) . You can add fees for multiple gateways if desired . <p> Fees can be for a set amount or for a percentage of the order total , and you can also set a minimum order total to trigger the fee . This may be a bit overkill for this problem , but if you plan to add other fees to your shop , its a tool worth looking into , as there are several fee types that can be added . <p> As unexpected fees can be a negative thing to encounter at checkout , you may want to reframe this for customers . Instead of charging a gateway fee , you could offer discounts for using gateways youd like to encourage customers to choose ( and perhaps make this a very nominal fee or increase shipping costs to compensate ) . The freeWooCommerce Payment Discounts plugin can be used to do this instead . <p> Amount or percentage-based fees can be added for every payment method installed in your shop . <p> Add payment method discounts <p> Customers wont see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway , though they will see which gateways offer a discount . <p> No discount <p> If an eligible gateway is selected , the discount is applied to the order total . <p> Discount applied <p> These are the two options I 'd consider to encourage customers to use a particular gateway . <p> As a side note , I 'd also had someone mention this plugin , but its not compatible with WooCommerce 2.1+ and it seems like there may have been issues with PayPal . You might want to keep an eye on it in case it is updated at some point , but it wont work until an update is released . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

You can embed polls in your emails to get higher completion rates for your surveys . This gives you better feedback , and does n't  let the <p> At the end of this post , well take a look at the main takeaways from the last few email case studies that have focused on survey emails . But first , let 's take a look at two survey email examples with polls included in the body of the email . <h> Embed polls in survey emails : Amazon product review <p> Content : The email clearly states that the feedback will take a minute to complete . In addition , the email includes useful details like the image of the product , estimated delivery date , and seller name . <p> Rating parameters : The email is very specific about what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rate the product , the copy defines the parameters regarding the rating . <p> Links : The email copy is relatively bare with the focus primarily on the rating . But , useful links are included at the bottom of the email to easily navigate to things related to the purchase . <p> There 's not a lot that this email lacks . Overall , it is very well organized , with the focus clearly on the rating . The only nitpick would be that the email is very utilitarian , and not very personal in tone . There 's a lot of brand loyalty and recognition for Amazon , so this is not a big factor for them . But , for small eCommerce store owners , personalizing emails conversational tone , signed by an individual along with the title of that person , etc. can go a long way in building a connection with the customer . <h> Embed polls in survey emails : Groupon customer service feedback <p> Copy : The copy in the email is very short and focuses on the feedback options . This makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email . <p> Further feedback : Once an option is selected , it triggers a separate survey that you can choose to complete . In this way , Groupon at least gets feedback on whether broadly a customer was satisfied or unsatisfied , even if they do n't  complete the rest of the survey . <p> Conversation reminder : The full conversation transcript is appended to the bottom of the email . This makes it easy to refer back to , without getting in the way of the call-to-action . <p> The bad is similar to the Amazon example where the email can be personalized ( a lot more in the case of Groupon ) . The email simply says " Hello " rather than including the receivers name . Instead of being signed by the generic " Groupon Customer Service " , it can be personalized more by being signed by a relevant individual , for example , John Doe , Manager at Groupon Customer Service . <p> This helps humanize the interaction and makes customers feel that there are people on the other side of the conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What gets you to click ? <p> The main thing in both emails is the ease of providing feedback . The embedded rating and poll allows you to respond with a single click . In both examples , the survey stands out from the rest of the copy visually . <p> The copy in the email is very short and to-the-point . There is no fluffy language or detailed content that gets in the way of the main purpose of the email , which is to get a feedback response . In the Amazon email , there are links at the bottom for more detailed information . For the Groupon email , the conversation is appended to the bottom of the email so that customers just have to scroll down for details . <h> Embed polls in survey emails : MailChimp polls <p> Most email management platforms provide the ability to embed polls within emails . In the example below , we will use MailChimp to create a simple survey . <p> You do n't  have to separately create the survey within MailChimp . Once you get to the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a poll within your email . <p> Build an embedded poll in MailChimp <p> You can choose to customize the questions and the functionality of the poll . For the above example , the tags create two poll questions in your email body . <p> You can also integrate other platforms if you primarily use those for your feedback surveys . For example , you can integrate SurveyMonkey with MailChimp to create and send surveys to your email list . <h> Embed polls in survey emails : Summary <p> Customers are much more likely to complete a survey or a poll that is embedded within the body of the email . The embedded poll makes it really easy for customers to fill out without navigating to a website . This can greatly increase the completion rate of your polls . <p> In general , try to make the survey relatively short 3 to 5 questions . Embed the question or poll that helps you drive a key metric , or gives you a broad understanding of the metric . In the above examples , Amazon asks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Groupon only has two options whether you were satisfied or unsatisfied with the customer service . Once you click on an option , the email triggers a further survey that you can choose to fill . In a similar way , if you have more questions , or have questions that require text comments , you can trigger a link to the survey after you get the initial feedback . This way , you at least get a response for the main point of the survey . <p> Our last few email case studies ( The Den and Clearly ) have centered around feedback emails . Below are the key takeaways from this series of case studies : <p> Provide a reward to incentivize customers to fill out the survey , like providing store credit or discount on a future purchase . <p> Clearly state how long it will take to complete the survey and keep this duration short ( like 10-15 seconds ) . You can include this in the subject line as well as the body of the email . <p> Embed polls in the feedback emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ideas that help get you better results from feedback emails ? Please tell us in the comments below . <h> 2 Comments <p> Thanks for this ! A lot of great tips on how to include poll and boost engagement in emails . I find writing my email in such a way that makes my information gathering relevant to my readers really helps . Even if they do n't  get anything from filling out the survey , being interested in the results is sometimes incentive enough to participate .

@@98138071 @2338071/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> Any eCommerce store , regardless of what software powers it , will need to handle customer service inquiries . Handling these inquiries effectively and quickly is a necessity for your store , as customers expect prompt , useful replies in order to stay loyal to your brand . <p> In fact , in a recent survey of top eCommerce stores from Shopify , providing great customers service was a key to more sales mentioned by 10 of the 25 stores ( and they could provide any tip that was geared towards improving revenue ) . Rather than focus on marketing or customer acquisition , this advice heavily favored keeping your existing customers happy . <p> While managing customer service inquiries with a one-person team is n't too difficult , scaling customer service while remaining effective can be tricky to navigate . This article will focus only on email inquiries , and I 'll tell you a bit more about my favorite tool for managing customer emails : Help Scout . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Even after using it for over a year , I still love it . <p> Help Scout helps our team manage all customer emails : pre-sales questions , support inquiries , refunds , and general questions . As I 'm sure your customers get in touch with similar inquiries , it can be a life-saver while managing these among several team members . Its not just something for software companies or tech companies : its email " support " or management for any company . <p> Help Scout makes customer service email management simple for shop employees , and your customers wont have to create accounts or log into help desks : for them , Help Scout is just email ; they get emails and can reply to them . This removes tons of barriers for getting in touch with you or communicating with your team . <p> Help Scout offers 15 day trials of the service , and pricing starts at $0 and increases depending on the number of users ( customer service accounts ) you need . <p> The free plan can be used with 3 users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Help Scout API or reports ( which I do love ) . This plan will also include Help Scout links in the footer of your emails . <p> If you choose to upgrade to a paid plan , you 'll pay $15 per user per month , and you get access to all features at any level . For a three-person service team , youd pay $45 per month , and would have an unlimited number of mailboxes , as well as full access to all Help Scout features . <h> 1 . Email is n't Enough : Creating a Service Team <p> So back up : why do you need something like Help Scout ? Why cant you just share an email account among your team members ? <p> You could . But in my experience , sharing an email account is extremely inefficient . Let 's say you use one Gmail address for all customer service inquiries in your shop . This means that anyone answering these emails has to log into this account to read and respond to them . <p> Here are some issues that can easily arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidentally marked read before a reply is sent , making the status of the inquiry unclear . Has it been answered ? Is someone just looking into this ? Is it awaiting a reply ? <p> If more than one team member uses the account , you can easily send multiple answers to the same customer . <p> There 's no easy way to see previous emails from a customer so you have a history of communication . <p> There 's no easy way to leave notes or questions for other team members . Forwarding emails with notes is insufficient and asking for trouble , as they can accidentally be sent to the customer . <p> There 's no way to " assign " an email to someone on the team , i.e. , assign refund emails to someone that can process them . <p> All of the issues that arise from using a shared email account are solved by a service like Help Scout . It provides basic " ticket " management , as shop employees can assign emails , add internal notes , and view the conversation history for a customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if needed to manage different kinds of emails for example , you could create different mailboxes for each of your brands or departments . <p> A single email account can work great if one person is answering emails . However , as soon as you add more employees into the mix , managing email effectively becomes far more challenging . Help Scout provides the tools you need to take email customer service to the next level . <h> 2. eCommerce Plugin Integrations <p> Help Scout has some existing integrations with eCommerce plugins that can augment your customer service management and save your employees time . First , both Easy Digital Downloads and WooCommerce can be used with Help Scout to display customer details right in your Help Scout dashboard . Details on customer accounts and orders drastically simplify your teams management . <p> For example , when Yoast integrated Help Scout with their EDD shop , they were able to cut the average time per response down tremendously : <p> Where our average time per question had been 5 to 7 minutes , having all of our clients info easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 minutes . Yoast <p> While they used a custom integration to do so , you can get your customer information from Easy Digital Downloads into Help Scout using the free EDD Help Scout integration . This will display customer information such as payments and recent purchases , as well as the payment method used , while viewing a customer email in Help Scout . <p> Help Scout can also connect to WooCommerce in the same way via the Help Scout WooCommerce app ( you can enable this in the Help Scout dashboard ) . <p> This gives you information about the customer and recent orders so your team can more effectively communicate with customers about orders , and links to them on your site for quick reference . You 'll see information like customer lifetime value in the sidebar as well . <p> WooCommerce can also bring Help Scout to your site using the Help Scout extension . This will add communication management directly on your site . Customers can quickly start a conversation from the " My Account " page and view all conversations here without leaving your eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some customer service management systems are clunky or will be overkill for your stores needs . For example , if you 're only managing pre-sales and support emails ( such as refund requests ) across a few people , something like Zendesk will probably be overkill . <p> Help Scout will give you the features you need without lots of features that you do n't  . Here are some of my favorites : <p> The reporting is fantastic . You can see details on how long replies take , the handle time for how long you ( or a team member ) spend on email tickets , emails per team member , happiness ratings ( customers can vote whether your responses are helpful ) , the average number of emails per month , and more . I evaluate these for our team every month using the built-in reports . <p> While Help Scout is easy to set up , there are some advanced features to automate your customer service emails . You can set up workflows to do this for you . For example , you can automatically tag emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have some emails tagged with " VIP " for customers that email from a certain company or have spent a large amount of money with us . <p> I can set up automatic tagging by matching email addresses exactly , or by matching the end of the email address ( with the company email ) . <p> Workflows will also allow you to automatically assign emails to a team member based on subject or tag . This is pretty helpful for emails that come from our contact form , as the subject is pre-filled and the email can be categorized accordingly . This can be useful to assign refund emails to the appropriate team member . <p> You can create custom views based on email data . For example , emails that have gone over 24 hours without a reply can be placed in an " Overdue " folder to ensure they 're addressed immediately . <p> Help Scout allows you to create saved replies and auto replies . Auto replies are simply auto responders for all emails , while saved replies are templates that help you speed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship history for a customer . This will show you all email conversations as well as customer information , and you can even integrate third-party CRMs , live chat software , or other services here to track all communication with a customer . <p> Relationship History <h> Summary <p> Do you need to manage customer service emails with Help Scout if your store only has one person managing email ? Probably not . However , as your team gets larger and grows with your store , you 'll need the right tool for the job to ensure email management stays effective yet streamlined . When you get to this point , I highly recommend Help Scout . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138072 @2338072/ <h> Managing WooCommerce Wholesale Customers <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Mondays post discussed creating a wholesale system with WooCommerce . While this article covered a bit on creating wholesale customers , it did n't  discuss how I typically manage those customers or add new wholesale buyers . <p> Ill first describe in a bit more detail how to manually create wholesale customers , then how to accept wholesale customer applications and approve them . <h> Manually Creating WooCommerce Wholesale Customers <p> Many shops with wholesale buyers will add the wholesale customer manually , as a discussion via email or phone often takes place before adding the customer as a wholesale buyer . <p> Manually creating wholesale customers requires nothing but the User Role Editor plugin as described in our previous article . The new role is created , and then a shop admin can go to Users &gt; Add New and manually create the wholesale customer , then assign the role of " wholesale customer " . <p> Manual create <p> This immediately grants the wholesale buyer the ability to purchase products in your WooCommerce store using any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customers <p> However , what if you want to allow the open application of WooCommerce wholesale customers ? Chances are you 'd like to review these applications before approving the user and granting them the ability to take advantage of wholesale pricing . <p> You can do so with a few additional plugins and a small bit of custom code . <p> First , well need to create our application , and use this to create a user for the prospective wholesale customer . The easiest way I 've found to do this is to use Gravity Forms ( developer license ) and the User Registration Add-on . This will let me create the application form , and its submission will create a new user . <p> Create your Gravity Form under " Forms " , and include all fields that youd like as part of your application , as well as fields for user data like username or password . <p> Once your form has been created , well need to tie user data to the right fields . You can do this under Forms &gt; User Registration and create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then mapped the form fields to the appropriate user data such as first name , username , password , and others . <p> Once you 've saved both the form and the user registration tie-in , you can put it on a page on your site . Prospective wholesale customers can apply via this form , and you can even automatically set the role to " wholesale customer " when the new user account is created . <p> There 's one problem with this setup : the user is automatically created when the form is submitted , which does n't  give you a chance to review the form before allowing the new user to access wholesale pricing . Well need one more step to fix this . <h> Approving WooCommerce Wholesale Customers <p> The New User Approve plugin will ensure that we can hold all new user applications for approval . This plugin sets all new user accounts on your site to " pending " until you manually approve a user ( or approve them in bulk ) . <p> When this plugin is active , all new applications via your Gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can approve when you 've reviewed the form . <p> Approve Wholesale customer <p> You can read the application , then approve the account for the correct username . <p> Of course , it ca n't be this easy . There 's one very important issue here : if you allow customer registration on your site at checkout or on the my account page , these accounts will also be held for approval . This will hang your checkout process and break it if a user registers an account at checkout , and the user never sees the " Thank You " page . <p> We obviously do n't  want this to happen , and we want to automatically approve all new customer accounts . Fortunately , the New User Approve plugin contains some helpful methods to check the user status and approve the user , which well do when WooCommerce creates the account . <p> This code snippet will auto-approve customer accounts , and can be placed in a custom plugin or functions.php file : <p> Now customer accounts will be treated differently than new wholesale customer applications . While the wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or use the account , regular customers will be approved automatically when they 're created . <p> Auto-approved customer <p> This method will ensure that user approval gets out of the way of your WooCommerce stores customer accounts , but that your WooCommerce wholesale customers must have an approved application before they have access to your store . <h> Pros and Cons <p> Manually creating wholesale customers gives you the most control over your wholesaler program , and requires no additional plugins or integrations to create your wholesale customers . <p> However , this can become tedious if you accept open applications for your wholesale program , as you 'll need to gather emails and enter all user details to get a wholesale customer set up . Automating account creation via a form can simplify this process and ensure that you only have to review / approve a wholesale customer , but requires some additional cost and setup . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 9 Comments <p> I just want to say THANK YOU for posting this and the previous article ! This helped me so much , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find anywhere online that helped me half as much as this . THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ! <p> Also , just wanted to point out 3 things for others that are looking at this . <p> In the previous article ( part 1 ) a girl commented that she used the " Price by user Role " plugin this helped tremendously , and was free . I searched online and there are plenty of $50 off coupons for Gravity forms . $199 is a bit steep , when I was hoping this would work , but i followed the instructions in this article and can confirm that it does . I had never used Gravity Forms before , but it was very simple and I 'll be using them on all of my sites . My application only differed from the authors in the fact that I do not need to approve the wholesale accounts . But what I did need to happen was for the newly created account to be automatically logged in . This took some snooping , but on the Gravity forms forums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy solution . <p> I 'm not generally a commenter , but this helped me so much I just really wanted to show appreciation to the author , and maybe provide a little help to other readers . <p> I found myself reading through this because of a need in my sandwich shop to allow multiple users from the same company to access the account . The idea being that if one person is away then another person can log in to the site with their credentials and see the purchase history of other registered users from the same company . This way they can re-order and , if necessary edit a previous order rather than having to start a new order all over again . <p> So , I do n't  really need wholesale prices but I do need multiple users from the same company being able to access the one account . 
@@98138073 @2338073/ <h> Why You Should Be Using KISSmetrics with WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is a guest post from Jason Glaspey , founder of PaleoPlan.com and co-founder of the Portland Incubator Experiment ( PIE ) . Jason enjoys working to build small startups and helping to make it easier for people to follow a Paleo diet using Paleo Plan . <p> It took me several years of selling products online before I really began taking steps to understand my audience and to truly attempt to optimize my site and store for conversions . Part of the reason was I was overwhelmed with other tasks , but that was mainly just lip service . The real reason was I was a bit nervous and scared . Of what ? Mainly what I did n't knowthis was an area I had very little experience , and its always easier to focus on what you 're good at than what you 're bad at . That 's where KISSmetrics analytics for WooCommerce comes in . <p> I understand the theory of a/b testing , and the theory of understanding Lifetime Customer Value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about measuring them , nor what tools I could use , or if I could even get those tools properly set up . So I ignored those metrics and a host of other important data points . <p> Then , after 3.5 years of running Paleo Plan , I finally realized that I 'd solved most of the problems I was good at , and it was time to start solving problems I was n't good at . So , I bit the bullet and took my first serious look at KISSmetrics . <h> KISSmetrics with WooCommerce <p> And with the WooCommerce KISSmetrics extension , it even anticipates pretty much everything you 're going to want to track , and turns those events on by default . All you have to do is find your KISSmetrics API key , and paste it into the WooCommerce KISSmetrics settings page . This took under 1 minute . <p> And BANG ! Just like that I had a working version of KISSmetrics , helping me identify a HUGE number of data sets that were previously either completely hidden in Google Analytics , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't a developer and was n't able to pull the types of complex reports I needed . <p> here 's an example of one dashboard I have set up in KISSmetrics . <p> You can quickly tell your current revenue , free trial conversion rates , signups , cancellations , on and on and on . And this is just one of the dashboards . <p> I wish I 'd figured out much earlier that this was so easy to set up , and would have started collecting user-data even if I was n't ready to be acting on it . Because now , I only have the data since I installed the extension and turned on KISSmetrics , rather than years of historical data that could have shed light on a number of other things . However , moving forward , I 'm collecting data , and can learn more about KISSmetrics , what numbers and data points I want to compare or analyze , and be able to go back and see reports from now on , even if I 'm not running those reports at the moment . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what reports I may find useful later , but I 'm at least collecting the information so I 'm able to move forward when I 'm ready . <p> However , I 've already found several things useful , and used it to immediately identify some weaknesses in my sales funnel and have thus increased my conversions and as such , my revenue .

We 'd previously written about 5 awesome free WooCommerce themes , and we got requests for more . Why ? Because finding good , free WooCommerce themes is hard . When we test free WooCommerce themes , we eliminate twice as many themes as we include . <p> So how do you pick a WooCommerce theme ? If you 're starting out with a new store , you 'll probably be tempted to pick a theme based on what the homepage looks like in the demo , or how many crazy options or plugin the theme includes . However , this is n't the best thing to do for your store . <p> When you choose a WooCommerce theme , its important to pay attention to the way the shop is styled and how the theme does so . Many free themes ( and even some paid ones ! ) ignore WooCommerce pages and instead just use the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the site . <p> You 'll also want to go to WooCommerce &gt; System Status when the theme is active and scroll to the bottom . This will tell you if any templates are being overridden and if they 're out of date . While overriding a couple of templates is n't a big deal , overriding more than a few templates or having out-of-date templates is a bad sign for future upgrades of WooCommerce while using this theme . At some point , its likely that your theme will break with an update , and avoiding updates is not the solution to this problem a better theme is . <p> If you 're looking for an inexpensive theme to get your store launched , you do n't  have to sacrifice a shop that looks great with the rest of your site . Here are some free WooCommerce themes that style WooCommerce pages to blend in with your site in an upgrade-safe way . <h> Artificer WooThemes <p> Artificer is developed by WooThemes , the parent company behind WooCommerce . Artificer is an older WooCommerce theme , but its still updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a static page or recent / featured products , and shop pages blend in with the theme styling . <h> Bearded Bonfire Lab <p> Bearded is developed by Bonfire Lab , and is available for download via GitHub . Bearded is a responsive theme that features a widgetized homepage that even has a couple of WooCommerce widgets available . You can view a live demo before giving it a try . <p> Shop and product pages are consistent with the rest of the theme : <p> Shop Page <p> Product Page <p> However , there are a couple things to pay attention to . There are a handful of templates that are overridden , and one that 's out of date , but this did n't  cause any issues for me while using the theme . The shop page also displays 3 columns , but 10 products , which leaves an orphaned product in your last row . You can change this pretty easily with a bit of code or something like the WooCommerce Customizer . <h> Barely Making the Cut : <h> Kidshop YiThemes <p> Kidshop is developed by YiTHemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for toys , childrens products , and more . You can check out a live demo of it in action if you want to get an idea of what it looks like . <p> The shop and product pages will blend in with the rest of your site : <p> Shop page <p> Product page <p> However , there are a couple of things to be aware of with this theme , which is why it barely makes our cut . First , it overrides tons of WooCommerce templates and some are outdated . This means that the theme could break with future WooCommerce updates , and this also messes with a few styling options . <p> As you may notice in the shop screenshot , the products-per-row display is off . Youd have to fix this template to set the correct number of columns per page , as the filter you should be able to use to change this has no effect ( meaning they 've done something to this template ) .

We have a good deal of repeat customers , so we have to take care of them . <p> What is the biggest benefit of your Sand Dollars rewards program ? <p> What 's nice about reward points is that they encourage customers to register and stay connected with our company . The Sand Dollars are shown on the product page and at the cart level . This gives customers the extra incentive to purchase . <p> Any plans for the future of Sand Dollars ? <p> We have not done a great job promoting the program , but plan to give it a boost via email . Since we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafood lovers who have stuck with us . We have close to 90K email subscribers .

Vitruvian uses Sensei to power two online classes , supplementing the in-person classes they run on location . <p> Sensei is n't truly a WooCommerce extension since it focuses on creating and managing courses ( and can be used without WooCommerce ) , but it integrates seamlessly with WooCommerce to sell access to those courses . Sensei can be used to easily create a WooCommerce-powered e-learning or membership site . <p> I asked David Jamieson , one of the founders of Vitruvian , a few questions about using WooCommerce with Sensei : <p> How important is Sensei to your business model ? <p> Were still primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from students enrolled in classes in the studio , and we currently have just two online courses available . Those courses , however , have become centerpieces of our entire catalog . <p> Our Sensei courses extend the reach of our teaching , allowing us to help students from around the world who would otherwise not be able to learn with us . They also provide an attractive alternative even for our on-ground students who find the ability to pause and re-watch video lessons to be a helpful supplement to their work with us in the studio . <p> Lastly , the revenue these courses generate helps to " fill in the gaps " of the inevitable fluctuation of on-ground enrollment . Prior to using Sensei to offer online instruction , a significant drop in on-ground enrollment could pose something of a crisis . Selling courses online has helped insulate us from the unpredictable flux in revenue from on-ground students " and we expect this benefit to amplify as we add more online courses to our catalog . <p> What have you found most useful about Sensei ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tight integration with WooCommerce . An online course is nothing more than a sequence of content , which could be easily presented in a series of blog posts . Controlling access to that content , and charging for it , makes things a little trickier . Since we were using WooCommerce already on our site , it was an easy decision to use Sensei for our courses . <p> Do you have any advice for other businesses that are considering using Sensei ? <p> Sensei itself is so well thought out and easy to use that there 's no reason not to give it a try especially if you 're already running a WordPress site with WooCommerce . But I do have two suggestions : First , take advantage of the extensions available for Sensei . My favorite is Sensei Modules , which allows courses to be organized into content blocks or " modules " each containing a number of lessons . It really enhances the presentation and navigability of longer courses . <p> And second , take content creation seriously . Sensei provides an elegant way to organize course content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Learn about video production ( shooting and editing ) , audio recording , and writing clear and instructive copy . Or , if you have the budget , hire professionals to do these things for you . <p> I found it particularly interesting that Vitruvian has been able to use Sensei to smooth their income from fluctuations in on-the-ground class participation . <h> Accept Bitcoin With BitPay to Stay at the Cutting Edge <p> Lamassu is the worlds most popular Bitcoin ATM . Customers wanting to operate a Bitcoin ATM out of a popular location such as a cafe , co-working space , or mall can purchase a Douru cash to bitcoin machine from Lamassu for $6,500 . <p> I asked Zach Harvey , the Co-Founder of Lamassu , some questions about using WooCommerce and BitPay . <p> What plugin or extension do you use to accept bitcoin payments in your business ? <p> We use the BitPay plugin for our website . Payments processing is completely free , which is refreshing , having worked with credit card processing in the past . <p> Do you have any advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would advise any company to start accepting Bitcoin . Its more secure , cheaper and there are no chargebacks . It 's also more convenient for customers who use Bitcoin . Like a website in the mid 90s , its better to get familiarized early on , than having to learn once your competitors already have a grasp on it . <p> You do n't  have to be a cryptocurrency business to accept bitcoin ( or other cryptocurrency payments ) in your online store . As Zach pointed out , payment processing with cryptocurrencies can be free or cheaper than using credit card processing . <h> Use Subscriptions to Get People Excited About Breaky Again <p> Yousli is a gourmet online muesli store based in Melbourne , Australia .

@@98138077 @2338077/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> If you 're setting up an online shop for the first time , there 's a lot that will probably be confusing , such as how to register your domain name , what an SSL certificate or PCI compliance is , and how to set up your first WordPress shop . However , there are also a lot of you out there that have gone through this process already , but may want to revisit some of the choices you 've made when setting up your site . One choice I 'd like to examine in this article is choosing a domain name registrar ( I 'd also check out our article on DNS services ) . <h> What is a Domain Name Registrar ? <p> Okay , chances are you already know this , but for the newcomers in the crowd , let 's review . A domain name registrar is a company who registers your domain name ( for example , ours is sellwithwp.com ) , processes name transfers , or handles renewals . Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to find your site , rather than memorizing IP numbers for the server on which your site is hosted . Obviously , if you changed the server for your site , people would n't be able to find you , and youll probably end up changing hosting at least once to find the right hosting company for you . Registering a domain name that points to where your site " lives " is a far more user-friendly way for people to find you and you can easily change the server(s) to which your domain name points so you 're free to change hosting if needed . <p> So how can any of these companies be different from one another if all they do is register an unused domain name ( or transfer a used one ) to you or allow you to renew the domain names you have ? You would be surprised . Security is one issue , as you do n't  want your domain name hijacked or shut down , which eliminates your ability to do business . Customer service is also another important factor to consider if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Price is also a sticking point for many people , but I 'd argue that if you 're going to make a livelihood from your website , you should invest in quality building blocks , which includes a reputable , ICANN accredited domain name registrar . Pricing will usually range from $10 to $50 per year ( you 'll usually renew each year ) . <p> This is what you 're looking for : <h> What qualities should I look for ? <p> GoDaddy is the most popular domain name registrar in the business , but remember that popularity does n't  always mean quality ( such as some issues with stolen domains see this and this , or google " godaddy domain stolen " ) . <p> You should look for a domain registrar that will contact you directly with issues and will resolve them without exorbitant fees . Test out their response time with a basic email question and see if you 're satisfied with the response ( scratch them off the list if its longer than 24 hours or so ) , and inquire as to how support is handled ( whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking out reviews of the services you 're looking into should be a must . One place you can check is the Web Hosting Talk forum . You may not think customer service will be that important for what appears to be a one-time purchase , but remember that this is how people get to your site . If anything is wrong with your domain name , nobody can find you , and you make $0 . <p> You also want to keep your hosting separate from your domain name registration . Many companies that provide hosting will include domain name registration for free do n't  take it . The minimal yearly costs of registering the domain yourself are worth the freedom it affords you . If your web host has registered the domain , then you 're not free to leave if you 're unhappy with the hosting service without paying name transfer fees , and they know this . Youve essentially locked yourself into the same company for both services , as you cant change your domain name or your hosting freely without one affecting the other . Keeping this separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend looking at ancillary services available from each company . For example , some domain name registrars will provide included email forwarding ( forwarding an email @yourdomain to an email you choose ) , DNS services ( more on this tomorrow ) , or Whois privacy ( checkout the linked article for why you want this ) . I prefer Namecheap , who is fairly awesome , and offers email forwarding and Whois privacy . However , I would n't recommend using their DNS services . Another option is DNSimple , who is focused more on DNS hosting security and would therefore be a better all-in-one solution , but is slightly more expensive overall . There are some other great options out there as well , so I would n't limit your options to only those services .

The core plugin also includes two integrations that were previously sold at $20 each : Stripe and PayPal Pro / Express , making even more of a steal . <p> The only pricing change is the elimination of the " Unlimited + Extensions " bundle , as two major extensions are now included , and another ( Braintree ) is free . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.1 : Improved Installation and Setup <p> RCP 2.1 includes some excellent user-facing changes , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that I think users will love are the re-organized settings and improved installation .

The core payment integrations already take advantage of these changes , such as the ability for members to cancel memberships . <p> The improved payments API also makes it easier to develop and add new payment integrations to Restrict Content Pro , as it provides a base class that developers can extend and work from to create new payment integrations . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.1 : Managing Memberships <p> As part of the improved payment integrations , member management is also improved . Both site administrators and members can now cancel memberships . For recurring payments , members will see a " cancel " link when viewing subscription details .

@@98138080 @2338080/ <h> Change Shop Messages or Text to Fit Your Brand <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I love that many eCommerce plugins for WordPress make it easy to set up and launch a shop without tons of configuration . However , as you 're running your shop , you may want to fine-tune what the plugin does , such as change colors , product page display , how images are presented , or other parts of your site . <p> One change that shop owners tend to make is to update the messages or content in their shop . For example , what does your shop say to a customer if the cart is empty ? What if they 've tried to create an account but they already have one ? You can use these messages to echo your brands tone and tailor them to your shop . <p> Many times , plugins will make this content easy for you to change by placing filters around messages or text ( such as " Add to Cart " text ) , which can be used to change this content programmatically . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product pages using a filter . I could change the tab name for the " Additional Information " tab if desired : <p> By adding a custom code snippet , I can shorten it to " Additional Info " instead : <p> These filters allow you to make site-wide changes in your content or messaging so your shop blends in with the overall tone of your site . <p> However , there 's not always a filter in place to change the text you 're looking for . In that case , you can usually translate the text instead , and there 's a very useful plugin to help you change shop messages via translation : Say What . <h> When to Translate Text <p> While translating text is n't the optimal solution to this problem ( using filters or actions is better ) , its an easy way to make a change to your sites content that could n't otherwise be made . You can translate text to change it if ( 1 ) no filter exists to help you achieve this , and ( 2 ) you do n't  need to translate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a translation plugin to provide a multi-lingual site , you do n't  want to use this method and you 'll have to override templates or find a workaround instead . Since you 'll actually be using the translations in that situation , you do n't  want to then override them in one language only . If your site is only available in one language , then this will work for you . <p> Well also need to ensure that translation is possible to use this method , as not every string is the same in code as it is on the frontend of your site ( it could contain HTML or other variables ) . I recommend searching the . pot file usually to see if a string is translatable ( search for a couple key words from the phrase ) . If you 're looking through the plugin source code instead , you 'll look for text wrapped in ( ) , e() , or x() functions . <h> Using Say What to Change Text <p> The Say What plugin will perform translations on the fly so that you can update text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . <p> Let 's take an example of text that ca n't be changed via filter , but can be translated . If you look at an empty cart page for a WooCommerce site , you 'll see a generic empty cart message : <p> Original empty cart text <p> First , let 's see if we can change this via a filter . The easiest way to see if there 's a filter is to search the plugin folder or public repository ( here 's the one for WooCommerce ) for this phrase . When I search the WooCommerce repository for this empty cart phrase , I find that its part of the empty cart template , and that there 's no filter available to change this text . <p> It is , however , translatable since its wrapped in our e() function ( or we could have checked the . pot file for this string if we had n't  found a filter ) . This means we can " translate " this text to replace it with our own content instead of displaying a boring , lifeless message . Well use Say What to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our admin after installing it . Well enter the original string and what wed like to change to : <p> Enter text changes <p> And now well see these changes on the frontend of our site : <p> New Empty Cart text <p> Note that you must enter the original string exactly the way it is in the plugin or . pot file in order to translate it . This is where things can get tricky , and I recommend checking out the . pot file to see what the original string contains ( for example , if there 's HTML you should replicate in your new string ) . <h> Text Domains <p> The last part of our translation is to use the text domain for your plugin . Each plugin has a unique text domain , and this can usually be found in the plugin documentation or by opening up the main plugin file in your text editor . For example , if I 'm looking at Easy Digital Downloads , I can open up the plugins folder and look at top of the **26;1122;TOOLONG file to see the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> here 's a list of text domains for some major plugins to get you started : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138081 @2338081/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> Okay before we start , let 's talk about why hosting matters . I want you to think about your own browsing behavior . If you go to a site , and the home page takes a long time to load , images do n't  show up within a couple seconds , or you find yourself waiting a while to browse products , what do you do ? I know I leave especially if I 'm viewing the site on my phone and want to go check out everything else on Twitter . <p> Think I 'm unique ? Check out this article from KISSmetrics and you 'll see that just about everyone is impatient when it comes to browsing . There are some other things you can do to ensure that load time is minimized , such as investing in good DNS hosting and checking out the W3 Total Cache plugin , but quality hosting should definitely be at the top of your list to invest in for your eCommerce site . <p> Do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Photo Credit : Greg Westfall , CC BY 2.0 <p> If you 're using a site to sell your products , bad hosting throws an unwanted and detrimental barrier between customers and potential purchases . Were no longer in the age of dial-up internet ( and I cringe when I write that and hear that connection sound in my head ) where we all expect to wait a while for a page to load . The longer customers wait to shop on your site , the lower your conversions will sink . Not only will these potential customers abandon your site , but they could cost you future sales when they tell friends that they had a negative experience on your site . The article linked above also gives us this valuable tidbit : <p> 79% of web shoppers who have trouble with web site performance say they wo n't return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online . <p> Agree with me about the importance of increasing speed yet ? If not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can move on and talk about how good WordPress hosting services are something you should invest in to maximize conversions and the money you can make from your site . <h> Why Use a WordPress-specific Hosting Service ? <p> There are a lot of options for hosting a website ( the host server stores all the data for your site to render in someones browser ) . Not only can you go with a hosting service , but you could also host your own site . So why recommend a company that is tailored to WordPress for hosting ? For the reasons above speed and performance . Amazon found that their revenue increased 1% with every 100 millisecond decrease in page load time . WordPress-specific hosting can deliver the best performance times because it usually handles caching optimized for a WordPress install and uses a Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) to speed up page loads even more . Generic services will usually yield generic results . By optimizing hosting for WordPress , you get the best performance possible . <p> In addition , many WordPress hosting services offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) better by doing automatic backups and ( typically ) core upgrades ; some will even do security audits for malware . Since performance matters so much for conversions , cheaping-out on site setup does n't  make much sense to me . If you open an on-the-ground store that will depend on foot traffic , are you going to just open up shop anywhere you can get cheap rent ? Nope , seems like a waste of money . Then why in the world would you waste money on hosting that wont serve your needs in the best way possible ? You 're sacrificing optimal performance and therefore some revenue by trying to save money on hosting ; quality hosting will probably pay for itself for any eCommerce store . <h> Shared vs VPS vs Dedicated Hosting <p> So now let 's talk about some hosting specifics . Many WordPress hosting services will offer shared , semi-dedicated/VPS , and dedicated hosting . In a shared hosting setup , you 're basically renting server space with other sites , so the server is managed for you . Good services will make sure that servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're going with the cheapest hosting possible and will affect your site performance . For small blogs and personal sites , shared hosting will probably be sufficient , and can save you a lot of money . However , that 's probably not what were discussing . For an eCommerce site , you 'll probably want a dedicated or semi-dedicated ( VPS ) server . In a dedicated setup , you 're renting the entire server for your site(s) . <p> If you 're running an eCommerce store , I do n't  recommend using shared hosting ( at least not for long ) . First , performance is a very real consideration for conversions , so investment in performance makes sense . With shared hosting , problems with other sites using your server can affect your site . If another site on your server is using a plugin that is taxing the servers resources , your site is affected . Uptime can be decreased , and support will not be as good as you need ( wait until you have an issue that your host will need to solve for your store to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  believe this ) . While shared hosting is much cheaper , you 're going to trade reliability in order to get a discounted price . <p> If you go with dedicated hosting , you rent the entire server to host your site(s) . This is probably the solution for sites with really really high volume . However , unless you have someone on your tech staff who really likes servers , you 'll want to make sure your service is managed ( see below ) . Just because you have dedicated hosting does not mean that the server is monitored , software is updated , or that you 'll get help with setup or migration . Setting up your own dedicated hosting is really not fun , nor is it easy to maintain . Even if you 're a developer and can do it , this definitely does n't  mean you 'll want to do ( hearing my husband whine about redundancy while doing this was painful enough without actually setting it up myself ) . While I 'm a fan of dedicated hosting to maximize site performance , I 'm not a fan of unmanaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unmanaged dedicated servers , its worth it to pay a professional to babysit your hosting and youll probably get some other benefits , like site backups . <p> Now what about most of us that have smaller to medium sized stores and are n't  running the next Amazon ? You can get semi-dedicated hosting services ( Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) hosting ) . Sharing will still occur on the server , but will be at a minimum , as the physical server can be split up into 4 or 5 " virtual " servers , minimizing the effect of other sites issues on your own ( for you non-geeks , this is like setting up " offices " or " rooms " within the server for each virtual server ; each virtual machine has its own workspace , and they do n't  really know that the other ones are there ) . This is the optimal solution for most eCommerce sites , as costs are n't  as high as having a truly dedicated server , but sharing is n't overloaded and performance is minimally affected . Our recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared servers . <h> Managed vs Unmanaged Hosting <p> Now that we 've got shared vs dedicated hosting out of the way , let 's discuss managed vs unmanaged WordPress hosting . If you go with dedicated or VPS hosting , you 'll probably have to determine whether or not you 'd like your hosting managed . <p> So what 's unmanaged hosting ? Unmanaged hosting does n't  have someone watching over your sites servers to make sure that software is updated and that your site is backed up in case anything goes wrong . You 're kind of left on your own and get pretty generic service , such as replacement for faulty parts and reboots . All software management is on you ; its like having your own remote computer that you have to maintain and update ( this is true of VPS hosting as well ) . If you do need software help , you 'll probably have to pay an hourly rate that will wipe out any savings you have from going with an unmanaged server versus a managed one . For almost everyone with an eCommerce store I 've met , unmanaged hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the staff to manage it . <p> So what 's the difference with managed hosting ? Managed hosting babysits servers for you . Software is updated and the servers are maintained so you do n't  have to worry about it . Security is usually a focus and sweeps are performed . Typically , additional services will include quality support , automatic site backups , WordPress core updates , and in some cases , may even include plugin updates . When you go with a managed solution , you 're getting a lot of help for the money , and to me its absolutely worth it . <h> Our Recommendations <p> While we plan on covering specific hosting solutions in depth at a later date , well give you a starting point for research and suggestions here . WP Engine hosts our site , and we promote them as an affiliate because we 've had good experiences with them . However , that 's not to say they 're the only good WordPress hosting service to check out , nor will we force you to rely on our experiences alone . <p> To get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major managed hosting providers . The " big three " for managed WordPress hosting are WP Engine , Pagely , and Synthesis . Each offers VPS and dedicated hosting solutions , and all three will do daily backups for your site , malware scans , and support automatic WordPress core and plugin upgrades . You 'll also need a second tier plan with each in order to support using an SSL certificate ( you cant use a personal plan ) . If you 're a developer , you 'll want these plans ( or higher ) anyway for clients . <p> Most common VPS hosting plans <p> *Note : If you go over 100k visitors in a month or are close , I know WP Engine has been flexible in the past and has not hammered people on fees . <p> Let 's start with WP Engine since we referenced them earlier . You 'll find that many of their customers will give them ringing endorsements ( check out Twitter for @wpengine for more ) and its a good all-around solution . Customer service is fast , support quality is good , and performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems if your site is hacked for free , and they have a pretty awesome " staging area " that you can use to create a copy of your site and test new plugins/themes . They provide a solid overall experience for most WordPress sites , though they include smaller bandwidth than other services at each pricing tier . <p> Synthesis is Copy Bloggers hosting offering , and also does a solid job for a slightly better price ( more due to the increased bandwidth than the $2 difference ) . Synthesis is also optimized for use with Genesis and does include some SEO optimization . Performance and security are great with Synthesis as well , and they also have a lot of happy clients . WordPress SEO plugin author Yoast has a good article on WordPress hosting that recommends Synthesis . <p> Pagely rounds out the top three managed WordPress hosting solutions . Their basic business plan pricing is a bit lower than WP Engine or Synthesis , but you do n't  get as much included in the plan in terms of storage or benefits . They also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be favored more by developers than clients since they have a pretty unique partner API that makes building on top of their services easier ( I have no data to back this up though , so take it with a grain of salt ; its just an errant observation ) . The API is also why they 're able to pair with Cart66 to offer the Cart66 Hosted service . <p> Looking for other managed WordPress hosting solutions aside from these ? I cant say that I 'd go in that direction myself , but if you want to check out other solutions to be thorough there are a few other services that offer WordPress-specific hosting . VPS.net offers WordPress cloud hosting that 's pretty solid and more affordable than VPS hosting from other providers , though it does n't  offer as much . DreamHost offers DreamPress , which is their WordPress hosting offering and is recommended by WordPress.org . <p> Still not sold on managed , dedicated hosting ? WP Site Care has an article on performance for shared hosting companies you can take a look at for performance . I 've also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shared hosting .

Your theme dictates how your site will look , so it need to make your site look great . However , eCommerce themes need to do this and support your eCommerce plugin to showcase your shop and make sure it looks just as good as the rest of your site . <p> You can check out the official themes , but were taking a look at a new free theme that was released with this announcement : Vendd . <h> Vendd Review : Overview <p> Vendd has been released to be the official Easy Digital Downloads theme its free so that anyone can use it immediately to create their shop . It can be used without modification easily to launch a new EDD store , and its also developer-friendly so that it can be customized as needed . <p> Vendd includes several templates to style the default Easy Digital Downloads pages ( such as a Downloads / shop page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure they look as good as the rest of your store . <h> Vendd Review : Setup <p> Setup for Vendd is simple , and most of it is done via the Theme Customizer . You can edit options like the color schemes , copyright text , number of downloads to show on the empty cart page , and more . If extensions are activated ( like Frontend Submissions in this screenshot ) , options for styling them will also appear . <p> Vendd Options <p> Once you 've configured the theme settings , you can also set templates for your Easy Digital Downloads pages . There are several templates , and you can set each for your EDD pages ( which are probably already installed ) to improve their display . <p> Vendd Templates <p> Some plugins will have their own templates available if active . Frontend Submissions will add two templates for the vendor dashboard and vendor pages that you can select . <h> Vendd Review : Purchasing <p> Vendd shows your downloads in a grid layout using the EDD Downloads template . If set , a featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase button will appear when the " + " button in the bottom right is clicked . <p> The furthest right product shows this quick buy button in action : <p> Downloads Page <p> The quick buy also works with variable products : <p> Variable purchasing <p> When a customer views a download , the full download page will show images , the description , and reviews ( if Product Reviews is installed ) . The sidebar will show purchasing buttons , download details , and details from active extensions such as vendor details . <p> Single Download Page <h> Vendd Review : Checkout <p> I really love the distraction-free checkout that Vendd uses during the purchase process . When you start checkout , the navigation , other links , and any sidebars are removed so the customer is focused on completing the purchase . <p> If the checkout is empty , the space on the page is not wasted . Instead , Vendd displays some products to the customer to guide them back to the shop . <p> Empty Cart Checkout <p> The " Landing page " template is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus on the page content . <h> Vendd Review : Extension Support <p> Since Vendd is designed to be the go-to Easy Digital Downloads theme , it supports several of the core extensions for EDD . We 've already mentioned that it supports Product Reviews and Frontend Submissions , but the FES vendor dashboard is worth another mention . <p> The tabbed vendor dashboard features an easy-to-navigate layout with the tabbed dashboard links aligned to the left side , and managing products or other vendor information is to the right . <p> FES Vendor Dashboard <p> Vendd supports the very popular Software Licensing extension as well ; the full list of supported extensions is available on the theme listing . Its important to note that not all plugins change the way the site looks to customers , so while Vendd may not " explicitly " support them , you can use any extension with Vendd . <h> Vendd Review : Other Styles <p> While Vendd obviously shines in its Easy Digital Downloads integration , it also ensures that your blog and other parts of your site are consistent with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog pages are not neglected . <p> The blog archive shows your posts with the excerpt and featured image in a list . I liked that each post also has the category and tags included below it for easy reference and navigation . <p> Blog Archive <p> The single post display includes the featured image as well . <p> Blog Post <p> The Vendd demo is a great place to see more blog posts ( as a shop ) in action . <h> Vendd Review : Summary <p> The launch of Vendd and free official themes is designed to make the creation of an Easy Digital Downloads store as simple as possible . EDD users now have access to several high quality themes that will work with core extensions . In the case of Vendd , you can even set up a digital marketplace because of its support for FES . <p> Vendd is lightweight and easy to set up , and the built-in EDD templates are geared towards making your store shine .

Youve heard of free website-builders through GoDaddy , Wix , etc . Or you know that WordPress is a free platform to build a website , and then WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads are free plugins to start selling online .

However , it probably wo n't create the best experience or build a reputable brand without investing more into your online store . <p> In this article , I 'll go over some costs that you have to pay , and others that you should pay to build a sustainable , ongoing business online . This is not an exhaustive list , but should give you a good idea of what you should or could be investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay ? <p> For any type of eCommerce presence online , you 'll have to pay some basic costs . Some eCommerce platforms may not charge these up-front though . For example , there 's a very small listing fee on Etsy , and then you 're charged a fee per transaction . This will get your products listed on a store that 's an extension of the Etsy.com URL . <p> But , if you want a standalone store with your unique URL , here are some costs you 'll have to consider starting off : <h> 1 . Domain <p> The first thing you will need to purchase is a domain name . This allows you to have an independent URL like http : //yourstorename.com rather than being an extension of another platform like http : **29;1150;TOOLONG or http : **29;1181;TOOLONG . <p> Domain names typically cost $11-$15 per year . Your own domain gives your brand more legitimacy and will go a long way in building trust amongst your customers . <h> 2 . Hosting <p> The next thing you will pay to set up your online store is web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . The cheaper hosting options can start at $5-$7 per month . This will give you access to the servers to install WordPress and build your site with the lowest bandwidth option for that host . <p> However , as with all things , you get what you pay for . If server management is not something you are too familiar with , you may be well served to go with a managed hosting for WordPress . This means that the hosting company will typically take care of managing traffic load and speed , ensuring security , and updating WordPress and the plugins . Managed hosting typically costs more , generally starting around $10-$12 per month . <p> At this level , we recommend Sitegrounds GoGeek plan for new / small eCommerce sites it has great security and features for a low price . <p> No matter which starting plan you choose for hosting , as your stores popularity grows and you get more traffic , you will need to upgrade your hosting plan to accommodate higher bandwidth .

Payment Gateway <p> Next thing you will need to pay for , generally on a per transaction basis , is the payment gateway you use for processing online payments . This includes gateways like PayPal , Stripe , etc . <h> Cost of selling : What should you be investing in ? <p> The above list includes base costs that you 'll have to pay to get your independent store site up . You can use free plugins like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads to set up your store and start selling . <p> But , itll go a long way for you to invest in a few extra things for your store to make it secure , professional , and trustworthy . <h> Graphic design <p> Your stores branding is one of the main things that people will remember . This includes your logo , graphics or fonts used on the site , layout and design for any eBooks or other digital properties . <p> I had one experience in building a site where I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the client refused to pay for a graphic designer to design the logo . The client ended up picking a free JPG image online and modifying it in Microsoft Paint . Needless to say , the logo did not fit in at all with the rest of the brand guidelines or the website . Something like that can very quickly kill your stores credibility , and make your store memorable for the wrong reasons . <p> Depending on your requirements , you can probably get a graphic designer starting at $1,000 for basic logo design . You can choose to get really low-priced freelancers for $100 or $50 per project , but the work will typically show that graphics were done on a budget . <h> Web design and development <p> Although it is easy get your store up and running , it does n't  mean that the design and functionality creates the best user experience , or that your plugins and chosen theme all work 100% the way you need them to . Many plugins may do everything you need , but sometimes they may only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to take your store to the next level of professionalism , you can invest in quality design and development to improve the browsing experience for your product catalog , or customize plugins to make them fit your exact needs . <h> Professional photography <p> On top of investing in graphics and design for your store , it can be worthwhile to invest in professional photography for your products . <h> Real-time backups <p> Backups are one of those things that we do n't  think about until we actually need them . And when you do , they can be life-savers . This is especially true when you 're running an online store with orders and customer information they 're an essential insurance policy for your site . For any reason that you lose data for all or part of your store , it is your customers whose orders will be lost or unfulfilled . <p> You will also lose all the customer information that you can use to target specific customers .

You can use something like VaultPress which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An SSL certificate creates an encrypted session between a customers browser and the server .

An SSL certificate can cost you about $100-$130 per year for the base packages . <p> Think of the type of business you 're trying to build online . The more you put into your store , the more you will get out of it in terms of revenue , customer trust , and brand reputation . <p> Now , there are always exceptions to the rule .

@@98138084 @2338084/ <h> What eCommerce Can Learn from Baseball <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Chances are most of you did n't  attend WooConf this year , where I presented on Value Metrics for New Stores = I 'm going to give you a recap of that talk today , and if you want to check out my slides as you read , you can view them here . <h> What Baseball Knows that eCommerce Forgets <p> I come from a baseball family it was always a part of our lives at family gatherings , and I played softball from kindergarten all the way through to the division I level at college . As a result , you learn stats , and you memorize famous ones to face off in trivia against your cousins . Leading MLB batting average of all time ? Ty Cobb , at .367 ( do n't  give me .366 Wikipedia-ers , check the official MLB stats ) . Second ? Rogers Hornsby , .358 . <p> I learned some interesting stats about college baseball as I grew up , too . One that always stuck out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , had a college career batting average of .500 . However , he does n't  have the career batting average record . Rickie Weeks gets it at .465 why ? At a full 35 points lower , why does he get the title and Larry Bird does n't  ? <p> The answer lies in statistical significance . The NCAA wont count a batting record unless you have at least 200 at bats ( the MLB requires 3000 ) . The reason is that they know you need enough data points for an average to be significant . In Larry Birds case , he was 1-for-2 in college , and 2 at bats does n't  cut it for a significant metric = His college career was a publicity stunt to encourage attendance at baseball games . ( He did have an RBI single though ! ) <p> Without enough data points , we do n't  know if a metric is representative or not Larry Bird may not have ever gotten another hit again after that second at bat , and his " true " or representative batting average may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base records on data samples this small , right ? Otherwise a lot of players might quit after getting a hit on their first at bat . <p> However , we count small or insignificant metrics like this all of the time on eCommerce sites . We talk about optimizing conversion rate before we even have enough orders to know if this conversion rate is a representative , significant metric . One quote on significance I love is from Peep Laja in the eCommerce Fuel podcast : <p> If you have less than 1,000 transactions per month the transaction could be either purchases or whatever you want to test , like email sign upsits probably too early for you to split test . <p> Tons of shops Ive worked with do n't  yet hit this 1,000 orders or so per month benchmark , so testing can take an extremely long time to reach significance . Optimizing your conversion rate before this point wont necessarily give you conclusive , significant results . <p> Instead , there are some key metrics your store can focus on instead as it grows until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test and optimize other metrics in a significant way . Well look at 3 metrics that are helpful , regardless of the number of orders you receive . <h> eCommerce Metrics : Average Order Value <p> Weve written a fair bit on average order value already its the amount of money you generate from every order , and you can calculate it by doing : <p> AOV = Total Revenue in a time period ++ Total order count in that time period <p> Since we 've already established we do n't  want to optimize metrics that rely on our order count , as we cant measure or optimize them in a statistically significant way , optimizing average order value is a good way to generate more revenue as you grow . Instead of focusing on generating more orders , you can focus on getting more money on each order you already get . <p> For example , a lot of eCommerce platforms will give you total revenue and order count by date , which you can use to calculate your own AOV . <p> Sales by date report <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs like Google Analytics track this for you instead . You 'll need a Google Analytics plugin that adds eCommerce events to your site tracking , such as : <h> eCommerce Metrics : Average Order Profit <p> While knowing your AOV can help you drive more revenue , you also need to know how much of your revenue is going into your bank account . This is where Average Order Profit comes in . You can calculate it by doing : <p> AOP = ( Total revenue in time period - cost of goods for that time ) total order count <p> This will help you determine what money is available and how you can allocate that to marketing , customer acquisition , and other operational costs . You 'll know how much you can afford to spend to get each order , especially since you may not yet know your customer lifetime value . <p> The problem , however , is that most eCommerce plugins have no way of knowing what your set costs are for each order . As there are tons of different kinds of shops , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , this usually is n't included in a core platform . <p> You can track costs externally in your accounting software or spreadsheets , or if you use WooCommerce , you could look into using the Cost of Goods plugin ( $79 ) . This let 's you set a cost for every item you sell , so that profit for a date range and average profit per order are automatically calculated . <p> Profit by date <p> Once you know how much you profit on each order ( based only on set costs like item costs , shipping , taxes , etc , not your " operating costs " like salary ) , you can more intelligently allocate costs , and try to optimize it as you grow . <p> For example , you can negotiate rates with your shipping provider , or optimize your supply chain by buying in bulk at lower prices . <h> eCommerce Metrics : Customer Acquisition Cost <p> Now that you know how much revenue you bring in , along with how much profit you have overall and per order , you can take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its important to know how much your growth and acquiring new customers will cost . You can calculate CAC pretty easily : <p> CAC = Total marketing spend in a time period total new customers in that time <p> Most businesses track marketing spend already in their own P&amp;L , but you could track this as simply as just adding every advertising or marketing purchase you make in a spreadsheet . Just have this number somewhere . <p> Now what about new customers ? here 's where things get dicey . Most plugins will give you some basic customer reporting . However , they tend to only give you customer registrations , not how many " new " customers ( first-time purchasers ) you have in a time period . <p> Customer Sign Ups , not First time purchases <p> Unfortunately I was n't able to find a great way to do this with most platforms or analytics tools like Kissmetrics or Mixpanel . If you 're a WooCommerce store owner , you 're in luck at least since I decided to solve this problem for my presentation = <p> You can download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasers in a given time period , whether they 're logged in or guest purchasers ( based on email address ) . <p> First Time Purchasers by date <p> Once you know how much you 're spending per new customer , you can make some decisions about how you 'll grow do you have investment money available for growth ? Are you trying to stay within AOP to grow until you know how many repeat purchases you 'll get ? What channels can you afford to use to acquire customers ? <h> Getting Started with eCommerce Metrics <p> You often hear " measure everything ! " and " what gets measured gets managed " in reference to eCommerce sites . I do n't  necessarily disagree with this advice ; I just disagree with the idea that you should try to do something about each metric you measure , or that each metric should hold the same weight in your mind while growing your store . <p> It can be crippling to divide your focus among tons of different metrics and trying optimize each when your primary focus should be on growing in a sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrics reliably yet . <p> Tony Perez from Sucuri wrote a great post on this recently , and this quote sums his ideas up for me : <p> The harsh reality is that while its fun to spend time reading case studies on the wacky testing schemes employed by organizations we all aspire to be , they are rarely practical insights for you . Its not because testing is impractical , but because most of us do n't have enough data to actually test against in a timeframe that makes sense to make any meaningful decisions from . <p> Until you have enough data to run meaningful tests and optimize metrics that require a significant number of data points , there are other metrics you can be focusing on to ensure the viability of your eCommerce business . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

By selling tutorials on your own site , you not only keep all the profits , but also ensure that the visitors remain on your own platform . <h> How Is Video Selling Different From Selling Other Digital Products ? <p> Why do you need to have a special set up for selling video tutorials ? Why cant you just sell them like any other digital products for example , like eBooks ? <p> There are a few key differences : <p> Video tutorials are much larger in size , often several gigabytes , as compared to eBooks . Selling them directly from your server as downloadable files can create a lot of additional load on your bandwidth and may even force your hosting provider to disallow video downloads . <p> Secondly , many users like to stream video tutorials online instead of downloading them completely . You cant do that if you sell videos as direct downloadable files . <p> You need to have a proper payment management system in place to ensure that your buyers complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key points in mind , here are a couple of ways you can sell video tutorials from your WordPress blog . <h> How to Sell Videos <h> Selling Behind a Paywall <p> A paywall is a " members only " area on your website that your visitors can access by paying for a monthly or yearly subscription . Content marketing leader Copyblogger use a paywall for selling premium content , courses , and products . <p> Once users become your paid members , you can route them to your exclusive video tutorial content . You can use plugins like Restrict Content Pro to create a members only area and to hide the pages with your video tutorials for non-members . This can be done with just a couple of clicks from the page or post you 'd like to restrict : <p> RCP content restriction <p> Make sure you do n't  host the video on your own server , as that will burden your bandwidth unnecessarily . Instead , go for video hosting sites like Vimeo Pro or Wistia ( I prefer Wistia myself ) . Alternatively , you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its highly scalable and reliable . <p> In the paywall model , your buyers need to pay annually or monthly to access all the paid content . <h> Selling Video Tutorials With Selz <p> If you do n't  like the membership selling model , you can adopt a more direct approach by selling individual or bulk video tutorials directly from your WordPress blog with Selz . <p> Selz is a powerful digital selling tool that simplifies video selling . Instead of putting burden on your website , Selz hosts your video up to 15GB per file on its own servers and offers unlimited bandwidth consumption . It also has a complete payment management system to process your buyer payments . <p> Once your tutorial is uploaded on Selz , you can embed it as a selling widget in your WordPress blog . <p> here 's the step-by-step process to setting up your video tutorial in Selz . <p> Sign in to your account and complete your payment details in the main dashboard . Selz will use these details to send you the payments received from your buyers .

You can upload files of up to 15GB size . <p> You can offer direct streaming from your website , complete file download , or both . For streaming to work properly , your video needs to be in MP4 format . <p> Add an image or small video clip as a preview of your tutorial . In my experience , short video previews are more effective than static images . <p> Complete the details of your tutorial , like title , description , etc . Make sure your titles are optimized with proper keywords , since Selz products are searchable on Google . In the description , use a list of the main points that your tutorial covers . <p> Add a price for your tutorial and set a quantity if you want to offer it for a limited time . <p> Once you complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will optimize your video . <p> This is how your video tutorial will appear to the users : <p> Buyers will have the option to stream , download , or save the tutorial to their Dropbox account once they purchase it . <h> Embedding Your Video Tutorial on your WordPress site <p> Now that you 've created your video tutorial on Selz , you just need to embed it in your WordPress blog . here 's the process : <p> When you activate the plugin , you can find it in the Appearance ? Widgets section , and as a shortcode button in the post editor . <p> Selz will give you a unique " item link " when you create a product . Copy that link and paste it in the Selz plugins " item link " field . <p> You can use this to display your products on pages or posts . here 's an example of how your video tutorial widget would appear on your site : <p> You can also change the style of your product widget by changing the color of the " Buy Now " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To purchase your tutorial , buyers only need to click on the " Buy Now " button . This will open a check out window in the same product widget . There are no redirections involved in the buying process so there 's a lesser chance of any buyers going away without completing the purchase . <p> Buyers can pay using Master Card , Visa , or PayPal . You can also integrate your MailChimp or AWeber account with Selz to directly add buyer emails to your mailing list . <p> Additionally , you can share your video tutorial with your social media followers on Twitter and by creating a free Selz store on Facebook . <h> Conclusion <p> Video tutorial are currently in huge demand , and they only seem to be getting more popular . By using the strength of your blog audience , you can create a completely new and extremely effective revenue channel by selling tutorials on different topics that interest your audience . Both the video selling options discussed in this post are very effective and should simplify video selling for you even if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's one of the reasons I 'd recommend you host the video with a video service ( such as Wistia ) and embed it many services that let you securely upload videos can let you disable embedding videos on other sites . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138089 @2338089/ <h> Selling an online membership with recurring payments <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We 've got an entire post category devoted to creating a membership site , so there are lots of options available to do so . However , what if you want to sell other products aside from your memberships , or you need to ship out products as part of your membership ? That 's where deciding on the right combination of plugins can get tricky . <p> This will eliminate some of the plugins with membership capabilities for your store , as they do n't  include the level of support you 'll need to sell physical products . <p> If you 're going this route , you 'll probably want to use an eCommerce plugin with a membership add-on . One of the most popular platforms you can use for selling physical goods and memberships is WooCommerce , as it provides a lot of flexibility and options for selling your physical goods . <p> In order to turn WooCommerce into a membership solution , you 'll need some premium add-ons that will add subscription payments and / or content restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two new premium plugins to sell an online membership with recurring payments : Subscriptio and Memberships from RightPress . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptio <p> The WooCommerce Subscriptio plugin is available for $29 , and will add the ability to accept recurring payments on your WooCommerce site . You can currently accept automatically recurring payments with the bundled Stripe gateway , or can accept manual payments for a subscription via other gateways . This will require customers to log in and pay for a subscription to renew it . <p> When you install the plugin , a " Subscriptions " menu is added that will allow you to configure basic settings . This will allow you to set up email reminders for payments and to allow for a grace period ( an " overdue " period ) for customers that manually renew subscriptions from their account before their subscription is suspended . <p> You 'll also be able to enable the built-in Stripe payment gateway from this menu . <p> Subscriptio settings <p> You can create a subscription with both simple and variable products by enabling the " Subscription " checkbox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as payment cycles , maximum duration , setup fees , and trial lengths . <p> Create a subscription <p> Subscription payment cycles , duration , and free trial lengths can all be set in terms of days , weeks , months , or years . For variable products , this can be adjusted on a per-variation basis . The only catch here is that you must update the product after adding variations to then add subscription options ( or membership options if using that plugin as well ) . <p> When a customer purchases a subscription , a subscription flow is started , which consists of the following actions in a chronological order : <p> Subscriptio subscription flow <p> For renewal orders , the customer will automatically be charged if using the built-in Stripe gateway , or they can manually pay via their account using other payment methods , as renewal orders are set to the " Pending payment " order status . <p> The plugin does a great job of allowing you to set up basic and variable subscription products , and ties to RightPresss Membership plugin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only use Stripe for automatic payments ( no other credit card gateways ) <p> variable products display the lowest price instead of range <p> The plugin is fairly new and still has room to grow and mature , but it provides a solid set of features and integrates seamlessly with RightPresss membership plugin . <h> WooCommerce Memberships <p> The WooCommerce Memberships plugin from RightPress is available for $24 , and will add the ability to create basic content restriction rules that are tied to product or subscription purchases . <p> When installed , the plugin will add a " Memberships " menu that will let you add membership plans to your WooCommerce site . Youll be able to view all members with this membership and any products that grant access to the membership ( if configured ) . You 'll also be able to " link " other memberships , so that access to a given membership also grants access to others . <p> This is useful for bundled or tiered memberships . For example , a " gold " membership might also grant access to the " silver " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created your membership levels , you can then begin to restrict pages or posts on your site . Youll be able to grant access to members only or non-members only , and can even create restrictions for certain plans . <p> Set access rules on posts / pages <p> I also loved that these rules can be bulk-added to pages and posts for quick content restriction . This makes setup far easier for sites with lots of posts and/or pages . <p> The final step is to tie a membership plan to a product so it can be sold . When you add a product , you can enable the " Membership " checkbox to add one or more plans to a purchase , and set an expiration date for the membership purchase . You can also add these options to variable products : <p> Add membership to products <p> Content restriction is easy to use , and the ability to sell membership products as a WooCommerce product or tied to a product purchase provides flexibility for several types of membership sites . <p> You could roughly use linked plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single posts or pages , as you 'd have to have a plan for each one . <h> Put it together : Sell an Online Membership with Recurring Payments <p> If you 'd like to combine these plugins , you can sell your online membership with recurring payments , as the plugins integrate with one another easily . If a subscription expires , is cancelled , or paused , membership access will also pause to reflect this change . <p> You can add both subscriptions and memberships to simple products : <p> A simple recurring membership <p> Or to variable products : <p> A variable recurring membership <p> Using variations can allow you to set levels with different pricing and access levels , which is great for tiered membership types . You can add more than one membership plan to a product or variation so that access is granted when purchased ( when the order is paid ) . <p> Sample product with Subscriptio + Membership <p> This creates a seamless experience for customers , as they can manage subscriptions for their membership with recurring payments from the " My Account " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceling a subscription will pause the membership as expected . <p> This also provides the flexibility you need as store own to sell memberships with a set length , a membership with recurring payments , and subscriptions for physical products along side of your other WooCommerce products . <p> Note : This . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Hello Beka . I am wondering what happens after a client purchases a subscription which has , say , a 7 days trial period . Will these 7 days start counting only after the Admin changes the order from Pending to Finished , or does this happen automatically ? This in the case the Admin doesn-t wish to use Paypal for the automatic payments . Do you have any idea ? Thank you .

While product sales will be a source of revenue for you , your store memberships can also generate revenue from registration fees or from advertisements sent to free members . <p> If you offer free membership to your purchasing clubs , you can require an email sign up and drive revenue via product sales , advertisements sent to your email list , or partnership sales offered by retailers ( for which they pay you to offer the sale upfront or via commissions ) . <p> If you offer paid membership to your club , you can generate revenue via membership signups and product sales in exchange for members-only access to products , discounts , or site content . <p> You can create a few different kinds of private shopping clubs with WooCommerce : <p> The tools you 'll need to create your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose . <h> WooCommerce Purchasing Clubs : Customers Only <p> What if you only want logged-in customers or subscribers to be able to be able to make purchases ? This is fairly simple to set up , and youll need the WooCommerce Catalog Visibility Options extension ( $49 ) . This let 's you easily restrict prices and / or purchasing to logged-in customers throughout your shop . <p> Catalog Visibility Options : settings <p> You can also restrict prices and purchasing on a per-product basis by role . For example , you can allow only subscribers , or only customers and subscribers to purchase given products . <p> Product Restriction <p> When purchase is disabled , customers will see your alternate text instead : <p> Pro tip : Want your " Alternate Content " to look like a WooCommerce notice ? Wrap it in &lt;div class= " woocommerce-info " &gt;my text&lt;/div&gt; to do so . <p> If you want to provide free access to your private shopping club , you can allow open registration on your site at checkout or on the " My Account " page within the WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page from your " Alternate Content " notice to ask new customers to register for an account . <p> If you want to sell access to your purchasing club , rather than just requiring a free registration , you can do it in a couple ways : <p> Sell a subscription ( requires WooCommerce Subscriptions $199 ) or regular product that 's available to everyone override its settings for Product Restriction to make it publicly available . This will serve as a paid registration for users , as theyll have a " customer " or " subscriber " role after purchase . <p> If you only want active subscribers to be able to purchase , then restrict purchasing to " Subscribers " but not " Customers " . Subscriptions will move inactive subscribers to the " customer " role ( or the role of your choice within its settings ) . <p> If you simply want to charge for registration rather than using a separate product in your store , then creating a paid registration via Gravity Forms ( $199 ) can help out here . You 'll use this along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence the $199 price tag ) to accept payment , and User Registration will create a customer account . <p> If this is the kind of system you need , then you may want to check out our article on creating a WooCommerce store for customers only , which provides more detail about Catalog Visibility Options . <h> WooCommerce Purchasing Clubs : Members Only <p> What if you want access to expire after a given amount of time , or if you want to offer other perks with your site membership than just access to the private shopping club ? For example , we wrote about how building a membership community helps to keep your members engaged and reduce membership churn . <p> If you want to offer other perks , such as content or membership access , or expire access after a time , then WooCommerce Memberships ( $199 $149 ) may be a better fit for you . You 'll still be able to offer product access , but you have a bit more control over how and when that access is available , along with the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several types of memberships for different " tiers " of access , such as the ability to purchase all products , or only products from a particular category . <p> Youll be able to grant membership access based on what product a customer has purchased and determine how long access is available . These can be your " public " products in your shop , and purchasing any of the products tied to the membership will automatically grant access . <p> Adding a new membership <p> You can also grant access manually if you do n't  add a product , and can require a registration process where you " approve " users and add the membership for them instead . The only downside here is that you cant provide a " free " membership registration without some custom code . <p> Once you 've created your membership plans , you can easily restrict all products to your members , or select some products / categories to restrict to the membership . If you do opt to restrict all products , you can then override this on a per-product basis to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access ) . <p> Restrict All Products <p> While restricting your products to members , you can determine if products are only visible to members , or if everyone can see products , but only members can purchase . <p> Plans : Restrict Products <p> You can also restrict new products or customize restrictions on a per-product basis from the " Edit Product " screen in a new meta box . <p> Products meta box <p> The biggest benefit here is that you can then offer other perks for your members , such as access to private pages , blog posts , membership forums , courses , or other content on your site . You can also expire memberships after a time and provide discounts to members . <h> WooCommerce Purchasing Clubs : Member Discounts <p> Finally , what if you do n't  quite want to create a private shopping club ? What if instead , your WooCommerce purchasing club should allow public purchasing , but give members a discount on purchases ? <p> WooCommerce Memberships is still a good fit here . You can provide member discounts for membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members will pay a discounted price while purchasing . You can quickly discount all products : <p> Add discounts <p> Or you can offer discounts on specific products and categories : <p> Create Member Discounts <p> When members are logged in and purchasing , theyll see a " Member Discount " badge , along with the updated members-only price : <p> You can even incentive non-members to join your club by showing discount messages to them ( or remind members to log in ! ) . If a customer does not have a membership discount for the product , but one exists , Memberships will show them that a discount is available and how to gain access to it . <p> Non-member Discount Notice <p> This notices can also be disabled if you do n't  want to tell non-members which products are discounted . <h> WooCommerce Purchasing Clubs : Summary <p> There are a couple ways to set up WooCommerce purchasing clubs , and which plugin you 'll need depends on how your private shopping club is set up : do you want to allow access to customers-only ?

@@98138091 @2338091/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Getting pricing right is tricky . Theres tons of research out there on pricing , such as the tip that prices that end in 9 are always more attractive that prices that end in a different number , even lower prices . <p> One of the most interesting tips Ive seen is that removing currency symbols can lead to an increase in sales . The study referenced cites an increase of 8.15% for prices displayed without a currency symbol , as removing the currency symbol disconnects the price from actual money in the customers mind ( making it easier to spend ) . <p> As a result , testing the effect of either removing currency symbols altogether , or using a less common representation ( such as USD ) , on your average sales may be a worthwhile experiment for your store . <p> Here are some ways to either change or remove the currency symbols in your shop depending on which plugin you 're using . If you 're not sure how to add custom code to your site , I recommend reading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the code referenced here if you 'd like to check that out instead . <p> Prices will now be displayed with just the value rather than the currency symbol . <p> Removed symbol <p> If you think this is to ambiguous for customers , you could also change the currency symbol instead to see how this affects average order value . here 's a snippet we 've modified from the WooThemes docs to change the WooCommerce currency symbol . <p> You can find a list of the currency codes to use on GitHub . When you change the currency code , I also recommend updating your currency display settings . I 'm going to now include a space : <p> Adjust currency display <p> And my product will be displayed with the new currency symbol instead . <p> Changed symbol <h> Change or Remove EDD Currency <p> To remove Easy Digital Downloads currency symbols , you may need to include a bit more code . EDD requires you to change each currency individually , so you could use this snippet over and over again you 'll just need to adjust the currency referenced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currency codes for EDD that you can reference . <p> Unfortunately its not very simple to change the currency display throughout the store with one snippet . You can change the currency display solely on the product price ( you use a string replace with the wpsccurrencydisplay filter ) , but not for shipping prices , pricing in the cart , etc . <h> Change or Remove Jigoshop Currency <p> Jigoshop has a filter wrapped around the currency symbol display , so we can use similar code to either change it or remove it . here 's a snippet to change the display to USD ( including a space between that and the price ) : <h> Change or Remove Shopp Currency <p> You can change the currency display for Shopp in a similar manner there 's one filter that will change the currency display on the frontend .

For many sites that sell online , this means you 'll need to find the right eCommerce plugin for you . <p> However , you may not need all of the overhead of an eCommerce plugin if you just want a simple payment form on your site . A plugin like FormCraft can let you create simple payment forms using Stripe or PayPal without creating product entries , setting up checkout settings and all sorts of eCommerce configuration , or managing inventory on your site . <p> You can use FormCraft to create simple forms on your site , such as contact / customer service forms , and can also use add-ons to allow for registration forms , email list signups , or simple payment / eCommerce forms to expand what it does for your site . <p> FormCraft can be purchased for $33 , and you can check out the plugins site for full details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality with payment forms , but it could also work along with your existing eCommerce functionality to create email list signup or customer registration forms to supplement your eCommerce functionality . <h> FormCraft Review : Overview <p> FormCraft can be used for your contact forms , customer service requests , and surveys by itself . However , when you use it with free or premium add-ons , it can also be used for mailing list signups , user registration ( i.e. , wholesale customer applications ) , or simple payment forms ( if you do n't  already use an eCommerce plugin ) . <p> When the plugin is active , you 'll be able to view a dashboard of your forms , create new forms , and view submissions or file uploads . <p> Forms Dashboard <p> You can create forms with several types of fields at least 16 field types and view a live preview of your form as you build it . <p> Field Types <p> Datepicker field type <p> There are some neat options for some fields , such as disabling certain days for datepicker fields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout you want .

You can name your form , and then you 'll be taken to a drag-and-drop form builder to add and edit form fields . <p> Add a form <p> Form fields can be added by clicking on the field type on the left site of the screen , and then dragging the field where you 'd like it on the form . Clicking a field will let you edit the values for the field , such as the label , character limits , or validation ( i.e. , letters only , numbers only , etc ) . <p> Create a Form <p> I found form creation pretty simple , but I did n't  like that the form builder was n't very responsive ; when you edit a form field , the editor can appear on the left or right side of the form . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can get cut off . Heres what a browser size of 1160px looked like : <p> This means you pretty much have to use your browser at full screen width . Other than the responsiveness issue , the rest of the form creation went smoothly . The entire setup is ajax-powered , so you never leave your form builder page to edit options or fields ; option panels simply slide into the screen for you to edit them , then you can dismiss them and keep working on your form . <p> You can also use conditional logic for your forms by setting up logic rules . You can use " and " or " or " logic to set up your rules , which will trigger actions . For example , if " Dropdown choice 1 " is chosen , you can set up an action to hide a certain field . <p> Create conditional logic <p> Form setup is pretty much the same for general forms like contact forms , user registration forms , email signups , or eCommerce payment forms .

FormCraft can be used by itself for basic eCommerce , as you can create payment forms , or it can be used alongside of your existing eCommerce plugin for other functions , such as email signups or registration applications . <p> There are free add-ons that can let you create email signups , which is very cool to see . You can buy FormCraft for $33 , then you do n't  have to pay an additional fee to use the MailChimp add-on to add people to your email list when they submit a form . <p> The User Registration add-on ( $29 ) is very useful , and can be used for registration applications if you accept wholesale customers ( or allow any different customer " types " on your site ) . <p> User Registration Add-on <p> When wed previously written about managing wholesale customers with WooCommerce , we 'd used Gravity Forms to accept wholesale customer applications and automatically register them .

Unfortunately this is n't as easy ; the code is a bit messy and does n't  follow WordPress code standards . While extending via add-ons is very easy , building your own customizations ( or hiring a developer ) with FormCraft will not be as simple . <h> FormCraft Review : Payment Forms <p> If you do n't  already use an eCommerce plugin and you have very simple eCommerce needs , FormCraft could also be used to create payment forms . Payment forms require either the PayPal Standard ( $29 ) or Stripe ( $39 ) add-ons to let you accept payments ( via PayPal or Stripe , respectively ) . <p> You can add costs to any of your field options when you edit the field by entering the option as value==option instead of just option . For example , if Option 1 costs $10 , I 'd enter 10==Option 1 when I create this field . <p> Add Field Values <p> The Stripe and PayPal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information as well , then process the payment for the form via your Stripe or PayPal account . To create a payment field , youd add it to your form , then enter how the total should be calculated , i.e. , " field1+field2 " . <p> Payment Field <p> Once youve added values for any fields that influence price and added a payment form , the setup is complete , and you 've got a simple eCommerce form ready to use . <p> Stripe Payment Form <p> Form submissions would serve as your " order " record keeping . This does n't  provide full eCommerce functionality like inventory management or refunds , but it does make it very simple to get up and running with payment forms on your site , and can be helpful if you only sell a few basic products . <h> FormCraft Review : Summary <p> FormCraft gives you an easy way to create basic forms for your site , such as contact requests or customer surveys . However , it can be even more valuable for eCommerce stores in conjunction with its add-ons . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signups , accept registration forms for wholesale or other customer types , or create payment forms if you do n't  already use an eCommerce plugin . <p> The newest version of the plugin makes form creation easy to understand with the live preview of your form and the ability to configure options without leaving the page . While it still has room to improve , especially with responsiveness and code quality , it was simple to use , does what it says it does , and provides good flexibility in terms of the type of fields you can use and options for these fields . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Dalton , it definitely seems like many people have a favorite = I typically use Gravity Forms since its most widely supported and I find the conditional logic easiest to set up ( that 's the feature I use most ) . I also use the User Registration , Stripe , and MailChimp add-ons frequently . However , Formidable Pro is best when you want to create a post / custom post type via your form ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best to build on as a developer . You may not even need Ninja Forms add-ons , so getting a great plugin ( core Ninja Forms ) for free is also a plus . <p> I think FormCraft is trying to be easier to set up with the form live preview , and is trying to compete directly with Gravity Forms in terms of the add-ons offered . From a developers perspective , its not something I would build on or try to customize , but if I had a user that wanted something easy to use , and perhaps needed one or two add-ons , it could make sense as an option .

We have a series of posts on free eCommerce add-ons that you can check out if you 're looking for more great free WooCommerce plugins , as well as add-ons for other platforms . <p> For each list of free plugins we publish , we install and test each plugin to make sure that they work as expected with a typical WooCommerce install . <h> 1 . WooCommerce Product Image Flipper <p> Product Image Flipper is a super-neat plugin , especially for clothing stores . When installed , it will automatically change the image displayed when the thumbnail is hovered in the shop catalog . This is great for front back views of clothing or other items . The featured image is still displayed in the shop template , but the first available image in the gallery will be displayed when a customer hovers over the image as the " flipped " view . <h> 2 . Knox Payments WooCommerce <p> Knox Payments is the least expensive payment processing service available for WooCommerce , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knox allows customers to securely log into a bank account and complete an ACH transfer to the merchant , and even pulls in address details to avoid mistakes at checkout . Merchants pay only 18 per transaction , which is lower than the typical 30 + 2.9% per transaction for credit card processing . <p> This plugin integrates Knox Payments into the WooCommerce checkout , and setup is extremely easy . You simply grab API keys from your Knox Account and enter them on the plugin settings page : <p> Knox Account <p> You can test drive a Knox account without entering bank details , as its pretty cool and easy to use its far simpler than dashboards for some payment processors .

You can show all sales using the wctsstotalsales shortcode , or show only a percentage of total sales . For example , if 10% of all proceeds are donated to St. Judes Hospital , youd use something like this : <p> This will display , " $XXX already donated to St Judes Hospital , " wherever the shortcode is placed , and the " XXX " will display 10% of your stores total sales . You can also add a before= " " parameter to change the currency . For example , if I wanted to display USD instead of $ , my shortcode would look like this : <h> 4 . WooCommerce Extra Product Sorting Options <p> One of the biggest issues with the default WooCommerce product sorting is that you can only choose to use a custom sorting OR alphabetical sorting for this once you 've started to create a custom sorting order in which to display your WooCommerce products , there 's no easy way to get back to alphabetical sorting .

When you want to display a product that 's sold via another site , you typically use an external / affiliate product type , and link to the product ( this is great for listing your own ebooks , apps , etc with an affiliate link ) . However , they open in the same tab / window . This plugin forces them to use a new tab when opening . <h> 6 . Blacklister for WooCommerce <p> We have a commenter to thank for the next one thanks Michael ! The Blacklister is still in beta , but worked out well for us in testing . You will have to download a companion plugin to work with this ( its just a framework ) , but installation and setup is really easy .

Store admins can also adjust the options that are displayed in this dropdown as well as the number of product columns and products displayed per page . <h> 8 .

WooCommerce Move Reviews <p> Sometimes if you have similar products , customers can leave a review for the wrong one . Move reviews does exactly what it sounds like allows you to move a review from one product to another . This is also handy if you 've created a new version of a product , or now display the product as part of a grouped product , as you can move the review to the appropriate place . <p> When editing a comment ( as this is actually what reviews are ) , you 'll now have a meta box that will let you move it to a different product : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138094 @2338094/ <h> Why You Should Use the WordPress SEO Plugin by Yoast <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the reasons WordPress is so great is how SEO friendly the platform is . Google eats up quality content , and WordPress is designed to deliver and manage content in the easiest way possible , making it pretty SEO-friendly as a base install . However , there are a lot of things you could be doing to optimize the chances of your store being found by potential customers , regardless of which platform you use . The single most helpful optimization tool Ive found is the WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast . <h> Why do I need to worry about this ? <p> Backup a second . Why do you care about SEO ? First of all , if you 're setting up an eCommerce store , I think its safe to assume you want to be sure that new customers can find you if they 're searching for what you 're selling . If you want them to find your store instead of a competitors , you 'll want to try to optimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have a large budget , go nuts hiring an SEO professional to do this for you I 'd recommend someone that specializes solely in SEO . Its hard enough to do well as it is , so if someone tells you they do everything under the sun , including SEO , they 're probably not going to be worth the money . For most of us , however , a huge SEO budget probably is n't in the cards at the moment . This is where putting in a bit of elbow grease yourself can help out . <h> Why use the WordPress SEO Plugin by Yoast ? <p> WordPress SEO is the best plugin I 've found for SEO . Its easy to use , works exactly as it should , and the base plugin is free ( but there are some handy add-ons and a premium version if you want to take a look ) . Its also constantly maintained and updated , which is hard to come by for a free offering . Any time Google rolls out some new changes , the plugin is updated to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to tweak your WordPress posts ( including any custom post types , which is what product pages will most likely be ! ) to be more SEO friendly than they already are . You can adjust the SEO title of your page or post and the snippet that Google displays to users so that prospective customers see what you want them to see when they find you via search rather than what Google hopes is the most relevant snippet . You can also take a look at the " page analysis " to get an idea of what else you could be doing to improve your page content . There are a lot of other features that many users will not dive into , but these couple of tools alone are really helpful to begin separating yourself from the competition . <p> Will this plugin do everything for you ? Absolutely not . Quality content is always first and foremost when trying to drive traffic your way . Youll have to write clear , direct product descriptions in order for this process to work properly , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just takes your hard work , gives you some feedback , and ships it out in a much more SEO-friendly package . You 'll still want to write posts for people , not for search spiders . <h> What else could I be doing to improve search optimization ? <p> This is going to depend on your goals for your store . Since the plugin works with all post types , you should be using it for all major products , pages , and blog posts . One thing Ive done is use the WooCommerce SEO add-on if you 're powering your store with WooCommerce to specifically improve SEO for products . You should also be writing blog posts about featured products or offerings ( possibly inserting a shortcode for the product in your post to make the item accessible to readers ) to ensure that you have content that is relevant to your products and what people may be searching for when they look for your product . Fortunately , WordPress is kind of great for blogging . Remember , content is king ; if you do n't  have relevant product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you a competitive edge in the eCommerce space . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138095 @2338095/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> How do I use WooCommerce grouped products ? I cant find a WooCommerce grouped products tutorial anywhere , and the documentation is a bit tough to follow . <p> This is a great question . Grouped products are part of WooCommerce core , yet they 're not frequently used . For stores that want to sell products that are bundled or " sold as a unit " , there are several available options . However it can be tough to decide which option is right . <p> This quick WooCommerce Grouped Products tutorial will walk through the appropriate use-cases for grouped products and how to set them up . <h> When to Use WooCommerce Grouped Products <p> So let 's start with when to use grouped products before we discuss how to create them . <p> Grouped products are simply a group of simple products you can sell products individually , or sell them in a group . However , the second part is what throws people . The core grouped products functionality is meant when you do n't  have to sell the products in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that customers do n't  have to buy everything in the group . Its more about displaying the products together to ( a ) make it easy to purchase them together , and ( b ) tell customers or remind them that you have a related product . <p> A good use case for a grouped product is an iHome customers that purchase this product will most likely need batteries as well . You can offer a package of batteries along with the iHome in a grouped product to remind customers they might need this product , and they can purchase both at the same time . Both the iHome and package of batteries will also be displayed as standalone products in your catalog . <p> Think of WooCommerce grouped products as a set of related products . The WooThemes documentation gives the example of a furniture set , which is also appropriate . Pieces in a living room set can be purchased separately , but you could also list them as a product group to let customers simply add which pieces theyd like to purchase . You can use simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side note , grouped products make coupon creation really easy , as you can restrict a coupon to the bundle , and the coupon will apply to any product within the bundle , but not others . However , this does not work with the Bundle Style Coupons extension . <h> How to create WooCommerce Grouped Products <p> To create a grouped product , you 'll need to take a few steps . After were done , our finished product will look like this : <p> Grouped Product <p> First , we need to create this grouped product so that we can add other simple products to it . Add a new product to your catalog , and create a " Grouped Product " type : <p> Create Grouped Product <p> I 'm going to make this my " bundle " option for the products I sell individually . In this case , I 'll call it " iPhone 5c / 5s Bundle " and add a bunch of iPhone products to it . This makes a handy landing page for advertisements or affiliates if you 're promoting all of these products instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grouped product page , I need to add some products to this group . Using new or existing products , add these to your new group while editing the products . You can do so from " Linked Products " under Product Data : <p> Add product to group <p> Do this for every product you want to be in the group , then check out your product with the " Grouped Product " type . Now all products in the group are displayed in the product page like our example ! <p> By default , all products will be visible . If you think customers wont need any other info than the name and price for a product in a group , or you 've included that information already on the grouped product page , you can choose to make the individual products hidden . This will allow the product to be purchased only via the grouped product page , but hide it elsewhere and remove the link to the product page . <h> Conclusions : Take it Further <p> My favorite way to implement this is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " main " product , then have small add-ons or upsells in the group . I first add all product details for the " main product " to the grouped product page that I can . <p> I then create the " real " page for my product , and only include pricing and inventory information . Then , I set the visibility of the main products page to hidden : <p> Hide products from catalog <p> This makes sure that this product can only be found and purchased from the grouped product page . I then create any other products I want to sell with this main product , and add them to the grouped product . <p> In the example below , I 've set up a grouped product for a camera . I 've also put batteries and a case in this product group as well , but Ive hidden the product page for the camera ( where Ive only entered stock and pricing information ) . This let 's me put the description and all details on the " group " page and makes this page the only option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Product <p> The batteries and case titles link to the product pages for these items , as I have n't hidden them from the catalog and sell them individually in addition to selling them as part of this group . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Thanks Beka , great article for showing how WooCommerce Group products can be setup ! I 'd like to know your thoughts on whether using Grouped products is the right way to go when you are selling products that each have different pack sizes ( 1mg , 5mg , 10mg ) but otherwise are identical ( with same documents , pictures , attributes ) . I want to avoid duplicate content in having multiple WooCoomerce product pages for the same product for SEO reasons . Is WooCommerce setup to prevent issues with duplicate content when hiding the products like you did for the main camera if i did it for each page with the individual pack size ? The single products in a Group still exist even if they are hidden from Category or Search so I 'm unsure <p> Hey Steve , I 'd recommend just setting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different package size , and then you 'd be able to adjust the pricing , shipping weights , etc , accordingly when the right variation is selected . <p> Thanks Beka , I ended up trying out variable products as an alternative just like you suggested . I just like the way the Grouped products show up in a table format on the single product detail page , and how easy it is to link in additional products that might be related . <p> It is a shame that WooCommerce does n't  offer the option to display variable products in the same format as Grouped products . So Ive been looking at plugins to assist me in listing the variable products in a table that will still work with wishlists . <p> i would like to ask if its possible to have a grouped products but under these products need only to select one item . For example , Product A and under to it have Product A1 and Product A2 . But you cant but the two . you only need to select one item . <p> Hello great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cant set all the products on your site using groups instead of variables ? Do you know of any errors that could occur ? I ask cause this is what I have done and it would be a mammoth task to swap all 500 to variable . Thanks <p> Hey Kari , I think a variable product would work better , as customers are most likely only choosing one to buy . Grouped products are best when the products are typically bought together ( think camera + bag + batteries ) . <p> I want to sell a product individually and in a group . When customer buy it with group , it is OK to show the product in cart as group name-&gt;product name . However , it is not good to still show group name before product name in cart when customer buy it individually . any ideas to fix this ? <p> I 'm using group to show different pricing for a resource , based on whether it is being purchased by a school or a district . I only want the group to show up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Only the group shows up on the Shop page , but , when you click on the group the name of the simple products is unreadable . What am I doing wrong ? <p> Thank you , Beka . It does show as you suggest . I needed the name and the link to show up . I figured out a workaround using a shortcode to show only the featured product on the Shop page , leaving the simple products visible . <p> What I 'd really like to do now is eliminate the Shop page altogether . The group product I created looks a lot better than the Shop page and since we only have this group product I want visitors to go directly to the group page without having to go to the Shop page . I have links on a page allowing visitors to go directly to the group page , but cant find a way to get rid of the " Shop " menu button . I 'm guessing that is not allowed by WooCommerce . Any suggestions ? <p> I am looking to use grouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a total of 100 seats and sell adult and child tickets . Is there a way to manage inventory for the whole group rather than for each ticket type ? <p> Hey Chris , I 'm afraid grouped products do n't  have their own inventory , as its managed by the child products ( in this case , your adult / child tickets ) . Youd need custom code to limit the total purchases of both of these together to 100 , as I do n't  know of a plugin that will tie the inventory of two products like this . <p> Hi Thanks for your Article .. Its Really Great .. But I 'm Facing Small Problem .. When i Hide the Child Product .. tht product name is not showing group product .. only price is showing but not the name of product <p> Afraid not . You could use the Product CSV Import Suite to set the parent product I 'd the " grouped " product is the parent , all child products would have its I 'd set at the parent I 'd . Probably the only faster way I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask if it is possible to set up a Coupon that only works , when people order the bundle ( all 3 products in the grouped product ) . The coupon works on all child products but my aim is to only make it cheaper when you buy all three . Can you help please ? Thanks . <p> Thanks for article , one thing is puzzling me in your example of the group of camera &amp; batteries etc . Which is that you might want to sell the product batteries in several different groups i.e. the same batteries would be useful across a range of products . But when I go to link say the simple product batteries I only seem to be able to assign it to one group . So I can assign to the Camera group but not also to Digital Recorder group . Is this correct ? Thx <p> Hey Barry , that 's correct , a product can only belong to one group . I think you 'd want Composite Products to do something like this instead , which should give customers the choice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks for your informative post . trying to work out if the " grouped item " function is what I need . I sell ink cartridges with free delivery . I cant offer the small ink cartridges with free delivery so I offer them as sets , but want the ability to have individual cartridges added to a set . I do n't  want the individual cartridges to be available for sale though , just visible as add ons to a set . I can create an item for the set , just not sure how to create the add on individuals . If I use the grouped function it appears that they will be visible in the catalogue . I see there is also a " composite " option , is that better . Thanks . Ian . <p> Hey Ian , you could hide the individual product pages for the cartridges from the category , but with a grouped product set up , there 's no reason a customer couldnt just add cartridges alone to the cart . I think something like Force Sells may be your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main " product , but I 'm not sure if this quite fits for your use case . <p> Thanks for your reply . As you stated , the forced sell option is no good as I want to offer the customer the option to add one or more of the 4 types of cartridge to the set they are purchasing . In other words if they buy a set of cartridges but want to add 1 cyan and 2 blacks . I have made a hidden item , but cant work out how to group it as it does not show when I try to group it with the set . If I include them as related items , my customers can add them on as normal items , but may be able to delete the set in the cart leaving a single cartridge , which I am trying to avoid . I will keep on trying , but it is not as simple as I had hoped it would be . <p> Hey Ian , preventing a single product from being purchased if alone is definitely a difficult set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup myself . To do so would most likely require a custom plugin built for you to prevent checkout if the " ink cartridge " category is the only category present in the cart . <p> A final option : you could consider Min / Max Quantities to require a certain cart total before checking out this may work if ink cartridges are a lower-priced item compared to the rest of your catalog , as you could require a certain minimum cart value for checkout . <p> My requirement would be similar to a car sale . You can buy a car and you can add the option of sunroof , auto or metallic paint for an extra amount . However you ca n't order the sunroof , auto or metallic paint unless you have bought the car first . <p> I will try the minimum amount for the shopping cart for now , but I believe there is something out there I just do n't  know what it is called and with plugins if you do n't  spell it exactly it wont show in a search . <p> Maybe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am after . I appreciate your time and ideas . <p> I decided to do a plugin search of just " woocommerce " ( all 101 pages ) . on the 4th page I found a plugin called " product dependencies " . If I try to buy a single cartridge it gives me a message that access is only granted after purchasing the other product ( in my case a set ) . So purchase of the smaller product is dependant on purchase of the larger product . <p> Initially this looks like it will suit my purposes even though it is not updated to my version of WordPress yet . <p> Just thought I would pass this on in case it is helpful to you or your readers in the future . <p> Hi Beka , great article ! . I want to sell Beer Boxes and now I 'm using woocommerce . The thing , is that I want that clients can select 6 beers from 12 ( all my beer products ) and be able to create their box as the client wants . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black and 5 Beer Red , how can I do to avoid that the clients select more that 6 in total ? , like a said , the box is just a SIX PACK . <p> Other thing is let the client select more than one SIX PACK , for example : 
@@98138096 @2338096/ <h> How to Create Pricing Tables with WordPress eCommerce plugins <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Pricing Tables are a great way to compare similar or tiered product options , as they provide a quick visual comparison for customers . They also provide the space you need to make a case quickly for why your product is a great fit , and which option is right for your customer . <p> However , they also provide the ability for you to anchor your own pricing and to drive customers towards the product you 'd like to sell when they 're designed well . This can be a huge help in increasing your average order value or sales of a particular product option , and fortunately they 're easy to set up with many WordPress plugins . <h> Pricing Table Design Tips <p> Before we get into creating pricing tables with WordPress and integrating them with your eCommerce plugin , let 's briefly go over a couple of keys to designing a pricing table . <p> While you may thing about colors and design first , there 's something that 's even more important to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad Mimi pricing page is an interesting one that shows how button text and the list of features are extremely important in terms of conversions . Make sure your line-item text for each tier is clear , concise , and unambiguous customers should understand exactly what theyll be purchasing . <p> Testing your button text over time to see how this affects your conversion rates is a valuable strategy as well . Button content that avoids generic text such as " Sign up " or " Purchase " tends to perform better in terms of conversions , but setting up an A / B split test for different copy is always the best strategy . <p> You 'll also want to pay attention to the order of your pricing table options . Typically , you 'll want to put your most valuable option or the one that youd like to drive sales to in the middle and highlight it in some way . Putting your options in descending order of price can also help , as customers will see higher priced tiers first . This ensures that they do n't  ignore these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better value in comparison since you 've anchored the price against your higher plans . <p> However , take note from the Mad Mimi case study above : if you have price-conscious customers , this strategy may harm you as customers immediately think your product is too expensive . <p> Adding strikethroughs for options that are present in some plans but not others can also encourage customers to go for a higher-level plan and makes it easier to see the differences between tiers . You can do this with the pricing table plugin we recommend by wrapping these options in **29;1212;TOOLONG tags . <p> Using pricing that ends in 9 is also a great strategy , as this pricing yields the highest conversions based on several pricing studies . The only thing better than ending pricing in 9 is having an " old " price and a new sale price . <h> Pricing Tables with WordPress eCommerce plugins <p> As most WordPress eCommerce plugins are focused on creating a shop catalog , they do n't  include the ability to create pricing tables .

The best part about using EDD with a pricing table is that you can easily add products to the cart directly from the pricing table without going to the product page at all . <p> EDD provides the ability to do an " add to cart " action via URL ( documentation here if you want further reading ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : <p> Replace the https : //MYSTORE.com/checkout part with the URL of your checkout page , then well add the rest of the address .

@@98138097 @2338097/ <h> Email Case Study : New Product Release from Withings <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this email case study , we look at the new product release email from Withings that provides a brief introduction to the product , and then prompts recipients to sign up for the launch announcement . This helps build a list of people who would be interested in the product so that marketing efforts can be focused on them . <p> In this post , well take a look at what works well in the email , what needs to be improved , and the main thing that got us to click . <p> New product release email from Withings <h> New product release : What works well in the email <h> 1 . Big image <p> One of the first things that you notice in the email is the big image of the two watches . The two are variants of the newest fitness tracker being launched by the company . The clear images help display the new features that are part of the watch . The two variants also highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-quality product images capture peoples attention while creating a good first impression for your new products . As anticipation for the launch builds up , these images will go a long way in anchoring a positive association in your customers minds . <h> 2 . Product focus <p> The content of the email puts a spotlight on the new features that people would be most interested in . In this case , it is the fact that a heart rate monitor is being added to an analog fitness tracker . In the short description , the content hits all the key points while also mentioning a few use cases for the watch , and its ultimate goal " take you from the office , to the gym , to a night out and help you improve your overall health . " <p> In this way , if the image gives us a complete view of the product , the description gives us a complete view of how we can use the product . <h> 3 . Call to action <p> The emails call to action is very clearly defined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement list . Prior to the call to action button , the value proposition is also made clear where the list will be the first to know about the launch . In this way , the email prompts people to be a part of an exclusive list of people . <p> There is a secondary call to action as well that links people to the new product page where they can find more information . When sending such emails , you can go with a few different calls to action based on how strong you want your ask to be : <p> purchase through a pre-order <p> add to a list to find out first <p> go to a page with more product information <h> New product release : What can be improved <h> 1 . Personalization <p> The email is sent to a list of existing customers or newsletter subscribers . For both audiences , the email can be more personalized to mention peoples names in a greeting , what type of product they had purchased and why they may be interested in this one , and a signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , as an example . <h> 2 . Description layout <p> Although the short description of the new product captures high-value points , these are easy to be missed within the paragraph . Instead , the layout can be changed to bullets so that each point is separate and more visible . This provides better comprehension of the new features . <h> 3 . Social buttons <p> Although the social buttons mimic the footer of the Withings website and give people an avenue to connect with the brand , the email does n't  make it clear why people should follow the brand on social sites . " Get social with us ! " is a bit ambiguous . Instead , the copy can mention what people can expect from following the brand on social platforms . For example , something like " See how people use our products ! " gives readers a better idea of what 's being shared . <h> New product release : What got us to click <p> The layout and style of the email is very clean with a lot of whitespace . This aligns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the big image of the two new watches . The images are very clear and give us a good sense of what the product would be like . In addition , the two images are of two different variants so we get a good picture of the new offerings . This certainly got us to click . <h> New product release : Takeaway <p> This email is a good example of marketing to create a buzz for new products . The big image helps showcase the product and the short description highlights its uniqueness . Since the watch will be launched at a later date , this email helps capture a list of people who would be interested in purchasing the watch . <p> For your store , you can build a list of potential customers by sending the email to everyone on your mailing list and collecting an email list specifically for launch .

@@98138100 @2338100/ <p> WP eCommerce is still one of the leading WordPress eCommerce plugins around , even after 8 years of development . With almost 70,000 active installs , there are a lot of users that are looking for extra store functionality . Weve put together a list of handy free WP eCommerce add-ons that can help store owners customize their selling process . <h> 1 . WP eCommerce User Role Discount <p> This plugin creates a role for premium customers . You can either manually create new customers for this role , or change the role of an existing customer . This can allow you to create wholesaler discounts for premium customers , discounts for members or other groups ( which could become automatic upon registration with a bit of custom code ) , or discounts for top customers . Your customers will see the normal price and the discounted price for premium customers , and this display is theme-independent. <h> 2 . WP eCommerce Grid View <p> Yep , the name tells you all that you need to know . This plugin alters the default shop catalog layout to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shop . Typically , this requires the Gold Cart upgrade from GetShopped to function , but installing this plugin unlocks the grid view option . <p> Grid views make browsing several products very easy for customers , as they can quickly scan for the products they need . Saving time in the browsing process helps your customers find relevant products and increases customer happiness with your store . <h> 3 . WPeC Bulk Category Pricing <p> This plugin is from Justin Sainton , who 's the lead developer of the WP eCommerce plugin . It allows the store admin to select certain categories as bulk pricing categories , then to add a product threshold and discount to that category . For example , let 's say you want to offer 40% off the " Swimsuit " category at the end of the season if customers purchase more than one swimsuit . Youd set your product threshold to " 2 " and the discount to 40% . This way , the discount is only triggered if two or more items from that category are added to the cart , while single swimsuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Related Products <p> here 's another one with an obvious name ! WPEC Related Products uses product information to display related products to the customer . Typically , related products are products that belong to the same product category or tab ; you can select which criteria to use for your related products and how many to display . Related products will automatically be selected based on these criteria and shown to customers on the product page in the area that you select under the plugin settings . <h> 5 . WP eCommerce Show Personalization <p> This is a nifty little add-on that shows the personalization information entered by customers for a product in the cart widget and at checkout . This ensures that customers have multiple opportunities to proof their personalizations to cut down on the amount of errors that occur due to personalized products . This helps customers to be completely sure that personalization details are correct before purchasing . <h> 6 . WP e-Commerce Call for Price <p> This add-on can hide the price of a specific product from your shop catalog . You can then replace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price or quote . This is great for companies that want to offer services along with products , or create a product that represents a bundle you can ask customers to call in for a quote on a bundle or service rather than creating a static product . This is great for products that require customization to fit the customers needs . <h> Coming Soon : WP eCommerce Cross Sales ( Also Bought ) <p> This plugin does n't  do anything yet , but download it now and you 'll be ready for the WPeC v3.9 release . This will replace the coming " also bought " section of product pages with a cross-sell for related products instead . This way , you have the option to show products that customers also bought if the item has companion items that go well together ( such as phones and cases ) , or to cross sell other items ( such as a nightstand for a bed ) , which gives you a bit more control over the process . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Hello , I am wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to use the call for price instead of the price ? I am interested in the removing the price aspect of this add-on but do n't  want customers to call . I have tried coding to get rid of price on product page with no luck . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138101 @2338101/ <h> Tutorial : Using Easy Digital Downloads Gravity Forms Checkout <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Have you ever applied for a job that made you do a silly or trivial thing in the application ? You may have been required to submit a document in a certain format , write a haiku , or submit something else with your application and resume . The reason that hiring managers do this is to introduce a barrier . Creating barriers , no matter how small , reduces the number of people who will complete a task , even if the barrier is trivial . <p> Now think about your stores checkout process . Do you introduce barriers , even if they 're tiny ones ? Each click needed to check out is a small barrier ; each action or piece of information a user must enter presents another small barrier . What you effectively do by creating these small barriers is encourage some users not to complete your checkout process . <p> Reducing barriers increases conversion rates , and one way to reduce these barriers it to make checkout as quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using one page , or even on-page checkout processes . Want case studies on how these help ? Check out this one or this one . <h> Easy Digital Downloads Gravity Forms Checkout : Intro <p> You can definitely create purchasing forms using just Gravity Forms . In fact , we have a tutorial on using Gravity Forms for eCommerce that shows you how to do this . However , this does n't  work as a complete eCommerce solution . <p> Order and product management , as well as purchase history setup , are not part of Gravity Forms . Its as basic of an eCommerce solution as you can get , but the forms are powerful and customizable . Combining Easy Digital Downloads with Gravity Forms gives you the best of both worlds : you benefit from great reporting , user / order management , and product creation on the EDD side , and can completely customize your checkout forms and create them on page via Gravity Forms . <p> This is an ideal solution for stores that need these dedicated checkout forms for a small number of products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products through EDD , or ( b ) need a more complete eCommerce setup than Gravity Forms offers alone . <h> EDD Gravity Forms Checkout : Setup <p> First of all , unless you 're using the Gravity Forms PayPal Standard add-on for payment processing , you 'll need to make sure that your SSL is forced on any pages that will contain payment forms . Typically many shops force SSL on the " My Account " / Login pages as well as checkout ; however , you may be embedding a payment form on a different page , and should therefore make sure the site ( or at least those pages ) is served over https . <p> You may also want to check out the plugin documentation for GF Checkout as you set this up , as it has a few pretty helpful hints . <p> Once you 've got all plugins installed , I 'm going to assume you 've already set up some Easy Digital Downloads products ( or at least read our review on it for help ) and jump right into creating your purchasing forms and on-page checkouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with purchasing forms in Gravity Forms , then display these to our customers and test them . Again , I recommend our tutorial on using Gravity Forms for eCommerce if you want more details or some helpful tips . <p> Well create basic fields that well need from all customers , such as Name , Address , etc. , then add fields for our EDD products to tie this form to EDD purchase records and reporting . To tie a form to a product purchase , well need to add some of the eCommerce Gravity Forms fields . Start with a " Product " field you 'll now see an option to tie this to an EDD product : <p> Add a Product Field <p> If you 're only selling simple products , you can confirm you pricing and this is all you 'll need to tie your product purchases via the Gravity Form to Easy Digital Downloads . However , note that my form is alerting me to the fact that I have variations . <p> If you want to sell a variable product via this form , you 'll have to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Fortunately , you can simply import your existing product variations into the form with one-click for a super-easy setup . <p> Options field for variations <p> These two fields completely tie my form to EDD product purchases , and will records sales per option accurately . The only other field you must have is an email field so that you can tie purchases to the appropriate user account . This will allow customers to access this purchase in their accounts purchase history , and ensures that your EDD reporting is accurate . <p> Once you have basic information in your form , you 're ready to go ! However , there are some other minor setup things to pay attention to for a great purchasing experience . <p> First , you probably want to change your confirmation notice . By default , this will just thank customers for submitting a form . However , we may want to provide a purchase-specific message when the form is submitted : <p> Purchase Confirmations <p> The final setup step is for payments . If you want to only accept manual payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include instructions for bank transfers , and EDD orders will be set as " Pending " . However , you will probably want to include a payment gateway . <p> You can use only Gravity Forms payment methods for these purchasing forms , not EDD payment gateways . I 'm going to use the free Stripe plugin we mentioned in setup , but you can use any of the payment gateways in the Developer add-ons for Gravity Forms . Do n't  forget to tie your form fields to the payment gateway information . As were using Stripe , well do this under Gravity Forms &gt; Stripe , and select the fields from our form . <p> Now I 'm ready to put my form into action , as I have fields for : <p> the product type <p> customer information <p> credit card information <p> any other information I need to gather <p> I 've also tied this form to Stripe fields for payment processing . Now let 's set this up for purchasing . <h> Purchasing Funnel <p> We 've created our products and the purchasing form , so we need to display this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers will purchase this product . For example , you may want to only sell this through a landing page ( well give you some tips on this soon ) . <p> As you may already have a lot of product information on this form , you can display the form right on the product page . This will give customers the product information , and then they can view all purchasing information via your new purchasing form . However , well want to disable our EDD purchase button when we edit the product so that our form is the only purchasing option : <p> Disable Purchase Button <p> You 'll find this option under the Download Settings . Now you simply add the shortcode for your form to your product description its easiest to do this by clicking " Add Form " . Our product page now displays all product information , and uses our purchasing form instead of an " Add to Cart " button . This completes the purchase right on the page for the fastest checkout possible . <p> EDD GF Checkout Form <p> As a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first product , as I 'm adjusting all pricing via my variations . If you do the same thing , you can hide the Gravity Forms Price text with this CSS in your child stylesheet or custom CSS option : <p> . ginputproductprice , . ginputproductpricelabel display:none ; <p> If you only want to target and hide the price on this form and not others , you can add a CSS class to this field under " Advanced " while creating it , then use that to make your CSS rule more specific . Let 's add the class rchp-form : <p> Now that my form is on my page , Im done ! There are some other considerations for the purchasing funnel that you may want to look at in the Taking it Further section . <h> Managing Payments &amp; Orders <p> Now that my form is created , tied to my products , and embedded in my purchasing page , my customers can use it . Any purchases made through this form will be recorded as EDD purchases . If they require manual payment , such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . If they 've been paid via credit card or PayPal , theyll be set as " completed " . <p> Each Easy Digital Downloads order will have a purchase note that references the Gravity Forms entry for this order , and each form entry will reference the EDD order number so that you know where each order or entry comes from . <p> Gravity Forms Note <p> EDD Purchase Note <p> Customers will also be able to view all purchases via Gravity Forms checkout within the EDD purchase history as well . <p> Purchase History <p> This gives you far better management capability than just Gravity Forms alone . <h> Taking it Further <p> The thing I dislike about using product pages to sell products ( as I did in this example ) is that they still display in the shop catalog if you use the downloads shortcode . This means that customers can purchase them via the EDD checkout process , which may or may not work for your stores purchasing flow . <h> Hiding Products <p> For example , your purchasing form may have fields you absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the EDD checkout to be used . Fortunately , there 's a free plugin that we can use to hide products from the Shop loop : EDD Hide Downloads . <p> Hide Download in Catalog <p> You can set the option to " Hide this download " , which will prevent the product from being added to wherever the downloads shortcode is used . However , customers will still be able to access this product directly . Therefore , you can add your own link for it to your shop page or another custom page . I 've added a thumbnail and link to my shop page to show this product since its no longer included with the rest of my downloads : <p> Add Hidden Product to Catalog <p> You can also completely disable access to the product page , and use EDD solely for the account management , reporting , and purchase history . You 'll then need to create a unique landing page for this product ( or use a pricing table / purchasing page ) with your Gravity Form Checkout . Just use the EDD Hide Download plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be able to track product purchases within the admin via your Gravity Form . <h> Scheduling Products <p> If you only want to show this product at certain times , or if you need to do this for several products , you could look into using the Limit Downloads Purchase extension . This will let you schedule when products should be available ( such as concert tickets ) . However , you could use it to limit purchasing via the EDD checkout by making the product " expired " , then only the EDD Gravity Forms checkout would be available . <h> Products as Services <p> Another issue you may encounter is with products that do n't  use a downloadable file . If you do n't  need to use a download with your product , you can use another free plugin to mark downloads as services . This will ensure that your downloads do n't  display any error messages if they do n't  contain files . <h> Conclusions <p> Easy Digital Downloads Gravity Forms checkout is extremely easy to use , and allows you to create a completely customized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital Downloads . You 'll still be able to leverage great reporting , customer and order management , download management , and eCommerce user accounts via EDD , but create your custom forms via Gravity Forms . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138102 @2338102/ <h> Restrict Payment or Shipping Methods in WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I get asked this question a lot , and its an excellent question : <p> Can I only offer certain payment or shipping methods to certain customers in my WooCommerce store ? <p> This question typically arises for shops that have members or wholesale customers , as shop owners want to offer different shipping methods or payment methods to these customers . The answer is : Absolutely . <p> The WooCommerce Role Based Methods extension ( $49 ) let 's you determine which WooCommerce shipping and payment methods should be offered to which customers . You can set up systems that only allow invoices for wholesalers , or provide free or expedited shipping to members and subscribers . <p> Note that this wont take into consideration what 's in the cart , or anything about the order , but will only be related to the customer checking out . If you restrictions should be dependent on the order itself , the new Conditional Shipping and Payments extension is a better fit , as it let 's you set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , order value , or the billing address location . <h> WooCommerce : Restrict Shipping &amp; Payments to Customers <p> There are two criteria you can use to restrict your payment or shipping methods in WooCommerce : the customer role ( which is a core WordPress function ) , or the customer group , which can be created with a free plugin . <p> WooCommerce automatically creates two new roles on your site when installed : Shop Manager and Customer . Anyone who creates an account while purchasing an item in your store will be created as a " Customer " role . However , this does n't  mean you 're only limited to these roles . <p> You can use the free User Role Editor plugin to create new roles on your site , which you can then assign customers to in order to determine which payment and shipping methods are available . For example , I can create an exact clone of the Customer role and make it " Wholesale Customer " . This will allow Wholesale Customers to all of the exact same things as customers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shipping methods . <p> If you do n't  want to change customer roles , you can also look into using the free Groups plugin . This gives you another way of categorizing users on your site , and assigning them new capabilities outside of their roles . For example , many people use Groups to create a WooCommerce membership site because they can allow some posts or site content to be read only by certain groups . <p> Groups can also be used with Role Based Methods to assign particular WooCommerce shipping and payment methods . <h> Restrict WooCommerce Payment Methods by Customer <p> You can use either roles or groups to assign payment methods to customers . Let 's start with an example that uses roles . <p> When you install Role Based Methods , you 'll now see a new menu under WooCommerce &gt; Role Based Methods that will let you enable and disable payment and shipping methods for certain customers . You 'll only see active methods , so be sure you have all payment and shipping methods already set up . <p> You can simple check or uncheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my example , I 'll let customers have access to PayPal Express , while I 'll set wholesale customers ( the new role I created using the User Role Editor ) have access to mailed invoices , but not PayPal Express . Both roles will be able to use credit cards and eChecks while paying . <p> Payments by Customer Role <p> When these customers visit my shop , customers will be shown credit cards , eChecks , and PayPal Express as available methods , while wholesale customers will be shown invoices , credit cards , and eChecks : <p> Regular Customer Checkout <p> Wholesale Customer Checkout <p> If you have the Groups plugin enabled , you can also enable or disable payment methods based on the group as well . Note that the " Registered " group applies to any registered users , so you may want to disable all methods for registered users and cover them either in the role or group . <p> Payments by Group <p> You can also take this a bit further by changing the logic between an " AND " condition , or an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " means that a customer has to be a wholesale customer ( role ) or a club member ( group ) to be able to pay via invoice , while using the and logic would mean that the customer must be both that role and group to do so . <h> Restrict WooCommerce Shipping Methods by Customer <p> Restricting shipping methods in WooCommerce is done in the exact same way from WooCommerce &gt; Role Based Methods &gt; Shipping Methods . You can check or uncheck the active methods to enable or disable them for customer roles . <p> Shipping by Customer Role <p> If Groups is active , you 'll see the Groups table as well , and can enable or disable shipping methods based on the group . As with payment methods , you can swap between AND / OR logic to determine when methods should be available . <p> Shipping by Groups <p> Let 's use a new example if a guest checks out on my site , only flat rate or international deliver will be available . Since I have an " expedited " version of my flat rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Checkout Shipping Methods <p> However , if club members ( group ) check out , theyll have access to any shipping methods available for their address , such as free shipping or in-store pickup . <p> Club Member ( Group ) Shipping Methods <h> WooCommerce Role Based Methods <p> WooCommerce Role Based Methods is an easy-to-use plugin that let 's you determine who should see which payment and shipping methods . Its a great way to offer shipping perks for your site members or subscribers , or to segment the payment methods available to customers versus wholesale purchasers in your store . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138103 @2338103/ <h> Managing Sales Tax for an eCommerce Store <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Almost 90% of American businesses have fewer than 20 employees , and I 'd imagine that number is consistent worldwide . Most businesses out there are n't  the " Amazons of anything " ; instead , they 're small businesses run by entrepreneurs with few or no employees . Based on this statistic , you most likely work for a small eCommerce company , either as owner or manager of the eCommerce store . <p> Small business owners or managers often end up doing it all for the business marketing , shipping , accounting , customer service , and tons of other tasks ; there simply are n't  enough people to specialize . Learning about every facet of your business can be super valuable as you grow . However , when it comes to government regulations related to your business , managing every aspect of your business can become daunting . Not only can mistakes cost you money , but they can cause legal trouble as well . <p> What 's the most potentially confusing , yet most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sales tax . When to assess it , when not to , how much it should be , and how it varies from item to itemsales tax can be a black hole in terms of time spent managing your business . <p> Since sales tax can be so onerous to navigate properly , I often refer merchants to different kinds of sales tax solutions so they can outsource this part of managing their businesses to people who deal with sales tax day in and day out . <p> Rather than trying to become an expert on sales tax for your state or country , let 's take a look at when you should outsouce , and some sales tax solutions that are available for WordPress eCommerce sites , along with how they can help you manage your store more efficiently . <h> Challenges in Managing Sales Tax <p> When you first set up your eCommerce plugin , its typically pretty easy to set up some tax rates . In my case , my store base is in Pennsylvania , so boom , 6% standard tax rate and Im done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taxed at different rates and rates may vary by services or by the purchasers tax status . Which items are taxed ad which are n't  also varies by location . For example , clothing may be taxed in one state , but not another . Digital products are especially difficult to manage taxes for . <p> Not only do the taxes you should assess vary based on the purchasers state and the type of item sold , but they also vary based on where you have locations for stores or warehouses . There are tens of thousands of tax jurisdictions in the US alone , and they each have their own tax rates and rules . <p> Sound complicated yet ? We have n't even gotten to filing returns and remitting taxes to your state / province and federal governments . Typically , most businesses end up hiring a CPA or accountant just to deal with the mess of filing and remitting tax since it can be extremely tedious and time-consuming . <p> When it comes to managing sales tax , you need to make sure several components of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct tax based on what the customer purchases <p> ensuring the tax is correct based on your location and the customers location <p> tracking the tax you owe over time ( which can be far more difficult when refunds or cancellations are thrown into the mix ) <p> filing tax returns with your government <p> remitting tax owed to the government <p> If any of these steps is incorrect , you could not only face money owed , but also fines or legal complications that could be costly . <h> When should I outsource managing sales tax ? <p> A lot of the time , its comfortable to continue doing whatever you 're doing right now change is always daunting , and it may be tempting to say , " Well Ive gotten this far managing my own tax assessment and reporting , I might as well keep doing it . " <p> However , sales tax tends to be an area of " unknown unknowns " you do n't  know what you do n't  know . There could be regulations with which you should comply that you 've never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start outsources your tax management to a tax solution ? <p> You collect sales tax from customers , but are n't  sure how to complete tax returns , or have difficulty filing them ( or filing on time ) . <p> In the US , you sell across state lines to residents of other states . <p> Your marketing or selling has begun to include attending trade shows , drop-shipping , or other out-of-state activities . <p> You 're paying an accountant or CPA to file tax returns . <p> Or my personal preference : never deal with sales tax yourself . Ever . <h> Options for Managing Sales Tax <p> So if you 're not going to manage sales tax yourself or with a DIY solution , what options do you have ? You could look into hiring an accountant or outsourcing sales tax to an automated software . It may help to ask some questions to determine which solution is better for you when comparing accountants or software solutions : <p> Can I file returns automatically , or is there any manual process on my end ? <p> Will this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit trouble ? <p> Does the solution integrate with my accounting software or store ? <p> How much management is required ( in terms of my time ) for this solution ? <p> Is this solution in budget considering time and money I already spend on sales tax ? <p> Can the solution scale with my growth in both order volume and physical locations ? <p> I prefer automated accounting solutions since they tend to both ( 1 ) tick more boxes in this list , and ( 2 ) provide pre-built ways to work with existing account or eCommerce software . <h> Choosing a Sales Tax Management Solution <p> If you choose to go with an automated tax software solution , you 'll need to determine what 's more important to you : the features of the tax solution itself , or availability for pre-built integrations between your accounting software and store . <p> Some tax software may offer great features or come in below budget , but if it does n't  already connect to your eCommerce store or accounting software , you 'll need to hire a developer to build this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at existing integrations with your eCommerce platform may be a better choice . <p> No matter what solution you choose , you should consider how well it will grow with your business in the future if you expand or choose to sell different kinds of products . For example , Taxamo may be a good fit for a digital-goods-only store , but if you may expand into physical product sales , it might not be the best fit . <p> Here are some pre-built connectors between eCommerce / membership plugins and tax services that you could use to start your search : <p> *There are some other solutions available for WooCommerce , but AvaTax ( from Avalara ) is my preferred one , as it offers excellent tax services and a feature-rich integration with WooCommerce . <h> Managing Sales Tax for Your eCommerce Store <p> As a small business owner / manager , you do a lot of different tasks for the business already , so managing sales tax collection and filings can be just another thing you do . However , its one of the most challenging things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-consuming , and the risks associated with errors may not be worth any savings over outsourcing this part of your business . <p> Using an accountant , or even better , an automated tax software like Avalara , can help you regain the time you spend on sales tax to invest in growing your business , while steamlining your sales tax management . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138104 @2338104/ <p> This series covers creating membership sites using plugins or eCommerce Platforms . <h> Overview <p> The Membership add-on for Exchange is one of the newest membership solutions to hit the market , and provides one of the most non-developer friendly solutions available . Membership integrates with your Exchange store so that you can sell memberships , subscriptions , and whatever other recurring purchases you want . <p> Setting up a membership site with Exchange from iThemes is simple , intuitive , and fast . If you have n't used Exchange , you probably want to check out our detailed review for some more information and some details on basic store setup . In order to set up a membership site , you 'll need to purchase the Membership Add-on for Exchange , which includes the Recurring Payments Add-on , for $97 ( 2 site license ) . However , if you plan on using Exchange as a solution for your entire store , you 'll probably want to invest in the Pro Pack for $197 , which gives you access to all add-ons released for a year . <p> So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site ? Well go through the process of setting up a membership site with Exchange and what it addresses on our checklist for membership sites . <h> Creating Memberships <p> Memberships are created as products using Exchange , you you can set an unlimited number of membership levels and restrict content differently for each membership . This will also allow you to set up tiered or content-based memberships , but wont provide an upgrade-path for customers since memberships are n't  tied to one another . Since memberships are products , customers can purchase more than one membership for topic-based membership sites . You can also set up products so that customers are billed once and the membership expires , or to bill customers on a recurring basis . <p> Before setting up membership products , I 'd make sure I 've generated content or planned out structure to make setup fast and easy . For instance , in the examples I have Im using a tiered-membership system in which each membership provides access to more categories . You could also use this to sell chapters of ebooks , individual posts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated the content you 're going to protect , you can start setting up membership products . <p> Membership products are created easily and the process is similar to setup of physical products . You ca n't offer member discounts or tiered-pricing based on memberships . However , you could set up a duplicate product with appropriate pricing and different tags for wholesalers or members since you can restrict product categories / tags to do discounts this way . Add your info and pricing ( more on this under " Billing " ) , and then you can move on to your content restriction . <p> Setting up a membership product <p> Last , you can display your memberships on the frontend by going to Appearance &gt; Menus &gt; iThemes Exchange and adding your products , memberships , and other pages to your navigation so that customers can view and purchase everything you 've just set up . <h> Content Restriction <p> Content restriction with Exchange is extensive , awesome , and easy to use . Using Exchange , you can restrict anything posts , pages , post categories and tags , custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example , if you only want wholesalers to see bulk products since you cant do membership discounts ) . When you create a membership , you can set content restriction rules for the membership product : <p> Setting Content Restriction Rules <p> Anything you protect wont be available to non-members on the frontend . A title will be displayed , along with the notice you configured under the Membership Add-on settings ( no snippets / teasers though ) . Be sure to select everything you want your members to be able to see when setting up restrictions . <p> Notice that content dripping can also be set up based on the membership . You can also configure dripping settings within an individual post or page , and can change dripping settings based on each membership if relevant . For example , some members can get access to content quicker than others if needed . <p> Post/Page Editor : Content Restriction <p> Drip rate can be configured in terms of days , weeks , months , or years , and the settings for restriction and dripping are available and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subscription Billing <p> Memberships can be set to one-time purchases that will expire ( set price to " forever " ) or set up as continuously billed products in terms of monthly or yearly billing ( no custom cycles like " 7 days " or " every 3 months " ) . When you set up your membership product , you 'll configure this very easily when you set pricing : <p> Setting up Recurring Payments <p> Since Exchange is an eCommerce platform and includes shipping options , you can sell digital content or physical products for memberships . Sell subscription boxes , other physical products , rentals , or whatever else you can think of . You can also create a pay-per-post system , but it will be difficult , since you 'll have to create a new membership product for each post you want to sell individually . <p> While set-up for pricing is easy , there are a few limitations as of yet . The Stripe add-on is free with Exchange and recurring billing is supported , which is a huge bonus since were fans of Stripe . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership products . Since memberships are individual products , this also prevents upgrades or downgrades along a membership path . Members will have to cancel a membership and purchase a new one , and you 'll have to determine refund / prorated fees yourself . Customers also have no way to pause memberships from their accounts . <h> Support <p> If you purchase the Pro Pack , you 'll be covered for support from iThemes for one month , or you can purchase ticketed support for $47 per month . There 's also free community support available or documentation ( though nothing on Membership since its fairly straight-forward ) . If you just want to know more about product development , iThemes has a public roadmap for Exchange so that you can check out and vote for potential features , including additions to the Membership add-on . <p> Tweaking and customizing Exchange and Memberships may not be as easy as other platforms at the moment , but iThemes has been very responsive each time I 've contacted them , and I anticipate this will get easier as the user-base grows and more developers work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Membership Sites with Exchange ? <p> Here are some other posts to check out about the Exchange Membership Add-on : <p> Chris Lema wrote a great overview of setting up a membership site with Exchange and said it was the easiest solution to use . Check it out if you want more detail of the setup process . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Marzio , admins can cancel subscriptions for a customer , but customers cant pause / cancel a membership themselves . I do n't  believe that canceling and resubscribing will allow you to pick back up from where you were , though I 'd confirm this with iThemes . The only plugins I 'm aware of that will do this are WooCommerce + Subscriptions + Groups and MemberPress . <p> As for auto-generating invoices , this is probably possible with most plugins but would require custom code to do so . <p> Thanks for this informative article . Were a non-profit org. and wish to build a membership site with protected content . Do you know whether exchange has the capacity to build a " member directory " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there a plug-in that can be integrated with Exchange that would do this ? <p> Hey Gregg , the review linked above shows how you can charge for user registration by implementing Gravity Forms . The only other things I know of that could work for a directory would be BuddyPress ( though you still have to worry about the payment part ) , and I think Paid Memberships Pro might have a directory add-on in the works that you could ask their team about . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138105 @2338105/ <p> Many companies allow personalization on their products . Think about the engraving you can get on the back of Apple products , or write customized messages for tags and cards . This allows customers to get something more unique than what product variants can provide . This months free plugin is the T-Shirt Designer plugin for WooCommerce that allows customers to personalize clothing or other products on your store by adding images to them . The plugin is built by ParaTheme . <p> In this post , we will go over setting up the free plugin , the customer journey using the interface , and some limitations to keep in mind . <h> T-Shirt Designer : Set up plugin <p> Since this is a free plugin available in the WordPress.org directory , you can install it through your WordPress dashboard . Click on Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; search for " T-Shirt Designer " . Install and activate the plugin to get started . <p> The plugin adds two items in the left sidebar the " Sticker " post type , and " T-Shirt Designer " settings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily highlight areas to find help , and features of the premium plugin . <p> Adjust how many products are shown in settings <p> The only thing you can adjust in the settings page is how many products are shown to the customer on the storefront . By default , 10 items are shown . You can adjust this based on the number of products you plan to allow customers to personalize . <p> Next , you can select the images ( called stickers ) that customers can add to your products . On the left sidebar , click on Sticker &gt; Add Sticker . Fill in the name of the sticker , the sticker category , and select the sticker by adding it as the Featured Image . For the best experience , add PNG files with a clear background for your sticker images . <p> Now , you will need to set the products for which you will allow customizations . To do this , create a new product or go to an existing product , and fill out the product details like the description , price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product pages , you will see the plugin section where you can upload the front and back images of the product . <p> Set the front and back view of products <p> Note that even if images are shown in this section , you have to upload/assign the front and back images for each product you want customers to be able to personalize . You can not assign products to show through the plugin in any other way . Only those products will be shown for personalization for which you have individually uploaded images in the edit product section . <p> Lastly , you will need to add the tshirtdesigner shortcode to the page where you want to display the storefront editor . <h> T-Shirt Designer : Create orders <p> Let 's take a look at the customer journey on the front-end . Once you add the shortcode to a page , the storefront editor is displayed . <p> First , customers select the product they want to customize <p> The editor shows three tabs on the left pane Product , Sticker , Text . Customers can select the product they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalization for the front and back separately . So , after they select the product , they will select Front or Back , and then select the Sticker tab and click on a sticker to add . <p> Add a sticker to the product <p> Customers can move the sticker to where they want to place it , and drag to resize the sticker . They can also double-click the sticker to adjust further options like the opacity , rotation , etc . <p> In the Text tab , customers can choose to add text to the product . <p> Create , edit , and move personalized text <p> For the text , customers can change the font size , type , color , and style . The text can be moved around on the product to where the customers want it . <p> Once the customizations are done , customers will click on Preview . This triggers a lightbox with the preview of Front OR Back of the product . In order to save these changes , customers will have to click on the disk-button on the right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front OR back of the product <p> This will add the side of the product you completed at the top of the editor . You can now do a similar process for customizations to the other side of the SAME product . Once you 've finished these customizations , click on the " Add to cart " button along with the quantity . <p> This will add the product to the cart with the front and back images included in the product description that will become part of the order . In this way , customers and you can follow the links to the images to see the personalizations . <h> T-Shirt Designer : Limitations <p> Although the free plugin adds the ability for customers to personalize certain products , the plugin does have a few limitations . <p> First , customers can not add customization to more than one product in one go . After they 've added a product to the cart , they can not remove the selected products at the top of the editor , but can only replace them by starting the customization for another product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only have one Front and one Back view . <p> Second , customers can go through the customization for the Front of one product , and the Back of another . This will add two different products in the top selected area . When this is added to the cart , only one base product is included in the cart which has the lower price of the two . This can create confusion as this function is not explained in the interface of the plugin . <p> Product selection issue <p> Lastly , the interface and functionality of the plugin is not very intuitive . If you do use the plugin , consider including step-by-step instructions for your customers on the page about how to use the plugin , and potential user experience issues they may encounter . Two main things to highlight that customers have to customize , preview , and save the Front and the Back separately , and that it is up to the customers to add the Front and Back of the same product at one time to the order . <h> T-Shirt Designer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to sell customized clothing ( or other products ) . The plugin let 's customers apply and place images ( stickers ) or text at the front and back of clothing items before adding them to the cart . In this way , customers are able to create unique items related to your brand . <p> You can use the free plugin to select images or stickers , and the products that these can be applied on . Customers can adjust certain aspects of the stickers or text like the opacity , rotation , text font , text color , etc . You can also upgrade to a premium version of the plugin to allow customers to upload their own images to be printed on your products . 11394 @qwx871394 
@@98138107 @2338107/ <p> We came across the free WooCommerce Coupon Shortcodes plugin plugin recently , and its a super powerful free plugin . This let 's you display coupon information , and even let 's you conditionally display content based on whether a coupon applies , does n't  apply , or has been applied by a customer . You can also list any or all coupon codes available . <p> However , it can be a bit tough to use , even with the documentation , so we 've created a quick guide on using the different shortcodes it offers . <h> Coupon details shortcodes <p> There are 3 coupon details shortcodes that should be used inside of the conditional content shortcodes listed below rather than alone on the cart page . These are couponcode , coupondescription , and coupondiscount . <p> The couponcode shortcode will display the relevant coupon code , while coupondescription will display the coupon description set by the admin . You can specify the coupon code that each of these should apply to if needed . <p> For example , couponcode code= " 10off " and coupondescription code= " 10off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can display multiple codes by using a comma-separated list of codes , but I do n't  find this particularly helpful . <p> You can display both the code and description by using the prefix attribute in the coupondescription shortcode . Using coupondescription code= " 10off " prefix= " code " will show : " 10off description " ( using whatever the description is for this code ) . <p> You can also add the elementtag attribute to wrap this content in an HTML tag ( div , span , or li work li is best if you 're enumerating coupons as described below ) , and you can add the prefixseparator attribute to add something between the prefix and description . <p> html tags ( not visible ) . Note that code is the only acceptable attribute for prefix . <p> The coupondiscount shortcode is slightly different this shortcode will display the discount amount or percentage the code will yield , as well as the product(s) the coupon applies to if its limited to particular products ( only for the Product Discount types ) . You can optionally show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupondescription shortcode . <p> will display : " 10off : 10% Discount on Happy Ninja , Ninja Silhouette " and link to these products . If the coupon is n't a product discount tied to specific products , then only the discount amount or percentage is displayed . <p> The 3 shortcodes are all probably best used within the conditional content shortcodes . <h> Conditional coupon content shortcodes <p> You can choose when to display messages or coupon information to customers using some of the shortcodes below . For each of these , you can use an all indicator ( * ) for codes rather than targeting them to a specific coupon code . This will display your content for all coupon codes , not just specific codes . <h> Couponisvalid <p> The couponisvalid shortcode can be used to display content to a customer if the cart contains an item for which there is a discount . For example , if the 10off code we 've been using only applies to the Happy Ninja or Ninja Silhouette products , the content enclosed in this shortcode will display if one of these products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all products , this message will always be displayed . <p> We 'd write couponisvalid code= " 10off " to target this coupon code , then write a message wrapped in this shortcode . We can use any of the coupon details shortcodes as part of our message , and do n't  need the code attribute since its already specified : <p> This message will only be displayed if a coupon for which the product applies is in the cart : <p> Coupon is valid message <p> If no products in the cart can use the coupon , then the message is not displayed . <h> Couponisnotvalid <p> The couponisnotvalid will display any enclosed content if the cart does not contain an item for which the selected code is valid . This can be really handy to encourage customers to add a product for which their is a promotion to the cart by showing the available coupon and discount information . <p> For example , we can show the message if the the product for our coupon is not yet in the cart , and show the coupon information to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you know we have a coupon available ? You have n't added the product to your cart yet , but we do n't want you to pass this up ! Here 's what you need for the couponcode coupon : coupondiscount elementtag= " div " prefix= " code " prefixseparator= " : " /couponisnotvalid <p> This will show the message only if a product for that coupon is not present in the cart : <p> Coupon is not valid <p> You do n't  have to do this for coupons limited to particular products its really helpful to show coupons for quantities , free shipping coupons , and more ! This encourages customers to add this item for a nice little upsell . <h> Couponisapplied <p> The couponisapplied shortcode can wrap content that you only want to display when a coupon has been used . This is a great way to personalize the shopping experience for your customers to thank them for using a coupon , or to include a message about the coupon . <p> Let 's assume that the 10off coupon was included in a blog post : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add a message that is only displayed when this code is used . <p> couponisapplied code= " 10off " You 've applied the LONG ... coupon - you must be one of our blog readers ; ) . Thanks for reading our posts ! /couponisapplied <p> Our message will display once this coupon has been applied to the cart : <p> You can use this shortcode to display the same message for all coupon codes code if desired . You simply replace the code with an " all " indicator ( * ) : <p> couponisapplied code= " * " You 've applied the LONG ... coupon - you must be one of our blog readers ; ) . Thanks for reading our posts ! /couponisapplied <p> The coupondiscount works well instead of the couponcode shortcode if you want to display more details . <h> Couponenumerate <p> This is a code that works really well on its own page , and if used right , can give your conversions a boost . When we wrote about improving eCommerce conversions , we noted that coupon fields are dangerous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you run the risk of them not returning or being unhappy with their purchase . <p> We showed you how to hide or rename coupon fields to help reduce the risk of customers leaving to coupon-hunt , but KISSmetrics mentioned a cool trick that Macys uses to avoid this they list all available coupons to keep customers on-site . You can do the same thing with the couponenumerate shortcode I recommend using this on a separate page on your site rather than on the cart page . <p> This shortcode will loop through available coupons and list them based on your criteria . Want to list every coupon ? Use the couponenumerate code= " * " shortcode around whatever you 'd like to display for the coupon : code , description , and/or discount info . <p> Let 's show all coupons , and provide the discount information with the code . I 'm going to put these into a list of codes using the elementtag : <p> This will list every single available coupon code ( including expired coupons ) along with discount information for customers wherever its placed . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the type= attribute and any of the following : fixedcart , percent , fixedproduct , percentproduct , signupfee , signupfeepercent , recurringfee , and/or , recurringpercent . Let 's limit this display now to only percent and product percent discounts : <p> Simple !

" Free " also provides a no-risk option that will be irrationally chosen more than a value option , so customers tend to add items to the cart just to get free shipping . <p> While free shipping may give you a competitive advantage , there are always cons to any marketing strategy . Free shipping can eat into your profit margins , especially for larger products . This list of pros and cons of free shipping from PropelAd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most major eCommerce plugins will allow you to set free shipping based on the order total . WooCommerce will also allow you to give out free shipping coupons if desired : <p> Plugin <p> Free w/ min order value ? <p> Free w/ coupon ? <p> WooCommerce <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> WPeC <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Shopp <p> Yes* <p> No <p> Exchange** <p> No <p> No <p> Jigoshop <p> Yes <p> No <p> *Must set up as " Order Amount Tier " method as explained here . **Enable " Simple Shipping " module to do per-product shipping , which can be set to free shipping for a product but not an order total ( no order-based shipping ) . <h> 2 . Use Real Time Rates <p> Using real-time rates is a good strategy if you ca n't offer free shipping when setting up your eCommerce shipping methods . This is very handy for oversized items , as customers can see that they 're getting the exact shipping rate , not an inflated one from your store . <p> If your profit margins are small and you cant eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best way to try to break even on shipping costs , as you pass the exact cost onto the customer ( except your packing materials ) . <p> The biggest con to using real-time rates is that customers can sometimes get sticker-shock when viewing a rate they 're not used to . Many people are n't  aware that it costs $10-12 just to ship small parcels , as they 're used to seeing flat rates from $0 to $5 from many stores . Testing a flat rate vs calculated rate is a worthwhile use of time and resources for many eCommerce shops . <p> Here are some options for getting real-time rates depending on your eCommerce plugin . <h> WooCommerce <p> There are several real-time rate integrations available for WooCommerce in the official marketplace : <p> OrderCup Free , but requires OrderCup account at $20 / mo gets rates from several providers based on location <h> WPeC <p> WP eCommerce includes integrations for Australia Post , UPS , and USPS in the core plugin . If you get real-time rates with these services , you can enable them under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory and rates . <p> The core team has developed a premium FedEx integration for FedEx real-time rates , which is available for $79 . <p> You can also purchase a third party Canada Post extension for $50 from Bartic . <h> Shopp <p> Shopp does n't  include real-time rates in the core plugin , but does have several integrations available from their core team : <h> Exchange <h> Jigoshop <h> 3 . Using Flat Rates <p> If you do n't  want to , or are unable to , offer real-time rates , flat rate shipping is probably your next best option in terms of eCommerce shipping methods . This will require you to find out your average shipping cost per order , then set this as your flat rate . The goal is to even out shipping costs , as you 'll be over / under on each order . <p> Flat rate shipping may also allow you to accept a certain margin of loss on shipping for each order . If your average shipping cost is $6.12 per order , you may be able to get away with offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs more palatable for customers while still avoiding a huge hit to your profit margins . <p> This also works really well if you sell small items . As these can typically be shipping in small envelopes or parcels , they have the lowest shipping costs , which you can pass on to customers in the form of a low flat rate . This is great for shops that sell jewelry or accessories . <p> Plugin <p> Flat Rate ? <p> &gt; 1 Flat Rate ? <p> Available by location ? <p> Add Intl Flat Rate ? <p> WooCommerce <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> WPeC <p> Yes <p> No <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Shopp <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Exchange <p> Yes* <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> Jigoshop <p> Yes <p> No** <p> Yes <p> No <p> *Only per-product , not per order **Requires a paid add-on <h> 4 . Consider Dropshipping <p> One of the largest risks to doing your own fulfillment is maintaining inventory . Youll have to stock your products for fulfillment , then send them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( a ) investing money in stock up-front that may not sell , and ( b ) running out of stock and losing sales while re-stocking or taking backorders . <p> Dropshipping can mitigate these risks , as you send products to customers directly from the supplier . Rather than maintaining your own inventory , you simply forward orders on to the supplier to be fulfilled when placed , and customers are sent product directly from the supplier . You act essentially as a middleman and buy your stock after the sale rather than before it . <p> The downside to dropshipping is the loss of control you 're no longer in-charge of our inventory , so you must trust that your suppliers are reliable in terms of fulfilling orders on schedule . Customer returns may also pose a problem , as you 've essentially bought the stock from the supplier , and now must refund the customer , then get your money back from the supplier . Some suppliers do not accept returns , so you run the risk of eating this cost . <p> In order to dropship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the rates to your supplier when the order is fulfilled . Youll have to determine whether to build shipping into your item cost , or offer flat / real-time rates . However , real-time rates may not be as accurate since you 'll have to base them on your suppliers location and available materials , not your own . <p> Your eCommerce plugin must also be able to export orders to the supplier . Here are some options to do so with each eCommerce plugin. <h> eCommerce Shipping Methods : Recap <p> If you 're fulfilling orders yourself , you 'll have to determine if and when to offer free shipping , and whether you want to use flat rates or calculated rates for your order shipping . You may be limited by what 's available from your eCommerce plugin , and should also test which approach is best for your store . <p> If you instead choose to dropship , you lower your risk in terms of keeping inventory on-hand , but will need to guess at shipping rates from your supplier and determine how to build them into your order costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier is in a different location , so flat rates or giving away shipping for free may be your only way to go . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> One Comment <p> Flat rate shipping works best for shops that sell just a few products in low quantities . With a per product shipping price , the shipping costs can skyrocket when customers order lots of stuff , scaring them off . But if you 've got a specialty shop that only sells a few things or focus on one or two items , flat rate shipping can be perfect . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138110 @2338110/ <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> A new version of WooCommerce is due out this week ( most likely today or tomorrow ) , so were going to take a look into what 's new and changed in WooCommerce 2.5 today . This version of WooCommerce has been in development for several months , as WooCommerce 2.4 was released August 10 , 2015 . <p> The first beta release was in November , but with the holiday sales season right in this release cycle , the beta and release candidate period was about 2 months . Beta 2 overhauled the way transients were stored ( transients are a way of temporarily caching information ) for much better performance and made some further template changes . Beta 3 , release candidate 1 , and release candidate 2 followed with mostly fixes and other small tweaks . <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review : Overview <p> WooCommerce 2.5 includes some small quality of life changes for shop owners and administrators to improve store management , while adding some very useful developer tools and performance enhancements . <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WP-CLI support , while the changes you 'll see in your admin and the frontend of your site are fairly small . <p> There are also several fixes in this version to make WooCommerce more performant and resilient to changes and different site configurations . <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review : Admin Experience <p> Let 's start with how WooCommerce will look different when you log in . In terms of settings , you 'll notice one setting that 's been removed : shipping display mode . The choice was made to go with radio buttons for shipping method display exclusively rather than using a select / dropdown for methods , so this setting is no longer present . <p> WC 2.4 Shipping options <p> WC 2.5 Shipping options <p> The tax settings have also been tweaked slightly . While there are no added or removed settings here , the tax UI is faster and uses a snappy ajax search for country codes now . For example , if you want to set a UK tax rate , you can enter UK in the " Country Code " column , and WooCommerce will search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct country code , which is GB ( using this an example because I mess it up all of the time ) . Previously , country codes werent searchable , so you had to look up the correct code manually . <p> WooCommerce 2.5 also introduces an email table for email management so that the " Emails " settings tab is simplified . Previously , emails were listed as sub-sections under the " Emails " tab , and you could choose which email to edit from here , along with configuring settings . <p> Now the " Emails " tab is simplified into a table to show all emails in a list . A failed order email has been added for admins as well to notify you of a failed payment . <p> WC 2.4 Emails <p> WC 2.5 Emails <p> The email settings are now located below this table . <p> WC 2.5 email settings <p> You can edit an email still by clicking its name or the " configure " icon in the table . <p> WC 2.5 Editing emails <p> When viewing an order that still requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payment " ) , customers can easily view a " Pay " link from the My Account page . You can now access this link as an admin while viewing the order as well so it can easily be sent to customers : <p> WC 2.4 View Order <p> WC 2.5 View Order <p> As a final admin change , you can now can search both parent / simple and variation SKUs in the admin when viewing your products . Previously , if you wanted to look a product up by SKU , you could only search for the parent products SKU . Now you can search for a specific variations SKU , and it will return the right product . <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review : Frontend Changes <p> There are also some minor changes to the way your shop is displayed to customers to improve the shopping experience . <p> For variable products , the add to cart button would not be shown until a variation was selected . If you wanted the cart button to show up immediately , you had to set a default variation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled until a selection is made . <p> WC 2.4 variable product <p> WC 2.5 variable product <p> If you enable the terms and conditions checkbox at checkout , this will now be displayed before the " Place Order " button rather than after it . <p> WC 2.4 Accept Terms <p> WC 2.5 Accept terms <p> The terms and conditions box has also been added to the " pay " page for orders that are paid for after they 've been placed , ensuring that all orders will have the terms and conditions available . <p> Finally , WooCommerce now enforces strong passwords for customer registration on the account and checkout page . This forces your customers to use a strong password before being able to register for an account on your site . <p> WC 2.5 strong passwords <p> As I do a lot of testing with dummy passwords , I wanted to disable this on my test sites . If you 're looking to do something similar , here 's a snippet to do so ( make sure you know how to properly add code to your site ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tons of fixes and tweaks in WooCommerce 2.5 that improve the overall performance of your site . <p> One of the changes I really disliked in WooCommerce 2.4 was that the checkout page removed some of its checks for appropriately formed JSON ; from versions 1.6 to 2.4 , WooCommerce would basically check the format of the data submitted by checkout to make sure it was in the right format . WooCommerce 2.4 removed this check under the assumption that plugins should not add invalid JSON ( bad formatting such as stray HTML ) . <p> While in an ideal world this is true , tons of plugins ( even ones not related to WooCommerce ) or themes broke the checkout with a " Syntax Error : Unexpected Token " notice . WooCommerce 2.5 fortunately fixes this checkout issue by adding malformed JSON handling . <p> When you enabled " verified reviews " for your products , WooCommerce had to store the verified review information somewhere . This was previously stored as a transient ( a temporarily cached piece of data ) . However , once your product had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , this would slow down product page loading . The function that retrieves verified reviews has been completely refactored for better performance , as these are now stored as post meta . <p> Transients were used to store some data about your products variations as well , and these have been refactored to avoid any slow-downs in your sites loading . <p> If you created a coupon with a product category restriction for a parent category ( let 's say music ) , coupons would not respect the category hierarchy this restriction should extend to any children of that parent ( let 's say " albums " or " singles " ) . WooCommerce now respects category hierarchy for coupons . <p> When a WordPress user is deleted , any orders they have placed now turn into guest orders . <p> WooCommerce will now use the product SKU for stock order notes instead of the product I 'd . Order notes are also added for manual email sends now as well . <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review : For Developers <p> Finally , let 's take a look at some of the changes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ API has has added some new endpoints : <p> **25;1243;TOOLONG to update product shipping classes . <p> POST , PUT , and DELETE for product categories and tags . <p> support for filtering products by tag , category , shipping class , and attribute . <p> tax and taxclass endpoints for setting tax rates . <p> WooCommerce 2.5 also includes PHP 7 support , so once your host upgrades , you 'll be completely ready to go . <p> WordPress does n't  have a built in way to handle sessions ( i.e. , a user session where you store a cart or other user details ) , so WooCommerce and other eCommerce plugins have to build their own session handlers . WooCommerce 2.5 introduces a new session handler , which improves scalability and performance by storing data in a new custom table . The developer blog has further details on the session handler . <p> WooCommerce 2.5 also adds WP CLI support , which let 's you execute and automate functions via the command line . This makes it easy to do things like add or update groups of products , edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers who manage several sites . The development blog has a great overview of some available commands . <h> WooCommerce 2.5 Review <p> WooCommerce 2.5 does n't  make huge changes to the way you run your WooCommerce store , but it does add several small quality of life improvements for shop owners and managers . The ability to quickly view and manage emails is very nice , and I 'm a fan of the minor frontend tweaks to the variable product and checkout pages . <p> The biggest changes in WooCommerce 2.5 are the things you do n't  always see the several fixes and performance improvements that went into this release , such as transients refactoring , a new session handler , making the checkout process more resilient , making product review display much faster , and PHP 7 support , all make WooCommerce faster , more dependable , and more scalable . <p> Developers also benefit from WP CLI support and new REST API endpoints , expanding the ways that developers can interact with WooCommerce stores outside of building companion plugins . <p> WooCommerce 2.5 overall is a nice refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developers , while improving and optimizing key pieces of the plugins technical infrastructure . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> My new order email wont show the image size I ve set . Copied the templates in my theme files , set show image true , image size arrat ( 128 , 128 ) but the mails show the default size 32,32 This happened after 2.5 update , Have any suggestion ? 
@@98138111 @2338111/ <p> While we 've outline strategies for increasing your AOV , how you can implement these strategies is sometimes a challenge . Increasing AOV is an excellent first step towards increasing revenue since it can be done without the need for increased traffic or conversion rates . However , reading about strategies is easy putting tactics and strategies in place to encourage higher order amounts is the hard part . <p> Todays post will look at tools and plugins to help you increase average order value with Easy Digital Downloads , and well find extensions for each strategy we 've discussed . <h> 1 . Use Free Shipping Thresholds <p> Since 99% of stores using Easy Digital Downloads are n't  shipping anything , unfortunately this is n't a strategy well be able to use in most EDD stores = . <p> Let 's skip this to focus on more relevant strategies for digital goods shops . <h> 2 . Use Discount Thresholds <p> You can encourage higher purchase amounts by offering a discount for meeting a certain threshold to encourage customers to meet this threshold . Easy Digital Downloads let 's you do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum amount set for usage : <p> If the customer tries to apply this discount when the order subtotal is under $60 , theyll see a notice that they have n't met the minimum spend yet . <p> You can also automatically apply discounts with the Discounts Pro extension ( $49 ) , such as discounts for purchasing 3 products from a category . The ability to automatically apply discounts for a cart minimum amount is n't available yet , but is listed as coming soon . <p> Once you have your discount set up , you 'll need to make sure customers know about the discount and the required amount so they 're encouraged to meet it . That 's where a tool like Hello Bar comes into play . You can create a top bar for your site to show on every page that let 's the customer know about the deal . You can use an announcement bar to just show text , or a promotion bar to include a call to action : <p> When you create your bar , be sure to include both the required order amount and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order amount . <h> 3 . Provide Volume Discounts <p> While coupons are pretty much the only way to encourage meeting an order minimum amount with Easy Digital Downloads , you can also increase average order value by encouraging bulk purchases . There are a couple of ways you can create volume discounts so that customers are encouraged to buy more products to get a discount applied . <p> The Volume Discounts extension ( $23 ) let 's you create simple discounts based on the total number of items in the cart . For example , you can set up a discount if there are 5 or more items in the cart : <p> This discount will automatically be applied if the cart meets this condition : <p> You can also set up a spend more , save more system with tiered discounts . If you set up higher tiers , such as a higher discount for 8 items or more , Volume Discounts will automatically apply this discount instead and remove the 5 item discount when the cart is eligible . <p> This can let you promote a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Buy 3 items , get 5% off <p> Buy 5 items , get 10% off <p> Buy 8 or more items , get 15% off <p> You can also create bulk discounts using the Discounts Pro extension ( $49 ) . This gives you the functionality present in Volume Discounts to automatically apply a discount when a customers cart has over a certain quantity of downloads . However , you can also create volume discounts for the quantity of a particular download or downloads in a category , e.g. , give 10% off when 3 items from the " Concert tickets " category are purchased together . <p> This gives you flexibility in terms of volume discounting since customers may not need multiple quantities of a download , but you can encourage them to meet an overall cart quantity for a discount , or a quantity for a category . <h> 4 . Bundle Related Products <p> Easy Digital Downloads is one of the best platforms for bundling products , as bundles are built directly into the plugin . You can set the Product Type to " Default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can select which downloads are part of this bundle and set up your bundle price . <p> Note that these bundled items wont be displayed automatically , so you should add them in your product description . <p> When a bundled download is purchased , the files for all of the downloads included in the bundle will be displayed on the purchase receipt . <p> Purchase receipt <p> Bundling with EDD is simple and is a great way to encourage higher value purchases . <h> 5 . Upsell and Cross-sell <p> There are a few ways you can upsell and cross-sell in an Easy Digital Downloads shop to encourage customers to buy related products . <p> The most obvious and complete way to do so is with the Cross-Sell and Upsell extension ( $49 ) . You can configure the headings for these upsells and cross-sells , as well as the maximum number to show ( I 'd recommend no more than 3 cross sells , as these will be shown in the cart / checkout ) . <p> Once you 've configured settings , the plugin let 's you manually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Any upsells you 've added for a download will be shown at the bottom of the product page while customers browse your store . <p> Any cross-sells will be shown on the cart / checkout page between the order items table and payment forms . <p> You could also show related products instead of setting up upsells and cross-sells manually . There are two main ways to automatically show related products to your customers : <p> The free Related Downloads plugin can automatically show related items based on the tags for your downloads . <p> The Recommended Downloads extension ( $49 ) automates showing related products in an intelligent fashion it tracks purchase data , and when products are purchased together , these products are then recommended to customers browsing product pages on your site . <p> On a final note , while this wo n't help with average order value , you can look to increase customer lifetime value with cross-sells and upsells after the order with a tool like Receiptful . This let 's you show related products in your purchase receipts to encourage repeat purchases . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " free " points , which can be offered on a per-shop basis , e.g. , " Double-points weekend " for all products , or on a per-product basis , e.g. , " Triple Points for albums " . <h> 7 . Sell Add-ons or Services <p> Since EDD specializes in digital products , you may have fewer opportunities for product or checkout upsells like personalization or rush handling . However , you can offer small add-ons or additional fees with the multi-option purchase mode for variable downloads . <p> Instead of forcing customers to choose a version of a download , this allows them to combine a couple of purchases , so you could offer a " basic service " with additional options for " rush service " or " white glove service " . <p> Customers can then choose some or all of these options for your download products to purchase . <p> The downside to doing this is that customers can unselect the " Base service " option , so your multiple options are n't  necessary up-charges for a particular option . <h> 8 . Raise Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase average order value with Easy Digital Downloads was raising prices . <p> EDD has a bulk edit action to update product prices , but this let 's you set a new price rather than an increase . <p> This means that you can enter a new price to override a bunch of download prices at once , but you cant do something like , " increase all prices by 3% " . You can still update prices manually , so this strategy can be implemented , but requires more time . <p> Easy Digital Downloads has lots of extensions available , and there are several tools that can help you increase your average order value with our recommended strategies . The flexible discounting and bundling options are very helpful , while the extensions available for cross-selling , upselling , and loyalty programs can help to drive additional revenue . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138112 @2338112/ <h> Advanced eCommerce Product Filters : A FacetWP Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the main reasons why plugins like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads have become so popular for WordPress sites is the ease with which they can be customized to sell almost any kind of product . <p> With WooCommerce , you have hundreds of extensions at your disposal to sell anything from coffee subscriptions to equipment rentals . Easy Digital Downloads focuses on virtual products , but gives you the tools needed to sell services , ebooks , software , create virtual marketplaces , and can even sell shippable goods with simple shipping rules . <p> Both plugins are very developer-friendly , so even if there 's no extension to do what you need , you can typically add functionality with custom code to achieve what you 're looking for . <p> However , in my experience , most functionality-based extensions ( e.g. , not integrations like payments plugins ) focus on what you 're selling adding new product types like bookings or memberships , giving you new ways to show pricing , or helping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensions that focus on how you 're selling and your stores browsing experience . <p> Adding product filters is a powerful way to improve the browsing experience and help customers find the products they 're looking for , especially for sites with large product catalogs or collections . Adding relevant filters to help shoppers browse your store can increase your sales and conversions : <p> Overall there was 76.1% increase in Revenue , a 26% increase in conversions and 19.76% increase in shopping cart visitsAdding a product filer is an obvious feature that many eCommerce stores may or may not have , but this A/B test demonstrated that it worked wonderfully for BuyAKilt.com . Visual Website Optimizer <p> Despite the potential revenue increases from implementing filters and their prevalence with giant eCommerce retailers like Macys and Amazon , many smaller sites do n't  leverage them , even if they are selling hundreds of products . According to Smashing Mag , " only 16% of major e-commerce websites offer a reasonably good filtering experience . " <p> The great news is that , as a WordPress eCommerce merchant , you can add your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with the help of the FacetWP plugin. <h> eCommerce Product Filters : FacetWP Overview <p> FacetWP ( $79+ ) provides a way for WordPress sites to categorize posts and filter the way they 're displayed to visitors . This let 's your visitors see only content that 's relevant to them and the filters theyve chosen , making it easier to find the desired content . <p> Since products on your site are a type of post , FacetWP provides the tools you need to generate filters that customers can use to drill down to the products they want to see . A good example of what you could achieve with FacetWP are the filters Amazon provides while shopping : <p> Example : Amazon Product Filters <p> When your store has hundreds of products , these kind of filters drastically improve browsing , as customers can not only use categories to see the products they want , but can use additional filters ( or " facets " ) to immediately find what they 're looking for . <p> FacetWP has a couple demo set ups you can check out to get an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : Categorizing Site Content <p> The first ( and most important ) thing you 'll need to do is determine how your products should be categorized and filtered . This part is the toughest part of set up , as you 'll need to determine whether the data you want to use exists already or needs to be added , whether filters can have multiple values at a time , and how filters should adjust if multiple values are chosen ( ie do products have to have one or the other , or both values ) . <p> Once you have this data set up , you 'll then need to determine the right filters to let customers drill down your product list appropriately . <p> Here are some good questions you can start with to add your product filtering data : <p> Does this data exist already ? For example , can I use product categories , tags , or attributes in my filters ? Categories are great for general product " types " , while tags are great for information that could relate to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be " Hoodies " , while a tag might be " 100% cotton " . The best kind of categorization for your products is one in which a product is only part of a small number of categories , and has a few tags that can describe it further that would also pertain to other products . <p> Is the data part of other product information ? For example , if you want to add filters for available stock , you can already get that data from WooCommerce . <p> If the data is n't already available , can I add it , such as by adding a new product attribute ? Attributes are handy for things like color or material , as products can have one or more values for an attribute . <p> For example , if you sell purses and want customers to be able to filter them by color , you could add a " Color " attribute , then add all possible values for color . This attribute could then be used in filtering . <p> WooCommerce Attributes <p> You also have the option to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category , tag , or attribute , which well look at in a bit . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : Create Facets <p> The plugin documentation is useful for creating your first facets , which are the filters available for your posts or products . I found that , by thinking about how I wanted to categorize my products and what information customers may want to filter by , my facets essentially created themselves . <p> Once you 're ready to create a facet , you 'll go to Settings &gt; FacetWP &gt; Facets to begin adding your own facets . For example , if I wanted to let my customers filter products by the available stock , I could create a " Number Range " facet . <p> Add Number Range Facet <p> This would let your customers use this facet on your sites frontend to filter the list of products shown ( in this case , any product with stock set to at least 2 ) . <p> Filter by range <p> Your facet can also use existing data like attributes or other taxonomies , which you can search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my products , I can search for this , and create a " Material " facet customers can use to filter by the product material . <p> WooCommerce Attribute Facet <p> When we get to using this facet , it will let customers change which products are displayed . Click the image below to see a quick example of this filtering in action . <p> Click to see filtering <p> If you find that you need some data that does n't  fit nicely into an existing set up , such as a product tag or attribute , you can also use a custom field to add this data , and FacetWP will let you create a facet for that field . <p> Custom fields are available for almost any post , and if you do n't  see the custom field editor immediately , change your " Screen Options " in the top right of your editor to show it . <p> Add product custom field <p> Here you can click " enter new " to add your own custom field , and the value for this product . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it when creating your own facets . <p> Custom Field Facet <p> Once your facet has been created for the custom field , it will operate just like other facets for tags or categories , and just checks if the product has the custom field value or not while filtering . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : Using Facets <p> Once you have the facets added that youd like to use , there 's an important step you 'll take before we display facets . Click " Re-index " for your facets to ensure they 're usable . FacetWP needs to build an index to store the data as to which products fit the facet so that your site stays snappy and fast . <p> Re-index facets <p> Now you 're ready to output a facet selector . There are two steps to output and use this selector . <p> Add a facet shortcode : The easiest place add the facet shortcode do so is in a text widget in your sidebar . Your shortcode will look like this : facetwp facet= " facetname " <p> This will output the facet selector ( ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posts or products being shown . <p> For best results , you 'll want to keep your facet shortcodes outside of the post content , so unless you understand what " the loop " or " WP Query " means , its best to keep these in your sidebar in a text widget = <p> Wrap the content being filtered in a CSS Class : This part is a bit harder for non-developers . You 'll want to wrap the post archive in a CSS class so FacetWP can detect the class and know when it should be used . Do n't  worry , if that does n't  sound like English , well show you how to do this easily for WooCommerce or EDD product lists so your selectors are shown and work properly . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : WooCommerce <p> Let 's get back to the second point about wrapping our content in a CSS class so we can use them with WooCommerce . What this means is that we need an element in the page source code that wraps or envelops the entire list of items being filtered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a filter when needed . <p> If you do n't  know how to properly override the archive template and make these changes , you could also use a bit of code to do this for you that should work with most themes ( I prefer to add code like this using the Code Snippets plugin ) : <p> You can also get in touch with FacetWP support if you need some guidance on this while getting set up . <p> Now when we output a filter with our facetwp shortcode it will ( 1 ) be shown when products are being viewed , and ( 2 ) actually do something to that product list when filters are adjusted . <p> Let 's add a product-specific facet and check it out ! I 'm going to use a " Color " attribute I 've added under Products &gt; Attributes , and I 've added some colors to my products . <p> I 'll choose a checkbox so customers can filter by more than one color at a time , and I 'll use the " Widen the result set " behavior so if multiple colors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , not all colors selected ( it basically changes the logic between AND or OR for the list ) . <p> Create " Color " Facet <p> Facet created ! Now I 'll use a text widget to output the facet selector in the sidebar . <p> Output Facet Selectors <p> And finally , since I have my code snippet in place along with my facet shortcodes , I 'll have a usable set of filters for my product list on the frontend : <p> Products with Filtering <p> Browsing for large sets of products has immediately improved with these filters = <p> Once you 've decided on one of those methods , you 'll be able to add your own EDD facets . As EDD does n't  have attributes , you 'll be limited to categories , tags , or custom fields you 've added for your facets . <p> EDD Tags Facet <p> Once you 've added the code snippet to your site , and added the facetwp shortcode to a text widget again , you 'll see your facet available for your downloads list . <p> Facets Displayed <p> This will let your customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exactly what they 're looking for . <p> Facets Used <p> This is great for things like file type , supported or compatible systems ( such as which readers an eBook can work with ) , or other digital product data that customers can use to get relevant results . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : eCommerce Shortcodes <p> Most eCommerce plugins for WordPress have a way to output products via shortcode . While its the most common way to show EDD products , other platforms like WooCommerce offer this , but they tend to be used less often . <p> If you use WooCommerce product shortcodes to output your product list instead , you can use a similar set up to our EDD one and wrap the shortcode directly in the FacetWP class to ensure it can be used on your product shortcodes as well as your shop list . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : Advanced Usage Conditional Display <p> Since you 're putting these shortcodes inside of a text widget , it may make sense for you to hide that widget sometimes . As your facet selectors will only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense to ensure the entire widget acts like this . <p> I like using the Widget Visibility module in Jetpack to handle these cases . You can conditionally determine when the widget with your facets is shown or hidden so it only appears when products are being viewed , or when a viewer is on a page with one of your shortcodes . <p> FacetWP also offers several free add-ons that you can use for more advanced facet types . This can help you create color swatches , or if you use WooCommerce Bookings , you can create an " Availability by date range " facet to filter bookable products . <p> Compatibility is also included for Advanced Custom Fields if you use this to add additional data to your posts . The ACF Integration supports basic field types , such as text , select , or checkbox , inputs , along with some of the more advanced fields like relationship fields and repeater fields . As ACF is popular among developers and power users for adding additional data to content , this is a really useful integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that you do want new relationships aside from custom fields , you could also consider using the Custom Post Type UI plugin to add new taxonomies ( or post types ) as needed . This is great for data that 's relating your posts , products , or content to one another , such as perhaps brands or retail stores the products can be purchased at . These taxonomies are detected automatically by FacetWP and are available for facets . <h> eCommerce Product Filters : Advanced Usage Templates <p> While FacetWP can be used by a knowledgeable WordPress user , its also an amazing tool for developers . You can customize the way your content is output by creating a template for your facets , then output it using the facetwp template= " templatename " shortcode . <p> This let 's you generate a custom template to output your posts , but its useful to output a " pre-built " query and thus a selection of posts . Facet filtering will also work automatically on this template . <p> I liked using this for a " product category " template , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of facets . This is useful if you want a set of facets that 's only relevant for a certain category for example , " Shoe " facets may not be relevant to " Clothing " facets , and if you want to be really advanced , you could output different templates and sets of facets to reflect this . <h> Using FacetWP to Create eCommerce Product Filters <p> FacetWP gives eCommerce stores the tools needed to provide advanced eCommerce product filters , improving the browsing experience when sites have a large catalog of products . <p> Its most effective for stores that have hundreds of products , as you can create facets to help customers filter out only products they 're interested in seeing rather than browsing the entire catalog , which can improve sales and conversions . <p> FacetWP is also best for users who are at least topically familiar with the way WordPress organizes data into taxonomies or post meta , as this kind of knowledge is needed to create effective facets for products catalogs . <p> At first glance , I found the plugin a little overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use ) and the need to adjust WooCommerce / EDD template files for filtering to work properly . However , after digging into this a bit , I found that adding the CSS class needed for proper filtering was straight-forward ( and I 've added what I did in the sections above ) , and that adding facets was a really powerful way to organize my product catalog and make it more browse-able for a customer . If you start with Facets and follow my guide , I think it will be easy for most eCommerce site owners to use . <p> Overall , while there was a slight learning curve in getting set up with FacetWP , I found it to be a great addition for eCommerce sites with hundreds of products , as it makes your store far easier to browse and filter , and experienced users can set up these filters without the need for custom code or development hours . <p> Even better , while FacetWP does n't  require coding knowledge , it can save developers a ton of time in creating really complex filtering systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facets specific to each product category , making it a useful tool for site owners and developers alike . <p> Note : This see our editorial policy . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> The Woocommerce instructional video indicates that the wordpress theme requires a archive-product.php file and he copies this file from the woocommerce theme .

@@98138114 @2338114/ <p> One of the huge benefits to using a plugin like WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads is the fantastic ecosystem and community around the plugin . While the availability of premium add-ons to meet many of your needs is a plus , there are also tons of excellent free plugins that developers give away that you can use to improve your business . <p> Its been some time since we took a look at some available free WooCommerce extensions ( since March ! ) , so were covering 7 new plugins for WooCommerce today . These are n't  plugins that we just found from a WordPress.org search they 've been installed and tested , and work with the most recent version of WooCommerce. <h> 1 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Export Customer Email <p> I love plugins that do one thing and do it really well , and Export Customer Email is one of them . If you go to WooCommerce &gt; Reports &gt; Customer , you can export a CSV of your customer list that contains the customer name and email address . <p> This let 's you import your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MailChimp , to keep tabs on your customers . <h> 2 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Coupon Generator <p> This is a really handy plugin from Shop Plugins that let 's you generate coupon codes in bulk for your store . The coupon generator wizard is really easy to use , and it can let you generate anywhere from 1 to hundreds of thousands of coupon codes . All you have to do is create the coupon rules , then it does the heavy lifting for you . <p> My test run of 10 coupons took only 0.35 seconds . Its definitely useful for shops that want to give out one-time use codes via email , Groupon , or other mediums . <h> 3 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Product Fees <p> This plugin is built by the ninjas at WooThemes and it gives you a really easy way to add per-product fees to WooCommerce . You can add insurance , printing , or handling fees easily . While editing a product , you can add an amount or percentage-based fee , and even multiply the fee by the item quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the fee amount can change by variation . <h> 4 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Receiptful <p> While Receiptful offers some paid plans , the core offering and the connector plugin for WooCommerce are both free . You can send customized email receipts to your customers that include one-time discount codes , product recommendations , and custom text . <p> We 'd written a detailed Receiptful review when it launched , and since then its added tons of cool stuff , such as the ability to get feedback , show recent blog posts , and allow customers to refer a friend . <h> 5 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Grow Reports <p> Grow reports give you a way to track your stores progress towards traffic and revenue goals from within your WooCommerce dashboard . When you install the plugin , you can authenticate it with Google Analytics so that your stores traffic data can be analytized , then you can enter your conversion rate and average order value . <p> Once you 've done so , you can set a growth target for each month ( i.e. , 5% overall growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. , growth in sessions , revenue , etc , separately ) . Once you 've configured the plugin , it will show you a dashboard with your current metrics and how they compare to your targets : <p> Set up <p> Dashboard View <p> Your dashboard will track and compare sessions , conversion rate , average order value , orders , and revenue to the targets youve set month-over-month and annually . <h> 6 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Prevent Purchase <p> This is another simple , clean plugin that does one thing : It stops customers from purchasing a product . You may want to list a product that can be purchased in-store only , or list a product before its available . In whatever case , you do n't  want to let customers order immediately . Instead , you can display the product , but lock purchasing down completely for it with one click . <p> You can also set up a message ( accepts HTML ) to tell customers why the product is unavailable . <h> 7 . Free WooCommerce Extensions : Multiple Free Gift <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to offer a gift , then you can select products that customers can choose from for the gift . The description is a bit misleading , as its more like a " lite " version that let 's you add one condition / one gift " offer " to your site . The user experience is a bit awkward , but its still a useful little plugin . <p> First , you can create a condition for the free gift ( such as a cart total ) , and then determine which products should be offered to the customer and how many the customer will get for free . <p> Once the customer reaches this criteria and gets to the cart page , the gift(s) are offered and the customer can choose up to the number of gifts you 've allowed . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Do you know is there a Woocommerce plugin that would show the amount needed to add to the cart to get free shipping ? <p> For example if I offer free shipping to everyone who buys 50$ or more . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be wise to encourage that customer to add another 10$ product into cart in order to get free shipping . 
@@98138116 @2338116/ <h> Create WordPress Pricing Tables within 6 Minutes <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> While many eCommerce shops have catalogs with hundreds , or even thousands , of products , there are lots of shops that provide a very limited product offering . There are also times where they have related products , from which customers will choose the best one for their needs . For example , subscriptions are typically marketed this way . <p> In these situations , pricing pages can be a great asset for shops , as they can easily display relevant information about these products while encouraging purchase with an effective price display . <h> Why Use WordPress Pricing Tables <p> Your WordPress eCommerce shop may be fine using a traditional shop layout to display your products , but if you have products that are similar to one another , or customers should choose one product from a range of products , then a catalog with individual product pages may not be the best way to market your goods . <p> In these cases , a pricing table can provide several benefits : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or offerings to purchase the best fit for their needs . <p> Pricing pages allow customers to skim read while still getting the information they need . <p> They can quickly highlight the differences between your offerings without being overwhelming . <p> Pricing tables help you to anchor your prices to encourage the purchase of a particular plan . <p> My preferred plugin for creating WordPress pricing tables is Easy Pricing Tables , as it helps you create pricing tables quickly and gives you the tools you need to create effective pricing pages . <p> Any pro license provides you access to 10 templates ( where the free version only has one ) , and these templates let me set up beautiful WordPress pricing tables in about 6 minutes . You can check out these templates in the frontend demo , and when I used these templates myself , they looked just as good without any style adjustments on my part . <h> Creating Pricing Tables <p> Creating a pricing table with Easy Pricing Tables is very simple . The pro version of the plugin allows you to select a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free version lacks . You can choose from several pricing table templates , or you can create comparison tables as well . <p> I started with a standard pricing table , and selected a template that can highlight a featured plan with color . <p> Selecting templates <p> Once you 've selected a template , you can edit the content of your pricing table . I like that the pro version allows you to use tooltips and icons to add more detail to your pricing table in addition to text . For example , I can add a " lock " icon to convey security to my call-to-action buttons , or I can include tooltips for plan features that may need more explanation . <p> The content setup is easy , and you simply start a new line for each row in your table . You can also add as many columns as you 'd like , and select which column should be featured in your table . <p> Creating the Pricing Table <p> That 's the hardest part of setup . Once you 've created your table , you can also adjust design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can include features like hover animations or " featured " badge text . <p> General Design settings <p> For example , plans that put a badge above the " featured " column will let you adjust this text here . <p> Other general design settings <p> You can also adjust colors for buttons , outlines , and badges in the design settings , which is very helpful if you 're not familiar with CSS , so that your table can reflect your brand . <p> My final stop is typically the " advanced " design settings , where you can disable buttons for information-only tables , hide empty rows , and other useful settings . <p> Advanced design settings <p> You can add CSS to your tables for more advanced usage , but I like that this feature is n't necessary to create the table you want . <h> Pricing Tables in Action <p> Once your table content is created , you can easily add the table to any page via shortcode . You can grab the shortcode while managing tables , or click the " Add Pricing Table " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you do , your table will be displayed with your template and the colors you 've selected under the design options . <p> Simple pricing table <p> If you 've added " expand on hover " options or added tooltips , these will also be visible on hover . <p> Hover effect <h> Comparison Tables <p> Some tables will require a stricter comparison between features rather than simply listing the features for each plan . You 'll typically see these kind of tables with checkmarks or " x " s to indicate which plans have which features . In this case , a comparison table template is a great choice . <p> These tables will still allow you to feature certain columns and add table content , but theyll add an extra " feature list " column to the left of your table , which is where you can list features , then designate which plans have them and which do not . There are handy y and n shortcodes to display checkmarks and xs if needed . <p> Create comparison table <p> Tooltips are also a great tool for comparison tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about features . Theyll be shown on hover , and a dashed line will visually indicate that a tooltip can provide more detail : <p> Comparison Table Display <h> Pricing Toggles <p> One of the best features of Easy Pricing Tables Pro is the pricing toggle feature . This let 's you display more complex pricing , as you can compare monthly vs annual billing , different currencies , or other conditions that will change your price . <p> This is commonly used for businesses that offer cheaper annual plans , as monthly billing will be offered , but yearly billing is discounted . A pricing toggle let 's customers swap between these pricing modes to view pricing tables for each . <p> Creating a pricing toggle is easy , as it essentially creates a comparison between 2 or more pricing tables . You can click " Make a Copy " to duplicate an existing table , then edit it as needed to create your comparison . <p> Managing tables <p> I duplicated a monthly billing pricing table , then changed the pricing to display a discounted yearly price instead without changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toggles using a shortcode generator on any post or page . You click the " Add Pricing Table " button from the post editor , and can select " Insert a pricing toggle " . <p> You 'll then select which tables should be compared , as well as the labels to use for each table . <p> Insert Pricing Toggles <p> This inserts both tables , and the customer can swap between then with one click . <p> Yearly toggle <p> Monthly toggle <p> Customers will see an animation to show them that the pricing has changed here 's what it looks like in action : <p> Pricing Toggles in action <p> Pricing toggles will let you add up to 3 pricing tables for comparison . <h> Using Easy Pricing Tables with eCommerce Plugins <p> The reason wed used these plugins is that they can use add to cart links to add a plan or product to the cart via URL . These are best to use with pricing tables , as you can direct the customer right to the checkout with an add-to-cart link from your pricing table . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button link in my pricing table something like this : <p> /checkout/ ? add-to-cart=101 <p> This will add product 101 ( based on the product I 'd ) to the cart and take the customer directly to the checkout page . <p> With other eCommerce plugins , you wont be able to add the product to the cart via URL . Instead , your pricing table will have to link to the product page for that item , adding an extra step into the checkout flow . <p> Even though the checkout flows may be different , pricing tables can be used with any eCommerce or membership plugin to sell different products or plans , as you can set up the call-to-action button links as desired . <h> Pricing Table Tips <p> These are some tips that are generally effective , but as always , you should test them on your site . Do the opposite and see which yields higher conversions . Run a split test on pricing low to high versus high to low . Make sure you 're not leaving money on the table by following general advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These are typically great rules of thumb when it comes to pricing tables , but as this Mad Mimi case study shows , they do n't  always work as expected ( in this case , showing the highest plan first negatively impacted their price-conscious customers ) . <h> Easy Pricing Tables : Summary <p> Pricing tables can be set up with any WordPress eCommerce plugin using the Easy Pricing Tables plugin . The free version is a great tool , and I 've used it on several sites . However , I love that the Pro version adds features that provide excellent flexibility in creating your tables and pricing display , and makes it worth the $29-$99 purchase ( depending on license type ) . <p> Easy Pricing Tables Pro adds features to : <p> include 10 templates for beautiful WordPress pricing tables with no additional CSS needed 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138117 @2338117/ <h> Selling your Videos with WordPress : HostStreamSell Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the most lucrative ways to generate passive income is by selling digital content . As you have extremely low fixed costs for digital goods , they 're a great way to generate income over time , as most of your investment is up-front in product creation . As a result , selling video courses online has become a very profitable path for eCommerce entrepreneurs . There are stories like those about 10 instructors who made a combined $1.6 million in a year selling courses on Udemy . While these results may not be typical , selling videos or digital content is a great low-risk business endeavor . <p> However , you may quickly run into issues and questions when trying to sell your videos with WordPress : Where do I keep the videos ? How do I make sure they 're secure so that people cant download them or share them ? How do I limit access for a period of time ? <p> You probably do n't  want to host the videos on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will eat up resources if you serve videos from your own server . Instead , I 'd recommend hosting your videos elsewhere and integrating them into your site . Today well take a look at a new service that will allow you to host videos while providing a tight integration with your WordPress eCommerce or membership site : HostStreamSell . <h> HostStreamSell Review : Overview <p> HostStreamSell is a video hosting service that provides easy integration with WordPress eCommerce or membership plugins so that you can sell your videos while they remain secure and your site performance is unaffected . You 'll still be able to sell any other products throughout your shop , so your videos and products will be located in the same place . <p> However , it handles video access for you ( i.e. , available for 6 months ) , as well as download and streaming capabilities , when integrated with an eCommerce platform . This saves you a lot of work in terms of content restriction and makes for a seamless setup you wont need additional plugins just to restrict access to your videos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people selling videos from their websites are using video hosting services like Vimeo , Wistia , Amazon CloudFront , or others , these can sometimes be complicated to setup , or provide access to your videos in an insecure way , which leaves them open to being downloaded . HostStreamSell takes care of security and access to videos so you do n't  have to worry about this . Their introductory blogpost provides a bit more insight : <p> We concluded that most videos are downloaded or shared because there ends up being an easy way to do so , and it is more opportunistic than premeditated . We went about building a platform from the ground up which would have as many layers of security as possible . <p> Best of all , it was fairly easy to set up and use , and gave me a lot of control over how my videos are shared with customers . You can create selling options for videos or video groups , then optionally set limits on the length of access , bandwidth caps on access , and whether downloads are allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video formatting and playback for you : subtitle support is included , and videos will play across any device , whether desktop or mobile . Most browsers are also supported . <p> I liked the pricing structure as well . Many video hosting services will take a percentage of your sales , but HostStreamSell simply charges a flat fee per month , depending on how much storage , bandwidth , and streaming capability you need . The services starts at $7 per month : <p> Pricing <p> HostStreamSell also provides access to their REST API to allow for custom integration with your website or application for more advanced uses . <h> HostStreamSell Review : Host Videos <p> To get set up , you 'll want to sign up for a HostStreamSell account you can try the service out for free for 30 days ( no payment info needed ) . Once you 've created an account , you 'll have access to your Dashboard , along with the ability to upload videos and create video groups ( if needed ) . <p> The Dashboard will show you relevant data on video plays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uploaded a video , you 'll need to encode it before its ready to be sold or used . You can click the " encode " button to start this process , and can continue uploading other videos as this runs . It did take some time to encode my videos , so I 'd recommend uploading them all , then allowing this to run for a bit ( depends on your video size go make a cup of coffee while you wait = ) . <p> Once this process is finished , you can then edit your video settings , such as the name and description , as well as the thumbnail and trailer options . Trailers can be shown to customers who do n't  have access to your video , so you 'll want a strong preview that will entice them to purchase . <p> Video Settings <p> You can also create selling options for your videos . These are pricing options that will provide specific access , such as streaming limits or download ability . If you plan to use Easy Digital Downloads to sell your videos , I 'd recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you plan to use WooCommerce or another membership / eCommerce plugin , I 'd add one selling option per video , as only the first will carry over . <p> Selling Options <p> Overall , video setup is pretty easy and the video settings are very understandable . You can finish by adding titles , descriptions , and selling options to all videos . You can also add subtitles if needed . <p> All videos uploaded <p> Now your videos are ready to be grouped . Adding a video to a group signifies its ready to be sold and will sync it to your eCommerce or membership site when we integrate it . Videos without a group will be ignored , as its assumed that you 're still working on it or creating selling options . <p> You can create a video group under the " Video Group " menu in HostStreamSell . <p> Create a video Group <p> You can add selling options for the group as well ( pricing and streaming / download settings ) , and then add videos to the group . You 'll select any of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can drag and drop them into the order you 'd like . This could be used to form a " course " if desired . <p> Edit the Group <p> Now well have to tie these videos to your store so that they can be sold with your eCommerce or membership plugin . <h> HostStreamSell Review : WordPress Integration <p> The HostStreamSell REST API can allow a developer to integrate your videos with your store as you choose , but there are a few pre-built integrations that will make this simple to implement . The best part is that video access is sold through your cart system so that all sales are accounted for in the same place . No managing payments in two different places . <p> For any of these integrations , you 'll need your HostStreamSell API Keys , which you can get from the admin menu : <p> API keys <p> Youll have to add this to any of the WordPress plugins mentioned to sync your store with HostStreamSell . <h> HostStreamSell Review : EDD Integration <p> If you 're planning to use Easy Digital Download to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between EDD and HSS is the tightest , so you can take advantage of both the multiple selling options for a video , as well as the video groups in HostStreamSell . These are great if you want to sell individual video access , as well as " bundled " access to videos ( like an entire course ) . Any video groups will be created as bundled products in EDD . <p> Now on to the integration . The Easy Digital Downloads integration plugin has setup options located under Settings &gt; HSS Admin . Here you 'll add your API key as well as any dimension settings for your videos . You can also sync your HSS videos with EDD using the " Update " button . <p> Syncing stores <p> This will create your videos as new Easy Digital Downloads products ( and change your menu name to " Videos &amp; Downloads " ) . <p> EDD Products <p> Any single video with one price option will be imported as a simple product , while videos with multiple selling options will have multiple price options created in EDD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . You 'll now be able to sell these videos as products in your store . <p> The video groups will also be created as product categories so that you can organize products even if you do n't  want to sell as a bundle . If you do n't  want to sell a bundle ( or likewise , do n't  want to sell individual videos ) , you can set these to a " draft " status so that they 're not re-added if you re-sync your store . <p> If a customer has not purchased access to a video , he or she will see a trailer for the video on the product page . Once the customer has purchased access , the rules you 've set for the selling options will be in effect ( such as streaming rate and length of access ) , and the customer will now automatically see the full video when returning to the product page . <h> HostStreamSell Review : WooCommerce Integration <p> Integrating WooCommerce with HSS is very similar to Easy Digital Downloads , but you wont be able to import multiple pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundles . Single videos ( that are assigned to a group ) will each be imported as simple products . Video groups will still be used as categories . <p> You can again set up the WooCommerce integration plugin under " Settings &gt; HSS Admin " and enter API keys , then click the " Update " button to sync your store and videos . This will create products for each video : <p> WooCommerce products <p> Access will be granted the same way as EDD : customers will see a trailer of the video until they 've purchased access . Then , when visiting the product page after purchase , theyll see the full video instead . <h> HostStreamSell Review : Other Integrations <p> You can also integrate HostStreamSell with any membership or eCommerce plugin using the using the HSS Embed plugin . With this setup , HostStreamSell with not know when a purchase has been made . Therefore , you 'll have to protect video pages yourself . <p> Many membership plugins already provide for this ability , as they can restrict pages or posts based on membership level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then embed your videos from HostStreamSell on your protected pages , and embed trailers on public pages to encourage new purchases . <p> Both trailers and full videos can be embedded this way to use HostStreamSell as a secure video streaming service . <h> HostStreamSell Review : Summary <p> HostStreamSell provides a video hosting service that 's extremely easy to set up and use . However , the real strength is in the integration with WordPress and restricting videos automatically , and I especially liked how simple the Easy Digital Downloads integration was . Once I 'd uploaded videos and set pricing / access options , I had these videos integrated into my store with a few clicks over the course of a couple minutes and they 're restricted based on the rules I set in HostStreamSell . <p> Best of all , you 're selling these videos right within your existing store , and you can sell other products alongside off them with minimal effort . You do n't  need to restrict pages that your videos are on , as HostStreamSell will take care of restriction and access length for you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital Downloads , WooCommerce , and other membership plugins provide , as all sales are tracked through your store . <p> You can get started with HostStreamSell for free to test-drive it for a month .

@@98138118 @2338118/ <h> Automate WooCommerce Member Coupons with AutomateWoo <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One question Ive gotten a lot is how to give members or subscribers a periodic discount for products on your site , which is no easy feat to accomplish . Sites that have subscriptions or memberships that entitle members to a set number of free or discounted products each month have difficulty in creating this kind of system . <p> WooCommerce Memberships can let you create " Member Discounts " , which essentially give your members a members-only price on your products . However , these member discounts are not limited in usage , e.g. , five discounts per month . <p> Create Member Discounts <p> Limiting automatic discounts like this to a number of usages can be a very resource-intensive process , which is n't great for your site performance . Instead , this is a much better use case for a usage-limited coupon . <p> The downside is that member coupons are on the roadmap for WooCommerce Memberships , but not added into the plugin yet . The good news is that there are plugins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customer , making this much simpler . <h> Using AutomateWoo to Generate Member Coupons <p> AutomateWoo is a very useful plugin for automating several kinds of marketing and promotional workflows in your shop . Were going to use it with WooCommerce Memberships to generate a new coupon for your members each month . This could let you : <p> Give members 3 products from the " Downloads " category free each month <p> Give members a new discount each month for all or some products <p> Drip out discounts so member usage is limited each month ( whereas a member discount via Memberships is unlimited ) <p> However , I should note that many sites use WooCommerce Subscriptions . Generating coupons based on the subscription renewal instead of time into the membership would be far better , so well be publishing a tutorial on that very soon . If you use WooCommerce Subscriptions , just know that Subscriptions support is coming to AutomateWoo soon , and were eagerly awaiting it so we can publish a tutorial on creating Subscriptions coupons ( rather than Memberships coupons ) = <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to create our coupon template , which will be used to send coupons to our members . You can create one or more templates , and AutomateWoo will use this template to generate a unique coupon for the member that 's restricted to his / her email address . You can also set the expiration date on the coupon so that it expires each month . <p> Create your template coupon with a generic name , and determine the coupon value . As were using this for free " Download " products , well make it a 100% coupon . <p> Create template coupon <p> Well also restrict it to that product category : <p> Create Usage Restrictions <p> Finally , well set the usage limit of this coupon so the customer can only use it 3 times : <p> Configure Usage Limits <p> Now AutomateWoo can use this template in workflows it will generate a unique coupon based on this template , but will add the email restriction and expiration date for us automatically . <h> WooCommerce Member Coupons : Create Coupon Workflow 1 <p> Once we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members only , we can set up workflows to email members our coupons . <p> AutomateWoo will let us choose a " trigger " for the workflow . All of our workflows will have a similar trigger : " Order includes a specific product " . Well run this workflow for any customer order that includes our " membership " product , as that signifies that someone has purchased a membership . <p> Create Workflow Trigger <p> Next , well determine when to run the workflow . You can do this right after the purchase , or a set time after the purchase , to send the member the first coupon . The timing is pretty much the only thing that will change between our workflows ; workflow 1 will be triggered first , then every new coupon will be a new workflow triggered later ( i.e. , 30 days , 60 days , 90 days , etc ) . <p> Set Workflow Delay <p> Finally , well add the action AutomateWoo should take when the customer purchases the membership product . While you can add other actions if desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member the coupon code using the " Send Email " action , and the coupon code will be generated by AutomateWoo in the email . To generate the coupon , well include the merge tag with our template coupon : <p> And we can then add subsequent workflows to email the next months coupons . <h> WooCommerce Member Coupons : Create Other Coupon Workflows <p> Now we can set up the rest of our coupon emails , which will be very similar . Well need a workflow for each email , and well just increase the delay for each one . Well still trigger on membership product being purchased , as there 's not really another way to determine if a customer is a member . <p> Create Follow Up Workflows <p> As with the first email , you 'll generate a coupon code for the member and set the expiration date . This can be the same template coupon , or you can use a different one if desired . <p> Workflow 2 email <p> Keep adding workflows for each coupon email you want to send to your members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time until you have all coupon emails configured . <h> WooCommerce Member Coupons : ( Optional ) Check for inactive members <p> Since memberships sold with only WooCommerce Memberships are set-length and paid up-front , you probably do n't  have many cancellations or refunds , so these workflows should almost always be run . <p> However , if you do end up refunding a membership , you may want to remove the workflows for that customer so that coupon emails are no longer sent . As a workflow is set up at the purchase ( since were checking the order for a product ) , it will not be removed if the order is refunded . <p> You can easily delete the workflows for your former member by going to WooCommerce &gt; Reports &gt; AutomateWoo . Under the " Queue " section , you 'll see all waiting workflows . Delete the workflows for the customer whose membership you 've refunded to ensure they no longer get remaining coupon emails each month . <h> WooCommerce Member Coupons : Summary <p> While WooCommerce Memberships can let you create member discounts , these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain number of purchases . Instead , coupons restricted by email are a much better choice for limiting discounts per month ( or overall ) , and AutomateWoo does an excellent job of generating these on a schedule . <p> While coupon emails are not tied into active membership status , as WooCommerce Memberships only sells set-length memberships by itself for an up-front cost , you probably do n't  need to cancel these emails unless a member is refunded . <p> Support for WooCommerce Subscriptions is coming in AutomateWoo , which would make generating coupons based on a subscription renewal instead of a membership purchase possible . If you sell memberships with a recurring payment via Subscriptions , this would make your coupon generation much easier and consistent with the members billing . Well be keeping an eye out for this and will post a similar tutorial using AutomateWoo and WooCommerce Subscriptions when its available ! 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Desmond , I 'm pretty sure there 's an AutomateWoo trigger for lifetime spend already , so youd need some custom code to handle the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it would require the help of a developer to achieve . I 'm afraid this is n't something I have any sample code available for , but the basic gist of what the code would need to do is : <p> Get the WP user I 'd for the user ( probably provided by AutomateWoo in its action trigger ) <p> Loop through each membership to find the plan you want and get the I 'd of that plan . <p> This plan is a WPPost object , so to give the user access to a different plan , change the parent post from the current plan to the target plans post . <p> I would pass this onto AutomateWoo to see if its something they wanted to add support for , and if not , then any WordPress developer should be able to put something like this in place . I typically recommend Codeable for these sort of jobs = 
@@98138119 @2338119/ <h> Selecting a Membership Plugin for WordPress Multisite <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> There are a lot of scenarios in which a membership site would benefit from using a WP Multisite install . Sometimes administrators want to allow members to create their own child sites within the same WordPress installation , while other times its beneficial to allow users to share an account among child sites . For example , take this scenario that a site administrator laid out for a project : <p> I 'd like users to be able to sign up for one account , then have access to content on all child sites . For example , if they sign up for a tutorials account , they have access to a child site devoted to guitar tutorials ( with different access levels for tutorial types beginner , advanced , etc ) . Then they can purchase access to other child sites , such as piano tutorials , though I 'd like the option to allow same access rules to apply to all of the child sites ( i.e. , for selling access as a beginner " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting setups that you can use with a membership plugin for WordPress multisite , but finding the exact functionality you want can be challenging . There three major membership plugins that provide full multisite support : Memberships by WPMUdev , Paid Memberships Pro , and S2Member Pro . All of them have been around for quite some time ( Membership is the newest , yet was launched in 2010 ) , so theyve matured and had time to work out kinks in multisite support . They could also serve as a starting point for a customized solution . <h> Memberships by WPMUdev <p> Memberships allows users to create child sites by signing up for your membership the flagship example for this is Edublogs.org . You can charge members for access to their own child site , or allow members to create sites for free , then charge for other access rules . You could also create a paid social network , as Memberships supports BuddyPress . <p> As for user accounts across all child sites , I could n't find concrete help on this ( I have n't used Memberships myself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites based on a customer account at the parent site based on this thread . Looks like it may take a very slight amount of tweaking , but will be able to achieve this structure . <p> The plugin is $19 , and support / updates are included in the plugin purchase for one month ( you 'll need a WPMUdev membership for more support ) . <h> Paid Memberships Pro <p> Paid Memberships Pro is free ( we have a full review of Paid Memberships Pro for more info ) , and while it does n't  support multisite in the core plugin , there are add-ons to make PMPro multisite compatible . <p> The Network Membership add-on allows restriction for an account across child sites , which allows user to share credentials among your child sites . If you want to allow users to create their own child sites or blogs , then you 'll want to check out the Network/Multisite Membership add-on . <p> There 's also a free add-on to add bbPress compatibility so that your membership site can have private forums . <p> While add-ons are free , support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is available for $97 per year . <h> S2Member Pro <p> To the best of my knowledge , S2Member Pro probably wont work for users that want to share one user account across multiple child sites , as it requires a separate installation on each child site . This item from their specs page provides more detail on this : <p> Compatible with WordPress Multisite Networking ( optional ) . *Note : Users/Members are NOT shared across the Network . Each child blog or sub-site in a Network runs its own instance of s2Member . <p> However , S2Member can allow members to create their own child sites or blogs . You can control the number of child-sites created by each user , and you can limit access to child sites for each account . For example , you could allow free users to have access to your parent site , but only allow paid users to create a child site or blog . S2Member Pro also fully supports BuddyPress and bbPress . <p> S2Member requires a one-time purchase of $129 for an unlimited license to be used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <h> My Thoughts <p> Of these three , Paid Memberships Pro is my favorite to work with , as you 'll probably need support or will be working with a developer anyway for a setup like this , and its very extensible and flexible . Site administration and usage with the plugin ( i.e. , setting up dripping with the series add-on ) is fairly easy as well . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 13 Comments <p> Hey guys . I 've got easy digital downloads running with restrict content pro on a a few multisite installations . It works very well and you will not find a developer that is more responsive and supportive of his plugins than pippin . They have an extension that allows you to set the settings network wide too . Works well . <p> Thanks for this breakdown , Beka . I wish I 'd found it a month ago ! Ive been trying to get MemberMouse up on a multi-site environment , and when I had no luck and contacted support they literally said " we cant help you with that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than all of the other membership solutions , as long as its not a pain to get support ( if their docs are good , then that should n't be an issue ) . <p> Hi , I just wanted to point out one error with this . You mentioned Memberships by WPMUdev as an option for creating child sites and said they use that for Edublogs.org . Youve mixed up their plugins . They have one that does that , but its not Membership , its " Pro Sites " . <p> Membership only lets you give access to content . Its multisite compatible but that 's more for allowing child sites to have their own membership areas . <p> Pro Sites is the one that let 's you create child sites and that they use for Edublogs . <p> I just thought this might help if someone is looking for that . Ive used Pro Sites and I feel its missing a lot of essential features that their customers have been requesting for years , so I was disappointed by it , but there are n't  many options for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ User Registration add-on to create site in a multisite environment . <p> Hey Todd , thanks so much for the clarification here ! I 'm not as familiar with WPMUdev plugins as I am with others , so great to hear from someone that 's used them and has more insight . Will check out Pro Sites for more info if you do n't  mind sharing , where did it fall short for you ? <p> Sure , I 'd be glad to expand on that . There are quite a few areas , actually . <p> In theory the plugin sounds great . It allows you to offer either free or paid sites , with multiple levels of paid sites . The free sites can contain ads if you want and all kinds of restrictions , such as only certain plugins and themes . Different levels can get access to specific plugins , email support , etc . It sounds great . But when you try to start using it , it feels like no one has ever actually used it because many features that seem obvious have been overlooked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is clunky and awkward . It uses the built-in WP signup process , so on the first page the user enters their desired username and email address and there is the option for " Gim me a site " or Just a username ( I forget the exact wording ) . That 's not generally ideal if you 're selling sites . Then on the next page it has options for your site , like site title , etc . There is no mention at this point about paying . After clicking to create your site , you get a message that tells your site name and gives you a link to log in . Again , no mention of paying . When you click the login link , I would expect it to be set up where you 're automatically logged in , but no , you have to manually log in . Once you log in for the first time , then you 're presented with the option to upgrade to paid or keep a free site . On edublogs.com , they do not use this setup . They have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more commercial applications , it just does n't  make sense . <p> Another issue I have with it is the lack of options for payment gateways . For years the only options are PayPal and Stripe . I actually really like Stripe , but for a long time I wanted to use a different gateway ( Clickbank ) . Many , many members requested it as well but the developers never said anything about whether it would be added . Other customers have requested other gateways and for years nothing ever happens with it . Its stayed exactly the same . What I do n't  understand is that some of their other plugins support other gateways , like Authorize.net , but not this one . <p> One thing I do n't  like is that the plugins do n't  integrate well with other , third party plugins . They pretty much only integrate with other plugins they make , and not very well at that . <p> For example , I wanted to integrate it with their Affiliates plugin , which it says it does , so affiliates can refer customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro Sites plugin let 's you set different levels that cost different amounts , the Affiliates plugin only allows you to set one flat amount for commission . So you cant give affiliates more for customers who pay more . <p> They also make the " Memberships " plugin you referenced . I would have though these would integrate together where I could not only sell websites , but also have a members area that my paying customers could get access to . But they do n't  work together like that . In fact , they do n't  even support the same payment gateways . So if I wanted to use Stripe with Pro Sites , that was n't an option with the membership plugin , which does n't  make sense to me . If it was a short term oversight it would be one thing , but its been that way for years . <p> I do n't  mean to be bashing wpmudev , they have a few plugins that are well-designed and work the way you 'd expect . But they have others that are just not thought through completely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems like they do n't  implement many of their customers good ideas . I 've seen many really disgruntled customers in their forums . I 've actually been using them for over 7 years because there are certain plugins they make that no one else does , and certain ones work really well . I really wanted to like them and use their stuff , but every time I try I get really frustrated and sometimes lose weeks of productivity because once I get into a project I realize their stuff just does n't  work right and I have to come up with a different solution . I 've kept coming back to them over the years , hoping things have improved , but so far they have n't . I hope for their sake they start listening more to their customers because , if they do n't  , eventually a competitor will , and could likely put them out of business . <p> At the moment , I 've lost almost a month of productivity because of trying to use Pro Sites . Far into the project I realized its just not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to have to abandon that route and try another one . <p> Hey Todd , thanks so much for sharing this ! Really interesting to hear about the sign up process for customers , that 's definitely a killer if its not streamlined / transparent . ( Also probably not something youd notice immediately while playing with the plugin in the admin ! ) Its always so helpful to hear from someone that 's spent some extensive time using something , as they typically catch things you do n't  think of at first . <p> Thanks again for sharing this ! The insight here should be really helpful to others looking into this solution = . <p> I just wanted to follow up and say thanks for this article . Previously I only knew of " Pro Sites " by WPMUDEV to accomplish this which , as I mentioned , I was very dissatisfied with . However , I had n't  heard of Paid Membership Pro , or if I had , did n't  realize it could provide the multi-site/network functionality I was looking for . But after reading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . After contacting them with some questions and determining it could do what I wanted , I gave it a try . So far I 'm really happy . <p> It did n't  do everything I wanted out of the box , but its flexible enough that it could be adjusted with a combination of freely-available code on PMPros site and some custom coding provided by Jason from PMPro . I bought their consultation package , which is n't small change at around $300 , but was well worth it . Jason wrote some custom code for me while we were on the call and answered questions and helped me get it set up the way I wanted , and then has been answering a couple followup questions in the forums . <p> To do everything exactly the way I wanted , as far as what users have access to on their own sites , I had to use a couple other plugins as well , but I 'm fine with that as everything works together well and is flexible , which has been the case . <p> So far everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and more flexible than what I would have had with Pro Sites . After fighting with Pro Sites for 4 weeks and not getting anywhere , I went with Paid Membership Pro and have it up and running in about 1 week . And I 'm much happier with the end result than I would have been even if I had gotten the other route to work . I have much more control over everything and customize it the way I want . <p> I just wanted to say thanks for your recommendation because I would n't have heard about them otherwise . <p> Hey Todd , you 're very welcome ! Great to hear you 've got a system in place that 's working for you , and thanks for sharing the experience in setting up PMPro . Its definitely one of the more flexible solutions out there and can occasionally require some custom code to be up and running , but it sounds like it was well worth it in this case = . <p> If you do n't  mind me asking what are your thoughts about how to accomplish charging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly prorated ? <p> For example , you run Test.com as a multisite . Example.com is a member of your multisite network . Example.com admin can add or remove additional users/admins under their account , and are charged appropriately on a monthly basis . $1 per month per user under Example.com , 10 users , $10 per month . Then Example.com adds 1 user 15-days into their current billing cycle , which makes next month $10.50 per month . <p> Hey Sam , I do n't  know of a plugin that will let you create this kind of system . I believe site admins for a multisite installation can not create or delete users , so youd have to ( a ) add the capability to do so , ( b ) trigger an action that notifies the super admin / billing system if this occurs , and then ( c ) charge based on the single sites user total . This would be entirely outside of the billing system / any proration or other billing features themselves , so while I think it would probably be possible , youd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would then need to integrate with your billing system of choice . <p> Thank you so much for this article ! I plan to create a multi-site system on area3(.ml) as a fun project I decided to start today = This article was a really big help and I 've bookmarked it so I can come back to it for refference .

@@98138123 @2338123/ <p> This series covers creating membership sites using plugins or eCommerce Platforms . <h> Integrating Membership Sites with eCommerce Plugins <p> We 've recently written several articles on creating membership sites using WordPress eCommerce platforms that wed like to summarize and compare side-by-side for those of you that are n't  currently tied into a platform , or are looking to switch . <p> Before we get started , I 'd like to point out that we published an article on general membership plugins for any WordPress site that you can check out if you only want to sell memberships . There are some truly great plugins available , and many are only getting better . This set of articles is more for those of you that want to sell products in addition to memberships , as integrating membership functionality with an eCommerce plugin is probably the one of the best solutions for this setup . <p> So for those of you looking for a solution or looking to switch , here are some points to consider . <h> Which platform should I use for my store + membership site ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd take a look to consider what you 'll need for the product sales side of your store . Consider how much weight to give the product sales side of your site versus the membership side while evaluating with plugin will be the right one for you . If the membership side of the coin is more important to you , then you may want to compare what each platform can do ( you can view the spreadsheet below here as well ) . <p> Are you selling subscriptions to a physical product ? I 'd consider WooCommerce or Cart66 Cloud . WooCommerce subscriptions offers a lot of functionality and flexibility in setting up billing cycles and user capabilities concerning subscriptions . Cart66 Cloud is easier to use , but is n't nearly as extensible as WooCommerce , so you 'll have to determine what you prefer . Pricing for the first year is comparable between the two ( solely based on this functionality ) , and WooCommerce licenses renew at cheaper prices each subsequent year . Really though , both are good choices . Exchanges Recurring Payments add-on will also allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not as strong . <p> Even though we did n't  cover it in this series , Shopp will also allow you to sell subscriptions to a physical product , but there 's no way to assign members to groups for content access . You can set free or paid trial periods , but can not set sign-up fees with free trial periods . The only way to assign a set-up fee is to set a price for a one-day trial , so you have choose which you want to use . One of the benefits to Shopp is that the shipping settings and discounts are pretty flexible , so if you do n't  need to put members into groups with a subscription , you can also look into using Shopp for your site . <p> Shopp Subscription Product <p> Want the simplest to use ? You 'll probably want to check out Exchange . Youll be limited some by the recurring billing side of things , as you ca n't set sign-up fees or free trials , but content restriction is extensive and super easy to use . <p> Easy Digital Downloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sites selling only virtual products . Content restriction is very easy to use , recurring billing is flexible , and EDD is also pretty extensible . WooCommerce can cover much , if not all , of the same functionality , but will probably be overkill for stores with only virtual products , and the Groups integration is a bit difficult to use . Cart66 can also be used for virtual products as content restriction is easy to use , but again , it wont be as extensible as other platforms . <p> Restricting logins is also not possible with Cart66 , as user accounts are not assigned as WordPress users . Other eCommerce plugins use WordPress user roles for subscribers , so you can restrict logins using the free WP Bouncer plugin . Logins are restricted to one IP address at a time , which is not foolproof , but is a good deterrent from sharing site credentials . I 'd also be curious to see actual statistics on how often user credentials are shared to determine how much revenue is lost from shared credentials anyone actually have hard data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with Cart66 Cloud or Exchange . Billing is more flexible with Cart66 and the cart system is hosted for easy setup and security , while Exchange offers more detailed content restriction , very simple usage , and is better for stores with physical products as well . <h> In Review <p> To summarize , if you only want membership functionality , check out our article on WordPress membership plugins . If you want to integrate an eCommerce store with memberships , then you have a lot of great choices available . Selecting a platform will solely depend on what you need / prefer for your store . Since we like you all so much , we 've tried to simplify this into a " Integrating Membership Sites with eCommerce Plugins " infographic ( full size here open in a new tab ) : <p> As I mentioned before , selling shippable subscription-based products is easy with both WooCommerce and Cart66 , so I 'd recommend giving both a shot . As for virtual products or content , please let us know if you have suggestions or experiences to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comments <p> Hi Beka Thanks for all your informative reviews of Membership plugins for WordPress . Can you say anything about reporting and analysis capabilities of any of those covered ? I 'm interested in allowing my client to see who downloaded/bought what . This way they can perhaps pursue the most promising to convert them to their own clients ! Thanks Robert <p> Hey Robert , I 'm assuming you 're also selling products through your membership site , so you need to use an eCommerce plugin ? If that 's the case , WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads have the best reporting and order management capabilities , so you can view which customers bought which items and view purchasing histories .

( And an inordinate amount of free EDD add-ons are from Andrew Munro , who writes great EDD tutorials and code snippets . ) These free EDD extensions can help take your digital store to the next level . <h> Free Easy Digital Downloads Add-ons <h> 1 . Lock Downloads to IP <p> This simple extension will restrict access to downloadable files to the IP address that was originally used to purchase the download . This prevents users from sharing their download links with others . However , be cautious and warn customers , as those that purchase from a mobile device will not be able to download purchases on a desktop and vice versa. <h> 2 . Related Downloads <p> The Related Downloads add-on is pretty self-explanatory it adds related downloads on the download page after the content . You can determine whether you want to use categories or tags to determine related content , the number of related downloads to show , and how they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to have related products displayed in a widget rather than below the download pages content . <h> 3 . EDD CSV Manager <p> The EDD CSV Manager allows you to bulk import or export products from your EDD shop . Import and export download products via a CSV file , and export a . zip of all files and images attached to download products . This can help you upload all products to a new server or to import past purchase records into Easy Digital Downloads. <h> 4 . Downloads as Services <p> Want to use EDD to sell your services instead of a downloadable product ? You 're not the only one ! This plugin removes the " no downloadable files " notice on the purchase confirmation page . It will also allow you to select individual downloads that are services , or to select an entire category that contains the services that you offer . <h> 5 . External Products <p> The EDD External Products extension is a great addition for those of you that both sell your own products and want to link to products as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any product you choose . If an external URL is specified , the add to cart and buy now buttons will send the customer to the external site instead of purchasing the item . <h> 6 . EDD Auto Register <p> The Auto Register add-on will allow you to create a WordPress user account for your customers at checkout without the need for the customer to enter any additional information . This helps to expedite the checkout process while still ensuring that customers can log in and view purchases or re-download files ( if allowed ) . The customers email address will be used as the username as this is required for checkout , and a random password will be automatically generated . <h> 7 . EDD Download Images <p> The Download Images plugin easily allows you to add extra images to your downloadable products and display them using the edddownloadimages shortcode . You can use the shortcode or template tag to display these images anywhere youd like , which is very handy for products that require more than just a featured image . Advanced usage will allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a slideshow. <h> 8 . EDD Prevent Checkout <h> 9 . Variable Pricing Descriptions <p> Variable download pricing is a really useful option with EDD , especially if you 're selling versions of a product ( i.e. , Regular vs Pro software ) or multiple products that can be purchased together ( such as tracks on an album ) . The Variable Pricing Descriptions add-on allows you add a description for each option by adding an " Option Description " field for each pricing variation . This way , you can describe not just the parent product , but the variations for each download if needed . <h> 10 . Featured Downloads <p> This extension provides a shortcode and template tag that will allow you to show a list of featured downloads . A " featured " checkbox will be displayed on the Edit Download pages and in your download list . You can then display a list of these featured downloads using the eddfeatureddownloads shortcode or template tag . This is handy for those of you that like to either have a " Featured Products " page or show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . WP Menu Cart <p> The WP Menu Cart plugin adds a shopping cart button to your sites navigation bar , and is compatible with EDD . You have the option to display items only , price only , or both items and price with the shopping cart button . You can also determine whether it should always be shown , or only when items are present in the cart . <h> 12 . Search Widget <p> The Search Widget extension acts very much like the regular WordPress search widget , but limits search queries to only download products from Easy Digital Downloads so that customers can easily find products without getting results for posts , pages , and other parts of your site as well . You can also use the shortcode edd-searchbox to display a search box rather than using the built-in widget . This could be pretty handy as part of your 404 page template so that customers can get connected with your products . <h> 13 . Product Badges <p> EDD Product Badges is also pretty self explanatory this plugin allows you to optionally add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add text or image-based badges for new or featured products . The text and badge images are up to you , as options are included for changing badge type , opacity , and other options . <h> 14 . Software Specs <p> The last two free Easy Digital Downloads add-ons are great for those of you selling software . The Software Specs extension adds a specifications table below your single download content with information such as version , file size , and more . You can display specifications using the edd-software-specs downloadid= " ### " shortcode instead if you prefer . It also adds relevant data to generate Google Rich snippets for Software Applications . <h> 15 . EDD Changelog <p> The EDD Changelog plugin allows you to optionally add changelogs and version numbers to each of your downloads . This can automatically be displayed after the single download content in a toggled container ( which can be collapsed ) , or you can display it using the eddchangelog shortcode . Changelogs and versions numbers will also be included in the EDD receipt page . This is also compatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx871392

However , these can be difficult to use if you 're new to modifying WordPress plugins or do n't  understand PHP basics . While there are tons of useful snippets available for customizing WooCommerce or tweaking your shops display that take advantage of these hooks , you 'll have to hunt these snippets down . You may even need to change them to get the effect that you 're looking for . <p> The moral of the story is that WooCommerce can be customized pretty easily , but there may be a barrier to doing so if you 're uncomfortable with adding custom code to your site , or do n't  particularly understand how an action or filter can work . <p> The plugin well take a look at today is designed to take these small tweaks and make them accessible for users that do n't  want to add code snippets to their site . The WooCommerce Jetpack plugin adds settings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can avoid adding custom code to your site . <p> The plugin adds numerous settings in a new WooCommerce tab that you can go through to enable and adjust as needed . There are pros and cons to this approach ( which we identify below ) , but the end result is that you can change several components of your site easily without worrying about conflicting code snippets . <h> WooCommerce Jetpack Setup <p> When installed , the plugin adds a settings menu to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Jetpack . Here you 'll be able to go through all settings and enable or disable them , as well as make your needed changes . There 's a large number of settings pages , so the setup may be time intensive . You can also find some of these settings through the WooCommerce default settings . <p> Some of the settings are locked unless you 've also installed and activated the WooCommerce Jetpack Plus plugin , which is currently on sale for $19 . Ill note which features are free and which are paid as I mention them . <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can be disabled if they 're unnecessary . For example , you can enable a " Call for Price " banner for products whose price is blank . <p> You can also make small changes to your product and shop pages . You can add information such as total sales or product SKUs to both your shop and single product pages : <p> There are several attributes that you can add to the shop pages , and there 's a full list of possible additions available . For example , you could display shipping weight and / or stock availability instead . <h> WooCommerce Jetpack Tools <p> The plugin also adds a set of tools under WooCommmerce &gt; Jetpack Tools . <p> My favorite of each of these tools is the ability to add custom order statuses to WooCommerce . You can add as many custom statuses as needed and delete them in the future if they 're no longer used . This is super helpful if you want to have a " shipped " status in between the " processing " and " complete " statuses , as each shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jetpack Key Features <p> Within the settings , there are a few key features that I found very useful . Most of these features are available in the free version , while the " Plus " version grants some additional or advanced functionality . <h> Product Pages <p> WooCommerce Jetpack will add the ability to set custom price labels on your product pages as desired . You can set any HTML to display after the price at a global level under the " Custom Price Labels " setting , and you can use HTMl instead of the price on a per-product basis . <p> For example , this could be useful if you sell products in bundles or packages . You could display " per dozen " following the price by creating a global setting for this . The " Plus " version of the plugin unlocks all pricing labels for a product . <p> WooCommerce Jetpack also let 's you add a product tab to your WooCommerce product pages . The free plugin can add one global and one single tab per product . <h> Checkout <p> You can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateways can be added , which are essentially new manual payment gateways . This is useful if you use the " check " gateway for something , but need to add another payment gateway . For example , I added an " Invoice " gateway , which will allow me to send an invoice to the customer following the order . <p> I really liked the ability to restrict this gateway to certain shipping methods , which can let you create a specialized gateway for delivery or other services . You can also set a minimum order amount for this gateway with the Plus version . <p> When displayed on the checkout page , your customized message , icon , and name will be displayed . <p> You can add payment gateway fees with WooCommerce Jetpack as well . This is handy to add a fee for gateways like the " check " gateway , as you may have to go deposit these checks in person . You can add a fee to account for this and encourage customers to use another payment method . You can set a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or percentage fee with the Plus version . <p> I also liked the setting that enables free shipping to hide other shipping methods . This is an easy way to ensure that your customers do n't  pass up free shipping promotions , which you may be asked to refund later if they accidentally pay for it . <p> The final checkout tweak that I used was the ability to change the " Place Order " button text as needed . <p> When your checkout is displayed , these changes will be in effect . <h> Other <p> The other important setting in WooCommerce Jetpack is the ability to generate sequential order numbers . You can ensure that your order numbers do n't  skip when generated , which may be necessary for accounting . <h> WooCommerce Jetpack Pros and Cons <p> WooCommerce Jetpack is geared towards users or shop admins that do n't  want to add custom code to their sites . The plugin is structured well and will help you make several small changes to your site without hunting down individual snippets to do so . <p> The benefit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of functionality with a minimum of effort . Rather than seeking out several plugins or snippets , you simply install and activate one plugin , and you have several new features added to your site with one install rather than installing 30 different plugins to accomplish this . It can save you time as a shop admin in terms of researching and adding plugins . <p> You also go to one place for support rather than using plugins from several different authors , which provides another time management bonus . <p> While this all-in-one solution can be useful for a shop administrator , there are downsides . There 's a small risk that an issue or error in the plugin could then affect multiple features on your site , as they 're part of the same plugin , rather than a modular approach of using separated plugins . <p> A plugin that adds several bits of functionality to your site may not be able to provide the depth in terms of feature set that you need , or may have to fit the UI for this into a structure that 's not best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PDF Invoices with WooCommerce Jetpack is awesome , but the setup is a tad bit cumbersome , as it has to fit in with the rest of the plugin structure . Typically PDF Invoice plugins have the flexibility to set up a new menu with tabs to organize the settings for the content , emails , and other setup information rather than displaying it all on one settings page . <p> This is certainly not a deal breaker , and will simply depend on what you need for your site . As a user you should determine : <p> what features you need ( and whether you need the majority of the features offered by an all-in-one plugin ) <p> if these features do enough to meet your needs or if a more specialized solution is required <p> whether you 're willing to install multiple plugins or if you 'd like to install one . <p> As always , your workflow will dictate what 's best for you . <h> WooCommerce Jetpack : Summary <p> WooCommerce Jetpack succeeds in making a shop managers life easier you can make changes and add several small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effort . <p> Setup will be intensive as there are so many features to go through , and some wording may be foreign to users new to WordPress . For example , setting a " Priority " for a product tab may confuse some users , as it sets the function priority for them , but they may not know an appropriate number to use . However , all new features are organized into one place so that you can quickly find them . <p> There 's the risk that you do n't  need many of the extra features , as there are other plugins or snippets that can help you get some of the WooCommerce Jetpack functionality , or that the modules may not do everything you need . <p> However , if you 're looking for a few of these features already and you want an easy way to add them to your site without custom code , WooCommerce Jetpack can be a very handy tool for you and makes it easy to make this site changes . You wont have to seek out several snippets and plugins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to with the Plus version . You also get to go to one author for these features and support . <p> Note : This post . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Arp , great question . I did most of the testing on a local site and a low-traffic test site so this was n't something I tested particularly , but there was n't anything within the codebase that would have led me to believe performance would have been affected . It was well-structured and none of the snippets / modules seemed too resource-intensive.

However , that does n't  mean that excluding PayPal from your eCommerce sites payment methods is the best choice for you . <p> While PayPal may not always be the most merchant friendly payment processor available ( read this from Chris Lema for an idea ) , customers trust PayPal and many merchants see an increase in their bottom line by using PayPal on their site . Nielsen Online Buyer Insights reports that PayPal Merchants benefit from a 27% increase in total customers after integrating PayPal , while total amount spent by customers increases 15% and transactions per customer almost double . <p> That kind of trust and those increases are significant enough that you should be testing PayPal in your stores checkout to see if you can duplicate these results yourself . Customers do n't  even need a PayPal account to pay via PayPal they can use their bank account or credit card to complete checkout , but can use their PayPal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SSL certificate while other methods may not , I 'm not going to include this in our comparison . If you run an eCommerce site , you should be using an SSL certificateno matter what . Aside from protecting payment information , they protect the login information for you and your customers from being sent in plain text to your server , and they usually increase conversions due to increased trust . You 'll also get an SEO bump for having one . <p> Our PayPal comparison is meant to help you decide which PayPal service is right for your WordPress eCommerce store . Well describe what each PayPal service can do and the associated fees ( in USD ) , then we have a list of which PayPal add-ons are available for each eCommerce plugin so you can get started ! <p> Transactions via PayPal Standard are processed on PayPals site ( not your own ) , and will allow customers to pay with a PayPal balance or credit card . Theyll be sent to PayPal from your checkout screen , and you 'll be charged the standard transaction fee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Customers are then directed back to your site after completing the PayPal checkout . PayPal also offers volume discounts if you process over $3000 in transactions with PayPal monthly . <p> Since checkout is completed on PayPals site , you have to rely on PayPal send payment success and failure notifications back to your store for completed orders using something called an Instant Payment Notification ( IPN ) . Using the PayPal IPN can occasionally be unreliable , which can sometimes result in the orders not being completed correctly on your store , which is one of the downsides to PayPal Standard . <h> PayPal Comparison : Express <p> PayPal Express is available in the same countries as PayPal Standard , and you 'll be charged the same 2.9% + 30 per transaction with no setup or termination fees . PayPal Express is very similar to PayPal Standard with one major difference : the checkout flow . <p> PayPal Express avoids the IPN issues that arise with PayPal Standard . Customers will be directed to PayPal from your site , but they do n't  complete checkout at PayPal . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed back to your site with a token ( this token is passed to your site behind-the-scenes ) . <p> The token can be used by your site to submit a final payment to PayPal . When a customer clicks to finish placing the order on your site after being directed back , this finalizes the order and sends that token back to PayPal with the final order details . <p> This is a more reliable payment method than PayPal Standard , as the checkout is completed on your site , but the payment is done on PayPals servers once your token is returned to PayPal . <h> PayPal Comparison : Pro <p> There are no startup or termination fees with PayPal Pro , but there is a $30 monthly fee along with a per-transaction fee of 2.9% + 30 ( volume discounts are still available ) . PayPal Pro also includes the PayPal Virtual Terminal to allow you to accept payments over the phone , the ability to accept bank transfers and in-person payment , as well as online invoicing . <p> The biggest difference ( and benefit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire checkout experience , as customers remain on your site during the checkout process rather than being directed to PayPal to complete checkout or approve payments . <p> PayPal Pro is available to merchants in the UK , US , and Canada . PayPal also has a comparison available between PayPal Standard and PayPal Pro . <h> PayPal Comparison : Advanced <p> PayPal Advanced is available for merchants in the US and Canada only this time . Advanced includes online payments and invoicing for merchants along with a checkout directly on your site like PayPal Pro . <p> There are no setup or termination fees , but PayPal Advanced requires a $5 monthly fee along with fees of 2.9% + 30 per transaction . The difference between PayPal Advanced and PayPal Pro is that the checkout form is on your site and embedded in your checkout process , but is not something that you can customize entirely . <p> The PayPal Advanced checkout form is an iframed form , which means that the form is actually hosted on PayPals servers and embedded on your checkout page . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in your checkout flow for purchasing , but the payment form is actually hosted by PayPal and payment information is sent directly to their servers . <h> PayPal Comparison : Digital Goods <p> One of the less popular gateway options offered by PayPal is the Digital Goods gateway .

The checkout process is seamless and can be completed from within your digital content easily , as shipping information is not needed . <p> PayPal Digital Goods charges only per-transaction fees of 2.9% + 30 or 5.0% + 0.5 ( whichever is lower ) to better support micropayments ( payments usually lower than $10-12 ) .

Any idea why they would n't upgrade to Pro or Advanced ? <p> Hey Joe , NameCheap is actually using PayPal Express instead of Standard .

For promotions on eCommerce stores , one of the best way to let your customers know about the sale is through emails . <p> In this post , well take a look at an email that comes closer to the end of your promotion campaign . Our example will be the sale reminder email from Moo , makers of premium business cards , stickers , postcards , etc . <h> Sale reminder from Moo : What works <p> Top half of the sale reminder email from Moo <h> 1 . Layout <p> The layout is one of the strongest points of this email . The emails starts with an image highlighting the details around the sale and a clear call-to-action button . The email then showcases three products that are included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a custom link for each of these products so that customers can directly go to the specific product category . Lastly , the email clearly states the products not included in the promotion and ends with links to social profiles. <h> 2 . Graphics <p> The email is visually very clean while still capturing the products and their details . The graphics fit in perfectly with the layout of the email giving it a very professional and premium look . This is part of the Moo brand , and the email certainly helps showcase it . <p> Bottom half of the sale reminder email from Moo <h> 3 . Copy <p> The copy that goes along with the images is clear and concise . The value proposition for each product is unique and captured within a heading and a description sentence .

This highlights the value customers get from purchasing these products . <h> Sale reminder from Moo : What does n't  work <p> There 's not much that I can point out in this email that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved is the personalization of the email . Since I 've been a previous customer with Moo , they have my details , like name and past orders , in their system . <p> You can personalize your emails by including one or some of these details ( a greeting with the customer name is a simple one ) in your emails . Another thing you can do is add a personal signature to the email . This helps humanize your brand which helps create better customer engagement . <h> Sale reminder from Moo : What got us to click <p> The large image at the beginning of the email that showcases some of the products on sale along with a clear call to action underneath got us to click . This is a perfect example of not burying the lead . The point of the email is captured in that top half with pertinent information : <p> how much time is left <p> how much discount is available <p> what type of products does it apply to , and <p> where to go to get the discount <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succinct and visually-appealing way . Capturing this towards the top of the email will help better funnel people to the promotion and your store . <h> Sale reminder from Moo : Takeaway <p> The sale reminder email is an essential part of any promotional campaign for your store . Although the promotion launch email probably gets most people to look at the promotion , some people may put off the purchase knowing that there is still time to get the discounted price . This is especially true if your customers werent already planning to purchase your products . Think of it this way , for an item you had n't  planned to purchase , there probably werent too many times you made a purchase the first time you saw it on sale . <p> Typically , the first time a customer finds out about the sale , it puts them on the path to purchase as they start considering the products . This is why a reminder email is crucial , especially closer to the end of the campaign . In todays example , the email from Moo showcases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second half of the email . <p> What types of emails do you send during a promotion or sale ?

It requires a lot of work and research , and needs constant TLC in terms of content generation and updates . There are a lot of options out there available to use for setting up a membership site , but each provides different features and functionality . So how do you choose which membership plugin is for you , and whether investing in a paid plugin is the way to go , or if a free one will work ? There are some important questions to ask yourself , and fortunately there are some great options both within eCommerce platforms and via general WordPress plugins . <p> Well cover some of the possible solutions in a series and link to each article here as we post them . We 've included a checklist of things to consider about what kind of solution you 'll need , and well first cover some plugins that probably work will all eCommerce platforms or wont require you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tie membership functionality into your eCommerce plugin if you 're selling other things besides memberships . <h> WordPress and Membership <p> First , why should you create a membership site using WordPress when there are lots of other solutions out there already ? Well friends , its pretty darn cheap and usually very flexible . Pricing for most non-WordPress membership platforms can be anywhere from $100 in one-time fees to $100 per month . You 're going to need a decent amount of members pretty quickly to ensure that your site pays for itself if you 're paying a high monthly fee just for your membership platform . ( Remember , you 'll have to pay for your domain name , DNS , possibly an SSL certificate , hosting , and other site costs as well . ) If you want to check out a list of non-WordPress membership platforms , we have a list at the end of this article . <p> Using WordPress can reduce costs and allow you to integrate a store , blog , and membership area all in the same site pretty easily . Plus , WordPress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using WordPress ? Kind of a no-brainer to us ; ) . However , we know not all membership sites are based on digital content ( subscription boxes , anyone ? ) . This makes us like WordPress even more : you can make a membership site with your existing store and eCommerce platform . The flexibility to do what you want is pretty awesome . <p> So how do you determine which WordPress plugin is for you ? That depends . If you 're already tied into an eCommerce platform , you may want to look at what options you have within that platform , so that 's why well cover potential setups with some of the more popular eCommerce plugins . If you have n't set up your site or store yet , you 'll want to ask yourself some important questions on what kind of membership site you 'll run and what features are important to you . The checklist below will cover some of the important questions to ask yourself when starting this process , and well address points from this checklist throughout the articles in this series . <h> Checklist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should keep it in mind . However , if you 're going to be building a site that will generate revenue on a platform , I 'd advise being sure that the platform is sustainable . Nothing will be worse than building your site and then finding out the platform is no longer actively developed , so cheap does n't  necessarily bode well for the long haul . However , I 'll try to recommend plugins with proven track records throughout this series that will ( hopefully ) be around for some time . <p> First , you 'll want to take a look at how your content will be protected . Chances are you may want some free content in addition to the paid content on your site , so the way the content is restricted will be important . Does the plugin protect both pages and posts ? Can you protect custom post types ( i.e. , products ) or certain post categories automatically ? Most plugins will have good options for this , but pay attention to how you want it to work . <p> How many membership levels can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them ? <p> Can members purchase more than one membership if you want to use a topic-based approach instead of a tiered approach ? <p> Does the plugin handle scheduling recurring billing/subscriptions as well , or just the content restriction ( for example , you sometimes need two different plugins to accomplish this with some eCommerce platforms ) ? What else do you need to make this happen if billing is not scheduled ? What kind of billing cycles are available ( monthly , yearly , custom schedules ) ? <p> This is a big one for us , but may not matter to you : Can you use Stripe to process payments , or are you stuck with another processor ? here 's an explanation of why we love Stripe . <p> Can members pause or resume memberships ? Is there a way to prorate fees for new or canceling members ? MemberPress is the only general solution that allows you to do this , or WooSubscriptions can do it via WooCommerce . <p> Can customers upgrade/downgrade subscriptions or memberships ? <p> Can you " drip " content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " content in the membership , you probably do n't  want to give all of your content out to members immediately when they sign up , as they can then download everything and cancel or it could be overwhelming to see it all at once . " Unlocking " content over time ( dripping ) protects you from these members who sign up and then ditch . Depending on your model , this may or may not be important for you . Want some insight on this ? Check out this post by Memberful . <p> Can you restrict logins ? By preventing multiple IP addresses from logging within a certain time period , you can ( hopefully ) reduce sharing of one membership among multiple people . Many platforms ignore this possibility , but MemberMouse handles it well . <p> While this probably wont be a major concern for most sites , you should ask yourself if you 'll need to set a membership expiration date . While most plugins support billing every month , year , etc. , what if your membership runs only until Dec. 31 ?

So well do our best to cover some potential options , but I 'd also recommend looking for other reviews in case there are things we miss , then trying whichever platforms you think will work for you before launching the site . Paying $100 and finding out the plugin does n't  work for you is infinitely better than building out the entire site and being stuck with something you do n't  want .

@@98138130 @2338130/ <h> EDD Members Review : a Simple , Lightweight Membership Solution <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of the toughest things to do while building a plugin is to balance the ability to do something really well and be streamlined in meeting this aim with the need to be flexible enough to support several use cases . Some complex plugins ( like WooCommerce ) do a lot to try to support different use cases , and thus they end up with features that not all users will use . <p> While supporting several types of users is not necessarily a terrible thing in an eCommerce platform or a complete membership solution , its not something you always want to see in smaller plugins like social sharing buttons or eCommerce add-ons . Its always great to use a plugin that has laser focus and does n't  try to be all things to all people . <p> The EDD Members plugin ( 45 , or about $51 ) is one of those laser-focused plugins . Its designed to be a simple , lightweight membership solution powered by Easy Digital Downloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution that tries to meet tons of use cases , and thus works really well for certain kinds of membership sites . <h> EDD Members Review : Overview <p> EDD Members is from Sami Keijonen at Foxland . Before we talk about what the plugin does , let 's talk about what it does n't  do : <p> Instead , its designed to be lightweight and to support a certain kind of membership site . EDD Members is great for sites that : <p> Only have one membership " level " or plan for the site <p> Want to restrict content , and possibly sell other digital products <p> Want to use bbPress to create members forums <p> Have simple content restriction needs <p> It integrates with bbPress to create forums , and can also be used with EDD Recurring Payments to create subscriptions for memberships . As not every site needs a large , full-featured membership solution , EDD Members is a handy " simplified " alternative . <h> EDD Members Review : Setup <p> Setup with EDD Members is fast and simple . There 's one recommended change for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enable registration , as memberships must be tied to a user account , and EDD Members will not force registration . <p> EDD Members : Disable Guests <p> Once you 've done that , you can head over to Downloads &gt; Settings &gt; Extensions to find the EDD Members set up . You can restrict entire types of content with one click , such as all blog posts , or leave these unchecked to restrict them one by one . <p> You can also determine if comments and RSS feeds should be protected as well , and create " content restricted " messages to show to non-members if content is inaccessible . <p> EDD Members Settings <p> One important thing to note : EDD Members only hides content , so it does not restrict purchasing if you restrict your Downloads to members ; the download description alone will be hidden . The add-to-cart button on the Downloads page may be hidden , but this depends on your theme , and products can still be purchased via URL or from a " shop " / products listing . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics , and replies for your members to have a private " members-only " area . <p> bbPress support <p> I really like the ability create customized notices for expiring or expired memberships with EDD Members . You can add or customize your renewal notices and when to send them . <p> EDD Members Emails <p> Clicking " Add Renewal Notice " will let you add new emails and determine when they should be sent in advance of expiration ( and how far before ) or after expiration ( and how long after ) . <p> Add a Notification <p> To complete set up , you may need to restrict individual pieces of content . To do so you can view / edit the post , page , or other content , and check the " Set as private " option . <h> EDD Members Review : Shortcodes &amp; Dripping <p> If you need more fine-grained control over your membership content than what the settings give you , you can use shortcodes to restrict portions of content ( such as a video in a public blog post ) The eddmembersonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to members . An optional message attribute can also let you set a message for non-members who ca n't see the restricted content . <p> eddmembersonly message= " This message is shown to non-members . " This content is shown to valid members only . /eddmembersonly <p> Shortcodes can also allow you to drip content over time to delay the members access . The eddmembersdrip shortcode works in a similar way to the members only shortcode , but can add a delay attribute to determine the number of days the member has to wait to see the content . <p> Both non-members and members that will have access , but not yet , will see the " message " content . Members that have been around long enough will see the content wrapped in the shortcode . <p> eddmembersdrip delay= " 7 " message= " This content can be seen 7 days after purchase . " This is delayed content that will be shown to members 7 days from purchase . /eddmembersdrip <h> EDD Members Review : Create Member Products <p> You can manually give membership access to users on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memberships by purchasing EDD products . When you create a product , you can enable " membership length creation " for the product . When the product is purchased , the customer will become a member for the length of time you 've specified . <p> Member creation also supports variations , so you can change the access time based on the variation purchased . If a customer purchases more than one membership variation or product ( does n't  have to be in the same order ) , the one that grants access for longer will be used . <p> Give access at purchase <p> It maybe helpful to add download notes and / or files to your membership , as these will be shown on the " purchase received " page , and you can use them to direct members to what they should do next see the blog , visit forums , etc . <p> Optional : add download notes or files <p> This way , members are led directly into the content access theyve just purchased . <p> Membership download note / files <h> EDD Members Review : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , the customer will still see your content in archives like your blog page or shop page . Excerpts ( if shown by your theme ) will also be shown to the non-member . <p> Archive view <p> When a non-member tries to click on a post or other restricted content , the non-member is shown the correct " content restricted " message that you 've created under settings . For a logged-out non-member , theyll see your first message : <p> Non member , logged out message <p> And a logged-in non-member will see your other message : <p> Non member , logged in message <h> EDD Members Review : Managing Members <p> When a customer has become a member , you 'll be able to view the membership status ( active , expired , or unknown ) and expiration date from the " Users " list . <p> Users List <p> If you click on a user to view the user , you 'll see membership details at the bottom of the user account ( if available ) . This will show you the expiration date . <p> Viewing Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can manually add a membership from here by adding an expiration date . When you save a users profile with an expiration date added , theyll be granted a membership . <h> EDD Members Review : Recurring Payments Support <p> When Recurring Payments is active , you 'll be able to choose if memberships should be active only as long as the billing is under your EDD Members settings : <p> Enable subscription support <p> You can also limit content access to active subscribers only : <p> Protect content to subscribers <h> EDD Members Review : Support &amp; Documentation <p> I love how easy EDD Members is to set up and use , and I found a couple of helpful hints ( like the dripping shortcode ) from the plugin documentation . For example , the set up guide is thorough and will get you up and running within minutes . <p> Each purchase also includes at least 6 months of support , depending on which license you purchase . <h> EDD Members Review : Summary <p> EDD Members does n't  do everything a membership plugin could do and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic membership sites that should restrict content or forums , and allow purchasing a membership with a one-off payment or subscription ( using the Recurring Payments plugin ) . <p> I 'd like to see a few small features , such as the ability to bulk-edit posts or other content to restrict them , which helpful for sites that do n't  want to restrict all posts , but want to restrict many at once . However , it does a good job of meeting the needs of the kind of site its trying to serve : a site with just a " membership " no plans , levels , or complex restriction rules . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Run sales ? Offer free shipping promotions or discount promotions ? <p> These are marketing strategies you can think about and plan now so that you can take steps to implement these strategies later this month and throughout October so you 're prepared for holiday shoppers . <h> 1 .

You 'll also want to let followers know about sales , or run promotions / giveaways solely for your followers ( i.e. , share a coupon code on Pinterest or Twitter ) . <p> Email Lists : Your email lists are incredibly valuable , so you 'll want to have some campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps discounts for your email list .

@@98138134 @2338134/ <p> This series pits plugins and services against one another in head-to-head comparisons . <p> Weve written about several different WordPress eCommerce plugins there are a lot of choices available . What 's best for your store will depend on what you 're selling , as well as the management capabilities or extensions to core functionality you 'll need . <p> However , if you 're selling only ( or mostly ) digital products , many eCommerce plugins may be overkill for what you 're trying to do . You wo n't need complex shipping options or the ability to create fairly complex products . You may not even need tax capabilities ( depending on the laws where you 're selling ) . <p> If this is the case , software that specializes in selling digital files may be a great fit for you . Well compare two choices that will integrate with your WordPress site to provide all of the functionality you need to sell digital products : Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Overview <p> The biggest difference between Easy Digital Downloads and Gumroad is that Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your websites servers , while Gumroad is a hosted solution . This means that your shop is hosted by Gumroad , and you simply integrate with your website by embedding links or descriptions for your products . <p> There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these shop implementations . While you do n't  have to worry about payment security with a hosted solution , you lose the flexibility and extensibility that comes with downloadable software ( meaning you can modify or add onto it as needed ) . There are other benefits and tradeoffs that well cover as we go , which should make it easier to decide which is right for your shop . <p> Weve written about Easy Digital Downloads ( most recently when version 2.1 was released ) , but we have n't written about Gumroad , so well provide a comparison of each part of the selling process . <h> EDD vs Gumroad : Setup &amp; Integration <p> Let 's start with Gumroad setup and integration with your WordPress site . You can sign up for Gumroad for free and give it a test drive to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sell with Gumroad for each purchase on your site , you 'll be charged 5% of the purchase price , along with 25 per transaction . There are no other fees or costs associated with a Gumroad store , such as monthly membership fees or refund fees . <p> Once you 've registered for a Gumroad account , you 'll then want to configure all available settings for your shop . I was able to go through all settings within a few minutes to include my basic store , payout , and tax information . <p> These steps will create a Gumroad storefront for you . However , you 'll still need to integrate this within your WordPress site . You could do so using the " overlay " codes provided by Gumroad , but I prefer to use the free Gumroad plugin , which let 's you create product buttons or embed products directly on your WordPress site via shortcode . <p> Now let 's talk about Easy Digital Downloads setup . EDD is a free WordPress plugin ( with paid add-ons ) , and you can set it up by installing the Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done within WordPress . <p> Install EDD <p> If you go to Downloads &gt; Settings , you 'll be able to set up all store options , such as location , download limits or expiration , payment gateways , and store emails . Nothing else is needed to integrate EDD with your site since its running on your servers within your site . <p> Setup Verdict : Both are easy to setup , though you 'll have to take the extra step to integrate Gumroad with your site . However , you do n't  have to worry about payment gateway setup or other options with Gumroad . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Theming <p> When you 've set up either Easy Digital Downloads or Gumroad , you 'll want to know how they look in your site . The good news is that both of these play well with almost any WordPress theme , so you 're in luck . <p> Gumroad will work by inserting products into a post , page , etc via shortcode . You an either embed products in your site ( using the " embed " method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your product details in a lightbox ( using the " overlay " method ) . <p> Shortcode attributes <p> Since the product will be embedded or overlayed based on what you 've created in Gumroad , you can control the products cover image , but not much else . When you add an embedded product , the full product details are displayed . When you add an overlay type , a button will be displayed that either opens the product details in a lightbox ( looks like just the embed ) , or can be used as a " buy now " button to send customers directly to checkout . <p> Embedded Product <p> Overlay Product <p> The embedded products will respect the container size so that your product details are responsive . For example , you could create columns for a grid layout of products , and the embedded product will respond to the appropriate size . <p> Easy Digital Downloads is also very easy to theme , can flexible in terms of product display . Product pages are automatically created when you add a product to your catalog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and featured images ( if you have one ) . <p> EDD Product Page <p> You can link to these product pages , create " buy now " buttons for a product via shortcode , or display a catalog of products or product categories via shortcode : <p> Theming verdict : No difficulty in making either look good for your site , but EDD is more flexible in terms of product display and can automatically create a catalog of all products , while Gumroad will require each product to be inserted manually . <h> EDD vs Gumroad : Customer Experience <p> As the way your catalog is set up is entirely up to you , the way customers browse your products will be flexible . You can sell products via posts or pages if you want to create " buy now " buttons , or create a product catalog for your customers to browse . <p> Using Gumroad , customers will checkout on-page via the embed or overlay methods , as the payment form will pop up once theyve made their selection : <p> Gumroad Payment Form <p> Easy Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can opt to send customers right to checkout if they want to purchase a product , or allow them to use a cart and checkout with multiple products at once . <p> Customers can access purchase information with each platform . Using EDD , customers can log in to view their purchase history : <p> EDD Purchase History <p> Gumroad will also display purchases or files to customers in their library , or show all available downloads after completing an order : <p> Gumroad Product info <p> Experience Verdict : Toss up this is more up to you than either platform . The Gumroad checkout is more seamless out of the box , but there 's no cart system if customers want to purchase multiple products . <h> EDD vs Gumroad : Product Management <p> Adding products with both Easy Digital Downloads and Gumroad are simple . Adding a product with EDD is just like adding a post or page in WordPress you can create them directly from your site and add data such as category , tag , price , images , and download limits . <p> Creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can edit it in the same way as you edit posts or pages by making your changes and clicking " Update " . You 'll also see your entire product list under the " Downloads " menu and bulk update some product data , such as price or category . <p> Creating products with Gumroad is also fairly simple , but theyll be created within your Gumroad account rather than within WordPress . Products must be priced between $0.99 and $1,000 ( there are further instructions available ) . You can also allow buyers can pay what they want and provide a suggested price . <p> Youll first select what kind of product you 'd like to sell a simple product , subscription , or pre-order . <p> Gumroad New products <p> You 'll then upload a cover photo and add product details , such as a name , description , and pricing . You can also use audio or video for cover images , and can even link to a YouTube , SoundCloud , or Vimeo URL to embed a player . <p> Gumroad Creating products <p> You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , or limit which countries the product can be purchased from and how many copies can be purchased . <p> Gumroad Creating product options <p> Once you 've created your product , you 'll have to then manually add it to your site where desired , as your product catalog is n't built automatically . <p> Editing products is possible with each platform as well . Once you 've created a product , you can access it from your product list and make changes as needed . <p> Product management verdict : This depends on your preference . Adding products with each is simple , but you can manage products within WordPress while using EDD . This let 's you add or change products as you blog or edit your site , or insert product links into posts easily . Gumroad also offers an easy product creation interface that does n't  require logging into your site . However , you 'll have to add products to your site manually anyway if you want them to show up there . <h> EDD vs Gumroad : Order Management <p> Order management is also something to consider when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each platform ; Gumroad customers will view purchases from their library , while Easy Digital Downloads customers can view them from a customer account created on your website . Each will also send purchase receipts via email with all purchase and download details . <p> Order management for shop admins will vary with each of these . Easy Digital Downloads will allow you to view all purchases and order information directly from WordPress under Downloads &gt; Payments . You can view each purchase , purchasing details , and edit order details as needed . You can also filter orders by time ranges or search them as needed . <p> EDD Payments <p> Gumroad does n't  necessarily have an " orders " view . Instead , you 'll see analytics on purchases for a given time period , or can view customer purchases and click on a purchase to manage it ( i.e. , issue a refund or cancellation ) . There 's no orders system with order numbers , etc . <p> Order management verdict : This depends on your needs . EDD has a true order management system , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Gumroad will also track purchases for customers and products , just in a different way . <h> EDD vs Gumroad : Customer Management <p> You can access customer lists and purchases with both Gumroad and Easy Digital Downloads . With EDD , you can view all orders for a customer by clicking their name , or view all customers from the " Reports " section . <p> EDD Customers <p> You can view customers from the " Customers " list in Gumroad , and click on the customer to see relevant details . You can also filter customers by who has purchased a product , or import / export customers . <p> Gumroad Customers <p> Gumroad does have a couple of really cool customer management features available . First , you can send a message to buyers that have bought a certain product ( or any product ) right from the " Customers " view . This is really useful to email about updates or new , related products . You can also message customers that paid more than a certain price to provide rewards discount codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy Digital Downloads , you 'll have to keep an email list with something like MailChimp and segment your customers appropriately . <p> Customer management verdict : Gumroad beats EDD for me in this area . I really love being able to easily contact customers right from the dashboard , and especially love the ability to send emails based on which product was purchased . You can also import and export customer lists , as well as filter by what was purchased . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Payments <p> Payment processing is very different for each of these platforms . Using Easy Digital Downloads , you can process payments via PayPal , or use your own payment processor . We 've got a list of some of the top payment gateway add-ons for Easy Digital downloads . Each payment gateway costs about $49 for the integration plugin along with the payment gateway fees you 're assessed as a merchant . However , you have flexibility in determining how you want to process payments , and can even offer several payment methods . <p> Gumroad does n't  offer the same flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . As such , your store can only accept credit cards no PayPal or other payment methods . Youll be paid every other Friday via PayPal from Gumroad for all transactions in your store . They make money by acting as a payment processing middle-man for your store . <p> You should also be aware that this may result in chargebacks , as customers will be billed from Gumroad and not you . You 'll want to make sure that you 've specified that they should expect charges from Gumroad rather than your shop . <p> You can accept subscription payments with Gumroad as well , and payments can recur each month , 3 months , 6 months , or year . <p> Creating a subscription <p> Gumroad also offers the ability to sell pre-orders , which is n't available with EDD . <p> Each offers the ability to create discounts for your shop . Gumroad allows you to create an offer on a per-product basis , while EDD has more flexible coupon rules since customers can purchase multiple products at a time . <p> EDD 2.0 Discounts <p> Payments verdict : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and running , you cant change anything about accepting payments and cant offer multiple payment methods . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Extending <p> You should also consider whether you 'll ever need more functionality beyond the core platform . This is where you 'll incur expenses with Easy Digital Downloads ( aside from payment processing fees ) . While there are some free add-ons for Easy Digital Downloads , you 'll probably need at least a couple of paid add-ons to complete store setup . <p> For example , you may want something like product review , which are n't  possible with Gumroad , but can be added to EDD for $32 . <p> Easy Digital Downloads is also extendable with custom code and plugins . Since the software is downloaded and run on your servers , you can modify or add onto it as needed . You can even make your own plugins or have them developed to add functionality to your shop . <p> Gumroad offers limited capability to extend the platform , and most of your ability to do so would be through a third-party service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are basically triggers for other systems . For example , you can set up a zap to send a text message via Twilio when an order is placed via Gumroad . <p> Extending verdict : Easy Digital Downloads takes the cake here . While Gumroad has a lot of awesome features built-in , such as customer-defined pricing and PDF stamping , you can purchase tons of add-ons for Easy Digital Downloads and can hire a developer to customize it as needed . ( For example , you can purchase add-ons to get customer pricing and PDF stamping , but you can also change the software as needed . ) <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Reporting <p> Both platforms will include reporting and sales analytics for your store . Using Gumroad , you 'll be able to view sales analytics by date range and product purchased ( including all products or only specific products ) . <p> Gumroad Sales analytics <p> You 'll also have data on conversion rates , and can even drill these down by referrer to see where your highest conversions are coming from . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROI . <p> Gumroad Referrer analytics <p> Easy Digital Downloads has built-in reporting as well . You can view reports for sales , products ( monthly average and total sales ) , payment methods , customers , and taxes . <p> EDD Sales Reporting <p> While you do n't  have the detailed referrer and conversion rate analytics that you do with Gumroad , you 're able to drill-down to product categories to view sales data . <p> Reporting verdict : Gumroad takes the cake here for both the ability to view conversion data right within the dashboard , as well as easy integration with Google Analytics for more data . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Support <p> Both Gumroad and Easy Digital Downloads include documentation and great support , so there 's no real need for comparison here . <h> Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad : Conclusions <p> Choosing Easy Digital Downloads vs Gumroad will depend on what you sell and how you plan to sell it . You may also want to take a look at pricing structure depending on the volume of your sales , but I 'd probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store . <p> EDD is a free plugin that offers paid add-ons and paid priority support , while Gumroad will charge you on a per-transaction basis . The upside to this pricing is that you 'll only have to pay for your shop when you make money from product purchases . However , as you sell higher volumes of products , you 'll end up paying more for something like Gumroad than you would for Easy Digital Downloads add-ons . <p> For example , let 's say you sell a product at $5 , and you sell 1000 of this product in a year . You 'll net $4500 , which means that Gumroad has cost $500 in that year . Depending on what Easy Digital Downloads add-ons you use ( if any ) , your costs could range from $0 to hundreds of dollars for the same sales . <p> However , as I said previously , what and how you sell should have more of an impact on your decision . Easy Digital Downloads is awesome if you 'd like to use the built-in WordPress structure and manage your shop from within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts that are integrated with your site and blog , and everything will be kept on-site for seamless transitions between your community , catalog , and checkout . <p> Easy Digital Downloads is also great for shops that will be selling products in a cart system . As Gumroad only allows purchasing products individually , this is a huge benefit to using Easy Digital Downloads . Customers can add all items to the cart , then checkout when they 're ready to purchase all items . <p> Gumroad is better if you 'll be selling a limited number of products , or if you 'll be selling via other channels . You can integrate a Gumroad store with Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , and SoundCloud , so it makes sense for shops that want to sell in multiple locations . Its also handy for subscriptions and Pre-orders . However , you 'll have to set up your entire product catalog on your WordPress site , and constantly manage your site and store in different places . <p> In a nutshell , you should use Gumroad if analytics and customer management are most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products on your website , products will be purchased individually without a cart system , and you 're okay with no control over payment processing . You 'll also get a seamless , on-page checkout . Easy Digital Downloads is a better fit if you want a built-in product catalog , order management systems , you want a cart system to customers can purchase multiple items at once , and you want to offer other payment options ( or just want more control over this yourself ) . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hi Beka , Great review . I like how you thoroughly went through each of the solutions facet by facet . I just wanted to make a couple observations : <p> Gumroads fees are 5% + .25 per transaction . But approximately 3% of that would have gone to the payment processor anyway ( credit card / paypal ) , so the cost in your example is actually closer to $350 . EDD addons average around $50 each and are renewable annually , with most people needing a few to get their shop up and running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the hours spent configuring a WordPress ecommerce store should also be factored in as a cost . The immediacy of the instant popup checkout for Gumroad is great for landing pages . Especially if you do n't  have multiple products , getting rid of the cart will help conversions . <p> One important factor you did not address : EU VAT collection , payment , reporting and records keeping . Customers in EU countries are required to pay VAT ( sales tax ) on all digital downloads . As a small business owner it would be a nightmare to handle all of this on my own . Gumroad handles all of that for me . Huge time saver , and therefore priceless . <p> The fact that you cant disable the long billing fields once your taxes are active is the reason I 've moved to Gumroad . Pippin should really consider the flexibility of EDDs checkout page because it is very user enemy right now and the checkout process is the essential key to any store . Gumroad wins . <p> Hey Laurent , I think the Checkout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital shops do n't  need to enable taxes , though ( at least in the US ) , I 'm pretty sure many of the billing fields are required to record for tax purposes . <p> Hey Angel , this would be possible , but youd run into some practical issues while implementing it : <p> The purchase takes place on Gumroad , so its not tied to a WordPress user account . As such , a customer without a WP account could make purchases , and thus you have no account to tie a role to . <p> Since Gumroads purchasing is taking place externally , there 's no way to prompt or require accounts while the purchase is happening . <p> You could have your site notified of a purchase , as Gumroad has webhooks available for developers . However , using this webhook would require custom code for your site to grab this webhook , check the email address of the purchaser , then update the users role on your site . Also , you may run into point #1 where there 's no account to update . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting purchase pages to only logged-in users , its definitely not the way I 'd recommend doing this if you can avoid it since it requires customization to connect your site that tightly to Gumroad. 
@@98138135 @2338135/ <h> More Membership options : WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> There are lots of options out there to create a WordPress membership site , and the right one will depend on your needs for content restriction , payment gateways , order management , and more . <p> WooCommerce presents a pretty popular choice because of the ability to sell more than just memberships , the excellent billing options provided by WooCommerce Subscriptions , the number of payment gateways available , and the oodles of extensions you can use . <h> WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction : Overview <p> WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction is a new extension from Curtis McHale , who focuses on eCommerce and membership site development . A single-site license for the plugin is $39.99 , and gets you access to support and updates with a 30-day money-back guarantee . <p> Easy Content Restriction adds the ability to restrict content to customers who have purchased a particular product from your shop . Shop owners can restrict posts , pages , and bbPress forums , but support can be added for simple custom post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plugin supports variations and grouped products , so you can restrict content to customers who have purchased a particular product or variant of a product . Simple and variable subscriptions are also supported . <p> The plugin documentation also includes lots of tips and code snippets for using filters to add restriction options to custom post types , or to customize restriction messages . This can be handy if you 're using portfolio pages or other CPTs as we mentioned above , or want to change restriction message based on the product purchase required to gain membership access . <h> WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction : Usage <p> Using the plugin is very simple , as there are no settings to configure . Once the plugin has been installed and activated , you can enter your license for automatic updates , then begin to restrict content immediately . <p> For any posts , pages , or bbPress forums , you 'll now have a meta box added while creating or editing pages/posts/etc from the WordPress admin . This meta box will allow you to set a restriction based on which product has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forums <p> You can also optionally create a custom restriction message . This will be displayed to customers who do n't  have access to your content , so you can add in excerpts and links to products to purchase to gain access . <p> Custom Restriction Messages <p> You can choose to leave the custom restriction message blank , and a default message will be used instead that links to the product needed to gain access to the content . <p> Restriction messages <p> That 's all there is to setup ! Customers will be given access to restricted content for any paid order that includes the required product ( order statuses of " processing " or " complete " ) . <p> You can use the documentation to create custom restriction messages or add restriction capabilities to other custom post types if desired . While this wo n't work for complex CPTs like products ( only the description will be restricted ) , you can use this for other custom post types that are primarily content-based . <h> WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction : Pros &amp; Cons <p> So what are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are a few major points and a list for comparison . <p> First , this is far more suitable for sites that like to have topic-based memberships rather than tiered memberships . For example , if you want to allow both gold and silver members to have access to a particular post , page or forum , this wo n't work for you . You can only enable restriction per page , post , or forum based on one product purchase at the moment . <p> If you 're selling access based on topic , then this probably wont be an issue for you , but be aware of this while researching . However , it will be far easier to use than many other plugins if you can work within this restriction . <p> Access will also be retroactive ; if customers have purchased the product that is tied to access in the past , theyll be able to access any restricted content associated with that purchase . <p> Ca n't manually assign access capabilities to customers without a purchase <p> No way to easily access member list / filter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can search for products that have been purchased from the Orders screen , but there 's no way to view everyone that has access to restricted content . <p> The biggest pro for me is the ability to easily and quickly restrict content based on product purchases , which works great for sites that want to offer particular content to purchasers of one product . The biggest con for me was the lack of bulk restriction , which will make setup time-intensive if you have several forums , posts , and pages to restrict to members . <h> WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction : Conclusions <p> Overall , WooCommerce Easy Content Restriction is a young plugin , but offers a very simple solution for restricting site content easily based on WooCommerce purchases . Ill be excited to see some of the future features added to the plugin . <p> Easy Content Restriction is best suited for sites that do n't  have a large amount of content to restrict and can work with restricting each post to only one " level " ( product purchase ) . If this works for your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restriction based on WooCommerce purchases . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> thanks for the nice article .

@@98138136 @2338136/ <h> Sell with WP Interviews : Matt Medeiros on Running a WordPress Podcast and Agency <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this interview , I talk to Matt Medeiros from the Matt Report podcast , his agency Slocum Studio , and products at Slocum Themes . His podcast focuses on WordPress news , interviews , and advice for freelancers , businesses , and agencies . The agency provides design and development services , and his products include premium WordPress themes and plugins . <p> Here is a summary of the interview with Matt Medeiros . <h> Can you elaborate on your projects a bit ? <p> Ive been doing the agency stuff for nearly 10 years now . The concept started in 2007 when I was working as a project manager for an ISP . At the time , my father was a professional photographer and had sold our family business , which was in cars that we had had for roughly 40 years . <p> So my fathers first paid gig was a high-end jewellery shop who also needed a new website . The ISP that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ISP so I was familiar with set up of sites . We looked at Drupal and quickly shifted to WordPress as I got acclimated to WordPress . So I did that on the side , and that little nugget became Slocum Studio . <p> Back when I was at the ISP ingrained in Drupal , I , with a co-partner , developed one of the first Drupal-focused themes . That was the genesis of me getting into digital products . I had done it for Drupal so I thought I should try it for WordPress , which is what were doing with Slocum Themes . <p> As for Matt Report , I saw how Jake Goldman who runs 10up growing his agency at an exponential rate . I had worked on some projects with him , including a TechCrunch redesign , and I saw that he had such strong ties in the community . To try to match his cadence , I started the Matt Report . I did n't  think it was going to be a podcast at the time . I was planning on just doing blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I used to listen to Mixergy at the time and so I thought , why do n't  I try to become the Andrew Warner of the WordPress world . So that was the idea to get my name out there and build better ties with the community . <h> How did the name Slocum come about ? <p> Were located on the south coast region of Massachusetts and there 's the Slocum River near our agency . I grew up on the river as we have a house on it . My father grew up there , and so did his father . Summertime growing up involved a lot of activities on the river like hunting and fishing . <p> So it was important for us to come up with a brand name that 's grounded and had roots in the area , and not something generic like " DigiShop " or " eWordpress " or something . We wanted something rooted in the community . <h> How do you manage competing interests between products and services ? <p> Were a team of 6 people at the studio now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services . Our lead developer takes care of running development related things , and I can focus on business retention and development . <p> One thing that does happen is that during some parts of the year client work takes precedence over our products and vice versa . As an example , around holidays the agency work dips down , and around the new year it picks back up when everyone has plans for their websites . <p> There 's always that fees-to-famine aspect of agency life where some months are great but others are terrible . One good thing about agency life is that you can sell the same project for $500 to one person but for $5,000 to the next person . <p> However , we are conscious of the fact that you need multiple streams of revenue to make sure you can weather downturns in certain parts of the business , if that happens . <h> What podcasts do you listen to ? <p> Hands down my favorite podcast is Mitch Joel from Six Pixels of Separation . Still some Mixergy , Tim Ferriss , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Any advice for developers or WordPress agency owners ? <p> Find the skill-set you 're really going to excel at . Do n't  just take things for the money . As you excel up the heightened revenue , theyll pay more money , but their expectation also changes on the quality of service , integrations , from the technical side , etc . So be ready for that before you get in over your head . <p> For small agencies , if the customer is trying to price you out and has unrealistic expectations of what theyll get from a low price , take that opportunity to do some consulting with the business . <h> What 's your advice for business owners on WordPress ? <p> There are a lot of customers who are afraid of setting up an eCommerce store because they 're afraid of all the leg work required in setting things up . So to them , my advice is to trust the platform a little , hire a professional , and be courteous of a professionals services . <p> If you know you 're going to do well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're going to make $1,000 by using a $30 plugin , then its okay to use it . If you have costs in the real world , why would you not have costs online . <h> What 's your advice for WordPress users ? <p> Start out possibly on WordPress.com as its safer and you can get the basic stuff done very well . Even if the first iteration exactly how you 're expecting , get something up and improve upon it . <h> What are you excited about with the future of WordPress ? <p> Im excited in the change of direction in the software from external sources . Its hard to continue the same growth WordPress has had in its fragmented state . So the only way to improve the experience is to tighten the experience . <h> What are some of your short- and long-term goals ? <p> For the business , were trying to focus on finding a way to service the small businesses around the area . A way that 's more all-encompassing whether its local workshops , presentations , or events . Were trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get direct results from . <p> For the product side , rebranding our Conductor plugin and the messaging around it which were aiming to launch by the end of this month . <p> And for the podcast , trying to turn that into more of a business by actively pursuing sponsorship for the show . I 'm also trying to find more creative ways of delivering content better ways like mini-series or something .

Ive been creating attributes for each of my products , then linking them to make variations . I just want to know if there 's a way to speed this up so I can automatically pull in sizes , etc . <p> Yep , you can absolutely do this ! This will make it really fast to add them to products , then you can just click " Link Variations " to create your variations from this . <h> Setting up Attributes <p> If you go to Products &gt; Attributes , you 'll be able to add default attribute sets . <p> Enter a Name for your attribute , which will be displayed on the product page .

This will allow you to simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you select " Text " , this will just create a placeholder attribute and you 'll have to enter all of the values for your attribute on the product page . For example , I do use this occasionally for color . I use a " Text " type , then on the product page , I enter the applicable colors ( like Blue Red Green , etc ) . <p> Finally , set your default ordering . I usually leave this as " Custom " so I can drag and drop attributes into the order that I choose , but you can also sort by name or term I 'd . <p> Once you 've added the attribute , you may want to add some terms ( if you 're using a " Select " type ) so that these will be available on the product page . You can do so by clicking the cog icon for the term : <p> When you click this , you 'll be able to add your terms for the attribute . For example , if your attribute is " Size " , your terms are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 've added your terms , drag-and-drop them if you 're using custom ordering , and you 're done ! You can add more attributes if you 'd like , but now these will be available on the product page . <h> Using your Attributes <p> Now that your attributes are set up , you 'll be able to access them when creating or editing products . They 're under " Product Data &gt; Attributes " : <p> You can now easily add these attribute sets to products . If you add a default attribute set , you 'll be able to enter all of the terms that apply to this product . If you 've created a " Select " type , you can add all terms , or add them as needed : <p> If you 've created a " Text " type , you 'll need to enter the applicable terms . <p> Select or add any attribute terms that apply and that they should be used for your variations . You can repeat this with any default attribute set , then when your attributes are added , link these to easily create your variations ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to globally change the default sort order of product attributes . Handy if you already have hundreds of the same kinds of products and want to change the order globally instead of manually reordering each one . <p> This is an interesting approach . Unfortunately having a product template only helps with future products , but not with current ones . Let 's say I have a cloth store with 1000+ products and I want to add a new attribute " waterproof " to all of them or that I found out that my customers are more likely to buy the product if the size is listed prior to color . Being able to create attribute sets ( or product types ) would help , but seems like this feature is not currently available in WooCommerce . Magento , on the other hand , has it . <p> I have one problem.How to use text type attributes , I want to user enter data . I created text type attributes , But when I used these attributes on product page it shows select-box.I did not get text-field . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use something like Product Add-ons attributes wont allow customers to enter anything from the frontend . If you want to enter a custom attribute yourself , you can add a custom attribute instead of selecting a default one . <p> Hi . I have question about the size attribute . Let 's say I have a clothing store that sells shoes , t-shirts and jeans . Shoe sizes range from 5 12 , t-shirt sizes range from small to X-large while jean sizes range from 30 40 . The problem I am having is that when I put a search by size filter say on Shoes category , the drop-down is showing all the other size values that are not applicable to shoes , for example small , medium , large , 30 , 39 , etc from the t-shirts and jeans categories . How do i solve this and make my shoe size filter just show shoes size values only ? <p> Hey Reuben , I 'd recommend setting up each type of size as a different default attribute then its sounds like you 've got all sizes in one default attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nav filter . So there would need to be a default " shirt size " attribute , " shoe size " , etc.

You can opt to ask for an up-front fee for a given membership length , which ensures that you do n't  need to provide a certain amount of value consistently each month ( it could be more sporadic ) , but this provides a large barrier to the customer making a purchasing decision , as the " pain " of purchasing is immediate . <p> If you opt to spread payments out over each month and use a recurring billing model for your membership , while this may be an easier hurdle to overcome for the initial purchase , you must also ensure members get very consistent value from the membership during each billing period , since they 're seeing the purchase " pain " repeatedly at each billing cycle . <p> One of the strategies some sites take to blend these options is the availability of payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membership , or spread cost out over a few payments ( typically at a slight premium for splitting payments ) . <p> Chris Lema has a great overview as to why payment plans are useful for membership sites , as they let you capture those members who may not want to make a large purchase up front , but are comfortable with a small recurring total for a few months instead . <p> As a membership site owner , this helps you mitigate the need to provide value consistently and in a distributed way over the lifetime of the membership , while also letting you configure a set access period for the membership lifetime . <h> WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans Overview <p> Installment plan or payment plan support is a tough problem for membership sites to solve , as separating access for the membership from the recurring billing is difficult . The plugin needs to pay attention to billing while its happening to ensure payment failures or cancellations are accounted for , but stop paying attention after payments are completed . <p> To automatically charge customers on the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billing records and setting up recurring billing on a schedule using the saved card . This will handle the financial part of our membership with a payment plan . <p> To handle membership access to your restricted content or members-only perks , well use WooCommerce Memberships this controls content access , but also listens to the billing record to ensure all payments complete successfully . If they do not , memberships will be paused or ended to ensure that your members complete all payments . You must be using Memberships version 1.7 or newer , as this version added the ability to set membership length independent from the subscription length . <p> There are two major ways we can set up a membership with a payment plan with Subscriptions as well : Subscriptions and the free Subscribe All the Things plugin , or Subscriptions alone with variations or a grouped product . <p> Subscriptions + Subscribe All the Things : This combination offers you a slightly improved product page display and purchasing experience . It also works with any version of WooCommerce Memberships ( though best with version 1.7+ ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SATT product as a " subscription " , so it wo n't listen for changes in the billing record in case it needs to stop membership access ( for example , in the event of a cancellation ) . <p> Subscriptions with variations / groups : This combination may take some tweaking to get the pricing options displayed the way you 'd like , and it requires Memberships 1.7+ . However , this is the more advanced and automated route to go , as when a real subscription-type product is used , Memberships will listen to the billing record in case it needs to stop a membership , even if the membership length is n't tied to the subscription length . <p> Well explain these pros and cons in a bit more detail below , along with what set up should look like for each option . <h> WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans : Using Subscribe All The Things <p> Weve written about the Subscribe All The Things plugin before , as its a great way to add recurring purchase options to regular products in your store . Since you can add these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an installment plan or split payment set up for your memberships as you can offer several payment options . <p> However , because SATT uses a regular product , this may influence the memberships purchased , so some manual management would be required , which well discuss shortly . <p> First , to set up your payment plan , you should create your membership product as a simple product . For the product price , enter the cost of your " up front " payment for your membership . <p> Up-front price <p> Now under the " Subscriptions " tab added by SATT , you can configure some recurring options as well . Ill override the product price and charge a bit more for this membership if a customer wants to distribute payments over a 3-month or 6-month period . <p> Split payment options <p> Save that product ! Now the final step : we need to tie this to a membership so purchasing our membership product grants membership access . <p> Membership Plan <p> However , here 's the kicker : see how there are no " subscription length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a subscription , so it will treat it just like a regular purchase ( more on that shortly ) rather than as a subscription-type product . <p> While this is going to be a negative to this approach , the frontend result is pretty nice . Youll be able to show the one-time payment price in the catalog / immediately for the product , while also offering recurring payment options . <p> Default display <p> I 'm not a huge fan of the " None " label for the up-front purchase , so fortunately there is an easy way to filter this label be sure you know how to add custom code to your site if you wanted to adjust it : <p> This will show the price + an updated label for the up-front purchase option instead . <p> Modified display <p> Now customers can purchase any of these membership options , and since the membership plan has been tied to this product , purchasing any option will grant membership access for the 1-year period . <p> The Subscription will have an end date that correlates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ) : <p> Subscription Info <p> While the membership record will ignore the end date here and have its own length set : <p> Membership info <p> However , notice that there 's no " Next Bill " date set . This is important this means that Memberships does n't  know the purchase was for a subscription ( as all it saw was a " regular " product ) . <p> This also means that a customer could cancel the subscription , but the membership does n't  know this has occurred , so access continues ( this is n't the case with a " real " subscription product ) . This is the major downside to this approach . <p> If you like the way SATT works and displays purchase options , you can definitely use it , but I 'd recommend manually updating memberships as they come in to link them to the subscription records that are generated ( possible with Memberships 1.7+ ) . This may or may not be feasible depending on how many sign ups you get per day . <p> If the membership is linked to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that record for billing updates in case of cancellation . <p> If you want a fully automated system , you can use true subscription-type products for your installment plan instead . <h> WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans : Subscription-Type Products <p> There are a couple ways we can set up subscription-type products with Memberships to create installment plans . In either case , the benefit to using a subscription-type product is that Memberships will recognize it as a subscription , then listen to billing without any manual adjustments needed . <p> While the membership length will still be set independently from the subscription , this ensures that all payments have been processed by the subscription , and if any fail or are cancelled , Memberships will halt access . <h> WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans : Subscription Variations <p> Let 's first start with talking about Subscriptions variations . This can definitely achieve an installment plan set up , though you 'll need to pay attention to billing periods and subscription length . <p> First , you need to create a variable subscription product , then add a variation for each payment option you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll adjust the pricing for these options along with the " Subscription Length " how many times the payment runs , ie for 3 months . <p> Variation set up 2 <p> This will give you a dropdown selector on the product page that very simply let 's your customers choose which plan theyd like . <p> Frontend Display <p> This is the part to be aware of : the way the " up front " payment method will be shown . <p> You 'll want one payment over time , so you could set this to $329 per month for one month , or $329 per year for one year I like to try to make the " Subscription length " reflect how long the membership is for so customers are n't  confused thinking their access time wont match up with the billing period . <p> " Up front " purchase display <p> Then for the membership part ! All you need to do is add your subscriptions parent product to the membership , and you 'll see the " access length " options adjust automatically , as they recognize this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the subscription length , so even if the subscription ends right away , or after 3 months , the membership will continue until the correct end date . <p> Plan Settings <p> The best part about this kind of set up is , since Memberships " recognizes " this as a subscription-type product , it will listen to the billing record until the subscription ends . Should the subscription ever be put on hold or cancelled , the membership will do so as well since it indicates all payments have not yet been completed . <p> You can see that now the " next billing date " is recognized as a result Memberships knows to listen for billing changes . <p> Membership info <p> Once the subscription ends and all payments have been processed , Memberships will then unlink the membership from the subscription record and stop listening for updates so that the membership will run until its end date . This ensures that the membership length is controlled by you exclusively , but if for some reason all payments are not completed in the split payments / payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memberships Payment Plans : Grouped Product <p> You could achieve a similar set up with a grouped product as well . I prefer this set up since I like the way it shows billing options , but either this or a variable product set up will work the same way . You 'll just need to adjust how you configure the membership plan . <p> First , you 'd set up the " parent " / grouped product . This has no data really , its just the product page well use to " hold " the products in the group . <p> Next , you 'd set up 3 products : one for each payment plan option ( so this brings the total products needed to 4 ) . We could use a simple product for the one-time payment , then 2 simple subscriptions for the payment plans . We could hide these from the catalog , and add them to the grouped product . <p> This will show all payment options on the grouped product page : <p> Grouped Product Display <p> Since the membership billing is controlled by 3 different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the membership plan to grant access : <p> Plan set up <p> You may see both regular product and subscription access options if you use both product types , so youd want to configure both for your membership length . <p> This will work the same way as a variable subscription : Memberships will listen to the billing record until payments complete for the subscription purchases , but once payments are done , its the only thing in charge of when the membership ends . <h> WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans : Taking it Further <p> Any of of these set ups : Subscriptions + Subscribe All the Things , Subscriptions variations , or Subscriptions in a grouped product , will allow you to create WooCommerce Memberships payment plans for your members , separating the billing periods from the access period . <p> If you work with a developer and wanted to take this further , you could consider something like our " Subscribe and Save " tutorial , which would let you append subscription options to a simple product for a different pricing display . <p> While the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a decent volume of sign ups , I would recommend sticking with subscription-type products rather than using " Subscribe All The Things " . <h> Creating WooCommerce Memberships Payment Plans <p> The ability independently control billing and access periods let 's you create any sort of billing set up while limiting membership access or extending it past the billing period . You can sell memberships with a one-time price or implement split payments to provide payment plan options over the course of several months . <p> Better yet , your memberships will listen to your billing records to ensure payments are completed in the payment plan , and if all payments are not processed either due to suspensions , failures , or cancellations , membership access will stop as well so that members do n't  have access they have n't fully paid for yet . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Dale discusses why he picked WordPress and WooCommerce to build his sites , and considerations around accessibility . <p> Below is a summary of the discussion . You can find the full transcript on this page . <h> What 's your background and how did you come to start these sites ? <p> Being blind since the age of 17 , I 've always wanted to help the disability community . I did a law degree at university in Tasmania , Australia , and practiced law for roughly six years as a partner in my own law firm . I was the second visually-impaired person at my university and the only blind lawyer practicing in Tasmania . At the end of the six-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I went into the tourism business . That 's where I started using the internet for marketing purposes . <p> Throughout that time , I was involved in disability advocacy and disability issues . About 12 months ago , we started planning out the roll out of different phases of My Disability Matters . <h> For the main three sites for My Disability Matters , can you talk about the timeline leading up to the . club launch in December ? <p> I had been using WordPress and WooCommerce for my wifes website since 2011 . I had feedback from the disability community that they wanted a disability friendly , owned , run , and managed website to spread and get news . We started with the " . com.au " domain but got a lot of global engagement on our Twitter account . <p> The team is currently my wife and myself . We did start building the blog articles and news on the . news site in the beginning of 2016 , then acquired the . com domain to make that the central hub for these sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How did you end up picking WordPress and WooCommerce ? <p> WordPress makes fairly accessible websites right out-of-the-box . The other big one is the number of plugins available to add functionality to the sites . <p> Putting the sites on Woo helps us run the membership fees , advertising campaigns , donation , and sponsorship components all on the same platform . We use a one-page checkout process to streamline the payments to create an easy seamless experience for our audience , while powering it with Woo on the backend . <h> What is one major thing lacking in WordPress or WooCommerce when it comes to accessibility ? <p> One problem with drag-and-drop themes or plugins weve used is that they do create a lot of drain on the servers once the site starts scaling up . So one thing I 'd like to see is some version of drag-and-drop editing and functionality built into the core . <p> The greatest difficulty using WordPress being a visually impaired person is the widget system . Its primarily a visual system for the placement of the widgets . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved from an accessibility standpoint , but that 's something I 'd love to see get better in that respect . <h> How did you get your first readers , community members , or contributors ? <p> We put a media kit up on the website and advertisers approached us for sponsorship opportunities . If you have a website for a very tight niche , then sponsors and advertisers are likely to be interested in you . <p> Weve been using Twitter primarily to attract readers . This effort has been a combination of using the right hashtags , and following up and engaging with followers . This can be made easier with automated systems like Sendible . <p> Other than Twitter , Facebook ads have also been quite lucrative for us to grow our member base . <h> What 's a WordPress or WooCommerce plugin you wish you had ? <p> There was a plugin up until two or three years ago for community moderation to allow automatic posting of all comments , but allow other site visitors and members to flag inappropriate comments for moderation by the administrator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of community moderation which would be great to have as sites get more active . <h> Before we get into some advice questions , what do you do when you 're not working on My Disability Matters ? <h> What is your advice for others who might be thinking of starting a membership site ? <p> One of the first things I would suggest is get a good quality host , preferably with managed WordPress hosting , like that provided by Pagely , to fix any issues that arise as you build your sites . This is especially helpful when you start using a lot of WordPress plugins for example , we had 140 plugins at one point . <p> Other than that , do n't  be afraid to make changes to your site if you think it will improve the experience for your audience . These can be minor or major changes like switching themes to changes the look and layout of your sites . <p> Lastly , use staging environments to test out the changes you 're making before pushing them to the live site . It helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What 's your advice for people doing development on WordPress , themes , plugins , or extensions ? <p> One personal request as a visually-impaired person and on behalf of other members in the disability community , is to avoid the use of CAPTCHAs on your sites . There are more accessible alternatives like CleanTalk that achieve the same result of reducing spam . <p> Those CAPTCHA forms block so many people from using your websites . I personally sometimes fill out a form but then have to wait for my wife to complete the visually-driven CAPTCHA before I can submit the form . Developers should be aware of that as it does ruin the accessibility of your site . <h> What are you planning to do to grow the social . club component ? <p> A major step is to engage influencers in the disability community people with successful blogs or disability services to work in cooperation with us to promote the club site to their members and site visitors . Another would be cross-marketing and cross-posting of articles . <p> Rest would be to encourage our current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term vision for My Disability Matters ? <p> We hope to create a far more tolerant and respectful online community regarding issues of disability . When we are successfully making money , we hope to give back to the disability community , hire disabled staff , and help disabled people start their own businesses . <h> Anything else you 'd like to share ? <p> The only other comment would be to encourage developers to not build their plugins or themes in a way that breaks caching . As our sites have scaled , we 've had issues with plugins breaking caching on the sites which add extra loads on the servers . 11394 @qwx871394

E.g. there may be a category for women , a category for men , or other logical product categories . Include a sidebar with an alternative way of categorizing your products . <p> Make sure that when customers have found your products , they are able to filter them in multiple ways .

Spend time customizing and designing your store , but do n't  forget to ask for opinions from users before you launch .

Make leaving reviews fun , and give customers the option to upvote other peoples comments ( plugins like WooCommerce Product Reviews Pro can add this ) . A social incentive is a great way to make leaving reviews more appealing . <p> Reviews are a great way to help people decide whether a product is going to be right for them . Try not to see divisive comments as purely negative " they are actually helping your customers buy the right products .

@@98138143 @2338143/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Every time a customer makes a purchase in your eCommerce store , they 're typically sent a few emails ( with most eCommerce plugins ) . These include order confirmations , new account information , order status updates , and more . These type of emails are called transactional emails because they result from an action the customer takes . This article details a few reasons why you should start using a transactional email service now . <h> Deliverability <p> WordPress has a built-in email system that WooCommerce and many other eCommerce plugins use to send these emails , but its not exactly reliable . Any number of reasons can cause the sent emails to end up lost or spammed . Normally this is n't a big problem for emails like comment notifications , but for an eCommerce site lost emails are a big problem . <p> Customers have come to expect immediate email confirmations for their orders and are likely to call or email if they do n't  receive one . Even worse , if a customer needs to resets their password before logging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset email , they may decide not to follow through with the purchase . Transactional Email services solve this problem and more by offloading the responsibility to deliver emails from WordPress . <p> Services setup multiple email servers all over the world and carefully tune them specifically for delivering email . They have relationships with major internet service providers ( like Comcast and AOL ) and email providers ( like Gmail and Yahoo ) to make sure that email sent from their servers is delivered promptly . <p> They also monitor the type of emails sent and block spammers so your emails are n't  mixed in with spam emails . When you 're hosting your site on a shared server ( along with many other sites ) , there could be a malicious site that is sending spam . Because the email providers will see the same IP address when receiving email from your site as they do from the malicious site , they 're likely to block or spam your emails as well . <p> Finally , transactional email services act as a buffer between your site and email providers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email service will queue the email and deliver it later when Yahoo is available , where as your WordPress site will simply not deliver the email . <h> Tracking &amp; Analytics <p> Have you ever had a customer contact you and say they never received their order confirmation email ? Or maybe a reset password email got lost somehow ? A transactional email service can help you track down these lost emails by showing each email sent and whether it was delivered or not . You can even view the content of the email with some services ! <p> Even better , the email service will insert a bit of code into your outgoing emails ( the customer does not see this code ) which will tell you whether the customer opened the email . You can also optionally enable click tracking which will show what links in the email the customer clicked . <p> One way you can use this feature is to improve your open rates ( the percentage of customers opening a given email ) . Let 's say you want to encourage customers to come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , so you add a " Review now ! " link in the order confirmation email . The standard subject line " Your Store Name Order Confirmation " may have a low open rate ( say 20% ) , but you could test a different subject line " Thanks for being awesome and ordering from Store Name " and see how it affected your open rates . More opens means more customers reading the email and likely coming back to review the product they purchased . This is a simple example and there 's a lot more that you can optimize about your emails when you have access to the right analytics . <h> Posted by Max Rice <p> Max Rice is a frequent Sell with WP contributor and cofounder of SkyVerge .

He s also contributed to various WordPress projects , such as WP eCommerce and bbPress . Pippin 's specialities includes remembering every single Easy Digital Downloads function off the top of his head and churning out great plugin development tutorials at PippinsPlugins.com . <h> Overview <p> Easy Digital Downloads is the only of the major e-commerce plugins that is built specifically to handle digital products , and digital products only . With its focus on digital goods , Easy Digital Downloads is also exceptionally well suited for membership sites that are selling access to digital content . <p> The core Easy Digital Downloads plugin , which is free and can be downloaded from WordPress.org , will handle the majority of the functionality needed for membership sites , including the product creation , the shopping cart , and the payment processing , but in order to utilize features such as recurring billing or protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To setup a full membership site , you will need the following extensions : <p> Out of the box , Easy Digital Downloads will allow you to process payments through PayPal Standard . If you wish to use something else , you will need to purchase an add-on payment gateway . Note : not all payment gateways support recurring payments . The payment gateways that currently support Recurring Payments are : <p> Assuming you are going to use Stripe or Paymill , your total cost for setting up a membership site with Easy Digital Downloads will be a little under $200 . If you are using PayPal Standard , your cost will be a little under $150 . <h> Creating Memberships <p> With Easy Digital Downloads , memberships can be created in two different ways : <p> One unique product per membership level ( great for topic-based memberships ) <p> One product for all membership levels with a price option for each level ( great for tiered memberships ) <p> To use separate products for each membership level , add a product by going to Downloads &gt; Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category , and tag options . When you get to the Pricing Options section , you will not enable Variable Prices and just enter a single price . You will also select your recurring options here : <p> For recurring products , there are several options : <p> Recurring : Yes or No . This simply sets whether the product should create recurring payment profiles for the customer when purchased . <p> Period : This determines the time period for the recurring payment profile . If you choose Monthly , for example , the customer will be automatically billed each month , starting from the date they sign up . <p> Times : This determines the total number of times the customer should be billed . Setting this to 0 means the customer will be billed indefinitely until cancelled . If you set it to 5 , for example , the customer will be billed 5 times and then automatically suspended . <p> Signup Fee : This is an optional signup fee that you can charge the customer . If , for example , you want the first month to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would set the main price to $20 and then the Signup Fee to $80 . You can also set this to a negative amount in order to discount the first payment period . <p> Once a customer has gone through the checkout and ( assuming they are paying with PayPal ) , they will see a screen like this : <p> If you wish to use a single product for memberships , you can enable Variable Prices and then setup the recurring options for each price separately : <p> If you are setting up a membership site where each subscription level gives the same level of access to content ( so only the price / period differs ) , it is recommended that you setup the memberships using variable prices . <h> Content Restriction <p> When Content Restriction is active , a drop down menu will be added to the Publish box of all posts , pages , and public custom post types that allows you to restrict the contents of the page to verified buyers of any EDD product . When Recurring Payments is active , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to view the content . This menu also allows you to restrict content to buyers of a specific price option for sites using Variable Prices . <p> If an active subscriber views a restricted page , they will see the content as normal . Non active subscribers will see a notice that they need to purchase the product / subscription level in order to gain access . <p> You can also restrict content using a short code provided by Content Restriction . This is useful for when you only want to restrict a portion of the content on a page . <p> The short code is used like this : eddrestrict id= " 34 " This content is restricted to buyers of the product with an I 'd of 34/eddrestrict <p> You can also provide multiple product IDs if you wish to allow buyers of any of the products access : eddrestrict id= " 34,56 " This content is restricted to buyers who have purchased product I 'd 34 or 56/eddrestrict <p> The short code also accepts a message that you can use to display a message to users that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message= " Please register an account in order to view this content " This content is restricted to buyers who have purchased product I 'd 34 or 56/eddrestrict <p> Editors note : Content restriction can also restrict bbPress forums to users who have purchased a specific product , which is great for those of you selling themes and software . Entire forums can be restricted , or you can restrict content based on topic . This can also be used for those of you selling tutorials or support services , as well as private membership forums . <h> Recurring Billing <p> As stated previously , subscription billing is handled by the Recurring Payments extension for EDD , which is $83 . Billing options are flexible , as customers can be charged based on a daily , weekly , monthly , or yearly cycle . You can determine the number of cycles for the subscription , or can create unlimited subscriptions ( until canceled ) . <p> Recurring payments supports sign-up fees as well as discounts . Customers can also have more than one subscription so that they can pay for posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Support <p> All Easy Digital Downloads extension purchases include full support directly from the EDD development team . If you have any questions that were not answered with this guide , you are more than welcome to open a ticket in the EDD support forums . <h> 18 Comments <p> Thanks Pippin ! Ive been thinking about EDD and memberships sites lately as I 've been planning one of my next projects . This answered a number of questions that I knew would come up as soon as I started putting my plans into action . Great timing ! <p> Thanks for this post , Pippin ! Ive been evaluating many **31;1362;TOOLONG solutions full-time for over 4 weeks , which has been mentally grueling ! After all Ive learned through this process , EDD/RCP has risen to the top with just a couple competitors , so I 'm getting close to finding the solution and this post helps greatly in making my final decision , so the timing is greatwhich I appreciate ! ( On a related note , I suggest including the info you 've described in this post back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfing elsewhere for it and finding it here " thereby leaving your site(s) , which couldve led me to a competitor instead ! ) <p> You stated above , " You ca n't create membership discounts with Recurring Payments or Content Restriction . However , you could achieve this by using EDD along with Restrict Content Pro and EDD Restrict Content Pro Member Discounts instead . " <p> Member discounts is something that I may want to offer sooner or later . Regardless , I definitely want EDDs add-ons for Event Tickets , Simple Shipping , AWeber ( i.e.- full support of AWeber , not just CSV via manual labor as appears to be the case with RCP ) , etc . But Im confused : to have such EDD-only add-ons and Member Discounts , should I get EDD and integrate RCP into it , vice versa , or ? <p> Although EDD w/ Recurring Payments , Content Restriction , and the other add-ons that I mention is clear , I guess I do n't  understand if or where " RCP-proper " integrates while leaving EDD add-ons functional . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective add-ons " running a site , " but not both ( again , if my main concern is having such EDD add-ons ) . <p> Please advise what configuration of EDD , RCP , or both that it sounds like I need " THANKS ! <p> Hi Tim , I 'm sure Pippin will have more to add about nitty gritty details on how RCP integrates with EDD , but theyll both work together and you can still use EDD add-ons for all of your EDD products ( see this ) , which seems to be your main concern . It sounds like you may want to lean towards RCP + EDD rather than using EDD Content Restriction if you know you need membership-level discounts ( it sounds like you 're heading towards offering membership-level discounts for tickets maybe ? ) so that you have the infrastructure for this up front . Both are RCP and Content Restriction great solutions and will allow you to use EDD for your virtual products , so it will depend on how you want to restrict membership content and if you need discounts that integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would billing for subscription / membership purchases be handled through RCP or EDD if you 're using both ? I 'm thinking about gateway integrations , and if you 'd need integrations for both plugins if you did set up EDD + RCP for this kind of thing . <p> The link you provided mentions , " This is an extension that integrates ( EDD and RCP ) and allows you to create automated discounts that give your paid subscribers a special discount on all Easy Digital Downloads purchases , " which makes the EDD-RCP coexistence/integration pretty clear . <p> By the way , you perceive correctly , Beka " Events is one ( but not the only ) thing that I 'll want to discount for members . <p> And , just in case it bears on things , I will want to use Stripe for payments , and the reason I 'll need EDDs Simple Shipping add-on is to allow me sell some physical items such as logo merchandise ( swag , polo shirts , etc. , which are also things I 'll want to discount for members ) . <p> Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me make a decision ASAP ! <p> No problem = . I love Stripe as well and it does have integrations available with both RCP and EDD , so it should n't be a problem to use that for memberships , tickets , or any other products . I 'd love to hear more about the setup process when your final decision is made and your experiences with whatever plugins you decide to use . Thanks for stopping by ! <p> Pippin , I 'm curious what your specific answer is to Bekas question and scenario above , " Pippin , would billing for subscription / membership purchases be handled through RCP or EDD if you 're using both ? I 'm thinking about gateway integrations , and if you 'd need integrations for both plugins if you did set up EDD + RCP for this kind of thing .

The only way I know how right now is making the whole block of content into a variable , then doing doshortcode(eddstuff) , which is a pain . <p> Hey Kamran , I think EDD would be a good choice for this , but I 'd recommend using the Sell Downloads as Services plugin ( free ) so that customers wont see a " no files attached " notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix , it should be a great option to sell a support subscription = . <p> Hey Beka , I had figured that out earlier today .

@@98138146 @2338146/ <h> 5 tips for eCommerce Content Marketing <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> If you 've never created an eCommerce store , you may think that getting the store up and running is the hardest part of launching an eCommerce business . However , in my experience , that 's almost always the easiest part of running an eCommerce store . <p> Managing day-to-day operations ( such as order fulfillment and marketing ) tend to be far more difficult than launching your store . Once you have this great shop with an awesome , unique product catalog up and running , how to you get people to your store ? How can you make sure that your ideal customer finds your products ? <p> Weve written a bit about affiliate marketing in this post and in this post , which is one method you can take . However , WordPress is built for another kind of marketing : content marketing . <h> eCommerce Content Marketing <p> So before we discuss tips , let 's back up for a second : Why worry about eCommerce content marketing ? Maintaining a blog for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your site , but this is n't the only reason to use one . Yes , it provides more indexible content about your products or niche , which increases the chance that your site will be found . However , you should pay attention to the other benefits of running a blog . <p> First , it establishes your authority . For example , let 's say that I sell mountain bikes and bike parts . If I write about fixing peoples bicycles , biking trips Ive taken , and compare different bike models or tires to one another , I 've established that I 'm an authority on my products . This drastically increases consumer trust and makes them more likely to purchase from you this overcomes their purchasing objections . <p> Blogging also gives you a chance to create a brand identity and gives your business a voice . People relate to other people , not clothing items or bicycles . We also trust other people . If your customers can identify with you and your brand , as well as get to know the people behind your products , theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your store . <p> Creating an eCommerce blog with WordPress is really easy when compared with other eCommerce platforms , and regardless of which eCommerce plugin you choose , you can create a blog for your store . Here are some helpful tips for launching or maintaining your own blog to lead your eCommerce content marketing strategy . <h> 1 . Be Helpful <p> While were creating this blog to promote your products , that 's going to be a fortunate side effect of the blog , not the focus . The main goal of your blog should be to help your customers . Help them find information they 're searching for . Help them solve problems related to your product niche . Help them make informed purchasing decisions . These tips from Hubspot also give this advice teach or help your customers . <p> This is one of the major ways to build trust with customers and to start to build a relationship with them . When they 're ready to purchase your product , theyll come to you directly rather than shopping around . Why ? Because they like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , and that can be more important and is certainly more lasting than focusing on price . <p> Going back to my bike example above what problems would avid cyclists have ? Perhaps theyd want to know how to fix a broken brake or swap out their seat for a better one ? These are things you should write about and provide guidance on . You can obviously suggest your own products to fix the issue , but these are problems your customers are looking to solve , and you serve them the tools to do so , including both your products and expertise , on a silver platter . <h> 2 . Be Relatable <p> What does your ideal customer love ? What does she hate ? If you can find these things out or guess at them and start writing , you gain the ability to empathize with your customers . Take The Oatmeal as an example : the content is shared widely and the site gets over 7 million visitors per month . One of the keys to The Oatmeals success is empathy writing about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your content shared , which is another great way to grow your audience and list of potential customers . You can make sharing even easier by using the Jetpack or Digg Digg plugins to add sharing buttons to posts . <h> 3 . Yes , Promote your products <p> While we do n't  want our products to be the sole focus of our blog , that does n't  mean that we want to hide them ! You should focus on solving your customers problems , answering their questions , or sharing interesting information in your blog . However , if your products are related to your posts , you should include them in the content or where appropriate . <p> Several eCommerce platforms allow you to easy add products into your content via shortcode . Here are some ways you can do so : <p> WooCommerce : Use product id= " 100 " or product sku= " wp-tee " to insert a single product ( image and " Add to Cart button " ) into a post . You can also use addtocart id= " " quantity= " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " button for a product if you 've already got the name / images covered . <p> Easy Digital Downloads : You can use the downloads id= " 100 " shortcode to add a download product to a page ( which accepts several parameters ) , or you can use the purchaselink id= " 100 " text= " Add to Cart " style= " button " shortcode to only display a purchase button for a particular download ( no image / name ) . <p> WP eCommerce : You can use wpscproducts productid= ' 100 ' to display a single products information , buynowbutton productid= ' 100 ' to display a PayPal " Buy Now " button for the product , or addtocart=100 to display an " add to cart " button for the product . <p> Jigoshop : The product id= " 100 " or product sku= " wp-tee " shortcodes will insert a single product with image and button , and the addtocart id= " " shortcode will only display the price and " Add to Cart " button for a product . <p> WP eStore : The wpeStoreaddtocart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button for the product , while the wpeStorebuynowbutton id=100 shortcode will create a " Buy Now " button to send customers directly to payment for the product . <p> Cart 66 : Using addtocart item= " 100 " will create an add to cart button for the particular product . <h> 4 . Feature your customers <p> Writing about your customers or featuring case studies is a great way to help potential customers visualize what its like to use your products . Do you sell running sneakers ? Get a brief story about a customer who ran a 5k , marathon , etc in a pair of shoes they bought from you . Write about what they liked and disliked about the product . <p> Do you sell services ? Even better . Write about how you were able to help a client achieve their goals by using your service . <p> Again , people relate to other people . Even featuring images of customers using your products is great . This let 's potential customers learn more about you , see that others are using your products or services ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or interact with your brand . <p> This also let 's you target some long tail keywords , as the quotes you get from customers on in the comments may help target search phrases you do n't  typically focus on . <h> 5 . Use Language Your Customers Use <p> Does the culture around your products lend itself to using a certain " lingo " or slang ? Use it . If its something newcomers may not know , you can definitely help them out by including explanations at the end or linking to definitions , but this shows that you 're in tune with the people that are using your products and makes you more relatable as a business . Using the language that mirrors your customers humanizes your store . <p> This also helps with your search traffic . If your ideal customer would phrase a search query a certain way or using a phrase related to your products , then including it in your writing will help you beat out the competition for these searches . For example , let 's say that I sell sporting equipment . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equipment that looked something like this : <p> Most manufacturers called these batting nets Portable batting nets or collapsible batting nets when they first came out . However , every player and coach referred to them as " Pop-up nets " ( which is what everyone calls them now ) . If I were creating an eCommerce blog and writing about " pop up nets " rather than " portable batting screens " , I 'd already be ahead of my competition because I 'm familiar with how my ideal customers refers to my products and I 'm more likely to show up when they search for these items . <h> Summary <p> Creating a blog should be at the core of an eCommerce content marketing strategy , as it leads to great traffic for your site , builds trust and authority , and let 's customers relate to you and your store . While it may be intimidating to start a blog or to start writing , remember that you do n't  have to do this every day . Start with 1-2 posts per week , and commit to writing about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifying some writing guidelines . <p> The SEO and conversion benefits of having a blog make it well worth the time invested for any eCommerce site , and building your site with WordPress makes it super easy to start blogging . <h> Read More <p> here 's a list of good eCommerce blogs from which I 'd recommend drawing inspiration . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138147 @2338147/ <p> PMPro is designed with the assumption that the core plugin should cover the most basic or essential membership capabilities , and that add-ons or extensions should provide the customizations necessary to meet the needs of different sites . The benefit to this approach is the ability to iterate add-ons quickly without updating the core plugin , and improving the stability of the core plugin since you eliminate code that may not be needed by most users . <p> Perhaps the most unique thing about PMPro , however , is that the plugin and add-ons are entirely free . Support is not included in the price , so you 'll want to work with a developer or get a support membership from Paid Memberships Pro ( $97 annually ) if you need help . You can download the plugin from the WordPress.org repository or download it by signing up with Paid Memberships Pro , which also gives you access to the free installation tutorials and videos . <h> Paid Memberships Pro Review : Overview <p> As we said in the introduction , PMPro is a lightweight membership solution for WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out in the order you should do them for the most streamlined setup process . Available options are easy to understand , and there 's a lot of customization available , especially for billing . <p> There 's a full feature list available if you want all of the details , and there are also a lot of free add-ons to customize plugin functionality . <h> Costs <p> As stated previously , the core PMPro plugin and add-ons are free . However , there 's a lot you can do with the plugin in terms of customization as its pretty developer friendly , so you 'll either want to have a developer handy or purchase a membership for $97 per year . Memberships include access to documentation , tutorials , premium content , videos , and members-only forums for one year ( I 'd recommend a membership and a developer if your site is more than a side project ) . If you want the white glove service , you can purchase installation and configuration for $697 , which also includes a consultation call and 5 hours of development to customize your setup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a basic membership site setup and configured in a matter of 10-15 minutes . Once I 'd installed the plugin , I went to the new Memberships menu that was created at the bottom of my WordPress menu , and the first thing to set up are Membership Levels . <p> While creating a level , you can set pretty detailed billing terms for the membership , create membership rules , and restrict post categories ( no tag restriction ) . <p> Creating a Membership Level <p> Setting up tiered memberships is easy , as you can copy a membership to add more access for the next level . Topic-based memberships are not quite as flexible , as users cant hold more than one membership at a time ( for example , they cant buy access to different categories individually ) . There is a work around for this that will help some users , as you can use the Purchase Access add-on to allow members to purchase access to pages or posts a la carte . <p> Once you have membership levels set up for your members , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an option to automatically generate the necessary pages with shortcodes , and gladly took that option : <p> Automatically Create Pages <p> Great ! The hardest parts of my setup are done . You can then setup payment information , emails , and advanced settings , such as requiring terms of service or forcing SSL on checkout . <p> One advanced option I really appreciated was the ability to show post excerpts to non-members if needed . Not only does this provide a great teaser to encourage non-members to sign up , but it also helps for SEO and allows search engines to index some of your content . The only thing I did n't  like was that my formatting was stripped from the excerpt , so youd have to work around this if it mattered to you . <p> Non-member Post Excerpts <h> Creating Membership Restrictions with Paid Memberships Pro <p> While setting up a membership level does provide post category restrictions , there are also other options available for content restriction . You can restrict access to individual posts , pages , or custom post types from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will also inform you if any restrictions already exist . <p> Restricting Pages and Posts <p> While static restrictions are the only option present in the core plugin , there 's an easy way to delay the release of posts or pages for membership access as well . Content dripping can be set up using the Series add-on . This plugin creates a new menu titled " Series " , and allows you to set a membership level for the series , as well as content that should be drip-fed and the number of days to delay the post / page access : <p> Creating a Post Series <p> You can set up different series for each membership level so that your content dripping is tailored to each membership using the Series add-on . If you want a complete walkthrough on using Series , check out this tutorial from Chis Lema . <h> Paid Memberships Pro Shortcodes <p> The final piece of setup for me was taking a look at the available shortcodes . Paid Memberships Pro uses one shortcode membership that has a levels attribute for content restriction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify the " My Account " template to include a link to the upsell page . Using the membership shortcode , you can then conditionally display upgrade text to the member based on the membership level s/he currently holds . <p> There are also more advanced uses for membership level checks using the **25;1395;TOOLONG function , but if you 're not familiar with PHP then you 'll need a developer to add the capabilities you 're looking for . <h> Selling and Managing PMPro Memberships <p> Once membership levels , content restriction , and content dripping ( if needed ) are configured , you 'll then want to sell your memberships . The good news is that PMPro creates a purchase table for you on the " Membership Levels " page , and creates a " Register " button for non-members while viewing a restricted post or page . <p> Purchasing Memberships <p> You can modify this template if desired ( again , where a developer / support plan comes in ) to match your theme or change the way memberships are sold . <p> Notice that all billing details are shown on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any membership level , as well as a trial period with the restriction that the trial period has to be defined in the same time unit as the subscription payment ( i.e. , weeks or months ) . However , trial periods are very customizable and can also allow you to offer a discounted introductory period for a number of billing cycles . <p> Customized Trials <p> Paid Memberships Pro also includes the ability to offer discounts . You can set usage limits for discounts , and determine which membership level the discount should apply to . Discounts will override the billing settings for the membership , and can allow you adjust the initial payment , trial amounts , or recurring billing amount . <p> Creating Discounts <h> Managing Members <p> Member management with PMPro is simple and has all of the basics . You wont be able to issue refunds or other advanced capabilities , but can effectively manage members and their subscriptions . You can also create and edit orders to add billing information , change purchase dates , and so on . <p> I liked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a CSV so that you can bring that information into a third-party accounting system if needed . <p> Administrators and members can also cancel memberships . Admins can do this via the " Users " menu , and users can do so from the account page . <p> As a final note on member management , you also have an option to restrict sharing of login credentials with PMPro by installing the WP Bouncer plugin . This prevents credentials from being used simultaneously from two different IP addresses . While this does n't  provide a complete solution to prevent sharing , it does provide a deterrent and is certainly better than nothing . <h> Billing and Payments <p> Paid Memberships Pro comes with several payment gateway integrations built into the core plugin , including Stripe , Braintree , PayPal , and Authorize.net ( among others ) . <p> Available Gateway Integrations <p> Billing options , as we previously mentioned , are very flexible . You can set up sign up fees , trial periods , recurring subscriptions , and subscriptions with a set term . You can also bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> Billing Cycles <p> One downside to billing with PMPro is that you can only use one payment integration at a time out of the box . However , there is an add-on that will now let you use PayPal Express in addition to your other checkout method . I know there is also a tutorial available to offer multiple checkout methods for paid members that I did n't  have a chance to check out but would probably help . <h> Integrations <p> As we stated before , there are a lot of free add-ons available for Paid Memberships Pro . For advanced email management , you can integrate with MailChimp , AWeber , or InfusionSoft , which will sort members into lists based on their membership level . There are also affiliate integrations available so that you can offer commissions in exchange for sign ups . <p> I also liked that a bbPress integration is available to restrict forums based on membership , which is great for those of you that support products or run private forums . <h> Support <p> Support is what 's monetized in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than fair considering the plugin and add-ons are free . All support channels are listed here . Users that have signed up for a free membership have access to plugin documentation , which includes tutorials and some helpful videos . There are also helpful resources for developers available . <p> However , if you want more advanced support , such as access to the membership forums , you 'll have to purchase a $97 per year membership . <h> Other Comments <p> While PMPro is primarily a membership solution for content restriction rather than physical goods , there 's a new shipping add-on available , which collects shipping addresses and other pertinent information at checkout . Since you cant add shipping rates or integrate with shipping services , I would n't recommend it as a solution for stores that rely on product-based memberships . <p> One place where I do frequently recommend Paid Memberships Pro is for multisite installations . There are Network Membership and Network/Multisite Membership add-ons available that turn PMPro into a multisite solution . As few membership plugins support multisite , this is pretty great functionality to have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can view visits and sales at a glance from the " Reports " screen : <p> Reports <p> You can also view more detailed reports , such as revenue or sales per day : <p> Report Details <h> Paid Memberships Pro Review : Wrap-up <p> Paid Memberships Pro is a flexible , developer-friendly solution for creating a membership site using WordPress . The fact that the plugins and add-ons are free is awesome , and I think that support is reasonably priced at just over $8 per month , especially since solving one major issue per year via support could essentially pay for itself . <p> The billing options included in PMPro are flexible and offer some great options , including discount capabilities . Content restriction is solid and offers most of the functionality that sites will need . PMPro may not contain the feature set that enterprise solutions like MemberMouse have ( such as upgrades , downgrades , or advanced billing options ) , but its great for small to medium sites , and extensible enough that it could grow with your site as you get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PMPro for memberships that involve shippable products , but does a great job for content-based memberships . While no solution is perfect , PMPro is a great plugin for those of you looking to start membership sites or switch to an easy-to-use , reliable platform . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> My name is Marshanda . I want to make membership site which accept offline payment ( bank transfer ) because paypal , cc etc is n't familiar payment in my country . Also can integrate with simple autorespoder plugin like mymail newsletter plugin from codecanyon , I do n't  plan to use big company like aweber , getresponse etc because I 've just started . <p> Do you think PMPro suit my needs ? Or I should use PMPro+Woo ? Or maybe there is membership/ecommerce plugin can handle better ? <p> Hey Marshanda , I do n't  know of anything that will integrate a particular newsletter plugin unless you 're using MailPoet , so I 'd recommend that or MailChimp ( which is what I use there 's a free plan to start ) . Most membership / eCommerce plugins will integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for membership functionality , using PMPro alone is a great choice and is very easy to set up / use . If you 'd like to sell products as well , then I 'd start by using it with the WooCommerce add-on to sell your memberships rather than using the PMPro checkout . This will keep all purchasing data and user accounts within WooCommerce so its easier to sell your products in the future . Both WooCommerce and PMPro have offline payment methods PMPro has a " Pay by Check " gateway , while WC has both check / bank transfer gateways . <p> Can PMP or any other multisite plugin drip content by allowing selected content based on available credits ? <p> Example : <p> One credit is give to a paid subscriber per day . They may or may not use it on that day but they can accumulate . At any point in time the subscriber chooses to use a credit to redeem it for content that is available from a list . <p> Hey Phil , I 'm afraid this sounds like a pretty customized solution . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-on to start , but the token system for both giving out tokens and allowing them as payment for the single posts would have to be custom developed . If you do find something like a points or token system , I 'd love to hear about it ! <p> We have this plugin set up . There is one thing that is not very clear in the documentation . If you set up a membership as a recurring subscription , does that mean their card will be charged automatically ? Or will they be billed via email ? <p> If it does charge the card automatically , and we do n't  want that , do you just set an expiration period ? And if so , does it send them an email or email bill to remind them to re-up ? Or does it at least remind us we need to bill them ? <p> Hey there James , recurring subscriptions are billed to the payment method on file automatically via PMPro . If you do n't  want this , you 're correct that youd let the membership expire ( do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are sent an email before a membership or trial expires details on the emails sent are here . You can customize this automatic email to remind them to re-purchase so that you do n't  have to bill them . <p> Beka , thanks so much for the response . So , by " recurring subscriptions are billed to the payment method on file automatically via PMPro , " do you mean just billed , or their card is actually charged automatically ? Thats what 's not clear . Thanks . <p> Hey Michael , I meant that you can " copy " the membership to add a new level , which in effect can give a tiered membership . For example , I can create a " silver " level and set up access rules , then copy it and add more access for a " gold " level . The ability to copy a level makes it easy to ensure that the next level up starts out with the same capabilities / access , and you can add more from there . <p> Does Paid Memberships Pro allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sell 5 memberships at once to a single company in a bundle , can I do that ? Lots of companies we work with like to purchase group subscriptions for their various teams ( sales teams , media teams , HR teams , etc . ) . A good example of this is stock photo sites often sell a set of 5 accounts to media departments at ad agencies . 
@@98138148 @2338148/ <h> 9 Tips for Writing Product Descriptions that Sell <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> As an eCommerce shop owner , you typically do n't  have the opportunity to " sell " to eCommerce customers in the same way that you do in-store . Since this real-time interaction is missing from the online shopping experience , increasing conversions by optimizing your site is the next best course of action . You can learn from the behaviors of previous customers to make changes that make the shopping experience smoother for the next customers . Weve written about general tips for increasing conversions on your site already , but will take a look specifically at using product descriptions that sell today . <h> Some Background <p> Customers leave your site all of the time . In fact , eCommerce carts are typically abandoned at a rate over 65% . Many customers abandon their purchases or leave your site due to price : pricing concerns make up the top 4 reasons that customers do n't  purchase from an online retailer . While you may or may not have flexibility with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to either ( a ) mitigate other abandonment factors , such as shipping costs , or ( b ) make price a lesser concern by getting customers excited or comfortable with their purchases . <p> We 've already written a bit about creating effective shipping methods for your store , so well focus on ensuring that copy and product descriptions sell effectively and make sure that customers are happy about paying your price while purchasing . <h> 1 . Know Your Customers <p> This is one that should be a no-brainer . If you do n't  know why customers are looking for your product , then how can you sell effectively ? Use surveys to ask customers why they chose your product , what they were looking for , and if they had doubts or something they do n't  like about the product . Offering a coupon or a free gift for the survey should help to ensure that customers will complete it . <p> Once you have a better idea of what problems your product is solving , you can sell more effectively . You most likely had an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose you is integral to creating your ideal customer . <p> You should have the ideal customer in your head when you edit your copy understand his sense of humor , what makes her laugh , what pain points this person experiences , and what hesitations he or she has . You 'll need to know this information to both connect with customers and overcome their doubts before purchasing . <h> 2 . Pay Attention to Formatting <p> Nothing is more intimidating than a giant wall of text . Have you ever gotten an email that took up the whole page with no paragraph breaks ? Did you want to read it ? I delete emails like that if I do n't  have to read them . <p> Do n't  do that to your customers . Be as minimalist as possible in your descriptions include what 's necessary and not more . Potential customers hate when you waste their time . If you need to include a product FAQ , then do that separate ( i.e. , in a product tab ) so that customers can get to important product information quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chunks " of text to read organize your product descriptions using headers and lists whenever possible . <h> 3 . Use Presupposition and Adjacency Pairs <p> Give a reader one thing to focus on , then suggest another thing . In order to focus on the first part and answer the question , the reader will have to accept the second thing as true first ( this is one of my favorite strategies from Web Copy That Sells ) . For example , take this question : <p> How will you react to all of the compliments you 'll get while you wear this shirt ? <p> While I would n't use that question specifically since its a bit hokey , the point of this is n't to get the reader to think about compliments its to make sure the reader pictures himself or herself wearing the shirt . This helps your readers to visualize purchasing the product and how it will make them feel , which is one of the toughest things to accomplish when customers can not physically interact with your product . You can also do this with presuppositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or obviously . <p> Other examples of adjacency pairs / presuppositions : <p> What will you do with the time that this saves you every day ? ( Reader has to accept that the product saves time . ) <p> Clearly , flashlights could be a lot cooler . ( Implying that flashlights are not cool , but this flashlight will have the aforementioned " coolness " . ) <h> 4 . Sell , Do n't  Tell <p> Focus on the benefits that customers will get from your product . For example , let 's take noise-canceling headphones . When selling your noise-canceling headphones , its easy to tell people about what you did to build or make them . For example , you can tell them the range of sound frequencies that will be canceled or the reduction in sounds , such as , " Blocks 70% of ambient noise and reduces sound by up to 20 decibels ! " There 's a problem with this : ( a ) nobody cares and ( b ) they do n't  know what that means . Tell them instead how it changes their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love these headphones , such as : <p> You cant hear other people around you as much <p> Audio sounds better since external noises do n't  distort it <p> Airplane noises are soooooo loud and I want to make sure I block them the whole flight . <p> For example , take Boses tagline : Youll love what you hear . And what you do n't  . In less than 10 words , they tell you that the headphones help you hear what you want to hear ( your music ) while limiting the ambient noises that annoy you . Bose focuses on the audio quality that blocking external noises produces in their ads : <p> Free shipping also eliminates one decision in the checkout process . Customers already have to ask , " Am I willing to pay the price for this product ? " Free shipping eliminates the need for them to ask , " Am I willing to pay the shipping costs ? " as well , which reduces barriers to purchase . If you 're offering this option , let them know on each product page ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since you 're using free shipping already , the way this is presented should have maximum effect . Test rewording shipping notices to say " Well pay your shipping " instead , i.e. : <p> If you 're order is over $50 , well pay the shipping ! <p> This way , customers feel as if they get something directly from your business you 're paying it for them rather than some nebulous free gift that 's descended from the heavens . <h> 6 . Use Sensory Words to Describe <p> Most adjectives , comparatives , or superlatives can be deleted from your copy . If you have to tell people that your product is the best or that it exhibits excellent craftsmanship , they probably wo n't believe you . After all , who tells people that their product is bad ? ( Though keep reading , you should in some cases ! ) <p> If you have something to back this up , such as a customer review , then let them say that for you leverage the social proof that this creates . However , there are some adjectives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help customers visualize and imagine what its like to have or use your product . <p> For example , if you 're selling chocolate , describe the flavor and texture : " These dark chocolate truffles perfectly pair the crunch and slight bitterness of the outer chocolate shell with the velvety hazelnut filling . " If you 're describing clothing , tell people how it feels : " Our 100% cotton shirts are so soft it feels like they 're kissing your skin . " <h> 7 . Use Reframing to Acknowledge Flaws <p> Always acknowledge what people see as flaws or shortcomings of your products . It builds trust with customers , and allows you to define the frame of reference through which they view your product . <p> Reframing typically means posturing what could be seen as negative attributes instead as positive features . For example , let 's take WordPress themes , which all too often include tons of options that most users wo n't need . Quality themes should n't include about a million bells and whistles , as options are better when added as needed to reduce bloat . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like ) , reframe this lack of options . Hook your users by telling them about why this perceived negative is actually positive : <p> Does this theme include 4 choices for sliders ? No . Do we include 11 different page layouts ? Nope , do n't  have that either . What we do have is a flexible , extensible solution that 's build for maximum performance . We eliminate options simply because they do n't  belong here you can always add sliders if you need them , or build your own homepage using widgets and our shortcodes plugin . We give you a lean , lightweight , high-performance codebase with the ability to take options with you when you switch themes . <p> You can also use this tactic with pricing . Let 's use WordPress plugins this time . For example , let 's say that you create a plugin that sells for $249 as far as WordPress plugins go , that would be on the high end . Before introducing price , tell customers about ( a ) how much it would cost to custom-develop the plugin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( b ) how much time the plugin could save them or what increase in sales it can yield . This sets the frame of reference for the customer rather than comparing the plugin to other plugins , they now compare it to custom development and the value of their own time . <p> Does reframing work on everyone ? Of course not . However , it does help to overcome some of the more basic objections that customers may have to purchasing . <h> 8 . Empathize <p> Its incredibly important to make sure that your customers feel that you understand them . Look at all of the great tips from The Oatmeal on writing great headlines and viral posts : readers want to identify with you . Show customers that you understand their pain points , and that your product is best geared to solve them . <p> For example , almost everyone that 's used a computer has had issues with using a printer . The headline " Why I Believe Printers Were Sent From Hell To Make Us Miserable " captures this perfectly , provides something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the writer and reader . Now imagine if you 'd written about why printers are awful and had the easiest printer in the world to sell . <h> 9 . Tell Stories <p> Stories can be one of the easiest and best ways to create empathy and connection . Take a look at this example from Shopio creating a story around a product makes it easier to visualize using that product and identify with the characters in the story . <p> Rather than connecting to the product , stories ask customers to connect to the people using the product , which is a far easier connection to make . This also takes customers a step closer towards purchasing , as they can imagine what it would be like to own this product . <h> Read More <p> Here are some other recommended resources on writing product descriptions that sell : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138149 @2338149/ <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : version 2.0 <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of my favorite plugins got an update last week , so today I 'll be taking a look at the changes and what 's new . <p> WooCommerce Subscriptions 2.0 came out last Monday , and it completely re-architects the plugin to improve support for multiple subscriptions ( and let 's customers purchase more than one per order ) , support for digital subscriptions via file dripping , new statuses , and one-time shipping charges , and subscription management for shop admins . <p> It also makes Subscriptions much more developer-friendly it now uses the WordPress custom post type architecture for subscriptions so data can be access easily , and has custom REST API endpoints to make integrations with other systems easier . <p> There 's a What 's new guide available if you want a recap , and well take a more detailed look at each new feature here . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Overview <p> WooCommerce Subscriptions ( $199 ) is a phenomenal tool for managing recurring billing , and supports almost any subscription product type ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Prior to this update , it had excellent support for subscription switching and pro-rating fees . <p> The good news is that version 2.0 still keeps these features : <p> customers can switch subscriptions to change , upgrade , or downgrade their subscription <p> customers can suspend subscriptions to pause them <p> sign up fees and subscription fees can leverage advanced proration rules for switching <p> renewal payment dates can be synchronized for easy management <p> And some great new ones are added = Well take a look through major changes in version 2.0 in this WooCommerce Subscriptions review rather than looking into every feature the plugin offers . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Manage Subscriptions <p> One of the first changes you 'll notice about Subscriptions is that the subscription data is now stored independently from the initial order . This makes managing the subscription much easier , as you can adjust any details about the subscription by viewing it , rather than tracking down the order in which it was purchased . <p> This also let 's you manually create subscriptions for customers and add products , fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful document on doing so . ) <p> Add / Edit Subscription <p> If a subscription was purchased , the original order will also link to this view / edit screen for the subscription so you can manage it . <p> Initial Order <p> You can view and edit all subscriptions from WooCommerce &gt; Subscriptions : <p> The change in structure to create a unique subscription object also means that multiple subscription products can become part of the same subscription as line items ( more on that in a second ! ) . <p> For example , if I buy two subscription products with monthly billing , these become part of my " monthly subscription " and are stored as part of the same subscription object . <p> Customer management <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Multiple Subscriptions <p> The ability to purchase more than one subscription in an order was added in version 2.0 , which means that your customers can sign up for as many subscriptions as they want to , saving them hassle while subscribing , and potentially saving you money on transaction fees . <p> Multiple subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their costs will be grouped together if their renewal periods are the same ( monthly , yearly , etc ) . <p> Purchasing multiple subscriptions <p> Each " group " of subscriptions will then become a unique subscription for the customer to manage from his or her account . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Customer Area <p> Speaking of the customer account , its been improved in version 2.0 as well . Previously the " My Subscriptions " section showed basic details , then several actions , like " View " , " Cancel " , or " Suspend " . Now the " My Subscriptions " list shows all subscriptions with an action to view more details . <p> " My Subscriptions " listing <p> Viewing a subscription gives the customer the ability to edit the subscription details ( such as the address or payment information ) and to view complete details for the subscription . <p> View Subscription <p> If subscription switching is available , or if the customer has multiple items in the subscription , they can also manage these parts of the subscription while viewing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subscription , or they can switch out one product in the subscription for another if switching is enabled . <p> Customer management <p> This makes it much easier for customers to take actions related to their subscriptions , and its easier to manage subscriptions to several products . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : New Status <p> A new status was also added to subscriptions : the " Pending Cancellation " status . <p> In previous versions of Subscriptions , once a subscriber cancelled a subscription , the status would immediately change to " cancelled " , even if the customer had paid for a length of time . For example , if I 'd paid for a new month on October 1 , but cancelled on October 10 , technically my " paid period " lasts until October 31 , but my subscription was marked cancelled on the 10th . <p> This could cause issues for downloadable file or content access , and it was n't clear to customers that they still had the " benefits " of the paid period . Now when a subscription is cancelled , it moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-paid period . After the paid period is over , it moves to completed cancelled . <p> This allows plugins that offer special access to subscribers , such as WooCommerce Memberships , to continue to provide that access until the pre-paid term is over . <p> Pending Cancellation <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Other Changes <p> There are tons of other minor changes and improvements to Subscriptions in this version , which are covered in the What 's New guide . However , one I do want to point out is the basic digital file dripping . <p> This improvement is designed to support digital content providers that serve files to members each month / year / etc . If enabled , it allows you to add files to the subscription , but subscribers can not access the file until the next renewal payment is processed . <p> Dripping Downloads <p> This helps sites like digital magazines add new content , but ensure that the next payment is processed before it can be accessed . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : For Developers <p> As we mentioned initially , Subscriptions uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.2 ) for a subscription rather than tying data to the initial order . This paved the way for multiple subscription support , while it also makes it easy and familiar to access subscription data . <p> This also means that accessing subscription data is easier , as a subscription is its own object and data can be queried with something as simple as a unique subscription I 'd . As subscriptions are a unique shopsubscription post type , developers who are familiar with WordPress will find working with subscriptions easier and more familiar . <p> Subscriptions has also added its own REST API endpoints so that subscription data can be accessed or updated by external applications , making it even easier to integrate your site with other services . For example , you can get all subscriptions using wc-api/v2/subscriptions <p> Looking to test the changes ? This WooCommerce Dev Helper plugin will let you manually trigger renewals for Subscriptions 1.5. x and 2.0. x so you can test the changes thoroughly . <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Coming Soon <p> Since the data structure of the plugin has been re-done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One that 's coming very soon is the ability to charge once for shipping for a subscription , which can be enabled on a per-product basis . <p> One Time shipping <p> This will help support stores that sell a digital subscription , but the initial sign up / action requires a shipped item ( such as a membership card , welcome package , etc ) . <p> There are also some other great things on the way from the fabulous Prospress team . We hinted at one previously when we wrote about WooCommerce membership sites : a new extension to add the ability to sell group subscriptions or parent-child subscriptions so one user can pay while others get the benefits . <p> There are also other great plugins on the way , such as the ability to add products to an existing subscription . Definitely stuff I 'd keep an eye on our weekly roundups for = <h> WooCommerce Subscriptions Review : Summary <p> WooCommerce Subscriptions still holds is place as one of the best ways to manage recurring billing for eCommerce sites . The version 2.0 changes are pretty incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they make the plugin much more flexible . <p> There are improvements for stores that sell digital subscriptions via the addition of one time shipping costs , file dripping , and " pending cancellation " status . The plugin also supports different business models by allowing multiple subscriptions in an order , as well as the ability to manage several products in a single subscription . The improved customer management is also a plus . <p> If you 're looking to build a business based on the subscription / recurring charge model , there are n't  very many plugins or apps I 'd put in the same class or above WooCommerce Subscriptions . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Thanks for the great summary . I would like your thoughts on if it is possible to use the Subscription/Membership together with Booking and create a certain number of appointments for example that are included in a subscription that a client can then use and book their appointments . Once the included number of appointments are exhausted they would get the next set with the auto ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be if any unused appointments could be rolled over into the next subscription term period ( unless subscription is expired/canceled ) . <p> I 'm afraid this is n't possible out of the box , as the number of purchases is n't restricted , just the product itself . I 'd recommend generating a coupon with each renewal as per this guide instead that would be valid for appointments . 
@@98138150 @2338150/ <p> Brents name has been on his plugins for the past couple of years , but he s now working with three full-time employees and one part-time employee , so he s looking to roll out one brand that encompasses the entire team behind these extensions . Even though there was an " unofficial " company for the plugin business , Brents excited to launch a new brand for all WordPress development : <p> For the last few years , I 've traded under the company name Leonards Ego . That name has really only been used for accounting purposes . It was never intended to become a company brand and I usually put my personal name on my work . This gave me complete creative freedom to explore different ideas <p> Rebranding the company to reflect that shift makes sense , but the rebrand is also for more than that . With the success of Subscriptions and knowing its still early days for the WooCommerce ecosystem , the rebrand also symbolizes the transition from solopreneur to company . At launch , Prospress Inc has a team of three full-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of developing new products and in recruiting full-time WooCommerce developers . <h> The Beginning of Prospress <p> With a team behind these WooCommerce products , Brent and Prospress are ready to move forward with several new products and feature additions . One of the major projects on the roadmap is Subscriptions v2.0 . This marks the first time that Subscriptions development will break backwards compatibility to support some huge changes . Brent explained further : <p> The scope of Subscriptions has grown tremendously since version 1.0 . To remain backwards compatible , the Subscriptions codebase has n't  been able to evolve fully with these changes . Version 2.0 is the chance to bring everything in line with how it is used today , and what is possible with WooCommerce 2.2 , rather than how it was designed and what could be done two years ago with WooCommerce 1.5 . <p> This change will bring some exciting features to the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin , the most important of which is support for purchasing multiple subscriptions within one transaction . Following this , most of the core development for Subscriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more features , such a unified failed payment retry system . Brent said that the development timeline for this is about a year : " I feel the majority of the features that make sense for core will be included by version 2.2 , which will be released mid to late 2015 . " <p> So what else will Prospress do besides core Subscriptions development ? <p> There are " mini-plugins " and other functionality extensions that the team would like to explore . " There are others things that store managers want to do with Subscriptions that I want to make possible , " Brent says . " But many of these features do n't  make sense for the majority , which means they do n't  make sense for core . " This opens up the ability to offer bolt-on extensions to make Subscriptions as customizable and flexible as possible without unnecessarily bloating the main extension . <p> Development on Subscriptions add-ons has already begun , but Brent was waiting to release his first add-on until he could add team members and support the plugins to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = ) . Now that the team has the capacity to support and maintain extensions at the same level , they 're looking to release these plugins and continue building . To start , a Subscriptions CSV Importer plugin is coming soon for customers that want to import existing subscriptions from a different platform . <p> Prospress will also soon be releasing a One Page Purchase plugin . " I 'm particularly excited about the One Page Purchase plugin , which allows customers to select products and complete checkout on the one page , " Brent said . The plugin is meant to be an alternative to the traditional checkout , which flows from product page to cart to checkout . Instead , the plugin will allow shop owners to display a product on a landing page and gather all payment details in one fell swoop . The goal is to support shops that only sell a couple of products , or to allow store managers to create landing pages for special promotions . <h> WooCommerce is Growing Up <p> Prospress marks another company that 's sprouted up in the " add-on plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend in the ecosystem . There are more and more companies that specialize in building for certain platforms ( such as Prospress in WooCommerce ) , or theming particular plugins really well ( as Astoundify does ) . <p> WooCommerces ability to sustain these kind of add-on companies is a huge marker of the growth it has experienced . However , as with all rapid growth , growing pains do ensue . <p> The freedom exists for anyone to build for WooCommerce , which leads to tremendous amounts of great products . The flipside to this freedom is that sometimes products are built that do n't  work well , as no single standard for quality benchmarks exist . As a result , some users blame WooCommerce or WordPress as a whole for this shortcoming . This is a concern that Brent shares with me : <p> If the extension does n't  work , a store manager will often blame WooCommerce in the same way people that blame WordPress if their site gets hacked due to an exploit in custom code . A quick look at the 1 star reviews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame the platform " behavior . <p> So how do you combat this in order to ensure that the platform continues to grow ? Is it better to have trusted companies like Prospress behind add-ons and active in the ecosystem , or to encourage as many single developers to contribute as possible ? <p> Brent said that it makes sense for WooThemes to " work with people they trust and know they can rely on , regardless of whether those people are part of a larger company or an individual , " and I tend to agree . He believes that , " Benchmarks of quality , reliability , and benefit to customers are more important than company size . " <p> While putting a company or team behind a large project can certainly help to ensure support and quality standards are met ( for example , if one dev wants to take a vacation and needs to tag in another for support tickets ) , I think that the benchmarks of reliability are the biggest influence in the growth of add-ons and the WooCommerce ecosystem . <p> In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable assets to WooCommerce providing curated , quality , supported plugins makes it easy for users to do whatever they want with WooCommerce without worry about compatibility or the future of the platform . <p> Brents take : <p> WooThemes is doing a good job addressing the challenge of overcoming " blame the platform " behavior by providing a trusted source for extensions . If you purchase an extension from WooThemes.com , you receive a promise that it will work with other WooThemes.com extensions , bugs will be fixed when it does n't  work as advertised , and someone will answer your emails if you have questions . <p> To me , this is the leading growth factor for WooCommerce . The WooThemes marketplace supports the growth of quality add-on development and provides the needed additional features for WooCommerce shops . This gives WooThemes the ability to provide trusted backing for the platform and for added functionality , and gives users confidence in WooCommerces future . <p> Even though the platform has experienced tremendous growth already , the ability to overcome platform-blaming with curated extensions and to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce still in its adolescence , and will continue to grow . <p> Congrats again to Brent and the rest of the Prospress team on their brand launch , and remember to check out Prospress.com to see more details about the current products , the Prospress team , and products in beta ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

There 's an easy way to prevent this from happening and to secure your WooCommerce downloadable files . here 's the process : <h> Steps to WooCommerce Secure Downloads : <p> Connect to your website via FTP or SFTP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see files like index.php , wp-config.php , etc . This is your " webroot " and any files stored here or in sub-directories are ( mostly ) publicly-accessible by default , unless you 're using . htaccess rules . <p> Browse to the folder above your webroot and create a folder named " downloads " . Upload all your downloadable files into this directory . Within your FTP client , you should see an option to copy the full path . In Transmit on OSX , it looks like this : <p> Log in to your WooCommerce store and browse to the Edit Product page . Change the " File Paths " section from the old URL to the path you just copied : Hit save and you 're done . <p> That 's it ! Repeat this process to secure all of your WooCommerce downloadable files and place a test order to make sure you do n't  encounter any errors . Once you 've done this , you can delete the old files stored in your wp-content/uploads directory .

I wondered if I was going to have to pay for some kind of expensive plugin to protect my files . nice little trick and I love how easy it is . Thanks for sharing . <p> Are n't  the files still accessible from the outside if you follow the redirect ? I would think theyd have to be otherwise the downloads would n't work . It seems like you just moved them to a directory outside of the WP installation but still accessible to the public if they discover the URL . Mod X-Sendfile was recommended to me as an alternative but I have not gotten around to setting it up . <p> Hi , It did n't  work with the ordinary way for my download files so I tried above and this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that there probably need to be some special permission for this folder on the server , is it like this ? <p> I have n't deleted the upload folder because I thought maybe the hosting company could fix something can this be a problem ? <p> Thank you , Max I tried to find the information that you have shared here at Woocommerce and just did n't  see it if it was there . I 'll try this . Signed up for your newsletter and posts ! My Christmas list is growing . = I 'll try to give back , Lordwilling my site produces giving to me . Thanks again . Laura <p> Hi Max , Thanks for the advice but I 've tried a few things and I 'm now more confused than anything . My files(hosting) structure is as follow : WordPress files are in " wp " folder Above this I have " publichtml " folder ( Which I would think is my " webroot " ) Above this is another level which I 'll call " hosting root " for now . I 've tried to move the downloadable files in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " hosting root " . When the folder is in publichtml anyone can access the files if they know the url ( like **28;1422;TOOLONG ) so no secure downloads here . When I place the folder in my " hosting root " the url can only use the IP ( like **32;1452;TOOLONG ) and the link is treated as a ftp link , trying to connect to the hosting server . <p> I thought I could control the access to the folder using permissions or maybe . htaccess file but I 'm not sure what to use . Do you have any idea what I 'm doing wrong or how I could fix my problem . FYI I 'm using a WP multisite install but I do n't  think this would change anything . Thanks <p> Making a folder in your hosting root ( like " assets " ) should work fine . If you have SSH/command line access or SFTP/FTP access you can use that to navigate to that assets folder and either use pwd to show you the full directory path , or your FTP client may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filename ) is what you want to enter in WooCommerce for the filename . hope this helps ! <p> I seem to be having trouble getting this to work correctly . I 've created a folder that is outside the wwwroot folder ( generically speaking ) named Download , made sure it had read permissions for public , and copied a sample file there . I 'm using Windows and FileZilla , and could n't find anywhere that let me get the full path for the file , but I assumed it was /Download/filename.zip . I put this entry in the file paths section as mentioned above , saved and tried it kept getting a 404 . I 'm hoping this is enough information , but is there something I 'm missing ? <p> Hmm , you might have to ask your hosting provider for assistance with that they should be able to give you the full path to your wwwroot then you could just remove that and add your " download " path which should work = <p> Hi Max . Thanks for your post ! I 'm really looking forward for a solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Force Download " is not an option because users can not complete big files downloads . My server does not have modxsendfile . The only option is " Redirect only " . Absolute path does not work with this option . Could there be another solution for that ? What if we use . htaccess to redirect to a php file before hitting the download file to check the purchase ? <p> Hey Renan , if you have large files for users to download modxsendfile is really your best option . I 'd look into a hosting provider that will be able to add that module for you rather than hack together a . htaccess rule to a PHP file = <p> Thanks for great advice and useful instructions ! I have done everything above and simulated purchases in my shop , and everything works just fine , until the downloaded product is corrupt and void of all data . Why is that ? I have tried different paths to my folder , or to each specific product , and the only time the download wasn-t corrupt , was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but then I had to use my password to the master FTP to get access to the product and that-s nothing I would want to hand out to customers = <p> Currently I use the Linux path to the folder , and doing so I enter the path to each specific product in the folder . This works fine in every step of the purchasing process , until it shows that the product is corrupt and contains no data . Can it have something to do with my site being under SSL encryptation ? I have checked the respective categories rights in the " downloads " folder and I can see nothing that not looks right there . The file type in question for both purchase and testing is PDF-documents . <p> Second : I contacted my host provider , and they told me my the corruption is due to server restrictions . The only folder that could come in question for such downloading purposes would HAVE to be under my " publichtml " folder no place else . The solution I was presented , is to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use an . htaccess file where I specify conditions for what and whom is allowed access to the folder . <p> The issue I now face is : How do I specify the script so I allow WooCommerce to link a download from that folder since the links generated from a purchase I suppose are temporary ? How do I link to that folder in WooCommerce so access is granted ? <p> Hello Max , Its really helpful article as others , thank you . I just a bit confused that article is best way for me or not . I would like to sell a magazine but not monthly , yearly or whatever subscription , just one time payment . I just want to that when the customer buy a magazine immedietly redirect a new tab and see the readable PDF not download PDF . And also when customer buy a magazine after then can access other magazine issues . <p> For example : I 'm a customer . I click the Buy item any magazine on shop page after redirect to me if I pay this item to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i saw a link on last page the PDF . The link says " You can access other issues when click this link i can read other magazine issues . <p> Thanks for the wonderful article ! I was able to make it worked on our site but we encountered 1 problem : <p> When we set File URL value to=d : **34;1486;TOOLONG , on save the field value is reset to http : // but the file can be downloaded . The next time you save the product and did n't  set again the value then the file will be empty . Any idea why ?

@@98138153 @2338153/ <h> Email Case Study : Indochino Cart Recovery Email <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this months email case study , we will review the Indochino cart recovery email . Indochino is an online provider of made to measure clothing for men , including suits , shirts , and accessories . The cart recovery email is sent when a customer has added items to the cart and has left the site without completing checkout . Typically , a customer would have to be logged in to the store , or would have had filled the email field on the checkout page to receive this email . <p> The goal of the email is to remind customers of the products in their cart and that these are saved for them to easily complete the purchase . According to a report , almost 67% of carts are abandoned on average . The cart abandonment recovery email aims to recapture some of this lost revenue . <p> In this post , we break down the Indochino cart recovery email to see what was good , what was bad , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was good ? <p> Clear call to action in Indochinos cart recovery email <h> 1 . Clear call to action <p> One of the first things that is noticeable in the email is the copy informing the customer what the email is about . The call to action to view the cart follows this copy to take the customer to exactly where they can go to continue their purchase . Another important thing is that the call to action is located at the top of the email before any other content to make the navigation quick and easy . <h> 2 . Product images <p> Another major part of the email are the big product images to show what is included in the cart . This not only serves as a reminder about the products , but also showcases the products as they would be used . In this instance , a model is wearing the suit and the vest so that customers can easily visualize what the end state of the products would look like . <p> Indochino cart recovery email second half <h> 3 . Recommendations <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations are shown based on the products in the cart . This is a form of cross-selling , where customers can see other items that can complement products they are currently considering . This can give customers an idea of what other items are in the store they can consider purchasing , and grow your average order values . <h> 4 . Shipping policy <p> Another " nudge " to customers towards completing their purchase is the clearly stated shipping policy . In this case , there is free international shipping on orders over $150 . This creates a little extra value in the mind of customers as they do n't  have to worry about shipping cost . Even if it was clear on the website , including it in the email is a great reminder of what they can expect by shopping with Indochino . <h> Indochino cart recovery email : What was bad ? <h> 1 . Lack of personalization <p> One of the things that 's lacking in this email is personalization . This email was triggered when I was logged into the store , so they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the email , and adding a personal signature at the end of the email can help humanize it a bit . This can help make it feel more like a conversation rather than being mechanistic . <h> 2 . Outdated copyright year <p> This email has an older year in the copyright text . This is equivalent to having a typo in the email , and signal a lack of care for this particular email set as the year has not been updated . Having errors even in these small details can negatively affect your brand . <h> 3 . No product prices <p> Prices are a major thing missing from this email . Prices can help quickly give customers a frame of reference about the amount of money they would need to spend . This applies to products in the cart , as well as the recommended products . Without prices , it is harder to make a decision about whether or not you would want to continue shopping or complete the purchase . Customers would have to go to the cart or the store to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Indochino cart recovery email : What got us to click ? <p> The big product images got us to click as they clearly show what the products look like . In this case , a person is modelling the suit and the vest which gives customers an overview of what the final product would look like when worn . <p> Depending on the nature of your products , you can display images to showcase the use case . This can connect better with customers as they can picture using the product . You can learn more about product photography in this post . <h> Indochino cart recovery email : Takeaway <p> The cart recovery email is an important part of eCommerce email strategy . These emails can directly impact revenue as the emails are marketing to people who have already completed majority of their customer journey . These customers have added items to their carts and have left before completing checkout . The emails help nudge these customers to complete the transaction . <p> You can use plugins and services like Jilt for WooCommerce by SkyVerge to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to create , personalize , and manage cart recovery emails .

@@98138154 @2338154/ <h> Promoting Your eCommerce Store : AffiliateWP Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Promoting a new product or eCommerce store can be difficult , especially if you do n't  have an existing brand or reputation to piggy-back off of . So what are some proven ways you can promote your new product or store ? <p> Paid advertisements <p> Pay-per-click ads ( such as Google Ads ) <p> Sponsored reviews <p> Content marketing / blogging <p> Affiliate networks <p> Content marketing requires a large time investment , but can be lucrative , as your investment is your time , writing , and research . You can even hire this out to a writer on your staff or a for-hire blogger to drive search and social traffic to your blog , and in turn , to your products . <p> Paid advertisements and reviews can be really valuable , but are not as easy to use effectively as you may think . Rather than slapping up your advertisement on a site or simply sponsoring a review , you should be paying attention to the entire conversion funnel , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easy-to-read advertisement to bring customers to your site . Ideally , this is placed on a site your ideal customers would visit . You then want to ensure that customers land on a page that provides information , answers questions , and assuages fears about purchasing . Finally , you 'll want the checkout or signup process to be as smooth as possible with minimal friction ( i.e. , using guest checkout or social login , only getting the required information to accept payment , etc ) . <p> While these are all considerations you should already bear in mind , there are some alternatives . Affiliate marketing is one . <p> One major benefit to using affiliate marketing is that all of the marketing responsibility is no longer on you and your staff affiliate networks expand your marketing team . Creating an affiliate network is like hiring out marketing help on a commissions-only basis , as affiliates write about or recommend your product in exchange for a share of sales . <p> Another benefit is that the risk is shared advertising and marketing costs are shared with your affiliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on PPC ads or just in the form of their time while writing reviews ) . We wrote about this a bit when we discussed why affiliate marketing is a good option , but affiliates promote your product and are only paid when their sales convert . While you have to pay out part of every sale , these could be sales you never would have had in the first place , and they bring new customers right to your door . <p> As we 've said before , AffiliateWP is our favorite affiliate tool for WordPress sites , and we wanted to visit a lot of the new and exciting changes that have been made to the plugin recently . <h> AffiliateWP Review : Version 1.2 Released <p> Version 1.2 of AffiliateWP marks some very cool updates to the plugin , especially since I first wrote about it at release . It was a great , flexible plugin already , but there are some new features that I like a lot . The developer add-ons are also very helpful in letting you structure your affiliate network as you choose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core plugin in version 1.2 : <h> Per-product referral rate <p> This is an awesome change for me . Shop admins can set a default rate for affiliate commissions , but they can now be overridden on a per-product basis . This is great if you want to offer higher payouts on new products to encourage affiliates to promote new or featured products . Likewise , you can use this to lower the commission on products that have a lower margin for you . <h> Affiliate Assets <p> Previously , this was a bit annoying to negotiate as an affiliate , as all data was displayed at once . Now affiliates can use the tabs to select what theyd like to view . <p> Creatives for affiliates can now be included in the affiliate area , which are brand assets or stock advertisements that affiliates can use to promote your site or products . A new tab has been added to display these to affiliates and to automatically add the appropriate referral URL for the image : <p> Creatives Tab <p> Adding a creative is very simple from the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own reference , add the URL the asset should link to , as well as the alt text of the image . You can also add an image , though I 'd probably recommend serving the image from Amazon S3 or another storage service . Otherwise affiliates will probably serve the image from your site/servers , which may put a burden on your own hosting service . <p> Add Creative <p> You can also make creatives active or inactive , which is helpful for " sale " creatives to ensure that they are n't  available after a sale ends . <h> Improved Affiliate Management <p> Affiliate signup and review has been improved as well . You can still review all affiliates that are active or pending approval from the affiliates list : <p> Affiliate List <p> However , there are some new fields for review . When affiliates sign up , theyll be asked how they plan to promote your site along with the primary URL at which theyll be promoting you . As an admin , you can now review this information when approving affiliates to ensure that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Form <p> Review affiliates <p> Removing affiliates has also been addressed in this release , as you now have the option to delete the entire user account for an affiliate when you remove them from your shop . <p> Tiered affiliate rates allows you to set " breaks " for referral amounts . You can determine what will cause an increase in referral rates for example , you can provide higher rates for affiliates that have a certain number of referral sales , or you can increase rates based on the amount they sell in dollars . This incentivizes affiliates to continue to promote your products , as theyll earn more money for increasing their own conversions . <p> Recurring Referrals is also very cool . Using this add-on , you can reward affiliates for subscription payments in addition to one-time purchases . This is very handy for sites that sell subscriptions or memberships , and currently supports WooCommerce , EDD , Restrict Content Pro , Exchange , and Paid Memberships Pro ( more details on the product page ) . You can reward affiliates on each subsequent order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also excited to see the upcoming release of Stripe Payouts , which will allow you to easily send payments to affiliates bank accounts or debit cards via Stripe . <h> AffiliateWP Review : Conclusions <p> AffiliateWP is rapidly becoming one of the best affiliate programs for WordPress eCommerce stores . You can manage your entire store and affiliates right from your WordPress admin , and it supports both one-time purchases and renewing payments for affiliate commissions . The recent changes and add-on releases make affiliate management and the affiliate area even better . <p> As an affiliate , I 'd love to filter my statistics and visits per month ( in the same way that graphs can be filtered ) . As an admin , I cant wait for the Stripe Payouts and PayPal Adaptive Payments add-ons to be released to make paying affiliates in the network even simpler . Even without these features , I still really like using AffiliateWP as both an affiliate and as a store manager , and it makes a great addition to any WordPress stores marketing toolbelt . <p> Remember to check out our special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138156 @2338156/ <p> WP EasyCart is one of the newest eCommerce solutions available for WordPress , as it was launched about six months ago . One of the benefits to using this platform is that all functionality is included in the one-time purchase price , such as coupon management , tiered pricing , and live shipping integrations . Check out the rest of the feature list from WP EasyCart for more of what 's included . <p> This review covers the Pro version of the service . <p> Update : The 2.1 plugin update provides some great features that are not included in this review : <p> You can now build PayPal subscriptions for your products ( magazine subscriptions , etc ) . You can see all the details of the subscription , including active status , sign-up dates , last payment dates , number payments completed , and other customer information in your admin console . <p> Version 2.1 includes an additional shipping method that allows you now to build a rate table based on quantity of items in the shopping cart . <p> DHL is now included as a shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this option . <p> You can now enter a global handling fee , which will be added to whatever shipping rates you use . <p> There 's now a setting under the Advanced Options to enable catalog-only mode to allow browsing , but not purchases . <h> Base and Ancillary Costs <p> You can get the WP EasyCartfree plugin from the WordPress.org repository , which let 's you set up store options . However , you 'll also need to download a store Administration plugin to add or manage products or orders . This plugin is also free , but requires a sign-up to use the 14-day free trial or a license to use all features . The trial allows you to set up 5 products to take the platform for a test drive . If you find out that you like using WP EasyCart , then you can sign up for a $40 or $80 license ( Lite or Pro ) for the plugin . <p> License Options <p> Note that the Lite plugin has a product quantity limit and does not include some features . The Pro version or bundled plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions include three months of support with purchase . <p> There are also some bundles that include the full plugin plus a WordPress theme for WP EasyCart . I tested the platform with the default TwentyTwelve theme and it worked well , but did not test it with any other third-party themes . However , the built-in styling options will help the plugin to blend in with many themes , so I do n't  think theming will be an issue . <p> If you do want an official theme , the ones offered are reasonably priced at $40 and provide some great options . You can buy the standard plugin from WP EasyCart , a " themed " plugin , which styles the cart , catalog , and checkout pages , or the plugin with a complete WordPress theme . Pricing options are laid out here . <h> Cost summary : <p> Though a plugin is available on the WordPress repo , this plugin does not actually add any store functionality to your website and only handles setup , so you 'll need the companion plugin and a license . Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the plugin alone or plugin and theme . Most stores will be able to operate effectively with the basic functionality included in that pricing . <h> Overview and Usability <p> As stated previously , full installation on your WordPress site will require two plugins and a WP EasyCart signup , so its a bit more involved than using other WordPress plugins . Once plugins are installed and you navigation to Store Administration , you 'll be asked to sign up for a trial or to purchase a license to use the store admin plugin for WordPress : <p> Trial Registration <p> After starting the trial or registering , you 'll have full access to start playing with the plugin . Again , well be reviewing the Pro version , which includes all functionality . <p> One of the things I found really useful about WP EasyCart is the ability to handle store administration using a desktop or tablet application in addition to your WordPress dashboard , which are other administrative options . This can be really handy for stores that have a warehouse manager , who could update store information or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPad or tablet . <p> I did n't  play with separate applications for the sake of brevity , but this makes options for store management more expansive than other WordPress platforms since it can be managed directly from other apps rather than through the WordPress dashboard . Technically , you do n't  even need to use WordPress to manage your store , which is an interesting way of handling administration . <h> Setup <p> Once installation is complete , you 'll want to check out some setup and catalog options before creating products . The EasyCart Admin is not styled like WordPress , so frequent WordPress users will want to go through all settings and options to get a feel for how it works . Though pages are not created automatically , adding store pages is super-easy and does n't  even require leaving the settings menu , as clicking " Create Page " does this for you : <p> Setting up Store Pages <p> Basic settings will also help you adjust store layout , sorting and sharing options , and more . You can enable or disable guest checkout , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase . Under Store Setup you 'll also find the " colorize " options , which allow you to change buttons , etc. , to match your theme : <p> Color Options <p> More color options are located under Advanced Options , in addition to fonts and responsive size points to match your theme . <p> Following setup , you 'll want to check out your Store Admin and customize some of the options there before setting up the rest of your store . There are also more settings under Store Admin that I would view before moving on to other options . <p> Once all settings are taken care of , I 'd then go to the Rates section of the Store Admin to set up shipping rates , coupons , promotions , and taxes . <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options in WP EasyCart are flexible and will help international sellers , as duty or customs taxes can be added to international orders . VAT can also be enabled based on country if needed . Regional taxes can also be configured for your country so that several tax rates can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EasyCart will allow you to sell simple , variable / configurable , downloadable , and virtual products , which makes it an option for many retail stores . <p> Once all setup has been completed , you 'll probably want to start adding products . However , I 'd recommend setting up your catalog structure first , such as Manufacturers , as you 'll need to enter this information for all products ( which is one thing I dislike about the platform ) . For example , you cant leave the " Manufacturer " or SKU / model number blank for a product , so setting up structure prior to adding products will be a time-saver . <p> I added all Manufacturers and Categories for my products prior to setting up anything else in my catalog , which was fairly easy , as it simply requires name entry . However , some of you will also want to setup Option Sets for your products as well , which will require a bit more thought . <p> If you 're setting up simple products , such as stickers or mugs , then option sets may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex items , such as apparel , will make use of them , and they should be created prior to products if possible as well since they can not be created while creating or editing products . Combo option sets will display a drop-down , while Swatches will display " swatches " / icons to select . <p> Creating Option Sets <p> Once option sets are created , you can then add options , such as sizes or colors , to the set and will be able to manage inventory based on on these option sets . You can also have different options influence price or weight while creating the set . While this system would be great if you 're selling a lot of the same type of product , it may be a bit inflexible for store owners that sell unique products . For example , if different tee shirts come in different colors , then you 'll need to create separate option sets for each of these shirts if you only want the appropriate swatches to be displayed . <p> Product editing lacks bulk editing options for inventory adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to have as much structure as possible before creating and editing products . Now that the setup is done , product editing is fairly simple . Simply fill out all product information ( you cant leave anything blank , which is why I did all setup first ) and insert the product into your catalog : <p> Product Creation <p> The price you 've set will always be displayed . If you want this to become a " sale " price , you 'll have to set an original price to be crossed-out under advanced pricing options . <p> There are some other advanced options , such as allowing customer reviews , creating donation products , creating handling fees , setting B2B or wholesaler pricing , or setting tiered pricing based on quantity . You can set these if needed , or set cross-sells under " Featured Items " for your products . The available options for customizing pricing are pretty extensive , especially since they 're included in the core plugin . <p> After the product has been inserted , you can apply option sets , change inventory tracking based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each option set . <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> WP EasyCart includes some great widgets and several shortcodes to use throughout your store , which gives you the opportunity to display your products in multiple ways . My favorite widget is the " Specials " widget , which let 's you display specials , such as shipping promos , to customers . <p> Built-in Widgets <p> An easy-to-use shortcode library is also included , and can be opened in the visual editor while creating or editing posts and pages . <p> Inserting Shortcodes on Pages / Posts <h> Order Management <p> One area in need of growth for WP EasyCart is order management . There are no bulk options for order management , which means you have to edit each order individually to update order statuses . Administrators are also unable to edit orders to update customer information or create orders . Order management does include the ability to add tracking information to send to the customer , which is a plus , but lacks update notes on what has been done or sent . <p> This introduces one problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stores processing hundreds or thousands of orders if statuses can not be updated in bulk . Since the Store Admin panel is a flash integration that checks in with the WP EasyCart licensing system , its a tad sluggish to begin with . Manually editing every single order introduces a big time suck into the store workflow . <h> Customer Experience <p> Frontend navigation is easy , clean , and responsive , and was one of platform highlights for me . The store looks modern to customers ( no circa-1995 styling or buttons ) and is easy-to-use . <p> Products can be displayed in a grid or list format on the frontend . I prefer a grid layout for stores with more than just a few products , as browsing is very easy and customers can view multiple products , product ratings , and change variable product colors ( using swatches ) at the same time . The only thing I would have liked to see would be the option to add items to the cart from the product catalog for simple products ( no option sets ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for customers that know exactly what they want . <p> WP EasyCart Catalog <p> The product catalog can also be sorted , and the sorting options can be changed under EasyCart Admin &gt; Store Setup &gt; Basic Settings . <p> Catalog Sorting Options <p> WP EasyCarts grid layout is responsive ( another plus with theming ) and provides a " Quick View " option that opens in a lightbox so that customers can view product details easily without leaving the catalog . <p> Product Quick View <p> If customers view more information about a product , theyll see all product images and can hover / cloud zoom over main product images ( which is a built-in feature ) . Any option sets included for that product are also displayed . This product includes a basic combo option set : <p> Product Page <p> Product pages can also display basic swatch option sets to allow users to choose which variation of a product they want to purchase by clicking the appropriate swatch . <p> Product with Options / Swatches <p> You 'll also notice that all product pages can contain social sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some marketing for you . You can choose which buttons to display under EasyCart Admin &gt; Store Setup &gt; Basic Settings . <p> Cart pages allow customers to remove products or update quantities before checking out , or proceed to the checkout page . WP EasyCart uses a multi-page checkout process ( three pages total ) , which may introduce points at which the customer can desert the shopping cart . Customers enter their information , select shipping , then confirm charges . <p> Last Checkout Page <h> Built-in Payment and Shipping Options <p> WP EasyCart includes tons of payment and shipping options in the core plugin , and all are available with the purchase of the Pro version of the plugin . The Pro version also includes promotions for payments and shipping , as well as store coupons . <p> Promotions are interesting and flexible , and allow you to set systems such as free shipping for a set order value . Theyll also allow you to create clearance sales on groups of products , such as seasonal products , which is great functionality to have . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options for set up . They can also be limited to manufacturers or certain products , but have no included usage limits ( i.e. , can only be used one-time , five times , for a certain customer , etc ) . <p> Adding Coupons <h> Payment Options <p> The list of built-in payment processing options for WP EasyCart is pretty extensive . Using the Pro version of the plugin , several integrations are included , such as First Data , Authorize.net , SagePay , PayPal , and Braintree . However , it is missing our favorite Stripe which we hope is on the roadmap , but still offers great options . <p> Third-Party Payment Integrations <p> Payment Gateway Integrations <h> Shipping Options <p> WP EasyCart offers several shipping options in the Pro plugin . Price Trigger systems allow you to set up tables for shipping based on order total . For example , you could set shipping rates for orders from $0 to $15 , $15 to $50 , and set free shipping for orders over $50 ( you could also create a free shipping promotion to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but based on total order weight rather than cost ( basically , a table-rate method ) . Static shipping methods are like flat-rate systems ; you can set store pickup , ground , air , and overnight rates , or use flat rates for FedEx , UPS , etc . <p> Shipping Systems <p> WP EasyCart also includes Live Shipping Integrations . If you ship using FedEx , UPS , USPS , or Australia Post , you can enter you account information and get calculated rates for your customers rather than store-determined rates . However , use this with caution , as some customers do n't  know the real cost of shipping . <p> Live Shipping : UPS <p> The first three shipping methods allow you to set an amount that can optionally be added to the order if the customer would like expedited shipping , and products also have the option to set a handling rate that can be added if needed as well . <h> Reporting and Inventory Management <p> Very basic reporting is included in the WP EasyCart dashboard . You can view total sales for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year : <p> Dashboard : Reporting <h> Inventory <p> Inventory management is possible with WP EasyCart , but is named " Quantity " , and Tracking Quantity options are provided . Backorders are not possible for out-of-stock products , but inventory can be tracked for product options / variations , and not just the parent product . You can also view quantities from the product list , though no low-stock notifications are included , nor the possibility to bulk-update quantities . <h> Support <p> Support is included with the purchase of the Pro version of the plugin for three months after purchase . Support tickets can be sent via email . I did n't  have an opportunity to use the support desk , but some of the WordPress.org Reviews mention good experiences with it . All users have access to community forums and plugin documentation . I did use the documentation a couple of times , and found it helpful for the issues I experienced . <p> While you can set up store options using the WP EasyCart plugin , the Administration plugin from WP EasyCart is what handles product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found this a bit misleading while checking the plugin out on WordPress.org , as the copy seems to indicate that the plugin will add the eCommerce functionality to your site rather than integrate with the store admin plugin . Regardless , installing two separate plugins just to use one platform could also be off-putting for some users , and provides one more hurdle to setup . <p> However , there is an upside to using two plugins , as it does allow the platform to be used on other CMSs ( such as Drupal or Joomla ) and allows for the extension of the store admin in tablet or desktop apps so you can manage your store without logging in to your WordPress admin . It does create a more involved setup process , but the goods news is that you probably wo n't have to install anything else ( extensions , add-ons , etc ) . I simply would have appreciated more clarity while reading about it on WordPress.org . <h> WP EasyCart Review Wrap-up <p> WP EasyCart has solid foundations for such a new platform , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as payment and shipping integrations , is included in the purchase price of the plugin , which makes it a strong contender for retail stores and a low-cost option at $40-120 ( I would just go with the Pro version rather than mess around with the Lite version for the nominal price difference ) . <p> However , the lack of easy / bulk management for product and orders limits the scalability of WP EasyCart at the moment and may eliminate it for stores with large product catalogs or those that process thousands of orders per week . There 's also no options ( currently ) for recurring billing or membership capabilities , which will eliminate WP EasyCart for some business models ( though simple PayPal recurring billing is coming very soon , so stay tuned ! ) . In addition , there are very few pre-made options for extensibility or customization at the moment since its such a new platform , though again , a lot of features are built-in . <p> Ill be curious to see the growth of this plugin , as it does a good job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disjointed and difficutl at first , but following the steps I laid out for product creation made the it far smoother . The scalability will be one issue that I 'm sure will be addressed moving forward , but aside from that , I think developers will like using this for clients , as they can give them basic instructions and clients will be able to use the store administration panel with minimal issues , and the platform is constantly growing and being updated . <p> Have questions about the plugin or some functionality we did n't  address ?

As for usage limitations ( i.e. , limit to a customer ) , that 's not currently possible with WP EasyCart . <p> Just a quick update from us here at WP EasyCart and this article follow-up .

@@98138157 @2338157/ <h> Product announcement email : What was good about the email ? <p> Product announcement email top half <h> 1 . Big images <p> The first thing that we notice about the email are the large product images . Since the point of the email is to introduce customers to the new line of shoes , the large images make the shoes the focus of the email . The images are not standard product images with a white background , but showcase two different colors with an appropriate background . This creates more interest in the images and grabs the readers attention . <h> 2 . Clear call to action <p> The " Shop New Styles " call to action is featured prominently on the images . This keeps the experience very simple as customers know exactly what to click and where to go next . <p> The call to action button visually stands out from the image , while keeping with the style of the brand . A clear call to action like this will help you drive more traffic to the product page on your site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Layout and navigation <p> The layout of the email works really with brand colors , a logo at the top , large headlines and labels , and different sections in the email . The top navigation mimics that of the store website . This makes the experience consistent between the email and the website . This also helps people navigate more easily as they get more familiar with how the navigation is structured . <p> The headlines above the images give a succinct description and attributes of the new sneakers . The " dress sneakers " describes the product positioning , and the attributes outline what customers can expect from the new line of sneakers . <p> In the bottom half of the email , the store policy on shipping and returns is highlighted . Many stores choose to highlight this at the top of their website and emails . However , since free shipping and returns have the limitation of being available only on domestic orders , highlighting it at the bottom of the email works better . <p> Product announcement email by Allen Edmonds bottom half <p> Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and links to Allen Edmonds social profiles for customers to get in touch and learn more about the brand in different ways . <h> Product announcement email : What was bad about the email ? <h> 1 . Lack of personalization <p> The email is not personalized for the customer or around the content at all . The email is not addressed to anybody , and is not signed by a person . This makes the email seem impersonal and part of a bulk process . Even though almost all emails are managed en masse , adding names can humanize them . <p> When you send your product announcement email , you can address it to the customers name . You can also have somebody appropriate sign the email like the founder , or the person in charge of product development . <p> If possible , you can also add content relevant to the customers previous purchases . For example , you can include something along the lines of , " Hi Harvey , we hope you 're happy with the X shoes you 've purchased from us in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wanted to share the news with you " <p> This helps people feel like the email was specifically geared towards them , and creates a better customer experience . <h> 2 . Content <p> The content between the two images is not very interesting , and easy to gloss over since it is one blob of text . You can narrow down the content you put in the email , and break it down into bullet points , or separate paragraphs to make it easier to skim . <p> You can also bold the text for things you want to emphasize within the content . <h> Product announcement email : What got us to click ? <p> The strongest part of the email are the large professionally-done images , and the clear call to action buttons . The images do a good job of visually providing an idea of what the sneakers look like . And we know exactly where to click and what to do next with the buttons . <h> Product announcement email : Takeaway <p> In this email case study , we broke down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mostly good things working for it . This included large images of the new product and a clear call to action . Another good thing was the fact that the email layout and navigation mimicked that of the online store website . The layout was simple and the focus on images helped the email accomplish what it was supposed to getting us to check out the new shoes . <p> There were only a couple things that did n't  work for the email . First was the lack of personalization where neither the customer name was mentioned , nor was there a personalized signature for the email . The second issue was the copy included between the images which did n't  grab attention in its paragraph form . <p> All in all , this is a good template for new product emails . Is there something you do differently in your product announcement email ? Please tell us in the comments below . 
@@98138158 @2338158/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> A big pain point for many of our readers has been finding great WooCommerce themes . As WooCommerce is a difficult plugin to theme correctly , a lot of themes out there improperly support the plugin . As we mentioned in our roundup of 5 Awesome Free WooCommerce Themes , some themes also claim to fully support WooCommerce , but use default WooCommerce styles that tend to look out of place with the rest of the theme . <p> While we do have a page full of recommended themes , plugins , and services , we 've decided to start compiling a series of posts on the quality themes we 've used for WooCommerce ( and plan to write about other eCommerce plugins soon ! ) . Our goal is to have a full resource of themes that leverage great design and tight WooCommerce integration . Well keep all of our recommendations together in this series and start with a selection 4 of the best WooCommerce themes here . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes from Elegant Themes , and features full WooCommerce support , as well as a Page Builder that allows you to drag-and-drop sections to easily create pages . Joining the Elegant Themes club for $69 will give you access to Divi and 86 other themes . <p> Installing Divi will provide a couple of setup options . You can customize colors and select from a few fonts using the theme customizer ( Appearance &gt; Customize ) , then configure the rest of setup from the new theme options menu under Appearance . For example , you can change the Number of Posts displayed on Archive pages setting to 15 to show 15 products on the Shop page rather than the typical 10 . <h> Pros <p> Divi is very easy to use , and the frontend looks great . Product images are showcased and WooCommerce styles blend in with the rest of the theme . <p> The Page Builder makes it easy to create really cool pages I was able to understand all of the options available by loading a sample template and reading through some of the documentation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full width or have columns , and add modules ( sliders , featured products , etc ) to each section . You can even add your own CSS classes and IDs to easily customize these sections . <p> I really loved that I could use the Shop module for WooCommerce products , and display shop details such as featured , sale , or recent products on any Page Builder page of my choice . I was using this for my homepage , but you could use this to easily create great shop landing pages . <p> There are tons of other modules , such as pricing tables , percent bar counters , and other options that can help you create with no code ( or minimal amounts of your choosing ) . While I usually do n't  like when themes have tons of options built in , Divi adds options while maintaining a quality code base and without overriding all of the WooCommerce templates . <h> Cons <p> Divi can be overkill if you do n't  plan on leveraging the page builder or other shortcodes to build landing pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , this is n't it . <p> If you 've never used a Page Builder , you may need to play around with it a bit to get the hang of what each option does . I also did n't  like that SEO options are included with the theme when its far better to use a plugin like WordPress SEO for this , but you can disable these settings . Finally , I did n't  like that a link to Elegant Themes was hard-coded into the footer . You can change this into a copyright notice in the themes footer.php by replacing this : <h> Overall <p> The Page Builder options are great , and I liked how easy it was to create home pages or landing pages with shortcodes / Page Builder modules rather than creating widgetized pages . WooCommerce support is well done , theme structure is good , and the shop pages look great . Pricing is lower than I 'd expect at $69 and I was able to set up my test site within 30 minutes . <h> Salient ThemeNectar <p> Salient is a $55 multipurpose WooCommerce theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home pages and landing pages in the same way that youd build them with the Divi page builder , and full WooCommerce support produces great shop and product pages . <p> Settings are created under a new " Salient " menu . While there are a lot to go through , you do have a lot of control over layout , colors , number of widget areas , and social button options . All settings are centralized within this menu rather than using the theme customizer . One setting I would recommend disabling is the smooth scroll try it yourself , but I really hate it when I 'm visiting sites with something similar enabled . <h> Pros <p> Salient has a really clean layout that makes your images pop . The shop and product pages show off your products will keeping the WooCommerce styles in line with the rest of the flat theme . <p> The visual composer makes building homepages and landing pages quick and easy , as you add rows and elements to each row . You can enable a full width or column layout for each row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reuse . <p> There are tons of elements to choose from for each section : <p> Widget areas also respond to the content being viewed : you can set widgets for the blog sidebar , pages , and shop sidebars to make sure that customers see only whats relevant to the content they 're currently viewing . <h> Cons <p> I loved the page builder , but it does n't  include any shop elements by default . You can get around this by inserting a text element and using the WooCommerce shortcodes , such as the featured products shortcode : featuredproducts perpage= " 4 " columns= " 4 " orderby= " date " order= " desc " to display your shop elements . <p> Salient also has the same con as Divi this is n't a minimal theme , and if you do n't  plan on using the page builder for home pages , landing pages , etc , you 'll have a lot of unnecessary code . <p> Finally , I did like using the page builder , but I had to tweak my typography settings and added some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , as the builder elements do n't  resize themselves based on the column widths . This was n't a big deal for me , but something to keep in mind while you 're being wowed by the demo = . I do n't  think you 'd necessarily need to know any CSS to get the job done , but it adds that last bit of polish . <h> Overall <p> Salient is another easy to use , flat , beautiful WooCommerce theme . While I could have done with out the " Portfolio " custom post type it adds , I appreciated the full-featured integration with WooCommerce , good structure despite what I 'd consider more options than needed , and the easy-to-use visual page builder . At $55 , Salient was worth it for me for a bold , flat site that I set up within about 40 minutes . <h> Total WP Explorer <p> Out of all of the themes in this list , Total probably has the best structure and codebase . I do n't  like that it bundles a couple of plugins for sliders , but to be fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $55 , you 'll have a theme ready to integrate with WooCommerce that also features a page builder and several customization options . <p> The theme customizer will allow you to tweak the theme colors for Total , but these options are also included under the new Theme Options menu . There are several choices for typography , enabling or disabling custom post types , and WooCommerce settings , so this menu is a bit sluggish to use . <h> Pros <p> Total features a page builder very similar to Salient users can add rows and elements to customize any page on their site , which is useful for the same pages ( homepages , landing pages , etc ) . You can enable full width rows , or break rows into columns and add elements of your choosing . <p> As for WooCommerce styles , Total does a great job of fully integrating the theme and WooCommerce . Images look great , and for products with more than one image , the next image in the gallery will be displayed if a user hovers on the featured image . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend right in . I was n't crazy about the dropdown styling , but its very easy to correct with a tiny bit of CSS to match the quantity + / boxes . <p> Several widget areas that respond to the content being viewed are also included . I 've chosen to keep the " Testimonials " custom post type activated , so you 'll notice that I can customize the sidebar shown for that post type in addition to the others on my site . <h> Cons <p> Total suffers the same downsides as the other themes listed : lots of options . Again , this may be a positive for you , but its unlikely that you 'll need all of the options that are integrated ( especially the custom post types , which I disabled for the most part ) . For my own themes , I usually prefer a more minimal approach and only add what 's needed . <p> Catching on to all of the possible options and slider integrations also took a bit of effort , so there 's a slightly higher learning curve with Total . I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but had to put some time into figuring out how the pieces of the theme fit together . SEO settings are included with this one as well and are unnecessary , as this should be handled by a plugin . <p> Two different sliders are also bundled with the theme , which could confuse some people , and required me to test each one to see which was better for what I was trying to achieve ( though I 'd recommend against using sliders anyway ) . <h> Overall <p> While Total takes some time to learn , its a quality-coded theme with several options for customization ( though this is a double-edged sword ) . For $55 , Total is very reasonably priced and provides a tight WooCommerce integration with a lot of possibilities . <h> Store Obox Themes <p> Store is really flexible in terms of setup options , as it has a quick-start homepage setup you can use , or a full widgetized layout . You can completely customize the way your homepage looks , and leverage the " Widgetized Page " template to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing pages ) . At $79 for the theme plus one year of support or $139 to upgrade to two years of priority support , Store is another affordable WooCommerce theme . <p> All color options are available by using the theme customizer , and setup options are available within the newly created " Theme Options " menu . <h> Pros <p> Using Obox themes , you have fine-grained control over a lot of aspects of your store , such as typography , advertisements , and layout options . You have a few choices for homepage layouts , including a quick setup or a widgetized homepage , and widgets are color-coded to help you determine the best location for each . <p> Widgetized pages are very handy for landing pages or pages that will leverage the custom post types , such as testimonials or team members . You can adjust the number of columns while editing the page , or use the " Widgetized Page " template to create widget sections : <p> WooCommerce styles are consistent with the rest of the theme and product pages feature a clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store options available , so setting up Store takes a decent chunk of time . My setup time was longer than usual for my sample shop , as it took me some time to learn what each widget and layout option did . <p> Several different custom post types are added by the theme , such as " Partners " and a " Portfolios " type . While I did like using some of these , such as the " Testimonials " and " Team " post types , I would have liked to either enable each of these manually , or see them as a companion plugin to the theme so that unneeded code is n't hanging around , nor are these added to the main menu . This would also ensure that users can take this information with them if they change themes . <p> As for code quality , best practices are not always followed , so this may cause issues . For example , there are direct SQL queries in some places where they should n't be , which may cause conflicts with plugins . <h> Overall <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typography and layouts , but may take you a bit of time to setup and learn to use . If you want to have options for team members , portfolio items , company features , and services , then you 'll like that they 're all integrated into this theme ( though keep in mind that you wont be able to take them with you if you switch ! ) . <p> I liked the ability to create several widgetized pages , which is helpful for creating home pages and landing pages . However , if you need to integrate with plugins other than WooCommerce or its extensions , then it may not be the best choice for you as conflicts may result . <h> Conclusions <p> Well be recommending more themes these are n't  the only good ones we 've found ! Well post 4-5 at a time , as we need time to test the theme and glance through the codebase to make sure its something that we want to recommend to our readers . Weve created a category for eCommerce themes so its easy to find all of our recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance you could look for a couple built on the Genesis Framework ? I 've used ClipCart from Themedy for one project , but I have n't been blown away by it . The included slider was pretty reliant on HTML knowledge , which is not ideal to hand over to a client . <p> Hi Dom , we do n't  do as much with the Genesis Framework ourselves , but I 'm sure well tackle it at some point . I know Yoasts themes are Genesis child themes , but I do n't  think they support WooCommerce out of the box . Web Savvy Marketing has WooCommerce-ready themes , so that 's probably a great resource to check out have heard good things about them . <p> Thanks for the comment ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138159 @2338159/ <h> Create a purchasing club with iThemes Exchange <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> While many membership plugins focus on only restricting content ( like Restrict Content Pro , which we recently reviewed ) , some sites will sell products aside from memberships , and can even require memberships to access products or discounts in the shop . <p> These eCommerce sites operate similarly to Costco or Sams club . To create a purchasing club , you 'll need the ability to both sell access to the club and to restrict how products can be purchased from your shop . This article will show you how to create a purchasing club using iThemes Exchange and a premium add-on . <h> iThemes Exchange Purchasing Club : Overview <p> The ability to restrict product purchasing to members was added to Exchange Memberships in July . This allows you to display products to non-members , but require a membership to purchase , which is how well create our purchasing club . You can use your memberships to restrict any content in your shop , such as pages and blog posts , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club for as little as $97 here are the plugins I 'll be using in my demo : <h> iThemes Exchange Purchasing Club : Setup <p> The central piece of our purchasing club puzzle will be the Memberships Add-on . This will handle selling the memberships as well as restricting our content and products . Once this plugin is installed and activated , it can be configured under Exchange &gt; Add-ons and by clicking the " configure " button . <p> Membership Settings <p> Here you 'll do some very basic setup create messages to display to non-members or members who do not yet have access to your content . Bonus points if you direct them towards purchasing in these messages . I use a product category for memberships that I can link to in this message . <p> Create messages <p> Once your basic membership settings are configured , you 'll then create some products . My purchasing club will be part of a book club membership , so I 'll create some books . I 'm going to sell them to members at a steep discount so they can purchase them as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be selling to members at my discounted price . <p> Create Products <p> Once these products have been created , we can move onto creating our membership and restricting products to members-only purchases . <h> iThemes Exchange Purchasing Club : Create Memberships <p> Now that we have our Exchange Membership settings configured and our products added , well create our membership products and restrict some content through them . To do so , you 'll need to add a new membership product ( not a simple or physical product ) . By adding a membership product type , you 'll be able to assign content restriction rules that apply when its purchased . <p> First , add your pricing and description . I 'm going to add some more description details that only members will see , but I 'll tell you more about that when I talk about restricting content . You 'll also want to add your pricing and determine whether this membership uses recurring pricing or will only be valid for a set length ( i.e. , one year ) . <p> Once the basic information has been entered , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict pages , posts , post categories , and most importantly : products . You can even delay access to these products so book club members cant buy everything at once . <p> Create Memberships <p> This product is what non-members will have to purchase to access any membership content and purchase members-only products . It will be displayed in your shop alongside of all other products , and purchases will trigger an active membership for a customer once the order is paid . <p> Purchase membership <p> Now this is where our purchasing club takes form . Once a product has been restricted to a membership , it can no longer be purchased by a non-member . Non-members wont see " Buy Now " or " Add to Cart " buttons , and will instead see your restriction message ( which we created in setup ) . I 've also included a notice in the products extended description on specific memberships that will grant access and what else they provide . <p> Non-member view <p> If a member views your product , he or she will be able to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra content to the short description for members so they can read more about the book . <p> Member View <p> This forms the bulk of your purchasing club , and can be set up in as little as 22 minutes ( unless you 're faster than me of course = ) . This will obviously increase if you 're selling lots of products or memberships , but setup is very simple , and as long as you create all products before memberships , you wont have to backtrack to your memberships to add new products to the club . <p> With that said , we can take our purchasing club a bit further to polish it up and cross the finish line . <h> iThemes Exchange Purchasing Club : Restrict Content <p> You can restrict other content ( such as blog posts or pages ) as part of this membership aside from product restrictions . This can be really helpful if you 'd like to display a " discounts " page for members or to include members-only blog posts and content . <p> You can restrict these pages and posts while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards while editing or adding a post . A new meta box will be created that let 's you restrict your content and optionally add a dripping / delayed release schedule . <p> Restrict Pages &amp; Posts <p> Blocks of content within posts or pages ( such as members-only videos ) can be restricted as well using a shortcode : <p> This is what I used to show an extended product description to members above . You can manually add these shortcodes by inserting the post i 'd of the correct memberships , but I hate looking up the i 'd while I 'm trying to write something . Thankfully there 's a " Member Content " button that will let you select the right membership and generate the shortcode for you to restrict this content . <p> Member Shortcodes <h> iThemes Exchange Purchasing Club : Take it Further <p> There are also a couple of ways you can take your purchasing club further . First , we mentioned the bbPress add-on that 's in the Exchange Pro Pack . When this is coupled with bbPress , you can create members-only forums to supplement your purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create forums for my members to discuss each book that ca n't be accessed by non-members . <p> This plugin will allow you to also gift products to members by making them free if a certain membership exists . <p> Member gifts <p> Membership Product Restrictions is also very helpful if you want to allow non-members to purchase your products , but want membership to receive a discount . You can add a non-member fee to a product instead ( without restricting it to members-only ) . <p> Add Non-member fees <p> Members will see your discounted price ( the product price ) , but non-members will be charged the price plus the non-member fee . <p> Non-member fee <p> This is a really useful plugin for adjusting your purchasing club rules . While it does n't  let you gift products to multiple memberships ( and will also charge non-member fees to all but one membership ) , its a great little addition to your membership setup for free . <p> Note that the restricting functionality is n't needed , as the Memberships add-on now handles this itself . <h> iThemes Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iThemes Exchange was simple , and setup can be done in less than a half hour if you 've already got an Exchange store set up . This allows you to create your own eCommerce Sams club or Costco , as purchasing certain products is restricted to members . You can also delay access to some products as part of the membership , which requires members to wait a certain time before purchasing . <p> My favorite part about this is how easy it is to create restriction rules for your memberships : add a product rule , select the right product , and optionally set an access delay . If you 've got your members-only products already created , its even easier . <p> An Exchange purchasing club can be set up for as little as $97 , but I 'd recommend getting the Pro Pack instead at $197 , which includes all official Exchange add-ons . Again , here are the plugins I used or referenced in this guide : 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138160 @2338160/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> Some readers have asked for theme recommendations , so here are some of our favorite free themes for WooCommerce and they actually support WooCommerce . <p> Picking a great WooCommerce theme is really difficult , as many free WooCommerce themes do the bare minimum to render WooCommerce correctly and then use the default WooCommerce styles ( we find this with almost every theme that " fully supports WooCommerce " in the WordPress.org repo ) . This frequently leaves your shop with a style that does n't  fit in with the rest of your theme , and can make your site look like a hack job . <p> Many sites recommend themes that do n't  include any WooCommerce styles ( were guessing because they do n't  actually test the shop styles ) . The themes we 've selected below have actually been tested by us and do a great job of making sure that your WooCommerce stores styles fit with the rest of your theme to give your entire site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free WooCommerce theme that we missed ? Let us know in the comments ! <h> Mystile WooThemes <p> Mystile is developed by WooThemes . While its an older WooCommerce theme , Mystile is actively updated to support the latest version of WooCommerce and is responsive for mobile devices . The homepage is widgetized so that you can easily customize it , and Mystile uses the WooThemes framework that paid themes use as well . <h> Virtue Lite Kadence Themes <p> Virtue Lite is from Kadence Themes . Its a responsive theme with a flat design and clean layout . It also includes portfolio pages and posts to showcase work or to provide information about your business . Virtue is one of the most highly rated free WooCommerce themes on WordPress.org , and it does a great job of showcasing images for your portfolio or products . <h> Highwind James Koster <p> Highwind is developed by James Koster , one of the core WooCommerce contributors . Its a very lightweight theme and though its responsive , is n't designed to have tons of bells and whistles ( do n't  go looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that helps tremendously with performance and stability . Highwind plays nicely with many plugins ( including plugins from WooThemes ) and is developer-friendly , so you can customize or extend it as needed . Its great for sites that focus on content but also have small stores . <p> I 'd like to give you our complete list of the best WooCommerce resources as a thank-you for reading . I 've put together a list of my top themes , plugins , authors , and go-to sites . You can download it for free &amp; join our VIP section : <h> Fruitful Fruitful Code <p> Fruitful is a simple , minimal theme from Fruitful Code . It has both responsive and static layout options under a Theme Options menu . The homepage is n't widgetized ( there are no included page templates ) , but there are shortcodes included for customizations to your pages ( along with a shortcode reference that includes images / samples for each shortcode ) . The handy thing about using shortcodes rather than a homepage template with widgets is that you can then use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for putting the focus on content or images throughout the site . <h> Panthea YIThemes <p> Panthea is developed by Your Inspiration Themes . Its a responsive theme with a flat design that 's focused on selling . There are available spaces for banners and store notices , and the " megamenu " allows you to set images in your menu dropdown for categories , which helps make this a really useful theme for retail shops . <p> As a word of caution , I do n't  think this theme has been updated for WooCommerce 2.1 yet , as it looks like they may be completely overriding the " Shop " page template . I was able to fix the issues on the shop page pretty easily with a bit of CSS , but this may not be a theme that 's ready " out-of-the-box " at the moment . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 23 Comments <p> Hi Jose , thanks for stopping by ! This comment gave me the impression that it was being updated as I was n't able to find any updates via Twitter . Hopefully its still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for this post . There are so many " best free woocommerce themes " posts on the net , but very few of them are from people whove actually done the research ! Nice to find someone who has actually put some thought into it . <p> Hi Joseph ! As far as free themes go , Virtue Lite and Mystile ( mentioned above ) both do a good job of showcasing images , which I 'd imagine would be important to that kind of site . There are n't  many free ones that support WooCommerce well unfortunately . <p> As for paid themes that show off images , here are some I like &amp; are well done : <p> If you 're considering paid-for themes , you might like to look at ENVY too ( released a couple of weeks ago ) . I designed it for the Genesis framework and like Highwind , its very simple and light on the bells and whistles . Simple for the novice to populate and equally good for the developer who wants to create their own stamp ! <p> I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YIThemes . Could you please guide me on that . I do n't  know css or any other coding . I am a beginner to web designing . I want to build an e commerce web site . The Panthea site was awesome . So i want to build my website using that themes . Would you help me please ? <p> Hey there , I 'll add this to my idea board for a full article / tutorial , as it takes several steps ( which will take some time to explain if you 've never done this ) . In the mean time , there is a pro version you could look at ( which should be updated ) , or could ask YIThemes if they 've updated the free version for WC 2.1+ . <p> If you go for a pro version of their themes , you get pretty good support by their developers . Probably they will provide you with any required CSS fix or so . <p> I also think of using panthea as replacement for the currently used theme ( mayashop ) , since I really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ajax live search , ajax product filters . <p> Hey Andy , I would n't recommend it . It bundles tons of templates , and some way out of date back to WooCommerce version 1.6.4 . You get display quirks like this : https : **26;1560;TOOLONG and its far more likely to break with updates , be incompatible with extensions or payment gateway , etc . <p> I am searching for an eCommerce wp theme that will support drop-ship . Any ideas ? <p> Thank you for your time and work with this article . Is fantastic . I am thinking I may use one of the above and just have pics as placeholders for any clickbank affiliate products I am promoting ( click &amp; it takes them to the clickbank offer ) , for now on my other dot com . . . . . and figure out drop-ship site if you have time to get back to this question . <p> If you 're listing affiliate products , you might also find this plugin useful ( let 's you add &gt; 1 link for each product ) ; if you 're only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product type is probably fine . <p> I need the shipping wording to say delivery instead as I delivery goods to my clients and shipping can cause confusion in the way my customers will expect their orders . Is there a way I can change the word " Shipping " to " Delivery " from the codes , or use a plugin ? 
@@98138161 @2338161/ <p> This series covers creating membership sites using plugins or eCommerce Platforms . <h> Overview <p> WooCommerce is one of the most popular eCommerce plugins for WordPress ( see our full review ) , so its no surprise that many users want to use WooCommerce to sell memberships or subscription products in addition to existing inventory . The bonus to setting up a membership site with WooCommerce is the flexibility to sell other products , such as complementary products or tools , as well as the advantage of several marketing extensions already available for WooCommerce . However , setting up a membership site using WooCommerce will require a few plugins and may be overkill for some simple membership sites . This is more for those of you looking for a solution that supports selling more than just memberships and can scale with your store and site . <p> We 've got an updated review of using WooCommerce for membership sites as well . <p> To set up your membership site , you 'll need some plugins to handle the membership setup , and another to handle recurring billing . You 'll want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then want the WooCommerce Groups extension for $79 that allows you to sell these groups as products . To handle recurring billing , you 'll want the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension for $199 , which brings the total set up costs to $278 for the first year . Renewal fees for support and updates will be around $139 per year after the first year . <p> So what do you need to know to set up your membership site ? We 'll go through the process of setting up a membership site using WooCommerce and what it addresses on our membership site checklist . <h> Creating Memberships <p> Memberships are created using the Groups plugin and its WooCommerce integration , and content restriction is achieved by using these plugins as well . Since Groups is n't a true membership solution , this part of the setup is n't exactly intuitive . You can follow along with the Groups documentation for help with the process . <p> The first thing you 'll need to do is create " groups " for your memberships . Since each membership will be created as a product that uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of membership products , and customers can purchase multiple memberships to support content-based membership sites . Groups can be created in a couple of ways . First , from the Groups menu , you can create a " capability " that groups will be able to use . I named my capability after the membership levels I used ( basic , silver , and gold ) . <p> Adding Capabilities to Groups <p> Once you 've added the capability ( which is essentially a restriction level for the posts , pages , or products you 're selling ) , you can add that capability to a group : <p> Adding capabilities to groups <p> If you 're already working on a post or page , you can select the capability required for access to the content from the " Access Restrictions " box . If you need to add a new group or capability , you can do so from this box as well : <p> WooCommerce Groups Access Restrictions <p> Setup is a bit time intensive , but does allow you to complete customize membership access , and will also allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product for a post with its own restriction capabilities . Another benefit to using Groups is the ability to integrate discounts with the extremely flexible WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing extension . This allows you to provide bulk discounts as well as membership level discounts ( in addition to other discounts and quantity-based pricing rules ) , so membership can allow customers a discount level for your store . <h> Content Restriction <p> Content restriction is possible using the capabilities of each group . You can set a capability required for read access to posts , pages , and custom post types from the WP editor . Any group that has this capability will be able to read the content . For example , if both " silver " and " gold " memberships have " silver " capability , then when the capability for read access is set to " silver " , members who have purchased either membership will be able to read it . <p> For each page , post , or custom post type you 'd like to restrict , you 'll have to set the access restrictions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you ca n't set restrictions for post categories or tags to expedite the process . You 'll also have to link your subscription products to the corresponding groups / restriction rules when you set them up to ensure that customers are placed in the correct group upon purchase : <p> Linking Subscriptions to Groups <p> Groups does not provide for other membership capabilities aside from content restriction , so depending on your model , this setup may not work for you . If you need to drip content , for example , you 'll need to find a different solution ( I 'd check out our list of general WordPress membership plugins ) . Groups also has no way of restricting login information to prevent sharing membership credentials . <h> Recurring / Subscription Billing <p> The recurring billing side of the equation is handled by the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension . This is beneficial for those of you who are just selling subscriptions to physical products , such as magazines or subscription boxes , as you wo n't need the Groups plugin or corresponding WooCommerce extension . Subscriptions supports sign-up fees , free trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own discounts . For example , if a coupon code is used for a subscription , that coupon is applied to the first billing with any sign-up fees , but is not applied throughout the duration of the subscription . You can also create subscription-specific discounts for sign-up fees and a recurring discount if needed . <p> Billing schedules are also very flexible , and allows you to set recurring billing based on a custom schedule in terms of days , weeks , months , or years , or you can set a defined length of time for a subscription ( ex : bill once for 3 months of access ) . You can also limit customers to purchasing one subscription , or can allow customers to purchase multiple subscriptions ( though they have to purchase each separately ) , which will be beneficial for sites using a topic-based model ( selling access to certain kinds of content ) rather than a tiered membership . Setting up subscription products is done the same way as WooCommerce simple or variable products ( with the benefit that variable products can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be too difficult for regular WooCommerce users . <p> WooCommerce Subscriptions comes bundled with PayPal Standard for payment processing , but is not limited to solely using PayPal . You can manually process subscriptions for any WooCommerce gateway integration by requiring customers to pay for a new subscription when theirs expire . However , I 'd recommend using one of the 14 supported official gateway extensions for Subscriptions that allows you to automatically process and charge subscriptions ( and Stripe is included ! ) . This will probably make your life much easier as it automatically bills subscribers to avoid the barrier of forcing manual renewals , which will also lead to higher conversions . <h> Support <p> Purchasing any of the listed WooCommerce extensions will include support and updates for one year from the date of purchase . After one year , if you need support and updates , you 'll have to renew your product license from WooThemes for 50% ( estimated ) of the purchase price . Having worked with Brent Shepherd , who develops WC Subscriptions , I can say that Subscriptions is a quality product and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature roadmap here ) . You 'll also benefit from extensive documentation while setting up and managing your store . <p> The WooCommerce Groups Integration also comes with extensive documentation and one year of support and upgrades from the WooThemes team . <h> In Review <p> If you 're looking for a membership specialist , there 's probably a different solution out there for you . Groups + Subscriptions does not have the ability to restrict post categories and tags , nor can it drip content if needed for your membership model . However , the benefit to using this setup is that it integrates seamlessly with your existing WooCommerce store , and provides a great option for sites that sell products in addition to memberships and will scale up no matter how many products you sell . The fact that shipping is included and plenty of shipping extensions are also available make it compelling for memberships tied to physical , shippable products . <p> If you 're just creating a content site , this may work for you depending on your needs ( though itll probably be overkill for those of you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very extensible solution in terms of marketing tools and integrations , a solution for subscriptions to physical products , or a solution that integrations both a store and memberships , then WooCommerce is a platform you 'll want to explore further . <h> Looking for More info on Membership Sites using WooCommerce ? <p> Want more information on setting up membership sites using WooCommerce ? Check these articles / documents out : 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> What a great post Beka ! Incredibly comprehensive and covers just about all the pros and cons of WooCommerce + Groups + Subscriptions for membership site . I now have a post to send any who asks " Should I use WooCommerce for my Membership site ? " Thanks ! = <p> Hi there , Beka ! Thank you for your excellent article . I have one question , though : is it possible to setup a membership system , using these plugins , allowing people to setup websites on a WP multisite network ? Instead of limiting access to certain content , i need to have the exact same characteristics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This includes , of course , a trial period , billing schedule , etc . Thanks ! <p> Hi ! WooCommerce does n't  officially support multisite , though I know improving that is on the roadmap ( not sure of ETA ) . That being said , if you network activate the plugins , theyll usually work , but you may sometimes encounter some quirky issues . If you already have the plugins , I 'd test it out thoroughly on a demo install first . <p> If you want something that fully supports multisite , I know that Paid Memberships Pro ( free ) has a network add-on ( also free ) that would probably work for you ( support not included ) . I believe Memberships from WPMUdev supports multisite as well . <p> To anyone else reading this : an " Ask Us " question reminded me of this thread . S2Member Pro also supports multisite , and may be best for this scenario ( havent tried it so I 'm not sure ) . From their specs page : " Supports Restrictions for Blog Farms to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Membership Level ( optional ) . For instance , Free Subscribers might get an account only , but paying Members gain access to create blogs or sub-sites of their own . Requires Network Support License . " <p> Hello again . I-ve managed to try the Subscriptions plugin with a Multisite installation and , although i can read on the FAQ page that this plugin is usable with Multisite , there are a few issues . The css files of the admin are not loaded ( for instance , the subscription state labels are not styled ) and it is not possible to change the date of the next payment ( if you press " Change " under the date , nothing happens ) . I was hoping Brent could have some input regarding these issues , as he sometimes gives some advice here Thank you both again . <p> Hello and thank you for your time i solved the problem . What was happening was that i was using a custom translation file for WooCommerce and the string " WooCommerce " had a different content . Examining the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pagenow " to be different from " **28;1588;TOOLONG " . I am also trying to localize the plugin ( Subscriptions ) without success is it only possible to achieve using WPML , or am i understanding this incorrectly from the FAQ page ? This seems a bit over the top , no ? <p> Its only been tested and verified as working with WPML , but it uses standard WordPress functions and best practices for translation so it should be able to be translated by anything built for those . Whatever method you use will need to support the n() translation function though . <p> Hello Brent and thank you once more for your explanations . I was using poedit to take care of the translation ( i only need a few of the strings translated , though ) using the pot file . Maybe i saved the file with the wrong name , perhaps ? Is the name **33;1618;TOOLONG incorrect ? <p> Hi Jon ! WooCommerce + Subscriptions + Groups for WooCommerce will be able to do this for you . You 're correct that you can restrict access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those pages . I would recommend something like Vimeo or Wistia for security rather than YouTube , but theyd all work the same in terms of content restriction . <p> The benefit to using Groups ( based on what your setup sounds like ) is that members can have more than one access level tied to their account . Some membership plugins create a different user role for each access level , which prevents customers from having more than one access level . Groups does n't  do this , and instead allows customers to have different access rules tied to the same account . Therefore , if a customer buys a membership level , then also buys a product with its own access rules ( for the tutorial video ) , the user will have access to all of that content within their account . <p> Very promising and exciting possibilities . I am using rapid elearning software , specifically Articulate Storyline . Storyline content can be published to a zip file , to run in Windows-based PC , iOs , or Android devices . Can this be accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using WooCommerce Subscription ? Or are there restrictions to the kind of files or content that can be uploaded ? Many thanks for any enlightenment on this matter . <p> Hey there , I 'm not sure what you mean by " accessible but not downloadable " is the zip file something they should get , or are the contents something you are embedding ? If you 're embedding content for members to view , then Groups + Groups WooCommerce can allow you to restrict access to these pages . <p> Thanks for the quick , helpful reply . It is something I am embedding and members to view . I 'm glad you confirmed that access can be restricted . On the same note , which is another issue , I just found a plugin which is Storyline-line specific that allows embedding of the file to the pages . Great developments . Thanks so much . <p> I 'm looking for a way to let my subscribers to chose 5 free products from the site . its not a content based site . We are selling the products . I bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my product so the drop down menu and the variations wo n't work here . i want my subscribers ( members ) send to the page where they will be able to chose 5 products for free . Is it possible with to do with this plugin ? <p> Hey Paulina , this depends on if these free products need to have inventory managed or not . If the inventory needs to be managed , there 's no way to do this without being able to use variations unless you get a custom solution developed . <p> If the inventory for these products does n't  need to be tracked , you could use Gravity Forms + Gravity Forms Add-ons for WooCommerce to achieve this . This could let you create a form with a dropdown or multi-select with all of the free products available , and allow customers to choose five of the products with the subscription purchase . This will occur on the product page itself rather than a different page , but will probably get close to what your describing . <p> I 'm looking for a way that to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non WP learning system Do you know if you can you buy 30 ( the whole class ) on 1 order line and can you have more than one subscription on an order eg on dfferent order lines ? <p> Hey Brent , I am developing an orphan sponsorship subscription based membership website for a non-profit organisation . The mechanism is such that each orphan child is considered as a subscription product . One Sponsor can sponsor multiple orphans simultaneously , but each orphan can only be sponsored by one sponsor at a time . That means I should be able to limit the number of subscribers into a subscription plan to only one . I know that we can limit customers ( sponsors ) to purchase one or multiple subscriptions , but in this case , it demands a the opposite possibility . Please clarify this matter . <p> We also require the multiple quantity subscription functionality as there will be no restriction on how many orphans sponsors would like to subscribe for in order to sponsor by the time they place an order . <p> Hi Ahmad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " for each of the children that will be sponsored ? You can then hide each product ( which will represent a child that can be sponsored ) when they already have a sponsor , or disallow backorders so that only one person can sponsor each . <p> Can you clarify what you mean by this part ? <p> We also require the multiple quantity subscription functionality as there will be no restriction on how many orphans sponsors would like to subscribe for in order to sponsor by the time they place an order . <p> Use WooCommerces inventory management and set the subscription products inventory to 1 . You may need to add something extra that automatically resets the inventory to 1 when the subscription is cancelled or expired though so that someone else can sponsor that child . <p> RE : multiple subscriptions , just so its clear , customers can already purchase multiple subscriptions to sponsor multiple children , for now , theyll just need to checkout separately for each sponsorship . <p> The first question sounds like its going to require some custom code to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product each month , as the subscription product type can not include a download at the moment . I 'm assuming you 'd want this to be as automated as possible , so having Subscriptions automatically create an order and send an email for the order with the download link would probably be your best approach . This also makes sure only the subscriber is authorized for the download , as you can leverage WooCommerces downloadable product settings ( i.e. , limiting the number of downloads ) for this . <p> As for the second question , there are a couple of ways to do this . If you want to simply restrict coupons to members , the Groups Coupons extension will work , which can allow you to restrict coupons to one or several access levels . <p> If you want a more robust approach that can offer automatic discounts , you can use role-based pricing with the Dynamic Pricing extension . This is pretty simple to do if you 're already using Groups , as Dynamic Pricing will be able to offer discounts or even specialized bulk discounts to your members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit that its automatic and you do n't  have to use coupons ) . We 've got a tutorial on using Dynamic Pricing for more details . <p> RE : email , it depends on your specific requirements , but this can be done by Subscriptions in one form . To understand how it would work , have a read of this download handling FAQ and the subscription emails section of the store manager guide ( and possibly the renewal process guide to understand when these renewal emails will be sent ) . <p> Alternatively , check out the Follow-up Emails extension as it has support for some subscription related events . <p> Thanks ! I actually read through all the docs ( there 's a lot ! ) before posting here , but I think my best bet is with follow up emails ? BTW WP Engine hosts my site , you guys are incredible . <p> My final question , I fear its not possible <p> I want to create a link / button that takes the customer directly to paypal checkout . So they 're on the product page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paypal . I fear that 's not possible with subscriptions bc I read that it requires account creation at checkout . Am I right ? What a short and amazing funnel that would be otherwise . <p> That would be possible , but would have to be custom code , and quite a lot of it . <p> The code would need to create the order ( with guest user ) , send the customer to PayPal , then when they come back to the store from PayPal , automatically create an account for them based on their PayPal email all seamlessly in the background . <p> I have some unreleased code which allows a customer to select a product on the checkout page ( or create a checkout page specifically for certain product/s ) . It was written for the Designer Funds book launch and can be seen live here . If you 'd like to test it out , shoot an email through the contact form on my personal site . Its definitely not ready for public consumption , but may help you get close to that kind of seamless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 one time payment 2. non members have to join for $5 / month to buy <p> I 'm trying to wrap my brain around how this might work , but its hard just speculating . A normal coupon would n't work bc non members would still be able to purchase . ? <p> This seems insane but : <p> Create membership product . <p> 1 . The #1 above works instantly , as members click " join now " and receive download , and are members <p> To solve #2 , create custom button in short description of above product , which links to a new product being added directly to checkout ( this new product is only accessible to members , using groups and woo groups ext ) . Hopefully this will require login to purchase . <p> Hey Ted , if you 're requiring a sign-up for #2 , does n't  that mean those customers are now becoming members as they have a recurring billing account ? If that 's the case , then it sounds like you can disable purchasing that product for non-members , and have a link / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a $5 per month membership ( even if this is a special purchasing power membership or something similar like a Sams club or Costco membership ) . Then your membership pricing would dictate what theyd pay after they 've signed up , which puts the group from #2 now lumped together with the group from #1 . <p> Its $5 a month to receive a new digital file every month , let 's say its a song . When you sign up you get your first song . But , for members who sign up in June , they 're able to go back to previous songs they may like ( April , May ) , and buy those products for one time $5 price per song ( not a recurring payment since they already pay monthly ) . These songs were not available to them as members since they joined in June . <p> How do you disable non-members from purchasing a product with groups for woocommerce ? If so , can these non-members still see the product ? <p> Anyways , its stuff I 'll hopefully be able to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for clearing this upfirst RE groups : you can disable products so that only members can see them . If you want products to be visible to everyone , but can only be purchased by members , then you 'll need to tweak Groups a bit to add this rule , but it could be done . <p> As for #1 , there 's nothing out of the box that will be able to do this . At first glance , I think you 'd have to have someone modify a few things : #1 , the product can only be purchased by members , #2 Subscriptions gifts the product to members each month , #3 that way the products could be purchased by any member at a later time . <p> I am working on a website that sells one type of subscription . The subscription allows the user to have one product of the shop ( which costs money for other users ) for free . He ca n't order more than once a week . <p> I am using subscription , and dynamic pricing and min max purchase pro to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and then limit each cart to one product . <p> But I cant limit the number of order per week . Can I do that with group by creating a group of subscribers that cant buy nothing and then manually move the subsciber who has already bought a product to this group ? <p> Hi Sam , manually moving subscribers back and forth probably is n't going to be a feasible solution for this , but you could do this with some custom code it would be easy enough to prevent a customer from adding something to the cart if they 've ordered it in the current week with a companion plugin . <p> Hi Beka I am struggling on how to meet this client need and thought you might advisethanks <p> non-profit organization rents musical instruments to students lots of categories they want make rentals ( memberships ) online and then have the monthly fee get charged automatically to credit card.THEN have rental(membership) info transfer to Quickbooks Enterprise . <p> thinking woocommerce store with subscriptions paid into paypal and then they can download info from paypal into Quickbooks somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QuickBooks is your best bet . There 's nothing off the shelf that I know of that will integrate a WC store with QuickBooks enterprise , though doing this with a customized project would be possible . I 'd check out this free trial or this tutorial if you decide to use PayPal as the intermediary . <p> Beka , this is similar to an earlier question but not identical . I want our subscribers to be able to make a choice each time their subscription recurs . One , do nothing and automatically get the next new product in the subscription queue . Two , instead of the next subscription product , substitute for it some previouly released product ( all of which are the same price ) . I am envisioning a perfect scenario where the member goes into her account and sees a list of the backlist products she has not already substituted in for the subscription product , and also sees what 's next in the subscription queue . She can then select one and only one of the backlist items ( if she wishes ) to replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be hugely appreciated ! <p> Hey Kevin , this is doable but would definitely have to be something custom . I 've actually had someone ask about doing something similar and did not found anything standard that works I believe they did end up having a custom solution developed . <p> As a work around , you could ensure that all subscribers are on an email list , then sync subscriptions so that everyone renews on the same day ( i.e. , first of the month ) . Send an email in advance to the list , and let them checkout for the product they want for that month , identifying the new one in some way ( i.e. , a product badge ) . That product could be listed for free and the cart limit set to one item . You could restrict the product to only subscribing members , and use that to gather what to send . Obviously this requires a lot of manual work and is n't ideal , but it might be something to do in the interim until a customized solution makes sense ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've been awesome . I 'd like to pursue this line of questioning a little bit further . Still wrapping my head around this stuff so I apologize if some of this comes off as na+ve . Anyway , is it possible to do something like this <p> Create a variable subscription that allows switching but permits only one subscription at a time . In another scenario this might allow someone to switch from say one magazine to any one of several other magazines . In this case , though , the options are : <p> 1 ) the next book we release 2 ) a set of backlist titles on Theme A 3 ) a set of backlist titles on Theme B 4 ) a set of backlist titles on Theme C <p> Option 1 is a rolling list that keeps extending out into the future as we release new books . The other options are static lists . All subscription costs and recurrences are identical . <p> Assuming this is basically possible , here are some key questions . <p> Say the subscriber starts with option 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to option 1 , and at some point back again to option 2. &gt; Can the system " remember " where the subscriber was in the option 2 static list ? Or would she have to start over again at the first book in the option 2 sequence ? &gt; If the system can " remember " where she was in the option 2 sequence , can the option 2 subscription be set up so that after one recurrence it defaults back to option 1 ? &gt; If the system can NOT remember where she was in the option 2 sequence , could options 2 , 3 , 4 etc be " subscriptions " consisting of a single book each ? <p> In any event , we need option 1 to be the catch-all , so that if the subscriber comes to the end of an alternate subscription series , yet her subscription term is still active , her next book would automatically come from option 1 . <p> In the scenario above ( a catch-all subscription and several alternates ) &gt; Would it be done using a single attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catch-all subscription plus a line item for every alternate ? &gt; Or would there be two attributes , one for the catch-all and one with a drop-down for all the alternates ? &gt; Or would there be one attribute for the catch-all and a separate attribute for every alternate ? <p> Hey Kevin , sounds like you 'd need something external developed to track the book sequence , as there 's nothing right now in your system that would be doing so ( except you ) . Users would be able to switch between these subscription variations without issue . However , what you 're actually sending to customers is n't tied into the subscription you 're managing the fulfillment and what gets sent . Subscriptions simply manages creating an order for you and accepting payment . <p> A custom solution would have to " note " where customers are in your book list for options 2-4 based on how many subscription periods have passed . The same custom solution could then track this , even if users have moved away from this subscription and back again , as it would be saved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you 'd want to have your own menu for viewing customer subscription history as part of this custom work ) . You could then also have the correct book in the sequence added as part of the order . <p> As per the last few Qs , this seems like you 're overcomplicating a bit . One variation per alternate option ( each variation would be a value of a product " attribute " i.e. , Variation Type ( attribute ) : Opt 1 Opt 2 etc ) would probably be best this would show them all as options in the same dropdown so the choice is clear customers are only picking one thing to get . <p> Beka , Hi , first of all , excellent work ! I have a quick question Ok , its not that quick ! <p> I 'd like to run a promotion on Groupon or similar where I supply a coupon to each customer who purchases from Groupon- then they redeem using a coupon on my site also paying postage at the same time . For example I 'm selling a product at -4 instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month subscription hoping that when the 6 month is up the customer will continue paying at full price . The customer pays Groupon for the 1st 6 months directly and receive a coupon code in return . <p> The subscription is billed monthly . Therefore a customer would enter a coupon code at the start of the subscription which entitles them to 6 months products in effect for free as they have already paid group on ( 6 months of products ) but they would be billed -2.50 each month postage from the start . <p> Unfortunately when the 6 month trial period is up the discount continues no matter what I try . No matter how I set the subscription coupon , the user continues to receive the discount after the 6 month period . <p> I 've investigated the 6 month free trial period which in effect does what i want but I cant secure it to customers buying from Groupon . <p> I hope this makes sense ! <p> So , I 'd like to offer a subscription that is controlled by a coupon ( as the only people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group on to receive the discount ) which in effects charges -2.50 a month postage from the start and gives 6 months free products then after the 6 months the usual " subscription " -8 price kicks in along with the postage . <p> Hey Dan , discounts are meant to be for the lifetime of the subscription , so to implement this the way you 'd like to , you 'd have to have some custom code around the coupon . The only way I can think of doing this without custom code is as follows : ( 1 ) Well create the product w/ the 6-mo free trial as you said , but well lock it to Groupon customers by using the coupon code as a password instead of a coupon . ( 2 ) Install the Multiple Passwords for Protected Pages plugin. ( 3 ) Make the product password-protected and create a generic password for your product ( a " master password " ) , then enter the list of your Groupon Coupon codes as passwords under " Publish " . This will ensure that only people with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . You have to enter the first password before you can fill in the " multiple password " field . You 'll probably want to set your " Catalog Visibility " to " Hidden " as well so that this is n't included in your shop , but people with the link can still access it . <p> The only issue here is that passwords could be shared to non-Groupon purchasers . You could tell people that it will expire , be locked to your account , etc to hopefully avoid this , or you 'd have to custom code the coupon to work in the way you 'd like if this becomes an issue . <p> Beka , Hey , apologies , just thought of another hopefully quicker question this time ! <p> Is there any way I could give a customer " credit " ( say 6 months worth ) that could be used against the cost of the subscription only each month ( they would still have to pay postage ) and then after the 6 months is up their debit card could be charged as normal as their credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using smart coupons but it did n't  work I 'm certain this was due to the way i tried to configure it ! <p> Any idea if the subscriptions plugin can support 20,000+ subscriptions based on physical goods . We would be running a dedicated server . Someone said that this number is just too high for the plugin . I am pretty sure we can hit 20,000 within 15 months given prior history . The plugin seems to have the best features so it is a natural choice , just wondering about data limitations . <p> Hey Justin , thanks for the kind words ! A year ago I may have agreed that 20,000+ subscriptions is too high . However , I knew of one site that was at 14,000 subscriptions and running successfully at that point , and with versions 1.4 and 1.5 , Brent made very significant improvements to the way the plugin stores subscription data and scheduling to address this specifically . With those updates and a dedicated server , the plugin will be able to handle subscription sites that large . <p> I know this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant seem to get a good answer out there for this . And , I see the question asked over and over again in the WP Community , but you seem so nice and knowledgeable maybe you 'll be able to help us ! <p> I have a nonprofit organization for which I manage the website they need a membership plugin as in a *organization/community membership , * not protected content . <p> The website is completely geared towards the public , but it also needs to function to have members be able to join the organization or renew their membership ( annually and there are a few add on options there for donations , buts not a complicated model . ) <p> This would then take them through setting up their " member account , " then they could manage simple things on their account : basic directory information ( name , address , phone , email this is why it must be member-only page ) communication preferences volunteer committees manage their membership payment ( ideally , offer annual renewal ) perhaps purchase tickets for members-only events but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be protected beyond that . They are a volunteer-only nonprofit , so theyd like to avoid an expensive plugin that offers way more than they need , although it does need to be a seamless UI experience not glued together from a few funky options . <p> Whenever I research membership plugins , they are all geared towards the protected-content business model , membership in terms of a content community . Do you have any suggestions for what we could use for our needs ? <p> Hey Alexa , thanks for the kind words = . Should anyone be able to register , or do you have to approve or manually create members ? There may be a couple of ways to do this , but would need to know ( 1 ) how do people become a member and ( 2 ) do renewals have to be automatic ? <p> Hi again Oh , I 'm so excited to have someone knowledgeable explore this ! <p> The membership for the nonprofit is based on an annual June to May year and a member must renew annually ( dues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a few other options , all resulting in set flat $ amounts ) . An individual member is then included in events all year and part of an organization working on improving the health of the community . Its really not very much about anything online at all . <p> Ok , to do everything youd want , you 'd have to have something custom coded to generate a " My Membership " page , as managing the member information + billing is a bit tough to find ( though I remember Jason at Paid Memberships Pro talking about doing something like this , so I 'd recommend contacting him ) . <p> Option 1 ) It sounds like the " directory " page is just a user profile , so you could use the WP User account for this . With a site login , the member could simply edit this information ( like when you edit your own user profile page ) and the admin could access all of it from the " Users " list . Use Gravity Forms dev license ( coupon here , recent tutorial here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youd also need free plugins : ACF and User Role Editor . Add a user role for your members , create ACF fields for the data about members you 'll need and add this to the users page . Then use a Gravity Form for registration / payment and tie the registration form info to the user meta fields generated by ACF . This will let you accept payment to simply create and pre-populate a user account . <p> Downside : Payment info not included in profile , and members must re-register to renew . You could create another form for renewals for logged in members so they do n't  have to fill everything in again . However , no ability for members-only purchasing or any other functionality if you want to protect any content at all limited to user creation and payment . <p> 2 ) Using WooCommerce , and add checkout fields , which will become user meta ( like contact method preference ) . You could then have something coded to add this meta and display it on the " My Account " page , which would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get ability to sell other stuff , view reports , have member purchasing ( using other extensions ) , as well as the ability to use Subscriptions for automatic renewals . Downside is that you need that small development job to add your member info to the my account page . <p> Beka , hey , Dan here again = Quick question please When buying a subscription ( physical product ) on our website , in the first month you get 1 razor handle and 3 heads and every month after that you get 4 razor heads . So the first months subscription package is different to the regular delivery . <p> When processing the orders is there any way of telling if the order is a new order or a repeat of a current order so that we know which package to send to the customer please ? <p> Hey Dan , I believe that the order page itself marks renewal orders , so you can tell by viewing the order . However , this would be something I 'd submit to WooThemes as its been a while since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WooCommerce will let members have multiple subscriptions attached to an account ( they just have to purchase each subscription separately until version 2.0 comes out ) . If you use Subscriptions , members can also upgrade / downgrade themselves based on your settings . Upgrades / downgrades are allowed between variants , or between grouped products . WooCommerce Subscriptions and MemberPress are the only plugins so far that support upgrades and downgrades , so it sounds like WooCommerce is the best fit for what you want . <p> Thank you Beka , you answer every questions patiently and provide FREE helpful information in your blog , its very important for newbies so they can spend their money on right product , no trial error buying dazzled products , no wasting time and money , because I know some gurus will sell information like this for money .. You are the BEST ! <p> Beka , Hey , hope you are well . Quick question , without any additional coding is it possible to use woo commerce to checkout like you can here https : **28;1653;TOOLONG or here https : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on checkout e.g. Every SIX weeks send me TEN razors where the numbers in capitals can be changed by the user to preset ones pre programmed ? <p> Hey Beka , I ended up using a variable subscription using attributes and variations Works well so far but have n't properly tested it yet Will revert when i have = Thanks again , you are awesome = Dan <p> Hi Beka ! I have been searching for the answer to these questions everywhere , and it seems like you are the only person who has enough knowledge to answer these questions . Like Alexa , the commenter a couple weeks ago , I have a question about a membership site . I have not even picked a WordPress theme yet , but here is what I want to do : <p> I would like to set up a site where people could " advertise " on my site . So , say they pay $100 to advertise their business on my site . They would fill out a form which would answer certain questions ( name of organization , phone number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This information would be a " listing " on my site . So if someone searched for the state they are in and the category of business , there would be several " listings " which would only show certain information- almost like a staff directory on most company websites . But then once you clicked on them , it would give a bunch of the information- all of which would be included in that ecommerce form they filled out in the beginning . So I am trying to understand how to do these things : <p> 1 . Should I use WooCommerce for this ? Would it have the ability to have all the form information I would need and then is there a way I could have it automatically upload to the site ( perhaps after I approve it so I do n't  get spambotted ) ? Another option I saw is 123contactform with the widget webhooks . Would this do the same trick ? I would need whatever form I use to link with Braintree with recurring payments . <p> 2 . What kind of WordPress " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to any kind of website design . But I do want the website design to be modern and mobile-friendly . <p> 3 . My idea was to have many different sites- a different site for every state , which would then show all the different categories the user can pick from , and then subpages for every different category under each state ( so were talking about a lot of subpages ) . Whatever coding needs to be done would need to automatically upload both the " listing " and the extended information once you click on the listing- so to two different sites . It may even need to go to several different sites if the company is in many different " categories . " Does that make sense ? Depending on the form information they filled out , the information would need to be uploaded in a neat fashion to many different sites . Is this possible using WooCommerce ? <p> Ok , that 's all the questions I have I think = You have already been a huge help to me Beka ! Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gravity forms to submit a listing , then use Gravity View to organize these listings , allow filtering ( i.e. , by site or type ) , and display them nicely on the frontend of your site . This way , you could display all listings on a page , and allow filtering or searching . You can also approve / reject them first . Using this setup , it would n't matter which theme you use = . I 'd recommend going with a reputable company like WooThemes or Array rather than just picking something from ThemeForest . <p> That is very helpful . Is there any option with recurring billing for Braintree ? They have the Small Business Startup deal where the first 50k of my payments have no transaction fee . So I would really like Braintree , but I also would really like recurring payments . Everything else in Gravity Forms seems to be exactly what I need , but that is a big feature to me . Is there another option ? <p> Hey Michael , the Gravity Forms Braintree extension I mentioned above appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author to see if there 's an ETA on this or if you can make a donation to help fund development to speed it up . <p> Hi Beka , thanks heaps for all the killer advice . I have gone down the route of WooCommerce , Groups and Subscriptions and have set most of it up successfully thanks to your pointers . <p> My problem is I need to create fairly complex User Profiles for my Members . On its own I guess this might not be such a problem , but I need the extended information gathered at the time they buy their Membership . I have new signups being connected to Mailchimp at the time of purchase , and some of the information is need to add segementing of the list . In other words its no good trying to gather this information after a person has purchased their Membership . <p> Is there a way to add custom fields to the checkout process when a Subscription product is being purchased , so that it adds this informaiton to the User Profile in WordPress ? I will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a later date via Edit Profile etc , and I can handle the custom coding for that . I just need a way to capture this information when they choose a Membership when checking out . <p> Conversely these fields must not show if another product type is chosen a ticket for example , or a book . I do n't  need extended profiles for these people as they wont be Members , or creating a profile . <p> Hey David , there 's not really an easy way to do this . Kind of a Frankenstein way would be to use User Role Editor + ACF as described in this comment to add a user role for subscribers , add this to a Gravity Form , then map the form field to user meta . You could then use Gravity Forms Add-ons for WooCommerce to use this form as part of the product page for your Subscriptions . That would capture the information in the checkout process for the Subscription , but I 've never done something like this . <p> The other option would be a custom plugin to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when checkout is completed and the WooCommerce account is created . <p> Thanks for that Beka . I had a look at your previous comment about user fields and I think option 2 is about what were looking at as we need to keep the recurring billing and other woo options for reporting etc . <p> Can you expand on how to achieve adding more checkout fields that add user data , as per the below ? <p> In the Woo admin I found options to turn on account creation preferences which currently ask for a username and password , so the hooks exist to add fields which affect the user meta . Is there a way to use ACF or Types plugins to manage these or will this need to be done programmatically ? <p> It does work on both if you 're using Groups and the Groups WooCommerce connector . The screenshot I 'm using it not a user role , but rather a custom group generated by Groups . You can price based on Groups *or* based on user roles . <p> Thanks Beka , I 'm getting a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at the sequence the way I hope it will work <p> 2 MAIN QUESTIONS : a ) When I purchase membership created as a woo commerce product how the user created during this step will be placed in appropriate pmppro membership level . b ) How do I tie specific products to membership level . Please see below my precise steps . <p> 1 . Woo Commerce installed , so is PMPro and PMPro WooCommerce integration plugin. ( testing it now in pilot environment ) 2 . I went to Membership &gt; Membership Levels and created the level for Gold Discounts . I specify 10% as discount value . 3 . Then I created a product in WooCommerce Gold Membership . ( this is how I plan to sell memberships ) . In the properties of this product in the Membership tab I specify the " Gold Discounts " . My understanding is that by doing that when user purchases Gold Membership as a woo product he will get all Gold Discount settings . <p> So far so good . Now I need to actually tie PMPro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount to everything ) . Let 's say I have 20 vacation packages in only 10 of them should be discounted under membership settings . <p> a ) I was hoping that in Membership Level I would be able to choose WooComerce categories but only WordPress categories show up . So this is not an option b ) Another option to go to the properties of every vacation package ( as created in woo commerce ) in choose membership level " Gold Discounts " . Is it the right way to tie product to a membership level ? <p> Hey Elijah , Everything looks right up to step 3 . Discounts will always be global ( all products ) if entered on the memberships page . You could instead leave this blank enter a different price for gold members in the " Memberships " tab for the products that should have a discount available ( described here ) . <p> Any idea on configuring this setup to work with a forum like Simple:Press allowing for users to be mapped to different levels on the forum via the group system . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system to map users and if Groups puts everyone into the same Role , but then creates groups within that role , would I need a separate solution ? <p> Hey John , if you 're looking for forums , I might go with WooCommerce + PMPro , as PMPro will integrate with bbPress for forums . I 've not set something up like this myself , but I 'm pretty sure that would be an easier approach . <p> Hmm unfortunately I do n't  use bbPress I 'm using Simple:Press which maps users to WP-User-roles so I 'd need a way to create new roles upon registration . Thanks for the info though PMPro does look like a powerful tool , and has some nice features , if I was n't so invested in Simple:Press already I 'd certainly consider it and bbPress as an option , but converting the forum at this point would be a lot of work . <p> Beka , so far so good , I think I 've figured it out an at this point have a pilot running with memberships and discount prices assigned for the specific products . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would appreciate if you can give me some pointers . <p> 1 . It would be extremely great if logged in user with specific membership would see the icon placed on the product that says " Discounted for Gold Membership " . Otherwise how will he know that he is looking at the discounted price . 2 . If the above is not doable , then is there any way to enable any other discount display based on membership . 3 . Is there any way to provide flexible discount structure ? Meaning not only specify the discounted price but create something that will enable " buy 2 package -&gt; get additional discount " or " enable store-wide discount and in addition apply 10% on specific products " ( for specific membership ) or " with each additional purchase gain additional discount " 4 . Will user be able to see their own profile pages with PMPro membership ? 5 . Will I be able to create a page with protected site content and make it available only for users with specific membership level ? <p> Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However the rest sound like theyd require custom code , so I 'd check in the plugin forum to see if theyd be included in a support membership or if you 'd have to hire a developer . <p> I-m creating a website where users can buy subscriptions to publish posts and custom posts according to their group . I want to know if it-s possible to hide from public all content created by a specif user if he does n't  pay . <p> Beka , Hi , Dan here again = I have a quick Stock keeping question please I currently sell a subscription product on my web site that has several different attributes e.g. check out will be something like this SEND ME " THE COLONEL RAZOR PACKAGE " and " 2 TUBS OF SHAVING CREAM " every " 3 MONTHS " where everything listed in " ? ? " are attributes . In the first " ? " there are 3 options , in the second " ? " there are 6 options and in the third " ? " there are a further 6 options . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible options please ? In the above example the amount of months do n't  matter but which razor sold and the cream sold do . <p> Hi Beka . Thanks for a fascinating resource regarding such a niche topic . I wondered if you could help me get to the bottom of this issue . We are starting a subscription site which sells digital templates for download . I want subscribed members to be able to access a group of 8 different templates , all individual created as WooCommerce products . I know I can host the download links as restricted content and use the Groups plugin but is there a way of creating them as individual digital products on Woo and then allowing download of these products once a subscription is activated ? <p> Could this be achieved with the Chained Product plugin ? <p> Reason for this requirement is that we might want to make certain templates purchasable for a one off fee and not part of the subscription . <p> Beka , Hi , apologies I thought I had posted a stock question but I cant find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question Pls see LONG ... Pls could you advise on the best way to keep track of stock while selling like this ( in effect 5 products 3 different razors , cream and razor cartridges ) . At the moment I have set up 1 product / variable subscription with several attributes It does n't  work very well for stock control ! ! <p> Great post ! I do have one question though , I hope you can help me with . Is there a way to a gate on posts saying you most be a member/subscribed to access this content ? It seems the groups plugin only hides the content completely from non subscribers . Please let me know what you think ? <p> Hey Niroj , you 're correct that each new subscriber will be created as a WordPress user . The user account will have the role " Subscriber " , and any Groups the member is in will be listed in the user profile as well . Capabilities created via the Groups plugin are tied to the group , so listing them as well would be unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model that were looking at is pay $x per month and get y products downloads of your choice for free ; then only $z for each additional . The prices for each item will be the same . <p> I 'm thinking that I would need Dynamic Pricing , Groups , and I 'm thinking PMPro ? Or do I have my plugins confused ? The products will also be available to purchase at a normal price for non-members . <p> It sounds like you wo n't need PMPro at all because you 're not doing any content restriction . You can give access to downloadable products while the subscription is active see Brents comment here . However , if you 're looking to provide a choice on which products they can download , but not provide the others , you may want to check into using Gravity Forms + Gravity Forms addons to allow selection ( see my comment here ) . You can then have regular products available for all of these downloads so customers can purchase what they did n't  select . <p> You 're correct that the reduced rate for your groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Were developing an online courses website . We want the teachers to be able to create " student users " , by **28;1714;TOOLONG in a private frontend page , where only can access once via password , after purchasing a product ( the course ) . <p> So we imagine some module that generates different " coupons/keys/serial " , and the user could use it like a password to get in the final page ( where is the form to create the user with student role in certain course ) . <p> We already have integrated LearnDash , Woocommerce and GravityForms , but still is needed the step where the Teachers purchase a course ( with a key or something ) , and use that key to get in only once to an URL and could join his/her student . <p> We have integrated LearnDash , Woocommerce and GravityForms , but still is needed the step where the Teachers purchase a course ( with a key ) , and use that key to enter to a determain URL and could join only once his/her student . <p> thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . Maybe you know a quick solution = <p> I do have a lot of subscribers ( paying and free with different subscriptions handled via the plugin magicmembers ) . <p> How can I add these subscribers to the wc subscription plugin ? I can add them to groups ( no problem ) , but after that they aren-t listed as a subscriber . The only workaraound ( I found ) is to add manually a new order ( with the subscription item ) and asign this order to the existing member . But that is not very handy ( 1000 subscribers ) . <p> Hey Marco , there 's not really a quick solution here . Migrations are always very involved , and if you wanted to migrate all subscriptions , youd need to have a custom migration script developed , which can do this automatically , as adding a member to a Group will not create a subscription ( Groups ties into Subscriptions , not the other way around ) . I 'm afraid the options are either work with a developer to do the migration , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already done by tying them to the subscription . <p> I 'd recommend working with a developer , as that way you provide access to the group only via the subscription . Otherwise , with the way you 've added members to groups manually now , theyll have access even if they stop paying because the group access is n't tied to the billing . <p> Great article ! I am doing a site where people can rent out PS4 games . So they buy " time " a month say and then can rent a game out at a time . I have pretty much decide on WooCommerce plus WooCommerce Subscriptions . <p> The basic thing I am trying to get my head round is " products " . I have two types of products . The first type is the actual time-based subscriptions . The second type are the games themselves . <p> I am just wondering the best way to differentiate these two types of products in WP / WooCommerce ? <p> For instance , in " Recently Viewed Products " widget , I just want that to show recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility you can filter based on : category , author , user , role , tag , date , page , taxonomy <p> So what in your opinion is the way to " split " my products between ( 1 ) subscriptions and ( 2 ) games ? <p> Also , since people are paying for time , the actual games themselves are " free " its just a way of the client telling us what game they want next . I am wondering if using WooCommerce for that part is overkill . I really just need to find a way for the client to let me know what game they want next ( presuming it is in stock ) <p> Sorry for so many questions , these projects are always the hardest at the beginning when you have so many choices available , and in my case zero experience of running an eCommerce site ! ! <p> Not having much luck to date . The " visibility " button on woocommerce widgets is just used to decide whether the widget is displayed or not . There does n't  seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get displayed ? <p> I do like keeping the games ordering within the woocommerce system though . Selling " free " products seems to work very well . <p> So just need to what to use to differentiate between subscriptions and games , and any widgets I can use to filter out the subscriptions <p> 1/ I have a print templates store where i sell digital goods and i want to use a plugin to give the customers the option to purchase a monthly plan and a yearly one . Both plans should grant unlimited access to all the store 's products for free while non members buy those products individually . And they should n't go through the checkout page for each download to make their user experience more efficient . Here is an example of website with exactly what we expect : https : **28;1744;TOOLONG : . Which plugin does this ? With recurring billing option using the 2Checkout plugin . Hope its clear : ) <p> Hey nora , this sounds like you 'd need a custom solution I 'm afraid . You could give free access to store products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to still go through the checkout page . 
@@98138162 @2338162/ <p> While there are lots of great premium WooCommerce extensions , who does n't  love something for free ? Weve covered some free add-ons already , but were always looking for new free plugins . Whenever we come across a new one , we install it and test it to make sure it works as advertised so you can safely install it in your store . <p> Here are 7 tested , free WooCommerce extensions you can start to use today . <h> 1 . WooCommerce Discounts Per Payment Method <p> WooCommerce Discounts Per Payment Method allows shop owners and employees to provide discounts to customers for using a particular payment method , which can help incentivize customers to use the payment method of your choice . For example , you can provide a discount for credit card purchases to encourage customers to pay using this method . <p> We covered this a bit already in an Ask Sell with WP question as well . You can set up discounts for all payment methods in your store , or only offer discounts for some methods . <p> Add payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the payment methods available at checkout. <h> 2 . WooCommerce Sales By Location Report <p> This one is pretty self explanatory = . WooCommerce Sales by Location Report adds a new report to your store that will show you where your orders come from based on the customer billing address or the shipping address . The color of the location designates which locations have the most orders and which have the least . You can also use the order total instead of number of orders to show which countries you make the most money from . <p> This can be handy tool for international sellers , as it gives them a simple visualization into where their sales come from . <h> 3 . WooCommerce Stellar <p> Are you into cryptocurrencies ? Stellar is both a protocol for sending / receiving money and a cryptocurrency that you can accept as payment ( similar to bitcoin ) . By both standardizing and decentralizing digital transactions , Stellar is able to help you send and receive money without going through a bank or credit card processor . You can use this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can also use the " stellar " currency , which is a fairly new cryptocurrency used in the Stellar protocol . Its basically like a poker chip : you can exchange poker chips in a casino just like cash , so long as you use their " protocol " for exchange . The stellar currency works in the same way you can convert dollars , euros , etc , to stellar when exchanging money via Stellar . <p> The WooCommerce Stellar extension let 's you accept payment for orders in your WooCommerce store using the Stellar protocol and stellar currency . <h> 4 . WooCommerce Google Analytics Integration <p> Chances are that you already run Google Analytics on your site to get some insight into landing pages , pageviews , visits , and bounce rate . However , you can track a lot more information for an eCommerce site with Google Analytics . <p> This plugin makes more connections between your site and Google Analytics so you can track transactional data , track the purchasing lifecycle from referral to conversion , and track eCommerce events . <h> 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item when its out of stock , which is why many stores choose to display remaining inventory to customers ( especially if its low ) . However , this can be difficult for variable products , as you probably do n't  want to display the total inventory for all variations ( i.e , all tee shirts , regardless of size / color / etc ) . <p> This plugin adds a small bar graph below the add to cart button that will show the inventory available for each product variation separately so the customer can view what 's in stock for each variation of your product . <h> 6 . Gift Cards for WooCommerce <p> The Gift Cards for WooCommerce plugin adds a simple gift card system to your site . You can manually add gift cards to send to customers , or sell set-value gift cards as products in your shop . These can then be redeemed as store cash during the checkout process . Its very simple to use and effective at implementing a store cash or gift certificate system . <p> My only dislike is that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as manually generated gift cards , as it would be great to have a reference in case a customer loses a gift card number . <h> 7 . WooDiscuz <p> While pre-sales questions typically happen via email , they do n't  have to . You can include a " discussion " tab with WooDiscuz that servers as a " Q &amp; A " tab to let customers ask questions about your product and hear from your team . These comments and questions will include avatars , the ability to upvote or downvote questions , and they can include badges so customers know which answers are from your shop employees . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138163 @2338163/ <h> 6 Keys to Effective Customer Service <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Customer service and communication are keys to increasing customer lifetime value , and eCommerce businesses are no exception to this guideline . Effective customer service makes the difference between one-time purchasers and customers , therefore increasing your return on the investment required to acquire that customer , yet some online businesses neglect customer service since they 're not in a face-to-face situation . <p> So how do you improve your service or support so that you 're keeping customers happy while maximizing your own customer LTV ? There are some tools and systems your customer service team should be testing to ensure that you 're retaining customers and turning them into your own brand ambassadors through great service . <h> Offer Reasons <p> Offering a reason for a purchase or why a product works is one of the first rules of selling , and customer service is no different . For example , imagine that you have to put a customer on hold to ask a question or check on something . Many times , we hear " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone . However , I recently had a call with American Express and had to be put on hold . Irene , who was very pleasant and helpful , said , " You know , I 'm going to need to check on something to see if we can streamline this process for you in the future . Could I put you on hold for one second to do that ? " <p> Well Irene , of course you may . You know why ? I know that you 're helping me and that its necessary . You 're not ignoring me and were totally getting stuff done . Does it really matter that Irene may have been blowing her nose , taking a sip of coffee , or rolling her eyes at helping me on a Saturday ? Nope , I do n't  really care . Irene made me feel like putting me on hold was valuable for both of us by giving me a reason for doing it . <p> Do n't  be short with customers or try to resolve situations quickly . Resolving them well is the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking a few second to explain something can make all of the difference . Which brings us to the next point <h> Be Patient <p> Let 's start this one with a story , though it may only relate to me = . Imagine you 've just had a great meal with a loved one . Service was good wine glasses were filled as they were emptied , spacing between appetizers and the main course was appropriate , and the server was attentive without being intrusive . You get the check , pay it , and thenthe server takes it before you 've had time to finish your conversation with that last glass of wine . <p> Feel like they 're in a hurry to turn the table over ? I really hate that feeling . Like truly hate it , especially if I 'm enjoying myself and want to finish whatever Im talking about before I leave the table , but the server is now eager to get the next tip . <p> So how does this relate to your customers ? Make sure you answer their concerns thoroughly and completely before moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If customers feel like you 're rushing them out the door in order to maximize the number of resolved cases per service rep , they wo n't leave the table feeling great about the experience . <p> And restaurants where this happens ? I avoid going back if given other choices , even though only one person may have put a mark on an otherwise fun evening . Think about whether you want customers to look at you the same way based on your interactions . <h> Empathize with Customers <p> Its really easy to think people are crazy . Sometimes they have really unrealistic expectations of what they 're buying , which weve definitely seen while selling software . However , your response shapes the conversation , not the customers initial inquiry . For example , what about the customer who has issues while using your product , or whose order arrives scratched or broken ? <p> Its easy to say , " I 'm sorry , let 's fix this issue , " and move on . However , empathizing with the customer , then fixing the issue generates a far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working towards the same goal . Instead , imagine if you got responses like this as a customer : <p> I 'm very sorry that your order arrived in that condition ! I know that must have been disappointing , and I 'd like to help you out by <p> I 'm so sorry you 're experiencing issues with our product ! I know we both want to get you up and running as soon as possible , so I 'd really love to help you by <p> Yes , apologizing and making customers feel heard is important , However , empathizing with customers and aligning yourselves towards the same goals ensures that customer do n't  feel as if you 're adversaries , but rather team members . <h> Use Positive Language <p> Challenge yourself or your customer service team to stop using the word " not " , or " cant " . What if a product is n't in stock , but will be available in a month ? Consider these two responses . <p> I 'm sorry , but that product is n't available at the moment , so I cant place the order . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be available in a month , so I can backorder it for you now and it will ship when its available . <p> While neither response is " bad " , one response creates a feeling of disappointment that the product is n't available now , while the other creates anticipation that the product will be in stock soon . This does n't  seem like a big difference overall , but it encourages positive language and feelings , while making sure that your company is aware of the language you use and message that you create . <h> Leverage all communication channels <p> Have channels of communication open for your customers . Not only will they be frustrated if they cant get in touch , but they can also sometimes give you insight or ideas to expand or improve your offering that could bring in more revenue . <p> This one will obviously depend on your demographic , but Twitter can be a valuable customer service asset . For example , take a look at the way Starbucks or Chipotle use Twitter . If a customer has a less-than-optimal experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently Tweets a Coffee to that customer as an apology for the experience . They do a great job of this in-store as well , as theyll typically upgrade a drink order if they cant make it just the way you want , or give you free drink cards if your wait time is longer than average . <p> While Twitter is just one ( very easy ) way to keep in touch with customers , it may not be best for you depending on your customer demographics . Having a customer service email visible ( or links to other channels , such as Facebook ) , is important to make sure customers can get in touch and be heard . <p> If you 're starting out , I 'd recommend offering several ways to get in touch , tracking which are most popular and which result in the highest customer satisfaction with the experience , then narrow down and optimize those channels . I 've found the most success with phone , email , and Twitter across different projects . <h> Be Creative <p> I know this one seems vague , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make decisions can be one of the most valuable instances of delegating that you 'll do . Even sending a thank you card or a token gift can go a long way towards smoothing things over with an unhappy customer , and gifts do n't  always have to be related to your products . <p> Many times , you can make an impression on a customer for a very minimal cost , but that customer has then become loyal to your brand unless you really mess something up . They 're also likely to tell other people about their positive experiences , and that impression can go to work for you and leads to new customers giving you the benefit of the doubt . <p> For example , check out the notes on creative customer service reps from Helpscout ( who weve used and highly recommend ) . Yes , sometimes unhappy customers can be tough to deal with , and you cant always resolve things in the way that theyd like . However , doing something nice ( like sending the box of chocolates in that article ) can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes the conversation about you will that person now recommend you ? What first impression will that generate when they talk about you ? The cost and time required of your customer service team for this type of response is minimal , but is good for business in the long run and encourages brand loyalty and positive recommendations . <h> In Conclusion <p> In the short run , offering great customer service may not feel worth it . Sometimes customers will be extremely rude or disproportionally upset . Its tempting to respond in kind , and you 'd be justified in doing so . <p> However , that 's a short-sighted game . You 're in this for long-term value and revenue . While you may not win over every customer , and in fact may sometimes lose money on offering great service , do n't  optimize for revenue in the short term . Cutting a customer service budget or discretionary spending may be an easy place to streamline your business , but that 's only going to yield short-term gains . <p> Instead , consider potential revenue , and factor a customers future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal customers can generate over a lifetime , as well as the customers they can help you in acquiring , and youll see why effective customer service strategies are so important . <p> Special thanks to Linda Le Phan at Cornerstone Content for sending some of the resources mentioned in this article and further reading ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Many of them also include support for several Easy Digital Downloads extensions , and they 're built by great authors . <h> 1 . Shop Front , $0 Sumobi <p> Shop Front is a free theme available that provides a great starting point for an Easy Digital Downloads store . You can get it from the author or download it from WordPress.org . It gives you a flat , minimal layout that provides the ability to create a downloads archive as a shop page and blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use your newest products on the homepage , or to use a static page and take advantage of your own text and EDD shortcodes to display your chosen products ( such as featured downloads ) . <p> However , the reason I really like Shop Front is that its meant to be customized , and is a great starter theme if you 're familiar with CSS . There are also some very useful companion plugins , such as a style pack for extra color schemes and a My Account page template . <p> One of my favorite things is how easy it is to set up Marketify using the built-in theme customizer , and I was up and running with this theme within a half hour . I also love the blog post template , as featured images are used as the header cover photo . The entire theme is beautiful , not just the product and vendor pages . <h> 3 .

While Squarecode can be used for a digital marketplace , it also works very well for single-vendor shops and supports several popular EDD add-ons. <h> 4 . Stocky , $58 Design Crumbs <p> If you 're selling photography with Easy Digital Downloads , Stocky is definitely one of the themes that you should be looking at . It features your downloads and the products featured image in a masonry layout on shop and category pages .

All setup can be done from the built-in theme customizer , which also includes homepage options and color settings . Humbleshop supports several popular add-ons as well , such as EDD Wishlists , EDD Social Login , the Product Reviews add-on , and others . <p> While I 'm not a huge fan of the blog templates , the shop pages and product pages put the focus on your products , and it makes a great theme for several types of stores . <h> 6 . Make Plus , $99 Theme Foundry <p> Looking for something with a bit more flexibility ?

I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way , do you prefer Woocommerce or EDD for such a store and why ? <p> Hey Mozie , I 'd recommend Squarecode in that case the cart is in the sidebar + can be in the top menu , and its from a great author . <p> If your store is selling only digital products , I usually recommend EDD , as WooCommerce may be overkill . For example , you wo n't need the shipping methods , etc , that WooCommerce contains . The EDD Frontend Submissions extension is also awesome for vendor marketplaces if you 're going that route . However , I 'd recommend looking at the available extensions for each to ensure that you have what 's needed to set up shop .

@@98138165 @2338165/ <h> Automatically Sort WooCommerce Products for Improved Conversions <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> The average user stays on a site page for 10 to 20 seconds . This is pretty dismal news for our shop how much can a customer possibly read in that time ? How can we make sure we attract their attention to ensure that they exceed 10-20 seconds on our pages ? <p> Keeping customers on-site and browsing your catalog is crucial for any eCommerce business , and to improve conversions we must ensure that customers remain on-site long enough to find what they 're looking to purchase . In order to remove any barriers to finding the right product , we can be intelligent in the way we structure shop pages and the browsing experience . <p> One feature of your eCommerce plugin that has the biggest impact on browsing is the ability to sort products and product searches . This allows customers to quickly view what they 're most interested in seeing . However , while providing sorting tools to customers is a great idea , we should also consider how default sorting displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Why is product sorting important ? <p> Let 's back up for one second . Why should you care about sorting your products for customers or what your default sorting looks like ? What effect does it really have ? Why does n't  the standard " alphabetical " or " best seller " sorting cut it ? <p> According to KISSmetrics , sorting and filtering capabilities make a huge impact on usability and conversions on search and shop pages . Sorting is especially important for search results , as customers want to see products that will be most relevant , but also be able to sort these products in a way of their choosing . <p> As for shop and catalog pages , sorting is hugely important to ensure that customers find what they want quickly and easily . According to UX Movements studies , users do n't  typically browse all shop products or pages to find what they need : <p> typically users would n't look further than the second or third page . This means if you have a lot of products , you need a way to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or help them filter out the ones they are n't  interested in . <p> That 's why sorting is important it gives your customers the ability to quickly see what they 're interested in seeing and bring those products to the top . <p> However , while giving customers the option to view best sellers and other types of sorting is a powerful option , many eCommerce plugins simply waste the default sorting options . Typically , products are sorted alphabetically , or in a customized sorting order that a store administrator can set . For example , the default WooCommerce product sorting can only be alphabetical or in an order that must be set entirely by the shop admin . <p> While custom sorting is probably the best way to go , as your store can display popular or highly-rated products first , WooCommerce custom product sorting is tedious and annoying . When your store has hundreds of products to offer , you need to ensure that users can quickly find what they 're looking for with a minimum of effort . However , you also have to be able to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products is n't a great use of your time . <h> WooCommerce Infinite Product Sorting Review <p> The WooCommerce Infinite Product Sorting ( WIPS ) plugin gives store owners maximum control over how products are sorted by default in shop , category , and search pages , and takes control of the default sorting option . Rather than either wasting default sorting on alphabetical order or taking huge blocks of time to create a customized sorting order , you can use WIPS to automatically create a default product sorting order that works for you . <p> WIPS allows you to set scores for which product attributes are most or least important when creating a sorting order . With an easy interface , you can slide these settings to the desired ranking for several attributes , including product ranking , price , product rating , and more : <p> Creating Sorting Rankings <p> Not only does this save you time when you have hundreds of products to sort , but it also allows you to rank sorting criteria based on importance rather than being limited to either / or situations . Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a default WooCommerce option . However , if you want to make best sellers and featured products important , then WIPS allows you to weight these attributes more highly than other product attributes . <p> WIPS will also use its sorting ranking engine for product search results when a customer searches for a key phrase , products with that key phrase will will be ranked based on the rating criteria you 've set . This ensures that customers are finding the products you want them to find . Note that this will only be used for product searches ( i.e. , using the WooCommerce search widget ) , and will leave your general site searches alone in order to get out of the way of other plugins ( such as Relevanssi for search ) . <p> In short , you wont be limited to one default sorting order that does n't  go to work for your store . Instead , you can rate what 's important to your store , then WIPS uses its ranking system to generate an optimal sorting order for you . <h> Configuration <p> There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorting simply activate the plugin and you 're ready to start ranking your sort order under WooCommerce &gt; Infinite Product Sorting . WIPS provides 9 product attributes for you to rank in terms of importance for your default product sorting . <p> Price <p> Number of sales <p> Availability ( number in stock ) <p> Date published ( make old or new products more important ) <p> Featured status <p> Product Rating <p> Number of reviews <p> On sale status <p> Menu order ( set under Product Data &gt; Advanced ) <p> You simply slide the bar towards whichever attributes are most important to you on a scale from 0% to 100% . If you would like an attributes ranking to remain neutral , simply leave the slider in the middle at 0% . This will influence how products are " graded " for sorting and how they 're displayed in the default product sort . <p> Adjusting Sorting Option Ranking <p> Once you 've set which factors are important ( and how important ) for your default sorting options , you can save this setting or preview the order in which your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quick preview is very handy for seeing which criteria favor which products in your store . <p> While you preview products sorting , you can also view the sorting score . WIPS has a built-in engine that figures out how to rank products easily each product will be assigned an overall score based on its attributes and the weighting provided by your sorting settings . The best part about this is that it takes all attributes of a product into account when creating sorting , and does n't  force you to choose only one thing that 's most important ( i.e. , featured or on-sale status ) . <p> Ranking Score <p> The engine behind WIPS makes it easy to rate importance for your sorting order so you do n't  have to do this by hand . Simply tell WIPS what 's important to you , and it figures out how to display products based on what you 've indicated as important . <p> If you 're not sure where to start with your rankings , you can also check out the preset settings , which provide popular criteria and rankings for sorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'd recommend checking them out to see how rankings are adjusted . <p> Preset Sorting Options <p> If you 're displaying products anywhere else , you can also leverage the Infinite Product Sortings rankings via shortcode . For example , let 's say you 've created a post or page that displays a " clothing " category of products . Youd probably using a shortcode like this to do so : <p> This will show the newest products in that category first , as were ordering by date ( descending ) , meaning the newest date will come first . If you 'd like to replace this ordering with your WIPS rankings instead , you can replace the orderby parameter with metakeymbc instead , and remove the order parameter since it will no longer be needed . <p> This will show the same category , but leverage your WIPS ranking for sorting . You can use this for any product display shortcode that accepts the orderby attribute ! <h> Free Add-on : Sort by Sharing <p> There 's also a free add-on available for the plugin that adds a tenth ranking criterion : social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharedcount.com API , will allow you to rank products higher or lower in your sorting order depending on how many times the product has been shared via social media ( e.g. , on Twitter , Facebook , Pinterest , or others ) . <p> Sharing Count Add-on <p> This is a really cool feature that provides a different way of gauging product popularity instead of simply using pageviews or sales to determine which products are most popular , you can rank products that people like to share with friends higher in your catalog , which can help drive traffic to your store as more people share them . This add-on will also create a " Most shared " sorting option in the sorting dropdown on catalog and shop pages . <h> What will it look like ? <p> When WIPS is in action , you 'll be able to see the difference immediately . In the first example below , my products are shown in a random order ( I tried to sort them manually using the drag-and-drop product sorter , but got a bit tired of it = ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rankings I established using WIPS to favor products that are featured , highly rated , or frequently sold : <p> Without WIPS : My Random Order <p> With WIPS : Showcasing my Featured / Reviewed products <p> The difference for me is immediate my best products are automatically displayed first , and I 'm not wasting my default order on an alphabetical sort . When customers now visit my shop or category pages , theyll see the most important products first , and I 'm not limited to showcasing only bestsellers or featured products . <p> WIPS will also make some minor adjustments to the sorting dropdown . Rather than displaying a " Default " sorting order , which tells customers absolutely nothing of importance , it replaces this with an " Our selection " option . This tells customers that the products shown first are ones recommended by you or ones perceived as " more important " than others . <p> If you 're using the free add-on , an option to sort products by which are most shared will also be added . <p> Default WooCommerce Product Sorting <p> WIPS Enhanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and documentation is provided on the plugin site . However , I did n't  need to reference any of the documentation while using the plugin , since options were clear and tooltips made it easy to see if there was something missing in my store ( for example , a tooltip notification told me that I did n't  have any featured products at first ) . <p> I did find out about using the WIPS ranking in shortcodes by referencing the plugin documentation , which was really cool to know . However , I 'd guess that most users will be able to use the plugin easily without slogging through lots of documentation to get set up . <h> Conclusions <p> The ability to easily automatically set and change default sorting options will be a huge win for WooCommerce stores with hundreds of products . Even with about 50 products in my demo store , I found that using the custom drag-and-drop product sorting capabilities was very tedious , and would n't be something I 'd want to work with or change on a regular basis . <p> Instead of wasting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create optimal sorting manually , I was able to use WIPS to generate a sorting order ranked by the importance I place on several product attributes within a matter of minutes . This helps customers to quickly find what 's important in your store , and helps store admins to avoid the limits imposed by default WooCommerce ranking criteria . <p> I also really liked that I could easily update this sorting order with minimal effort on my part if I decided that I want to change what 's important to my customers . For example , I could favor on-sale items during clearance sales so that customers can quickly find bargains . The effort in doing so while using WIPS is far lower than using a manual custom sort alone , and would make me far more likely to update sorting order for my products as needed . <p> WooCommerce Infinite Product Sorting provides really great value for large stores at $21 , as the ability to automatically sort WooCommerce products and to quickly change that sorting will make managing hundreds of products far easier . <p> Note : This post . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 10 Comments <p> Hi Beka , thank you for your articles on this ! I hope its ok for me to ask you here but I am using virtue premium with wordpress.org and woocommerce and I have managed to set up products under menus in a way that it is not connected to my shop products link . So if someone wants to go through my menu item instead of through all my over 30 products and counting they will not be able to click on it to purchase it but they will just see a picture of the product . Then they have to go to a separate menu screen and click shop products in order to be able to purchase but then they can not have the menu categories . There must be a way to link this all together so I can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item in the menu and have it also be buy-able . Does that make sense ? Will you take a look on my site ? Thank you ! <p> Hey Sybella , seems like perhaps youd want to use the link to the product category in the menu instead of the custom pages you have ? That way it will output your products on these pages when clicked from the navigation instead of just images . <p> Hi Beka , Thanks for your reply . Do you know how I do that ? I am a newbie at doing websites and I have been learning through youtube videos . If you do n't  mind giving me a step by step or if you have an article already that does that and can point me in the right direction , I would SO appreciate it ! I am a visual learner and this has been admittedly very challenging to learn ! <p> OK , thank you for that link , so I read through it but I have already done everything it said to do I have created all the menus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and its not written in those directions is how do I then have the pages that I already created ( to form or populate the menu ) actually link to the shop products so a person can click on the product listed in the menu and then actually buy a product ? Right now I have the menu set up without issue , but if someone selects a product they are viewing from the menu it just opens as a pictureThere must be a way to somehow link the menu items in a way that let 's customer purchase it ? I know others must know this . I feel like it must be an obvious thing that I am missing as it makes no sense to have it set up like this <p> Right , I 'm saying the product categories should replace your current menu . Instead of linking to pages that you 've created from your menu , link directly to the product category instead . This will show a category page that looks like the shop page , so the custom pages you 've built would no longer be needed . 
@@98138166 @2338166/ <p> While its simple to sell physical gift cards that are redeemed in-store , as they can be treated like any other shippable product , setting up e-gift certificates or vouchers that can be emailed , downloaded , and redeemed online and/or in-store can require a bit of additional work . This is where the help of an add-on or custom code can elevate your eCommerce gift certificate offering . <p> Todays case study will take a look at a store that uses a WooCommerce add-on to provide gift certificate capabilities , as well as some custom code to extend what the plugin can do . <h> Gift Certificates in Action : Lobster Anywhere <p> However , they also run a very successful gift certificate program that will allow customers to send either emailed or mailed gift certificates , which can then be redeemed in the online store . They use the Smart Coupons extension ( $99 ) to set up most of the gift certificate functionality , and theyve made some custom changes for their workflow . <p> I spoke with the CEO of Lobster Anywhere to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code changes theyve made . <p> Gift certificates account for 40% of their revenue , so theyve worked very hard to streamline gift certificate purchasing . Because the products at Lobster Anywhere are perishable , they lend themselves very well very well to selling gift certificates , as their CEO points out : <p> Gift cards are a big part of our business . Since seafood is perishable , gift certificate are a good gift giving choice . Lobster lovers can select their own special dinner date . <p> To give their customers maximum flexibility while purchasing gift cards , they provide both email and mailed gift certificates , which allow customers to select a certificate value for redemption ( just like store cash ) . <p> However , they also offer product certificates , which will allow customers to purchase a specific gift " dinner " or package , which the recipient can redeem when desired . For example , the Sea of Love Dinner can be purchased , or a gift certificate for the dinner can be sent . <h> Offering Several Gift Certificate Types <p> I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores only offer gift certificates for certain amounts ( either pre-selected amounts , or they allow customers to enter an amount ) . However , adding certificates for a particular product is interesting , and is great if your products are time sensitive like the lobster dinners from Lobster Anywhere . <p> You can order a gift certificate for one of over a dozen lobster dinners . This is shipped as a paper certificate ( either first class mail or rushed via Fedex ) with a description of the package and a photo of the dinner . <p> Offering a Product Gift Certificate <p> This setup is great for perishable and date-based items . For example , event sites can sell a ticket certificate , and gift recipients can use it to select the show or date of their choice . <p> This setup is achieved by using Smart Coupons , as the product purchase delivers the coupon automatically . Smart Coupons allows you to tie coupons to the product in this way so that purchasing will automatically send the coupon . <p> The amount-based gift certificates are also generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift certificates , available as a physical gift card or as an e-certificate . We also refined the email template so customers can print out their gift certificates . Gift givers often like to print out a gift card and hand deliver when they are in a pinch rather than having to wait for the mail . <p> Email gift certificates <p> This gift certificates work in the same way Smart Coupons generates the gift certificate and its attached to the product so its delivered when the product is purchased . This certificate can then be redeemed in store just like a coupon code . <h> Customizing Gift Certificates <p> Since gift certificates account for almost half of all orders , Lobster Anywhere needed an easy way to manage them while viewing orders . As some are e-certificates , but some require shipping , using a different gift code structure provides and easy way to know what has to be shipped out , and what 's an online-only certificate . Lobster Anywhere customized the gift certificate code to reflect this , and they also automatically generate a new code for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special plugin for the gift codes . Right now the code starts with D + dollar amount + c + code for gift certificates , and SKU + code for gift dinners . Notes are are added to the order with the coupon code . Codes are all inserted automatically into the WooCommerce coupons . <p> For example a Boston Lobster Bake dinner for two would be something like BLB2-00aa0 &amp; a $50 dollar e-certificate would be GC50aa000 <p> This automates the coupon creation so that each coupon becomes a one-time use certificate . For mailed certificates , the gift code is placed in to a template that can be printed , while e-certificates have the code inserted in the custom email template . <p> As Smart Coupons emails are n't  really printer-friendly , the Lobster Anywhere team also customized these templates for easier printing with some inspiration from Tricksy Knitter : <p> We modified the Smart Coupons plugin to send better , more printer-friendly email . We designed a fully responsive email template that works with all major mail providers ( even the terrible ones like hotmail ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as holiday-themed certificates . <p> While customizations have helped them to make fulfilling gift certificate orders easier , there 's still room for improvement . <p> The one clunky thing with Smart Coupons is re-sending lost gift certificates . It would be neat if customers could retrieve lost gift certificates <p> Also , there could be a better way for customers to see how much they have left on a dollar amount certificate or see if it was already used . <p> Many eCommerce plugins and extensions provide a great starting point for projects , but there 's always room for improvement . Fortunately , the ability to extend these via custom code is usually great , and can yield very cool results like Lobster Anywheres automatic gift code generator . <h> Gift Certificate Program Impact <p> So does the Lobster Anywhere gift certificate program yield results similar to those in our reasons to sell gift certificates ? Here are some insights they shared about their program . <h> Reason 1 : Capture New Orders and Customers <p> The E-certificate has really helped with last minute sales especially for gift giving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lobster dinner ca n't be done far in advance , while buying a gift certificate can be done at any time , yielding far happier gift-giving customers . <h> Reason 2 : Increase Order Value <p> Lobster Anywhere confirms that gift certificate orders typically clock in at a higher value than the gift certificate amount , though for a slightly smaller percentage of orders than First Data reports ( their average statistics show that 71% of gift certificate orders are for higher than the gift card amount ) . <p> We see about 60% of customers will go over the gift certificate dollar amount , adding extra revenue . <p> While some certificates are for a product and not a dollar amount , the certificates for a particular amount have given a nice bump to revenue when customers order more than the certificate allots for . <h> Reason 3 : Offer Product Choices <p> The ability to offer product choice has been a huge win for Lobster Anywhere . As mentioned previously , products that are time or date sensitive make excellent candidates for gift certificate sales , whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The ability to offer this choice has improved gift-giving , as the gift giver no longer has to spoil the surprise by getting a specific delivery date from the recipient . With gift certificates , the recipient can select their own lobster dinner date . <p> The choice in physical versus e-gift cards is also exercised by customers , as purchasing is split between the two . <p> I would say it is 60% paper to 40% for e-certificate . <p> Many customers like the ability of providing a physical gift so they go for the paper / mailed certificate , while those pressed for time or who want instant delivery can get an e-certificate . <h> Increase Revenue by Selling Gift Cards : Summary <p> While gift certificate add-ons for eCommerce plugins may not always be a turnkey solution , they can provide a great foundation for a gift certificate program , which can be a lucrative addition to your business . They 're a wonderful option for time-sensitive products , and gift card sales can be a fairly easy way to generate additional revenue . <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats with us ! I 'm keeping the lobster mac and cheese and the clam chowder in mind for a future purchase myself = . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138167 @2338167/ <h> Automated Marketing to Boost WooCommerce Sales : AutomateWoo Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Weve written tons about selecting an eCommerce plugin for your store , and have lots of tips on customizing or improving your WordPress eCommerce shop . However , one of the toughest things to do is market your products . Marketing requires a lot of effort and time , and if you 're running a small eCommerce business , you may not have the manpower to devote to extensive marketing campaigns . <p> Automating your marketing efforts can go a long way into making them easier and more sustainable for you as a shop owner . Recently a very handy WooCommerce marketing plugin was released to help automate your marketing efforts and boost WooCommerce sales : AutomateWoo . <h> AutomateWoo Review : Overview <p> AutomateWoo helps to automate WooCommerce marketing via workflows for your marketing actions . Each workflow consists of a very simple system of one trigger and one or more actions . <p> A trigger let 's you determine what youd like to start a workflow from a completed order , an item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which action should be taken from that trigger an email sent , a user updated , an order updated , or more . <p> Each trigger starts the associated actions without any effort on your part , creating marketing actions that work for you to boost sales without requiring tons of time and attention . Here are some video overviews of the plugin in action . <p> AutomateWoo is currently $99 for a single site license , and provides tons of powerful marketing actions to help you boost WooCommerce sales . <h> AutomateWoo Review : Setup &amp; Configuration <p> To set up the plugin , you first need to activate your license , as you wont be able to access workflows or reports without it . You can do so under WooCommerce &gt; Setting &gt; AutomateWoo . <p> License Form <p> Once the license is validated , you can then access and create your workflows , as there 's nothing else needed to configure the plugin . <h> AutomateWoo Review : Creating Workflows <p> Workflows are very simple to set up , and can be created with a single " trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more " actions " to perform when the trigger happens . <p> A trigger can be something that happens with the order ( such as a status change or particular product purchase ) , something that happens with a user ( such as a new user or a period without a purchase ) , or an abandoned cart . <p> Choose Trigger <p> Once you select the trigger for your workflow , you can then set up the other criteria for the trigger . For example , if you select a lifetime spend trigger , you can determine the amount for this lifetime spend ( i.e. , spent $500 lifetime ) . <p> Trigger Setup <p> Once your trigger is configured , you can add one or more actions for that trigger . Actions can be sending an email , changing the user role or adding user meta , adding users to mailing lists , updating an order , or executing a custom function . <p> Choose Actions <p> Emails can contain several merge tags to personalize your emails when sent to customers . This is great for abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews . They can even generate a coupon to send to the customer . <p> Email Action <p> Let 's take a look at 5 quick examples for workflows that can be created to boost WooCommerce sales . I was able to set up several workflows in under a half-hour . <p> All Workflows <h> AutomateWoo : Automatically Create WooCommerce VIP Customers <p> You can automatically create a WooCommerce VIP customer in your store using AutomateWoo . This let 's you reward your most loyal customers to increase sales and WooCommerce customer lifetime value . <p> Youll first need to set up your workflow to determine what makes a customer a VIP . Your trigger will determine this . You can make a VIP from a single order value over a certain amount ( using an " Order Processing " trigger , as this represents a paid order ) , or when a customer lifetime total spend reaches a certain amount ( using a " Lifetime spend " trigger ) . <p> I 'll set up a single purchase amount of $300 to create a VIP customer . This let 's me change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed . If you use a plugin like Dynamic Pricing , you can give your VIP customers automatic discounts in your store . <p> VIP customer trigger <p> I can even send an email with an additional action to let the customer know of the change . <p> VIP email <p> If you wanted to take this further , you could also add VIP customers to a mailing list in your MailChimp / Campaign Monitor account for VIP-only marketing emails with an additional action . <h> AutomateWoo : Recover Abandoned WooCommerce Carts <p> AutomateWoo can help you recover your abandoned carts to boost WooCommerce sales . Over 68% of shopping carts are abandoned , so recovering these lost sales can increase revenue from sales you may not have otherwise captured . <p> To recover abandoned WooCommerce carts , you can set up a workflow using the " abandoned cart " trigger . This will let you send an email to the user to re-engage them and remind them to complete the purchase . You can also delay this email for one day to ensure that the customer had abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up multiple abandoned cart workflows so that you send additional abandoned cart follow ups to perhaps offer a coupon to incentivize the purchase . As most abandoned carts are left due to unexpected shipping costs , a free shipping coupon is a great inclusion in these emails , and I typically recommend including it in a second abandoned cart reminder . You can even auto-generate one with the user.generatecoupon merge tag . <p> Abandoned Cart Email <h> AutomateWoo : Re-Engage Inactive WooCommerce Customers <p> AutomateWoo has a trigger that I really love you can trigger a workflow based on how long its been since a customer made a purchase in your store to re-engage inactive WooCommerce customers . <p> Kissmetrics has great tips on re-engaging inactive subscribers , which AutomateWoo makes effortless . This workflow can add your inactive purchasers to a particular email list , for which you can send out periodic discounts or remove them from your regular emails . <p> Re-engage inactive customers <p> You can also send immediate emails targeted to inactive customers , and add user meta to their WordPress profile to track details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> AutomateWoo : Get WooCommerce Customer Feedback <p> Getting feedback from your customers is hugely valuable in improving your store , especially when you start out . You can find out what 's non-intuitive about your shopping process , what reservations about buying customers have , or why they decided to purchase from your site . This allows you to implement feedback and improve the shopping experience in your store . <p> AutomateWoo makes it simple to get feedback , as you can trigger a workflow to email customers after their first completed order in your store or when they first register an account . <p> Get Customer Feedback <p> This also gives you an opportunity to give coupons or promotions to new customers or those who engage with you to provide feedback , encouraging repeat purchases to boost sales . <h> AutomateWoo : Cross Sell or Upsell WooCommerce Products <p> You can create triggers for purchases that contain particular products or products in a category , which can allow you to upsell or cross-sell products . This let 's you market products to a highly engaged audience . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can send an email to cross-sell related products , such as cases , lenses , batteries , or memory cards . <p> Cross Sell Products <p> As these customers have already purchased from you , they 're interested in your store and are more likely to purchase again . Cross-selling related products is a great way to help customers find products they 're interested while increasing their lifetime value to your store . <p> These triggers can be used to create actions , such as emails or user status changes . <p> AutomateWoo includes some detailed reporting on sent emails as well under WooCommerce &gt; Reports &gt; AutomateWoo &gt; Email Tracking . You can view sent emails , opens , clicks , and unsubscribes . <p> Reports &gt; Emails <p> There are also reports to let you view logs of all workflow actions and to see any queued actions that have not yet been done . <p> Reports &gt; Logs <h> AutomateWoo : Other Comments <p> Typically while testing a plugin , you may run into weird issues or small bugs since you 're poking at all sort of functionality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the developer patches them up , but I did n't  run into any issues while installing and using AutomateWoo . The codebase is solid , and there 's documentation available to help you out with set up . All purchases also include a year of support . <p> There is one aspect of the plugin I disliked / found odd , which had to do with setup . The plugin " Workflows " menu will be hidden unless : <p> This means you can do no testing or set up until you go through license key activation ( which takes under a minute to be fair ) , or you 're using a site with a particular URL structure to try the plugin out , which may not fit your workflow . For example , I typically name my local sites something like test.com or woo.com , rather than dev.something or local.something , which means I could n't test the plugin there until I was ( 1 ) back online , so I could ( 2 ) activate the license . <p> Is this a deal breaker or issue in using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine . I think making the settings or menu non-obvious because its hidden at installation creates a worse experience for new users . They ca n't play with the plugin , nor do they have any idea where its functionality is until entering a license key , while it does n't  necessarily halt those avoiding the license since the menu can be forced to display with a small code snippet . <p> In speaking with Dan ( the developer behind AutomateWoo ) , I appreciated that he had a rational for this , as he wants to provide an incentive to keep a valid license and keep the plugin updated without making it non-GPL or obfuscated , so we very politely disagree = . <h> AutomateWoo Review : Summary <p> Overall , AutomateWoo is an extremely useful WooCommerce marketing plugin , and you can automate tons of marketing actions in your store . Its easy to use and set up , and it was dependable throughout my testing . <p> You can set up as many workflows as you 'd like to boost WooCommerce sales , re-engage inactive customers , increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store . The various triggers available let you automate tons of marketing campaigns , and this plugin let 's you easily implement various eCommerce best practices . <p> At $99 for a single-site license , this is a tremendous value for the different types of workflows you can set up and makes it a full-featured , top-notch WooCommerce marketing plugin . <p> Ready to give it a go ? You can start automating WooCommerce marketing today : <p> Note : This . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Great review . I really appreciate all the articles . Do you have an opinion on wich plugin is better for sending follow-up emails after a purchase : woocommerce follow-up emails or automate woo ? I am thinking these emails , in particular : <p> 10 days post purchase ; invite to leave product review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy again ( unless sku is subscription item ) send a different set of emails once a customer becomes a preferred member ( group ) <p> Hey Justin , both plugins will be able to do #1 and #2 for the second one ( only non-subscription products ) , the easiest way to do this would be to put all non-subscription items into a category and use that to trigger emails , as then you can use the " product in category " trigger for both . As for the last one , Follow Up Emails does n't  account for a customer type , but AutomateWoo will let you restrict emails to a certain customer type . However , this is based on the role the customer has , not a group ( i.e. , if you 're using the Groups plugin ) . 
@@98138168 @2338168/ <h> Improving Product Reviews : Add Employee Badges <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> If you could watch me shop online , youd see that I 'm crazy about reading product reviews . It does n't  matter to me if I 'm buying bath towels or a new TV . I 'm almost ashamed of how much time I 've spent reading the Sweethome or the Wirecutter . <p> I always try to ensure Im getting value for the money I spend , so product reviews are important to me ( and almost 9 in 10 shoppers ) . Research shows many online customers shop this way : <p> 85.57% of the participants stated that they read reviews often or very often before they purchase online . Of the participants who read reviews , 83.65% compare positive and negative reviews with each other . Advances in Economics and Business <p> Despite the overwhelming evidence that product reviews matter to online consumers , some eCommerce sites do n't  include reviews as part of their product pages because they either do n't  want to manage reviews , or are afraid that negative reviews will affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad reviews can happen ( though if you read our research on reviews , you know they can actually improve conversions ) . However , WordPress allows you the ability to respond to these reviews in a comment , which can show you customers a lot about your brand . You can address concerns or feedback so readers can see if the review is fair . <p> However , this upside can create an issue : how do customers know that the response is from the shop ? Some review systems allow customers to comment on reviews , which means that your answers to reviews may be mixed in with others . <p> You could require custom gravatars for all shop employees with your logo to set their comments apart , but adding a badge before their names is very easy to do and does n't  require you to use gravatars on your site . Badges will show customers which comments are " official " in order to draw attention to them and designate official answers vs customer replies . This easily solves the issue of knowing which reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review Employee Badges <p> Easy Digital Downloads does n't  include the ability to accept product reviews in the core plugin , but the Product Reviews extension ( $32 ) creates a review system for your downloads . Customers can leave a rating , write a review , and vote reviews as helpful or unhelpful . <p> However , this plugin is one that allows replies / comments for reviews , and thus your replies can be mixed in with customer comments and replies . Typical reviews and comments will just show the users name . <p> Standard reviews <p> Let 's add some badges to show which comments belong to store employees . As EDD is frequently used with the Frontend Submissions extension to create a marketplace , we may also want to display a badge for vendors to show that the product " owner " or vendor is replying . <p> here 's a code snippet that can be used in a custom site plugin , Code Snippets plugin , or your functions.php file to create badges . You 'll need to adjust the $badgetext set here for administrators and vendors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can differentiate them to show admins and vendors separately . You can also adjust the badge styles ( i.e. , the background color ) to match your site . <p> Once this code is added , this badge will appear before the comment authors name , indicating whether the commenter is a shop employee ( admin ) or a vendor and helping them tell customer replies apart from store replies . <p> Reviews with vendor and admin badges <h> WooCommerce Product Review Employee Badges <p> WooCommerce does n't  typically allow customer replies to reviews , so you probably wont need to add badges to your product comments . However , its not a bad idea if you want to make it obvious that replies are " official " and from you or your employees . Fortunately , you 've got a couple of options to add employee badges to your product reviews with WooCommerce . <p> If you use WooCommerce Product Reviews Pro ( $79 ) to add improved review capabilities ( and the ability to reply to reviews for both customers and shop employees ) , you 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is released . Version 1.0.5 adds a setting to add admin badges to any reviews , contributions , or comments added by shop administrators or managers : <p> Product Reviews Pro badge setting <p> If you 're using the built-in WooCommerce reviews , you will need some custom code to add badges . By default , all reviews and comments will look the same in your shop : <p> WooCommerce Product Review <p> Let 's add badges for both administrators and shop managers . Again , $badgetext and the styles can be changed as desired . <p> Once this code is added to your site , your employee answers to reviews will now contain a badge to show customers that the answer is coming directly from your shop . <p> Admin Review Badge <p> Shop Manager review badge <h> Product Review Badges for Other Plugins <p> Most other eCommerce plugins for WordPress have limited product reviews , or none whatsoever , but there 's a third-party plugin that can help you out here . If you use Shopp , iThemes Exchange , or WP eCommerce , you can add product reviews using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inc . <p> This plugin adds ratings , reviews , and " helpful " voting for comments . If ratings are required for reviews , only shop admins can reply to them . However , if you do n't  require ratings , customers can leave replies as well . <p> Easy Ecommerce Reviews in action <p> Add admin badges with Easy Ecommerce Reviews is pretty easy as well . Ill use Shopp in this example , but this snippet will work for any other eCommerce platform as well . Shopp creates a " customer service manager " role that would be helpful to check for , so I 'll include that here and you can change the badge text for admins and shop managers as needed . Note that this snippet will still work for other platforms . <p> Once added , your shiny new badges will be displayed with the comment authors name . <p> Reviews with admin and customer service badges <p> Product reviews should be an important part of any eCommerce site , and badges to designate " official " responses can help you insure that they show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can also help you build trust by showing how you respond to both positive and negative reviews publicly , and they 're very simple to implement . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138169 @2338169/ <h> Set WooCommerce Delivery Dates with the Order Delivery Date Plugin <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Stores that sell standard products rarely encounter the need for more functionality when selecting or using an eCommerce platform . Most platforms offer the ability to sell tee shirts or other simple products , then send those products to customers and charge them . However , there are tons of other business models in the eCommerce space that will require some specific functionality to make sure the business runs smoothly . <p> The way your products get into the hands of your customers is one aspect of your business that may require some additional features . For example , what if you 'll ship to customers using UPS rates or allow customers to schedule delivery or pickup times ? You 'll need to extend the basic WooCommerce functionality to do so . <h> Table of Contents <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro plugin <p> WooCommerce includes core shipping methods for both Local Delivery and Local Pickup : <p> However , these core methods are a bit lacking for many stores . While you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's no way to accept date or time slots . <p> As a customer , I love delivery . Especially for large items like furniture , or for time sensitive items that I buy locally , like flowers . However , I definitely want to be able to select when the delivery person should be showing up while I make my purchase . <p> Local Delivery Shipping <p> The WooCommerce Order Delivery Date plugin is designed to make setting WooCommerce delivery dates and pickup times easy and flexible in order to fix this problem . You can enable the ability for customers to select a delivery date , date with a customizable time , or date with a time slot . <p> Pricing ranges from $99 to $249 , which depends on how many stores you 'll use the plugin for . If you 'd like to take the plugin for a test drive before purchasing , you can check out the Frontend demo or Admin demo . There are also FAQs available to help you determine if the plugin is right for your shop . <p> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduler as well , as it supports any model that would require a date and time for customers on a per-order basis . <h> WooCommerce Delivery Dates : Setup &amp; Usage <p> Setting up WooCommerce delivery dates , pickup times , or any date / time information for orders is really simple . Youll first determine if you want to allow delivery on specific days , such as Monday Wednesday Friday , or only on certain dates . This will determine how you configure the plugin . <p> All settings are located under the Order Delivery Date menu . I 'm going to set up a schedule of days so that the available deliveries will repeat each week under the " Date Settings " . You simply have to check which days to enable , and enter the fee for delivery if the day incurs one ( you can otherwise enter 0 or leave it blank ) . <p> Day Settings <p> I also really liked the ability to tweak delivery availability on those days and how far in advance it can be scheduled . From the same settings page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule delivery , as well as how many days in advance customers can schedule delivery . This is handy for large items like furniture , as you probably do n't  want purchased items taking up space long after being sold while you could be bringing in new inventory . <p> You can also opt to include the date information in confirmation emails and lock out delivery after a certain number of orders . This gives you a sort of " stock " management system for your deliveries on a given day . <p> After setting up my WooCommerce delivery dates , I checked out the " Time Settings " page . You can use this to allow customers to select a custom time for a delivery . This will create a slider for both the hours and minutes so they can choose any time within the range you 've configured for delivery , pickup , or whatever you 're using the plugin to schedule . <p> Time Settings <p> Here is also where you can set expedited fees for same day or next day delivery that will be added to any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , so customers ordering after this time will not be able to select these delivery options . <p> If you do choose to enable the " time capture " option so customers can select a time , note that you should not use time slots in addition to this , as it will be confusing for customers , and for you when looking at orders . <p> Choose a time selector <p> ( The top time is a time capture , while the bottom is a time slot . ) <p> If you 'd instead like to use a time slot dropdown , you can go to the " Time Slots " settings . These settings will let you enable time slots and create each available slot . You can also lock out new orders once a time slot has been selected a certain number of times , which acts like " stock " management for your delivery personnel . <p> Create time slots <p> Now that I 've got my basic delivery options set up , I can finish out the rest of the options . The " Appearance " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your delivery options , your date format and calendar theme , as well as set up the labels for your delivery options . WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro is also compatible with WPML for stores using WPML to create multilingual sites . <p> You can determine how many months should be shown when customers use your calendar on the checkout page as well . <p> Appearance settings <p> Finally , I set up my " Holiday " settings . Any dates you enter as a holiday will become unavailable in the calendar on the checkout page . If a customer tries to select a holiday date , it will be displayed as " Holiday " so they know why its unavailable . <p> Holiday Settings <p> As a last note , there is one setting that I did n't  need for my setup , but could be used the " Delivery Dates " setting . I could use this to allow delivery on specific dates rather than based on a day of the week . You can use this instead of the " Date Settings " if preferred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The WooCommerce delivery date and time picker will now be shown on your checkout page right after the billing fields . <h> WooCommerce Delivery Date : Customer Experience <p> Once you 've set up all fields in the admin , customers will be able to view and select your WooCommerce delivery dates , times , or time slots . <p> Available dates <p> I set up my calendar to display 2 months with the time capture option . This allows customers to set whatever time they want for delivery or pickup . Customers simply select a date and use the sliders at the bottom to set hours and minutes for the time of their choice . <p> Time capturing <p> This is super handy for shops that allow pickup , as customers can tell you when theyll arrive so that you can have the order prepared and ready to be carted away . I would have preferred a larger interval than " per minute " , such as customers being able to move a slider for every 10-15 minutes so you do n't  get a time like 10:53 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to configure the time of their choice . <p> If you use time slots instead of the time capture , customers will simply select a pre-set time slot from a dropdown menu , which is really handy for scheduling local deliveries or services where you do n't  have an exact time available . <p> If you 've set any fees for your delivery dates or same / next day delivery , these will be displayed in the order details table to inform customers before they check out . <p> Next day charges <p> While you do n't  have to use any shipping methods for this plugin to work , you may also allow shipping or delivery / pickup for your products . If that 's the case , its helpful to use this conjunction with the WooCommerce local delivery or pickup shipping methods so that customers can select this at checkout . Just be sure that you do n't  add fees to both the shipping method and the WooCommerce delivery date . <p> I 'd then add instructions for customers to make it clear which shipping method they should select if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkout page . You can do so easily with a tiny code snippet ( here are instructions on how to add code to your site ) . <p> This will add our horizontal bar and text right above the delivery field options so that customers are aware of which shipping method to select . <p> Add text before fields <p> You could also use something like the WooCommerce Advanced Free Shipping plugin to create a method for this since the delivery charges will not be added as part of the shipping method , but rather as a separate line item , so it does n't  matter which shipping method you choose . <p> One other thing I did to make the customer experience smoother was to remove the ( Free ) label from after the Local Delivery and Local pickup shipping methods using this snippet . <p> However , I made a minor change . Instead of replacing " ( Free ) " with a blank space , I added a notice about the fees that would be applied . My string replace instead looked like this : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $label <p> This is an easy way to inform customers of charges theyll incur , and it will be displayed with the shipping method . <p> Day-based charges <p> Finally , customers can view any selected delivery or pickup dates and times when they view an order from the " My Account " page : <p> Overall , the date picker is very easy for customers to use , and flexible enough to be used for any checkout , as its not tightly tied to a shipping method . This let 's you use it without a shipping method at all , or with any method of your choice . Just be sure that customers know what to do = . <h> WooCommerce Delivery Dates : Managing Orders <p> Once customers have gone through the checkout process and selected a delivery date and/or time , this information will be displayed as part of the order , and can be edited by an admin . <p> Youll be able to get a birds eye view of all scheduled delivery dates when viewing the " Orders " screen , as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) will be added . <p> Orders page <p> Your WooCommerce delivery date or pickup time will also be displayed on the order itself so that it can be managed or changed as needed . <p> Order details with time capture <p> Order details without time capture <p> If you need to edit or add WooCommerce delivery dates or pickup information , you can do so from the " Custom Fields " section of the order . You 'll use your field name , such as " Delivery date " or " Pickup time " to set this value , and can also set or edit time slots . <p> Delivery option custom fields <p> Any charges for delivery will also be added to the order as line items , which means you can edit or add them as needed . <p> Fee line items <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date : Adding Orders <p> Overall , setting up and managing orders with the plugin is very simple , and I was up and running within 15-20 minutes . Unless you need to change time slots or dates , you wont have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is fantastic . <p> The only thing you may need to do is manually schedule a WooCommerce delivery date or pickup time . For example , if you take phone orders , you may need to enter this information for a customer . You can do so by creating a new order . <p> The new order wont have our pickup time yet , and we cant set it with the billing details . Instead , well set it elsewhere . <p> Once you 've added your products to the order , keep scrolling down to the " Custom fields " . Your delivery options are set as order custom fields , which you can add or edit as needed . Add a custom field for your date and use the label name , i.e. , " Delivery Date " , " Pickup day " , etc . You can also enter a time slot if using one . <p> Add Custom Fields <p> Once you 've added your delivery information , do n't  forget to add any fees as needed to the order table , such as a delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can then calculate taxes and totals for the order . <p> Finally , save the order . Your delivery information is now saved and will be displayed for the order and in the column on the " Orders " page . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date : Support &amp; Docs <p> Should you need any help while setting up or using the plugin , there are several support resources available . The documentation was n't really needed when I set up the plugin , as settings were clear and easy to follow . However , it was pretty helpful when I read through the differences in using time slots vs time capture for delivery times . <p> When you purchase the plugin , you are provided with a license that expires after one year ( though it can be renewed at a discounted rate ) . Your license includes support , so you can ask questions or get help via the plugin forums or through an email ticket with the support staff . <p> I did n't  need to use any support resources while using the plugin , but responses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check these out yourself . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date : Other Comments <p> While the plugins main " advertised " feature is to allow you to set WooCommerce delivery dates , there are several other uses for a calendar / time picker on your checkout page . This can be used as a lite version for a booking system , such as one that will allow you to schedule coaching , meetings , or phone calls . You can also use it create WooCommerce order pickup times instead of delivery times . <p> Since its not tied into a particular shipping method , you can use it for any scheduling on a per-order basis . <p> The only concerns I had with the plugin are related to the code structure . The code does n't  always use namespacing for functions or constants , which has the potential to cause conflicts . For example , if I were to make a plugin that let 's you sort products in the shop , I 'd probably include something like wcshopsorter in front of my functions and constants so they wo n't have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which can crash your site ) . The constants like CALENDARTHEME in the plugin have the potential to cause conflicts with other calendar-related plugins . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date : Conclusions <p> I loved that the WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro plugin was very simple to use for both shop administrators and customers . The ability to select both dates and times helps any shop schedule deliveries or pickups , but I really found the options to set " inventory " by limiting the number of deliveries useful . The same day and next day fees and cutoff times are also great , and automate your delivery scheduling completely . <p> Order management is simple , and you can view all delivery or pickup dates and times right from the " Orders " view to easily understand how many deliveries have to go out on a given day . I would love to see an add-on for this to display or export a calendar of delivery dates , but they 're easy enough to manage as-is . I had a couple of qualms about code structure , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you want to allow for WooCommerce delivery dates , pickup dates and times , order-based scheduling , or any other scheduling functions in your checkout process , this plugin is a simple and easy tool to help you add them and manage inventory for your dates and time slots .

@@98138170 @2338170/ <p> What 's better that finding a cool WooCommerce extension ? Finding cool , free WooCommerce extensions . We 've already posted a list of 12 of the best free WooCommerce extensions if you missed it , and were looking to add on to that list with more free WooCommerce plugins here . <p> The most powerful thing about WooCommerce is the ability to extend it as needed . There are hundreds of great WooCommerce extensions available in the WooThemes marketplace , but there are also several handy free WooCommerce add-ons floating around that you should check out . Here are some of our new favorites ( and yes , weve actually installed and used these ) : <h> 1 . Simplify Commerce <p> The Simplify Commerce extension is developed by WooThemes to add Simplify Commerce from Mastercard to your store ( for US based merchants only currently ) . While free payment gateways are n't  something we usually recommend as you 'll need to be guaranteed that these will be maintained and updated for security , the fact that this is offered from the core WooThemes team as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept all major credit cards using this gateway , and both a merchant account and processing capabilities are included if you sign up for Simplify Commerce . <p> You 'll still need an SSL certificate to use this payment gateway integration since payment data is collected on your site . <h> 2 . WooCommerce Advanced Free Shipping <p> This is a really cool plugin that allows you to add multiple free shipping methods , and to change when free shipping is offered based conditions that you set , such as country , cart value , products in cart , and more . For example , you can offer free shipping for US-based customers if orders are $50 or more , but require orders of $100 or more for free shipping for Canadian customers . You can add " and " conditions ( for example , cart subtotal of $50 AND US-based ) , or add " or " conditions ( such as a cart subtotal of $50 OR a special coupon , though I might just make 2 methods for this ) . <p> The only thing I 'd recommend doing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping method name , as this is appended to any methods aside from the core free shipping if the cost is $0 . You can use this snippet in the bottom of your themes functions.php to do so : <h> 3 . WooCommerce Cart Tab <p> The next free WooCommerce plugin is developed by James Koster , who 's one of the core WooCommerce developers . It adds a nifty floating cart tab to the right of your site pages ( except the cart and checkout ) . This way , users can view a cart total off to the side of every page that scrolls with them . If they want to view the cart contents , they simply hover over the tab and it slides out to show a cart widget , as well as buttons to view the cart or check out . <p> You can also view settings under the WooCommerce " Product " settings to change the cart tab display to the left side of the page , or use a dark color scheme vs a light color scheme . <h> 4 . WooCommerce Email Validation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validation simply adds a " confirm email address " field to your checkout to ensure that customer email addresses are correct . <p> If the two email addresses entered do not match , a notice is displayed and checkout is not completed . This is really handy for shops that sell digital products , as these may be emailed to the customer after checkout , so its imperative that the email address on hand is correct . <h> 5 . WooCommerce Bundle-Style Coupons <p> WooCommerce Bundle-Style Coupons adds an extra option for your store coupons to only allow discounts on a " bundle " of products . If this setting is enabled , a coupon will require all products to which the coupon applies to be in the cart at the same time , or the coupon will return an invalid notice . <p> For example , let 's say I want to offer a discount on a particular jacket if you buy a shirt or a hat with it . You can enable the " bundle-style " option , limit the coupon usage the jacket and companion product , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are present in the cart . <h> 6 . WooCommerce Menu Cart <p> This is another simple but free WooCommerce extension . WooCommerce Menu Cart adds a cart widget to your navigation . You can enable your menu under " Settings &gt; Menu Cart " and determine in which navigation menu the cart should be displayed . You can choose to display the number of items , price , or both , as well as enable a few other settings . This provides an alternative to the cart tab or cart widget that can be slightly less intrusive . <h> 7 . Pushover for WooCommerce <p> The Pushover for WooCommerce integration allows you to get automatic Pushover notifications send to the Pushover app on your mobile devide for store events . You can be notified of new orders , low stock , backorders , and out of stock products . <h> 8 . WooCommerce Bulk Discount <p> WooCommerce Bulk Discount let 's you apply flat or percentage discounts based on ordered quantity for a specific product . You can determine whether to offer flat or percentage-based discounts under the plugin settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply bulk discounts for certain quantity breaks for the product page , and add a notification for the discount that appears below the category / tags on the product page . You can add several tiers for discounts for each product . <p> Pricing will not be reflected on the product page , but when customers view the cart and checkout , a discount notice is shown to include the discount level . You can also optionally show a messsage at the top of the cart page if a discount is being applied . <h> 9 . WooCommerce Grid / List toggle <p> here 's another super-simple plugin . Grid / List toggle does exactly what the name implied : A toggle button is added to your " Shop " page so that customers can choose their preferred view . Shop owners can normally select one of these views in the settings , but this plugin gives customers the choice in how theyd like to browse products . <h> 10 . WooCommerce Product Video Tab <p> The name says it all for our last plugin WooCommerce Product Video tab adds an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When activated , the plugin adds a " Video Tab " option under product data , and you can set the tab name and embed a video from any source using an embed code ( you can usually get this while watching a video and clicking " Share " ) . This is great for video demos or walkthroughs for a product , as customers can see the product in action before purchasing . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey David , you can limit your flat rate method to the USA , then use the " International Delivery " method for the rest of the world . Just exclude the USA from the countries list for the International Delivery method . If you 'd like to set different rates for different regions , you could also check out the Table Rate Shipping extension . <p> You really simplied E-commerce for me . Its a great list of Plugins that you have put up . But I am stuck in a situation . I want all my product Variation Combinations to appear in a tabular form rather than drop-down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Hey Jesse , afraid I 've not seen something that does that : I thought Product Add-ons might be helpful , but it looks like you can only add fees on a per-category and not per-attribute basis . You could probably automate this with a bit of custom code if you have too many products to manage it manually . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138171 @2338171/ <h> Building a Membership Community with WordPress <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Most purchases are straight-forward and easy for consumers to understand : the transaction is completed up front by paying for items that provide immediate value . For example , think of a new laptop : you 'll pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to purchase the laptop , the get value from it as soon as its in your hands and throughout its lifetime . Customers can judge pretty easily whether the initial cost will yield an equal or larger value over the course of the items life . <p> However , many membership sites do not follow this model . Instead , a recurring fee is charged each month . While this business model can help to be more sustainable for the business owner , it makes purchasing decisions more complicated for the customer . Now instead of a simple value vs cost analysis , the customer has to continually evaluate whether the monthly payment provides enough value during each renewal period . <p> As a membership site owner , it can be very challenging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue with a subscription each month . You can publish new content , add new member benefits , or send new products ( in the case of subscription box memberships or similar ) . However , one very sustainable way to maintain value for your members is to build a membership community . <p> Weve written a lot about membership plugins for WordPress , but most of the time were focused on restricting content you generate as a site owner or products you may sell . Instead , you can focus on cultivating a community of members so that member engagement helps to drive renewals and lower your membership churn . <h> Building a Membership Community with WordPress <p> Building a membership community is n't going to simply produce automated income with minimal effort I 'd recommend reading this interview on membership communities from the Bright Agency for an inside look at a successful membership community site . It takes lots of work in terms of moderation , engaging members , and teaching them how to interact in your community . <p> However , building that engagement is a huge motivator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a high enough value that renewing the membership every period is a no-brainer . This quote from the interview really stuck out to me : <p> I 'm actually surprised at how attached people are to the community . I 'm totally baffled . There are some people that deeply care about folks in this community . Its fascinating . <p> If people can find some topic that they can reach out and touch and revolve around , they 're very willing to do it . <p> Making connections with other members is a powerful motivator , and it can help to sustain and build your membership site . Two plugins that can be really helpful to build this kind of membership community are BuddyPress , which can help you create your own member / social network , and bbPress , which let 's you create forums . <p> Not all plugins support BuddyPress and / or bbPress , so well give you a brief overview of some popular membership plugins that support them and what that support includes . <h> Membership Community : Restrict Content Pro <p> Restrict Content Pro ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several great features for membership sites . We 've published a full review as well as an update for version 2.1 previously , and the plugin has added a few more features since then , such as WooCommerce support . <p> It wont support BuddyPress or bbPress out of the box , but can certainly do so with a little bit of help . <p> However , it does n't  yet give you the ability to restrict certain BuddyPress features to your RCP members . You could work with a developer to hide BuddyPress components to RCP members , but the RCP BuddyPress plugin says this is coming soon : <p> I 'd recommend checking out if any of these are in development already ; if not , you 'll need to work with a developer for more comprehensive bbPress integration . <h> bbPress <p> There 's a free bbPress connector plugin available for Restrict Content Pro , which let 's you restrict forums , topics , and replies based on the RCP membership : <p> You should note that restricting a category will not automatically restrict forums , topics , or replies that belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics directly to prevent direct access via URL access to topics and replies . <h> Membership Community : iThemes Exchange <p> iThemes Exchange is a free eCommerce plugin , and we 've written several articles on using it for eCommerce and membership sites : <p> To get membership capabilities , along with bbPress and BuddyPress support , you 'll want to purchase the Exchange Pro Pack ( $197 ) . The Membership Add-on is included in the Pro Pack , and its very easy to set up and use while it offers flexible and simple restriction and dripping rules . <h> BuddyPress <p> The Exchange Pro Pack includes the BuddyPress add-on , which let 's you restrict BuddyPress pages to your members . This gives you a basic BuddyPress integration where you can restrict certain BuddyPress content to your members only . <p> I 've not used this add-on , so I 'm not sure how tight the integration is between Exchange and BuddyPress , though it looks like its just focused on restricting BuddyPress content . <h> bbPress <p> The bbPress add-on for Exchange is also included in the Pro Pack , and let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When installed , it adds the Membership add-on meta box to the forum / topic / reply editor : <p> Forums , topics , and replies will also be available for restriction and content dripping rules while editing one of your memberships : <p> Membership Content Dripping <p> There are a couple of downsides to note while using the Exchange bbPress integration : <p> restricting a category will not automatically restrict forums , topics , or replies that belong to that category ; forums and topics are accessible directly <p> restricting a forum will not restrict direct access via URL to topics in the forum <h> Membership Community : MemberPress <p> I do n't  use MemberPress ( $99 ) too often since I 'm usually using an eCommerce solution along with a membership plugin ( like Easy Digital Downloads or WooCommerce ) , but its an excellent alternative completely focused on membership sites . <p> MemberPress has really flexible content restriction and dripping rules , its easy for developers to extend , and it has fantastic billing rules , such as proration , upgrades , and downgrades . <h> BuddyPress <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what MemberPress can do in terms of restricting custom URLs , it should be simple to restrict URLs like /forums/ for members-only so that forums are completely private . <h> Membership Community : s2Member <p> S2Member ( $89 ) is another plugin Ive not used too much , but as a very mature membership plugin for WordPress , its had a lot of time to develop support for several popular plugins , including bbPress and BuddyPress. <h> bbPress <p> bbPress restrictions in order to limit member access to forums , topics , and replies is also possible . I 'm not sure how this operates in terms of category restrictions flowing down to child forums or topics within a restricted forum also being restricted , but would love to hear it if you 've got experience using these plugins together . <h> Membership Community : Paid Memberships Pro <p> Paid Memberships Pro is a free plugin with several add-ons available , which makes it great to use for DIYers or sites that already work with a developer . If you do n't  work with a developer and need help our support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $97 per year . <h> BuddyPress <p> Paid Memberships Pro is n't necessarily compatible with BuddyPress out of the box , but compatibility is possible if you work with a developer or if you have access to a support membership . For example , you can update BuddyPress profiles with Paid Memberships Pro information . You could also use some custom code to restrict BuddyPress components to members . <p> However , this is n't a turnkey solution and you 'll need to do some legwork to make them play nicely together . <h> bbPress <p> Paid Memberships Pro offers a free bbPress add-on , which will add the ability to restrict your forums to certain membership levels . When you edit a forum , you 'll be able to select the members that have access . <p> The good thing about this add-on is that the restrictions will be inherited by " child " objects . For example , if you restrict a category , all forums , topics , and replies in that category will be restricted . If a user tries to access the topic directly , they 're redirected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message is shown . <p> The downside is that , while you can restrict categories or forums , you cant restrict individual topics / replies . <p> This is a better solution for people that have a shop and a membership component to the site rather than sites that are exclusively devoted to content-based memberships . <h> BuddyPress <p> WooCommerce Memberships does not yet have a specific integration for BuddyPress . You can restrict the BuddyPress pages , such as the " Groups " index , but this wo n't stop non-members from accessing a group via a direct URL , and only prevents browsing to the group . <p> An improved BuddyPress integration is on the idea board for voting , so its something you can vote for to keep in the loop as to its status . <p> However , most any kind of membership site can benefit from creating a membership community , and they can all help you build a community in some way with bbPress or BuddyPress. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> One Comment <p> One plugin we wrote about recently that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support BuddyPress , it does have a tight integration with bbPress to let you create a simple members-only forum .

@@98138174 @2338174/ <p> One of the best things about using WordPress eCommerce plugins is the ability to extend their functionality via add-on plugins so that you can create an ideal solution for your online store . Jigoshop is no exception to this there are lots of free and premium extensions for Jigoshop that can help you tailor functionality to suit your stores needs . <p> Here are 9 useful free Jigoshop extensions that you should test out in your Jigoshop store : <h> 1 . Jigoshop Product Add-ons <p> This plugin is awesome . Seriously , this is a super-handy extension for Jigoshop , and its a huge bonus that its free . Using Product Add-ons , you can create text fields , dropdowns , checkboxes , file uploads , etc. , to customize your products that can optionally add costs to your items . When the option is selected , the cost is automatically added to the item cost in the cart and at checkout , and options are added to the checkout and order for reference . The only way this could get better is if you could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product description / excerpt if needed . <h> 2 . Jigoshop CSV Importer <p> The Jigoshop CSV Importer will allow you to import all product types into your Jigoshop store . This is really handy if you 've been selling with a different platform , as you can download a CSV of your products from that platform , ensure that your formatting is correct , then upload them directly to your Jigoshop store . You can import : <h> 3 . WP Menu Cart <p> This is a simple but cool extension . WP Menu Cart adds a cart widget to your navigation menu . You can enable the menu cart under " Settings &gt; Menu Cart " and determine in which navigation menu the cart should be displayed . You can display the number of items , price , or both , and enable a few other settings . There 's also a pro version that allows you to upgrade for some extra features if you like having this cart widget displayed . <h> 4 . WP Cart Mailcheck <p> WP Cart Mailcheck helps cut down on errors with email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for proper structure and suggests changes to customers to ensure that email addresses are entered correctly . This is especially important if you 're selling downloadable products and customers will need to receive an email for download links or license keys . <h> 5 . Jigoshop Store Exporter <p> This plugin allows you to export products , categories , and tags to CSV very easily . You can export all products and select which fields should be included in the CSV , or export products by category , status , or type ( including variations ) . There are handy settings for changing character encoding and file names , and you can view archives of all exports . <h> 6 . Jigoshop Video Product Tab <p> This is a really simply plugin that let 's you add more detail to your product pages . When enabled , a tab for videos is automatically added to the " Edit Product " screen . You can embed your sales or informational videos here , and theyll be displayed in a new tab on the product page . <h> 7 . Shipworks Connector <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ShipWorks for order fulfillment . ShipWorks includes support for viewing rates , transit times , and printing live shipping online status of each order using ShipWorks as your external shipper. <h> 8 . Jigoshop Basic Weight Shipping <p> The core Jigoshop plugin includes support for flat rate and free shipping , but nothing for weight-based shipping . This plugin adds a weight-based shipping method so that you can ship orders based on the weight of the included products . As most shipping rates are dependent on weight , this can be really helpful if you sell items with a huge variance in size , or can protect you from losing money on shipping for large orders . You set a maximum weight for each tier ( there are five tiers possible ) , and add a cost for each weight tier . <h> 9 . Jigoshop Basic Bundle Shipping <p> This plugin gives you a bit more control over your order shipping methods . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a minimum and maximum shipping rate . This will then increment based on the number of products in the cart . For example , you can charge $3.00 for shipping for the first product . You can then charge $1.00 more for each additional product in the order . You can also optionally cap the number of products to charge for . <p> For example , if I cap the charged products at 3 , then I 'll charge $3.00 for the first product , plus $1.00 each for the next two products . This brings the maximum shipping cost per order to $5.00 . If you use this shipping method , you 'll want to disable flat rate shipping . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Jigoshop Shipping extensions are all really bad . All of them .

@@98138175 @2338175/ <h> Drop Shipping vs Order Fulfillment <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is a guest post from James Radwanski . James is a writer and content marketing consultant . <p> Online retailers have more options than ever when it comes to getting orders into customers hands . In todays fiercely competitive business world , no retailer can afford to drag its feet when it comes to fulfilling online orders . Consumers have come to expect rapid turnaround when placing orders online , so the only way to compete is by having a smooth , reliable system in place . Behemoths like Amazon can easily afford to fill massive warehouses with thousands of different products , but smaller operations walk a fine line and typically have to choose between two options : drop shipping and order fulfillment . So , which option is right for you ? <h> Drop Shipping vs Order Fulfillment : What 's the Difference ? <p> There 's a lot of confusion out there about drop shipping and order fulfillment . Many online business owners consider them to be interchangeable , but that 's not the case at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order fulfillment and being familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each , you can more easily identify the one that 's right for your business . <h> Order Fulfillment Defined <p> As the term implies , order fulfillment is the process of fulfilling a customers order . It does n't  matter whether this is done by locating , packing , and shipping an order from your own warehouse or by outsourcing the work to a third party . However , when most people refer to order fulfillment , they 're talking about companies that stock their own inventory and fulfill orders themselves . <p> Most WordPress eCommerce plugins assume that you 'll be fulfilling orders yourself , as theyll provide the ability to set up flat rate or table rate shipping methods that you can charge to customers for shipping . Many also provide the ability to get real-time shipping rates by integrating with shipping services . For example , WP EasyCart integrates with 4 different providers for real-time shipping rates in the core plugin . <h> Drop Shipping Defined <p> Drop shipping is a kind of order fulfillment . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manufacturer or a wholesaler , who then ships products directly to your customers and sends you the bill . Its then up to you to bill your customer for the associated shipping costs . <h> Advantages and Disadvantages <p> The best way to decide between fulfilling orders yourself or leaving it to the wholesaler or manufacturer is by understanding the pluses and minuses of both options . For some businesses , directly fulfilling orders is the best way to go . For others , it makes a lot more sense to let others handle it . <h> Order Fulfillment : Pros and Cons <p> With order fulfillment , you have direct control over your inventory , so you know precisely what you have and how much you have of it . Companies such as DHL have made order fulfillment a big business by offering shipping , tracking , and other management tools and services . In this way , you 're better able to avoid inadvertently selling a customer an out-of-stock item . There also tends to be a better profit margin when fulfilling orders yourself because wholesalers offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own inventory . <p> There are also usually a lot of great tools for tracking and managing orders you 've sent yourself . I mentioned DHL earlier as its one of my favorite services there are several WordPress eCommerce integrations available for DHL shipments and tracking . WP EasyCart will let you get real-time rates from DHL and share tracking information with customers , and an integration for WooCommerce is planned and in early stages of development . <p> Several cart plugins will also allow you to share tracking information for orders shipped with DHL or other services . WooCommerce has a Shipment Tracking extension that allows you to provide tracking information to customers , and the Jigoshop Shipping Details extension does the same thing . Cart66 Pro will also allow you to share DHL and other tracking numbers with customers . <p> However , there are considerable drawbacks to fulfilling orders yourself . Most notably , you need large amounts of cash to ensure that you have the right amount of inventory . You have to manage that inventory and know how to replenish it in a timely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , and renting warehouse space can be very expensive . <h> A Note About Outsourced Order Fulfillment Providers <p> There 's a third option : using an outsourced order fulfillment warehouse to receive , store , and ship items on your behalf ( such as Shipwire or similar ) . You still have control over your inventory , but you do n't  have to deal with handling the products or storing , packing , and shipping them . You will be charged on a per-shipment basis , which adds to your bottom line , but you 'll gain access to shipping rates you otherwise would n't get as they 're negotiating bulk shipping rates . <h> Drop Shipping : Pros and Cons <p> There are lots of advantages to opting for drop shipping instead , so its easy to see why so many online sellers go this route . There 's no need to drop a ton of cash to invest in inventory , so you can get started right away without going into the red . Its easier to test new products because you do n't  have to stock up on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking , packaging , and shipping of your products , so you can focus on running , growing , and expanding your business . <p> Not everything about drop shipping is advantageous . Discounts tend to be lower , so your profit margins will be tighter . Odds are that many other online retailers are availing themselves of the same drop shipping services , so offering competitive prices tends to be more difficult . Returns can be major nightmares because you are in the middle : customers still have to deal with you to request them , and you then have to deal with the drop shipper . Finally , without direct access to inventory levels , its all too easy to accidentally sell items that are out of stock and that may not be replenished for a long time , which makes for very unhappy customers . <h> The Bottom Line <p> If you have the cash reserves that are needed to stock your own inventory , direct order fulfillment may be a suitable option . If you require more flexibility and have less cash to throw around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the best benefits of both options , outsourcing the work to an order fulfillment warehouse that receives , stores , and ships items for you may be the optimal solution . <h> Read More <p> Here are a couple of other resources comparing drop shipping vs direct order fulfillment : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

In this months Email Case Study , we look at a purchase receipt email from Michael Kors online store . <p> After a customers interaction with your online store has completed , emails are one of the most important ways to continue to build customer loyalty . Lifecycle emails can not only help build your brand , but also increase sales by encouraging repeat purchases , or getting helpful referrals . <p> Let 's start our discussion of the Michael Kors purchase receipt email by looking at what was good , what was bad , and what got us to engage . <h> Purchase Receipt Breakdown : Overview <p> Were starting with a purchase receipt email since they 're a commonly overlooked marketing opportunity for your store . Purchase receipts generate higher revenue than any other type of email : <p> Compared with standard bulk mailings , the average revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up to six times greater than the all-industry average of $0.13 <p> Furthermore , transaction rates soar eight times higher than bulk mailings for order confirmations and four times bulk for shipping- and return/exchangebased messages . Experian Transactional Email Report <p> They 're also great for engaging customers , as they 're more likely to open emails they 're expecting . According to Receiptful , email receipts have 3 to 4 times higher open rates ( 70.90% ) than regular marketing emails ( 17.19% ) and up to 3 times higher engagement rates . <p> Let 's take a look at some of what Michael Kors does that you can consider implementing for your own store . <h> Purchase Receipt from Michael Kors : What was good about the email ? <h> Layout <p> One of the first things that stands out about this email is that the top bar mimics the navigation menu on the website . This has two effects . First , it makes navigation easier by creating a familiar experience that customers had on the website . Secondly , it links to different sections on the website that customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken into different sections <p> Including navigation in your emails is also a great way to engage your customers and it results in higher numbers of clicks to your website : <p> Confirmation emails including limited to full Website navigation produce more than double the click rate of confirmations with no site navigation . Experian Transactional Email Report <p> The fact that Michael Kors provides free shipping and returns is also highlighted at the top of the email , similar to when you visit their store website . Free shipping on all orders is a great differentiator for an online store , and highlight at the top of the email reinforces that about Michael Kors with customers . The rest of the branding is also consistent with the website , creating a seamless experience between viewing the website and emails . <p> Lastly , the email is divided into different sections which are easy to distinguish with section headings or graphic separators . This keeps the information compartmentalized , and each section achieves different things for the email . <h> Say Thank You <p> Are you happy that the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " Not only does your customer deserve it , but it makes them more likely to be engaged with the rest of your email . <p> Michael Kors says it loud in the beginning of the email , and again in the first paragraph , making purchasers feel like valued customers and that their business is appreciated . <h> Information <p> The purchase receipt contains relevant information for the customer about their order . The subject line of the email is a simple " Thank You for Your Michael Kors Order order I 'd " . This includes the order I 'd in case the customer needs to quickly reference it , for example , for shipping or customer service calls . <p> The main confirmation message of the email informs the customers about common next steps , and what to expect . In addition , the email provides an overview of the order , with images of purchased products , and links to the return policy . These are all things that customers may need to reference after their purchase . <p> Prompt for creating an account <h> Account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create an account on the online store . Instead of simply including a button to start the account creation process , the emails contains a pitch about the value of creating an account , which is a great strategy . Psychologist Ellen Langer found that giving a reason , even a completely bogus one , increases the likelihood that someone will do what you ask ( a condensed overview here ) . <p> Customer accounts on your stores provide convenience for repeat purchases , and tracking order history . Customer accounts can also give you useful and up-to-date information about customers that you can use for targeted marketing or promotional campaigns . <h> Upsell and cross-sell opportunities <p> The last section of the purchase receipt showcases related items to the ones purchased . This area is a great opportunity for upsells and cross-sells . <p> Related items provide upsell and cross-sell opportunities <p> This not only gives more visibility to other items on your store , but also makes it easy for customers to see related items in one place , rather than having to go through you or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with resulting in higher engagement . <p> Cross-sells are an excellent engagement tool in transactional emails , and can be even more powerful if they 're intelligent recommendations based on the customer purchase . <h> Purchase Receipt from Michael Kors : What was bad about the email ? <p> There was not much bad about this email , as it touches on all of the main components of a receipt email that Receiptful recommends : branding , structure , and upsells / cross-sells . There are a few small adjustments that could make things even better . <p> Although the order summary section where product details are listed is good , it can be improved . This section only shows the shipment status . But , an estimated delivery date would be even more helpful . <p> Another thing this email does not highlight are the social profiles for Michael Kors , which are only linked to at the bottom of the email . The prioritization to drive engagement on social profiles , or asking people to share on social media may be different for different businesses . But , sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to engage with the brand . Take a look at our social media tips for online stores in a previous post . <p> A link to shipping and return policies in the first section would be helpful , as one of the most common questions any customer has after placing an order is , " When will I get this ? Whos delivering it ? " <h> Purchase Receipt from Michael Kors : What gets you to click ? <p> This email contains a lot of useful information , and a lot of relevant links . Two areas that elicit engagement are the related products section , and the the " Shopping Made Simpler " section where customers are prompted to create an account on the online store . <p> Both these sections provide added value to the customer by making it easier to find related products , and keep track of their purchases . Including a compelling reason for creating an account is a great strategy to encourage customers to sign up . <h> Purchase Receipt from Michael Kors : Takeaways <p> Overall , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email covers most of what customers may need after their purchase and includes tons of best practices for receipt emails . <p> Let 's take a look at some things you can implement yourself : <p> The email either outlines or links to details like contact information for customer service , billing and shipping details , images of products purchased , and return policies . Add links to helpful information , and includes images for products if possible . If you use WooCommerce , we have a tutorial that should help you add images , and further tips on customizing emails that could help you or your developer add other links and information . <p> here 's a quick video explaining features in Receiptful , as in general its an amazing tool for purchase receipt emails : <p> Another good part of the Michael Kors purchase receipt email was to invite customers to create an account on your store in case they did a guest purchase . By making the account signup process simple and quick , you can get more customers to make an account on your store . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offers . <p> When creating your purchase receipt emails , make sure to include any information that a customer may need . This way , the email is the one-stop place where customers need to go .

@@98138178 @2338178/ <p> These posts show you how to get member lists from different WordPress membership plugins , import members into MailChimp , and segment emails based on member data . <p> Producing content and benefits for members when launching your membership site is a huge task . If you 're primarily selling access to members-only content , a lot of time , thought , and effort goes into creating relevant , evergreen content that provides high value to your members . <p> However , the initial set up investment of your site may be a huge part of building your online business , but its not the only investment required for success . While acquiring new members with great content and benefits is needed to grow your business , keeping those members around helps you to continue to grow and drive recurring revenue for your site . <p> To reduce churn and keep members for the long term , you need to continually offer benefits to members that will keep them coming back to your membership site and paying membership fees . This could mean you entice members with new content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your site . <p> One important piece in communicating new benefits to members is your member emails . While it may be tempting to manage everything you can in WordPress , sending mass emails via your sites server is n't a great strategy , as its not optimized for email deliverability ( especially if you 're on a shared server while your site grows ) . <p> Weve talked about this when we discussed transactional emails , but using a dedicated email service for mass emails or emails for which deliverability is important is a better route than using your sites emails , and one of my favorite tools to send email is MailChimp . <h> Segment Member Emails <p> MailChimp allows you create email campaigns , and send them to entire email lists , or segment those lists to only email subscribers who meet certain criteria . While many marketing email services will work this way , I 'm going to focus on how to segment member emails with MailChimp in this article since its the tool I most frequently use . <p> Segmentation allows you to define rules for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , you could say , " Send this email to anyone who subscribed in the past month , " or , " Send this email to anyone who did n't  open the last email campaign . " More importantly for our purposes , we can segment emails based on user fields , even custom ones we create . <p> For example , we can add a field for each subscriber to note which membership plan or level the subscriber belongs to , allowing us to email all " gold plan " members at once and only these members . You could also do the same thing with membership status email all members whose membership is expired ( or even email based on the membership being expired been for at least a month ) . <p> Segmenting your emails let 's you deliver personalized content that relates directly to the subscribers member benefits , giving members information they need to get the most out of a membership , and keeping them coming back month after month . Email segmentation should be an important strategy of any membership site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member list into MailChimp so all members are subscribers , and then we can look into segmentation . This series will show you how to do so with several membership plugins for WordPress . <h> Export Members with Restrict Content Pro <p> Step 1 : get a list of our members , along with their emails , associated membership levels , membership status , and membership expiration dates in case wed like to segment based on these . <p> The good news for this tutorial is that Restrict Content Pro only allows one membership per user , so you could use one list in MailChimp for all of your members in case you 'll need to do mass-emails to all members , then segment for emails specific to certain memberships or statuses . <p> Restrict Content Pro has a built-in member exporter that 's going to be extremely useful for us . This will give us a CSV file of all members on the site , including data about each users membership that we can use in MailChimp . <p> To export your members , go to Restrict &gt; Export in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists for your members , you can choose to export only users belonging to a certain subscription . If you want to use one MailChimp list , you can export all members . <p> You 'll probably want to get a list of active members , but can export other membership statuses as well if you 'd like to email non-active members . <p> If you have a lot of members , you may find the member limit and offset values helpful to break the export up into " chunks " to ensure your export does n't  time out . <p> Once you 've exported your member CSV file , you may want to delete some of the fields you wo n't end up needing for MailChimp , such as billing address fields . This is n't a necessary step , as you can skip the extra columns in MailChimp , it just feels cleaner to me this way = <p> You can determine whatever you want to export , and re-save your member CSV . For example , I 'm not going to use the " Discount code " column , but you may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discount code . <p> Now that you have a list of members , along with columns / fields that we may want to segment by , you can set up the MailChimp side of things and import these members . <h> Set up Subscriber Fields in MailChimp <p> You 'll need one or more MailChimp lists , which I 'll assume you already have set up . The benefit to using one list for Restrict Content Pro members is that , should a member update his or her membership in the future , you could merge these changes into your new list . With separate lists , you 'll have to unsubscribe inactive members from lists before emailing , and add them to new lists ( for example , if they 've upgraded a membership ) . <p> Since membership level / plan and status can only have one value , you can use a dropdown or radio button field for membership plan and status in MailChimp . You can add a date field for expiration date if desired as well . <p> To add your fields , go to your member list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Click " Add new field " at the bottom . Add a field for each column or piece of member data youd like to use in MailChimp to segment your emails . <p> One important note : make sure the dropdown choices for membership type match the names exported . In this case , well need to tie the Subscription level from RCP to the membership field , and the field values should be the IDs of your subscription levels ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc ) . <p> If you do n't  want to use the IDs in MailChimp , you could replace all of these values in the CSV before importing it to use names instead ; just make sure whatever is going to be imported matches the choices for the membership dropdown ( and the same goes for statuses ) . <p> Now that these fields exist , not only can we use them to segment member emails , but we could also use them as merge tags in email content . For example , *PLAN* would let me insert the plan that the member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful to list expiration dates or current membership status as well . <h> Import Members into MailChimp <p> Now that we 've got MailChimp fields set up , we can import our members into MailChimp , and make sure that our membership data is set in the MailChimp fields . <p> For your list , go to Add Subscribers &gt; Import Subscribers , and select " CSV or tab-delimited file " as the source for your import . <p> When you do this , you 'll be able to match the CSV columns up with your MailChimp list fields match up every column you 'd like to import , and skip the ones you do n't  want to segment by : <p> Once you 've mapped all columns , you can import your members , and you should have all subscribers imported , along with their membership statuses and levels added to their subscriber profiles in MailChimp . <p> You can always follow the same process to re-import members in the future ! This is really useful to do before sending each email you can merge the new import with updates to members with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statuses , so your segments are accurate . <h> Create Member Segments in MailChimp <p> Now we 've got our MailChimp fields set up , and members imported as subscribers ; were ready to segment an email based on the member data . You can create a saved segment by going to Manage Subscribers &gt; Segments to add a segment . <p> Here you 'll be able to set up some rules for the segment , then give it a name when you 're done . You can also choose to auto-update it so that if subscriber info changes , the segment is updated in the future . <p> Let 's take a look at 3 examples of segments we can set up . <p> 1 . Email All Active Members Well need to create a segment for our subscribers based on one field : the membership status . This will let us send an email to any active member , regardless of which membership plan / subscription level the subscriber has on your site . <p> " All-member " emails are great for announcing new site-wide benefits or partnerships that are available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific to a plan , they can help you get new information to members from time to time . <p> 2 . Email Recently Inactive Members Not only can we segment based on status , but we can also segment based on date . In this example , well email expired members , but only those whose expiration date is within the past month ( assuming you 've imported this field ) . <p> To create your segment , set up rules that check for the expired status , along with a comparison to the expiration date field . <p> This could let you send a " win-back " email for expired members , such as a discount , or perhaps soliciting feedback as to why the user let the membership expire . <p> You could treat cancelled membership emails the same way get important feedback as to why these members churn out , and what you could do to prevent it in the future . <p> You 'll need to edit this segment to change your date cut off before each email , but it let 's you catch all memberships that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Active Members of a Plan Heres another example of segmenting based on two rules . Instead of using a date , well match subscribers by membership status and membership type so that were only emailing active members of a certain plan . <p> In order to do this , we need to remember which membership had which I 'd in our import ( unless you changes the plan names in your CSV before importing ) , which you can get under Restrict &gt; Subscription Levels . <p> I 'm going to email everyone with Membership " 2 " ( my " eCommerce 101 " subscription in RCP ) , who currently has an active membership . <p> Notice I 'm forcing MailChimp to match " all " of the conditions so I only email subscribers who fit both criteria . <p> Plan-specific emails can help you ensure that members get content very specific to their needs , interests , and available benefits on your site . Personalizing these emails with your existing merge tags can make these emails feel even more catered to each member . <p> Send the email ! Once you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members in this segment for any campaign by choosing them as the recipients . <h> Segment Member Emails in MailChimp with Restrict Content Pro <p> To recap , our basic steps are : <p> export members from RCP to a CSV file and modify it if desired <p> add fields for membership data in MailChimp <p> import members to MailChimp , mapping the data in the CSV to your subscriber fields <p> create segments based on the membership data <p> before each email , re-import members so your segments are always up-to-date <p> More detail on #5 : you can re-import members before each email send to ensure that your MailChimp data is up-to-date with your sites membership data so that you 're correctly emailing members based on current plan and status . The ability to " merge " an import with MailChimp is really useful for this , as it can update existing subscriber profiles automatically on import . <p> This let 's you keep member email lists up to date while giving members personalized , current information on membership benefits and changes . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138179 @2338179/ <h> Creating a WooCommerce Custom Order Status <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This code works for versions of WooCommerce up to 2.1.12 . WooCommerce 2.2 changed the order status structure , which means this wo n't work . This updated post will work for WooCommerce 2.2+ instead . <p> Adding your very own custom order statuses to WooCommerce is both fun and easy . When you first install WooCommerce , it automatically adds 7 order statuses : Pending , Failed , On-Hold , Processing , Completed , Cancelled , and Refunded . These statuses are fairly universal and should be sufficient for the majority of shops , but certain businesses are going to have an order fulfillment process with additional steps , or one that just does n't  quite fit the usual mold . <p> Thankfully one of the guiding philosophies behind WooCommerce , and a driver of the explosive growth its exhibited , is to make things " just work " right out of the box for the majority of folks , while allowing easy customization for when something just does n't  quite fit your needs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order status can be created by calling the WordPress function wpinsertterm() like so : <p> wpinsertterm ( ' Assembling ' , ' shoporderstatus ' ) ; <p> To actually add our custom order status , call that function from the WordPress init action by adding the following to your themes functions.php : <p> Then load any page in your WordPress admin , and your shiny new order status will be ready for use : <p> This action/function only needs to be run once to add a new status . Though it wo n't hurt anything to have it run additional times , there 's no need to do so , and it should be removed from your functions.php file once you 've verified your new status was created . <h> Removing a Status <p> If you start having second thoughts about a custom order status you 've added , its a simple matter to get rid of it using the WordPress wpdeleteterm() function . Youll first need to look up the status term i 'd : <p> Again , put this in your themes functions.php and load a page in the admin . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run once , so remove it once you 've verified the custom order status is gone . <h> Taking it Further <p> Once your custom order status is added , you can extend the functionality of your simple status . Perhaps you want to dispatch an email when the custom status is set on an order , and can do this by using some of the numerous order status hooks provided by WooCommerce . <p> &lt; begin shameless plug &gt; Not comfortable tweaking this code yourself ? For those looking for this sort of functionality combined with the ease of use of an administrative interface , there 's an upcoming Order Status Manager to be released in the WooThemes store within the next month or two ( from SkyVerge , our parent company at Sell with WP ) . Well link to that plugin once its available . &lt; /shameless plug &gt; = <p> Until then , if you use these techniques to create your own WooCommerce custom order status , let us know what order status you 've created with a comment below ! <p> Hi there . I just added your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status " approved " . The problem is that every time I refresh the order an " approved " status is added . So I end up with many " approved " orders . Am I doing something wrong ? Should I put the code somewhere else and not to functions.php ? <p> Hmm , when I first tested this it seemed that it did n't  matter if the wpinsertterm() function was called multiple times , but if this causing duplicate status to be added for you , I 'd recommend removing that code and deleting all but the first one that was added . <p> Just to let you know that even the plugin I bought for status order and emails did n't  work for woocommerce 2.2 , so I believe its a good idea to downgrade to 2.1 and wait until the plugins developers fix this .

@@98138181 @2338181/ <h> MemberMouse Review : Powerful WordPress Memberships <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One potential problem with membership plugins or services is scalability . Will it be easy to protect content when I have tons of posts and pages ? Will I be able to protect different kinds of content as my site grows ? Will payment processing and order management scale with my user base ? <p> Good membership platforms have to be easy enough to use when membership sites are launched , but need to provide the room for these sites to grow as they become successful . In this MemberMouse Review , well discuss the pros and cons of using MemberMouse for WordPress membership sites , and how MemberMouse fits the needs of different users . <h> MemberMouse Review : Overview <p> MemberMouse is a WordPress membership plugin that integrates with any WordPress site . It offers a full-featured solution for memberships , including content restriction , flexible billing options , content dripping , restricting logins , and supports developer tweaks and changes . In addition , MemberMouse can offer upsells to members , or automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve customer retention and maximize revenue . MemberMouse also allows members to upgrade or downgrade memberships themselves . <h> Costs <p> MemberMouse costs are dependent on the number of users for your membership site , yet MemberMouse is n't a true SaaS solution , as the MemberMouse plugin runs on your own servers . You install the plugin on your site , but will also have a MemberMouse account ; your site then checks in with the MemberMouse licensing server to send data on site usage . Because this is a " check in " , your site does n't  require MemberMouses licensing servers to run the membership part of your site . As a result , site performance is entirely dependent on your own hosting and environment . <p> MemberMouse pricing ranges from $20 per month for 1,000 users up to premium and professional plans at $300-600 per month for sites with over 100,000 users ( support is included for all plans ) . You can try MemberMouse freefor a 14 day trial before committing to using it . Each pricing tier offers different benefits ( such as premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough breakdown of price based on number of users : <p> Plan Name <p> Max No .

The email also linked to the resources I 'd need to get started , as well as some basic instructions and a series of tutorial videos . Before you can start playing with site setup , you 'll need to register your site URL in your MemberMouse account : <p> Register Site URL <p> The cool thing about this is that you can change the registered URL , so if you want to use MemberMouse on a staging site before migrating to a production site , you can register the staging site URL and completely set up your site and members for launch , then migrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is registered in your MemberMouse account , you can then download the MemberMouse plugin from your dashboard and install it in your WordPress site . From there , you 're ready to start configuring your site . <p> If you do n't  want to set up the site yourself , you can purchase Quick Start service from MemberMouse for $299 , which includes a WordPress installation ( optional ) , MemberMouse setup following a consultation call , and an optional migration of membership data from an existing site . <h> Configuring MemberMouse <p> MemberMouse creates several pages when installed ( similar to an eCommerce plugin ) , such as checkout pages , login/out pages for members , and more . You can customize these pages in order to test the most effective approach for your store , but I chose to first get set up . <p> MemberMouse dashboard <p> You can check out your membership dashboard when you log in to see some compressed details about your site , but since I have n't set anything up yet , I headed down to the General Settings menu to see what options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , I navigated to " Other Settings " and was able to change what members see when logged in , including the page they 're redirected to and whether to display protected menu items ( for example , if you 're protecting products from non-members ) . One setting that many of you will find interesting is the " Access Sharing Protection " Setting : <p> MemberMouse Restrict Logins <p> This little box allows you to restrict how many different IP addresses can log into your site using the same credentials in a 24-hour period . I 'd allow more than one IP address in case members use a computer and a mobile device to view your content . That way they do n't  get frustrated by being locked out of your site when using a different device . For some membership sites , the ability to restrict login information is non-negotiable , so MemberMouse becomes an attractive option . <p> MemberMouse also allows you to create Employee users under General Settings so that sales or support personnel can log into your site and member center in order to create or assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . When support or sales people log in , they only have access to the " Manage Members " menu , MemberMouse Dashboard , and Activity Logs . <p> MemberMouse Employee Roles <p> As a final note on setup , MemberMouse includes a couple of built-in widgets that you can use to display content throughout your site . For example , the " Protected Content " widget can display upcoming content to members based on which membership level access they have so they know what to look forward to ( date can be included as well ) . <p> MemberMouse Widgets <h> Creating Products with MemberMouse <p> One word of caution for those of you trying MemberMouse : watch the tutorial videos . I make a habit out of jumping into using a new plugin without first reading documentation or watching videos , but I ended up going back and forth between the products and memberships that I created and wasted time . Usually documentation is great for when I get stuck rather than as a starting point , but I was n't sure why memberships and products were separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership access to different products . If you 're new at this , it may seem redundant to separate memberships from products at first ; however , this allows you far more flexibility in pricing your membership products . You can create a " Bronze " membership access level and tie it to multiple products , such as a standard product ( at one price ) , a discounted product ( with a promotional price ) , and an affiliate product ( with a price for users referred from an affiliate ) . After watching the videos and understanding this structure , I really liked the flexibility offered by separating membership access from products . <p> Products are created under Product Settings . Both virtual and physical products are managed from the same page , and once your products are set up , you can then create membership access levels and assign them to your products . To start , assign your " Associated Access " for your products to " none " since you 'll be setting up memberships later . <p> MemberMouse Product Creation <p> With MemberMouse , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trials " , you can optionally set a price for a trial period ( which can be $0 ) , then determine how long that trial period will run . If you only want to use this for a sign-up fee , then you can set a one-day trial and then start the membership . This is n't ideal , as the monthly charge wont be shown immediately at checkout since only the signup fee is shown , but it works well enough that it should n't be an issue . Your product description should explain fees and billing anyway . <p> Create Free Trial <p> Create a Signup Fee <p> You can also make products " shippable " to take advantage of the limited shipping methods available in MemberMouse for memberships that involve physical products . <h> Creating Membership Access with MemberMouse <p> Once products are created , you can then create membership access levels to tie to any of your membership products . These membership levels will determine the content restriction rules for members . However , you can also edit the access rules on a per-post or per-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can assign that access level to a particular product . This is what I was talking about in terms of flexibility you can assign an access level to as many products as you want , so if you offer promotional pricing for email subscribers or referrals from your affiliates , you can tie the same access to each of these products . <p> Create Membership Access Levels <p> You 'll also select which categories will be protected for that access level from the same screen . Multiple post categories can be selected for access . As a result , MemberMouse supports both tiered and topic-based memberships . <p> Protecting Categories <p> As a default , access will be restricted for the entire post for each post in the category . However , you can get around this to display post excerpts and teasers with Smart Tags . Access can also be set on a per-post or per-page basis while editing a post or page . The post / page editor is also where you 'll handle content dripping . Dripping is flexible and super-simple , as you can set a delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Granting Access <p> Setting up Content Dripping <p> Once content dripping is set up , you can view schedules for each membership level under Product Settings &gt; Content Dripping Schedule to get an overall view of when each access level can see content . This page will also allow you to bulk edit access rights for each membership level , and customize content dripping times for each access level . Its really useful for those of you that already have a lot of content created , and just want to assign drip times and access rights from one screen . <p> Content Drip Schedule Page <p> Not sure how it will look to each member ? MemberMouse has a cool feature where you can preview content from a certain access levels point of view , and even from a number of days into the membership ( to see how your content dripping will affect what members see ) . Look at the top of your screen when previewing your site : <p> Previewing Membership Content <p> Neat , huh ? So now you 've set up products and access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , you 'll have a list of products with associated access levels : <p> MemberMouse Products <h> Selling Bundles <p> MemberMouse has another sales option of which you can take advantage . Members can not purchase more than one membership level using MemberMouse . However , you can use a different content restriction tool , known as a bundle , to provide a topic-based membership . This is also how you can provide upsells to current members . You can assign multiple products to a bundle in the same way that you can assign multiple products to a membership access level . Bundles allow you to expand the content access that a product provides when used in this way . <p> Because Bundles are tied to products in the same way as membership access , bundles can also take advantage of content dripping . The benefit to using bundles is that members can purchase more than one bundle at a time . <h> MemberMouse Smart Tags <p> Before you start setting up your site to sell membership products , you 'll want to check out some of the built-in shortcodes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart tags to insert purchase links for your products , selectively restrict ( or remove restrictions from ) certain pieces of content to create excerpts , and show member data . For example , you can show a members name on emails or welcome pages , content based on their membership level , or show content based on which affiliate referred the member to your site . <p> Content Restriction can also be created or lifted with smart tags . For example , if you just want to display teaser content to non-members or members that do n't  have the correct access , you can wrap that content in a smart tag : MMAccessDecision access= " false " This is my teaser content . /MMAccessDecision This lifts the protection from that content for readers without access . Putting smart tags together can provide some pretty powerful customization and automation for your membership site . <p> Yo Dawg , Heard You like Smart Tags <h> Selling and Managing MemberMouse Memberships <p> When you 're done learning about smart tags , setting up products , access levels , and content dripping , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically creates a lot of pages , it does n't  create a catalog or sales page . For me this is a good thing , as I think selling memberships to potential users requires long-form content anyway members probably are n't  going to come to your site and browse for memberships right away . <p> To sell memberships , you 'll need to create pages or posts with purchase links . You can copy purchase links from your product settings for each product , or generate a purchase link using a smart tag if the link is being posted on your WordPress site ( which is what we 've done in the screenshot ) . You can also use MemberMouses built-in button styles rather than the ones from your theme ( mine are a bit lackluster since were using the default theme ) . <p> Create Product Page <p> Product Page : Frontend <h> Managing Members <p> One of the great things about MemberMouse is that members can manage themeselves , which helps free up time youd otherwise spend on site administration . For example , member upgrades , downgrades , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Account " page . You can also customize the member " My Account " page to automatically upsell your products for you , or to try to save sales if members want to cancel . <p> When members make changes to their accounts , these changes are automatically reflected in your email lists or other integrations built-in to MemberMouse so that you do n't  have to manually manage changes in membership ( i.e. , moving from the " gold " list to the " platinum " email list ) . The members center is geared towards automating and simplifying your site management , which can save huge amounts of time for sites with thousands of members . <p> If you 'd like to downsell members whod like to cancel , you can take advantage of the MemberMouse Save the Sale page , which let 's you create a downsell that will be shown to members that want to cancel a membership . When members do cancel , you can choose to hard cancel the membership , which blocks access to the members area and logging in , or you can pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you choose to set cancellations to membership pauses ) , their membership is actually frozen so that they still have access to any content that 's been released up to that point , but are removed from the drip schedule and can not access any new content . <p> Update : The newest version of MemberMouse changes cancellations . Member status now becomes " Pending Cancellation " when the users opts to cancel , but the user retains access until the end of their current billing cycle . They then change to " Cancelled " and access is stopped . <h> Billing and Payments <p> Billing is extremely flexible with MemberMouse , and cycles are completely customized . You can bill in terms of days , weeks , months , or years , and enter the cycle of your choosing ( ex : 3 months , 1 year , 2 weeks , etc ) . You can continue to bill on a recurring basis indefinitely , or you can set a number of cycles for the membership ( such as " 3 payments of $19.95 " ) . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 'd recommend avoiding this unless you 're just starting out , as you 'll constantly have to chase new members , which kind of defeats the purpose of a recurring billing model = ) . <p> You can also use coupons with MemberMouse , and determine whether to apply them to the first billing cycle or the life of the membership . Coupons can provide a percentage off or a dollar-amount reduction . Coupons can also be created to provide an entirely free membership , or you could create a membership for a customer yourself and comp that membership instead . Coupon usage can be restricted to certain products or a number of uses . <p> Creating Coupons <p> The best part about billing is that you can control recurring billing actions , such as refunds , directly from MemberMouse rather than logging into your account with your payment processor . For example , you can issue refunds from within your MemberMouse admin rather than logging in to Stripe or PayPal to do so , and MemberMouse automatically interacts with the correct processor . <p> Finally , MemberMouse integrates with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authorize.net , Braintree , and ClickBank . You can use one on-site payment method , such as Stripe or Authorize.net , and at the same time use PayPal and/or ClickBank to provide up to three payment options . <p> MemberMouse Payment Integrations <p> Because cards are tokenized and saved for members , MemberMouse can also help automate overdue payment handling to save your customer management team time and keep your revenue stream flowing . When MemberMouse detects that a card has been declined , it marks the members account as overdue , then sends the member and email asking him to login and update the card information in the account . The member can then update billing information from the " My Account " page . The member is then immediately charged the amount due and the member account is reactivated . <h> Shipping <p> MemberMouse is n't really designed to be an eCommerce platform , but it does allow you to sell some physical products through your site and to sell physical products with subscriptions , such as magazines ( though I think it does a far better job with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your product , you mark it as " shippable " , then set up basic shipping rates ( such as standard and expedited shipping ) . <p> Personally , I 'd just include shipping as part of the membership pricing per month ( and advertise that fact ! ) to simplify my store management , but the shipping methods can be useful for selling swag items and other physical products for your site . <p> Shipping Methods <p> Creating a Shipping Method <h> Integrations <p> MemberMouse has a few integrations built in to help you with your site management . First , email is critical for communication and engagement . Rather than set up an internal email system , MemberMouse integrates directly with email marketing companies like MailChimp and AWeber . You can use this integration to manage your relationship with members using an email platform you 're already familiar with , and moving members between lists is automatic to save you time . <p> MemberMouse Email Integrations <p> MemberMouse also integrates with iDevAffiliate to manage affiliates for your membership site . When customers are sent from an affiliate , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can choose to dynamically display content or offers to members based on which affiliate referred them to your site . <h> Support <p> MemberMouse includes email support with all plans , and offers some other resources for users . Full documentation is available , and was pretty helpful for me . Some documentation includes video walkthroughs , and all settings and functions are documented . I only used the support desk one time for an issue with the smart tag library , and received an answer for the question I submitted in the morning later the same day , and also got a follow-up email to let me know the issue would be resolved in the next release . <p> In addition , there 's developer documentation available for site customizations . If you 're running a membership site with tens of thousands of members , chances are you have a developer on retainer or one on staff , so having docs handy for tweaks and customizations is a plus . <h> Speaking of Developers <p> If you 're an advanced user , or have a developer on staff , you can further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart tags ( shortcodes in WordPress lingo ) , there are plenty of actions and filters available , as well as a well-documented set of global functions for use in templates and other custom code . <p> In addition , you can create push notifications for site administrators and members for events such as new member signups or payment receipts . However , these push notifications can also be used to trigger actions in third-party integrations ( i.e. , sending data to an accounting system ) . This means that MemberMouse can always be the hub of information for your membership-based business . <p> MemberMouse also has an API that developers can use to integrate MemberMouse with external systems , which is n't the case with all membership plugins . This allows you to create , get , and update information about members . <h> Other Comments <p> MemberMouse makes it easy to improve the Lifetime Value of your members by providing the ability for one-click sales . By removing barriers to purchase for existing members , you can drastically increase conversions . When members are logged in , purchase links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged to the card on the account to make the purchase essentially a one-click sale ( account info is already prepopulated with the payment information tokenized in the customer account ) . Since you 've already gone through the time and expense to acquire these members , up-selling them is made as easy as possible to generate additional revenue and to help them find other products . <p> Another interesting feature is the ability to email purchase links to members , so that when the link is clicked , members are logged in and sent to a pre-populated shopping cart to again remove as many barriers as possible to purchase . <p> The level of service MemberMouse offers was interesting for me , as many membership solutions offer the plugin / integration and support , and that 's it . The Quick Start service is a white-gloved install and setup , which is offered by a few other services , but MemberMouse also provides a list of recommended contractors , and encourages current users to become affiliates to promote the services . Developer resources are also a great addition , and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MemberMouse beyond WordPress . <h> MemberMouse Review : Wrap-up <p> MemberMouse offers huge functionality and will allow you to treat your membership site like a business instead of a hobby . Since its designed for sites with tens of thousands of members , this should n't come as a surprise . Setting up a site and basic content restriction is easy ( especially with the help of the " Getting Started " videos ) , but far more customization is possible if you 're willing to make a time investment in site setup and optimization . There 's definitely a learning curve involved in using MemberMouse , but its in proportion to the amount of functionality you get out of the plugin , as it has almost everything you could want in a membership platform . <p> Payment processor selection is limited , but includes our favorites so this wasnt huge <p> Learning curve for new members looking for advanced options in terms of when to use products vs. bundles , how to use smart tags different from most membership / eCommerce plugins <p> While basic setup is fast and easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of content with protection / products on your own ( may want a developer or Quick Start service to automate or migrate what you can ) again , proportional to level of optimization you want <p> Overall , MemberMouse is a well-rounded membership solution that provides more upsides than downsides and offers powerful features and flexibility for many different membership site models . I had some help in understanding all of the functionality from the MemberMouse team , and the more I learned , the more I was impressed with MemberMouses capabilities . Have questions ?

Weve been using it and its working out pretty good . I was hoping they would add an eCommerce component but that probably wo n't happen . Great review ! <p> Wow , that 's an intense review ! Super thorough . I made the switch from Wishlist Member ( throw up in my mouth ) to MemberMouse about 6 months ago . The process to move over was about 6 months of work prior to that . Moving 10K members over takes a LOT of work and making sure that each and every nut and bolt is set just right . <p> We could n't be happier with the platform . More important , that quality of support offered by MemberMouse is incredible . These guys really stand behind their already quality product , and will no doubt start to dominate this space . <p> Hey Chris , thanks so much for the kind words ! It seems that every time I thought I 'd figured out all that MemberMouse does , I 'd find out more or learn that it does something I thought it could n't . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had questions . Ill be curious to see how it grows as well . <p> Hi Chris- I have a membership of abour 1100 that I want to take from WLM to membermouse ( SO OVER WLM ) , but am nervous about the gateway setup . How did you get your members over to the new system and payments still established ? I am worried we have to ask our members to resign up and that is too big of a risk in the event that they do n't  resign up . Would so appreciate any insight . In fact if you do consultations I would be very interested in consulting with you on this specific matter . Thanks hope to hear from you , Kim <p> Hi Kim , to chime in here , I know MemberMouse has dealt with migrations like this before and they have a system for it ( see the FAQ here ) . They also offer a Quick Start service for $299 , which might be your best bet to make sure that everything is smoothly transferred . <p> As for payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . For example , if you 're using Stripe and payments tokens are already stored , then moving them would n't be too hard . <p> One thing that was brushed over a bit quickly ( but its ok , its quite advanced ) is the usage of smart tags and push notifications . <p> Here are a couple of examples of each that I 'm using , which shows you just how flexible they are : <p> 1 . We setup push notifications to change or add someone to different groups in our Mailchimp list . Before , we would have to have multiple lists in Mailchimp , and sending out emails was quite frustrating . If customers were signed up for several products , theyd sometimes get 3 of the same email . <p> However , now push notifications handle all of that automagically through MemberMouse , and its completely transparent . This opens up a HUGE new world of options for autoresponders . For example , if the customer has X product and is really missing out by not having Y product , we can tell Mailchimp to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . We have a large number of downloads we sell through our website . As a result , we an make this a simple bundle product that is simply protected with smart tags . <p> If the member is part of a product , but does n't  have that added component of downloads , it shows a purchase dialogue . If they do have the downloads , then the purchase dialogue is no longer shown , and it shows their activated ( and protected ) downloads . <p> REALLY slick . <p> Just a few examples of how powerful those components are . You wo n't find that with any other membership software . <p> Agreed , there are so many possibilities with some of the advanced features that I think it would take a separate post to cover them . Love the use of push notifications with MailChimp seems like it would be a huge timesaver ! <p> Hi there , MemberMouse can allow you to create physical products itself , then restrict those products to members based on membership access . It sounds like that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your members . <p> Great review , thanks . I find one ( of many ) unique benefits of MemberMouse is how it automatically transfers email addresses between MailChimp lists . For example , when a person upgrades from a Free Subscription to a Paid subscription , the email address is transferred on MailChimp as well . <p> Also , like the support we receive from the team at MemberMouse , quite thorough and very responsive . <p> Hey , I 've been looking into member mouse but we heavily use custom post types . While it says it can restrict access to custom post types it only seems to be a possibility in the protected content widget . Do you know of a way to restrict all posts in a custom post type to certain membership levels ? The way it seems now is that each time the editor creates a post in a post type we want restricted , he will need to be sure he sets the proper restrictions . <p> Do you know if MM will allow user registration to carry over throughout a multi-site install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist on a different subdomain can a user access each course that they purchase with the same login information ? <p> I 'm trying to find a membership solution that will allow me to have all my courses on a different subdomain , but a user just signups up at mymainsite.com and will get access to the courses they purchase . <p> Hey Jeff , I 'm actually not sure about the multi-site question , but I know they were working on improving multi-site support . I 'd get in touch with the pre-sales team to get more definitive info = . You can fill out this form with a " Pre-sales inquiry " subject . <p> Did you ever get an answer from them ? I 'm working on setting up MM on a second site in my Multi-site network , and I 've noticed the members from the both sites show up in the MM admin of each one . Im having some issues with the wp-admin redirect , though , and I suspect its got to do with multi-site and the redirect behavior for members ( which our admin accounts are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moderation for a week . = <p> Hi , THIS has really helped me a lot and make my decision to go with MM = I am currently using the OptimizePress theme for my website and I love it ! ! ! There is only a few things I do not understand how to do with MM ? How do I insert a Member login button on my homapage and link it to the members login page ? How do I link my members over to my tutorial page after they 've log in ? PLEASE somebody HELP ME ! Thank you for this wonderful post Beka . <p> Hey Carolina , glad to hear this has been helpful ! I 'm not quite sure how to do this myself , but support is included with MemberMouse so you could shoot this question to their team here I 'm sure theyd be able to straighten this out immediately = . <p> Great review ! Is it possible to create products that are limited to members ( ie , you need Level A to be able to access Level B ) ? Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of dripping specific to the product ? <p> Hi Arp ! There 's not strictly a way to have products accessible only to certain members . However , you could protect the purchase / checkout page for Level B by only allowing people with Level A memberships to visit it . As for dripping , you can set up dripping for any membership product , free or paid . Each product can have its own unique dripping schedule , so you can drip content to free members slower than paid members , etc . <p> There 's also a free trial for 14 days if you want to give it a spin . Hope this helps ! <p> Thanks Beka that does help . My idea is to offer free courses to members but have them dripped and it sounds like it would work . Ill have to evaluate some more before taking the trial but MemberMouse is a definite contender ( along with Memberpress ) . For my particular site , I need recurring commissions too so I have to take a look at both iDevAffiliate ( and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No problem ! If you 're looking for other affiliate solutions , I know AffiliateWP plans to add recurring referral support for MemberMouse soon for developer license holders , so that might also be one to consider . I 'm a big fan of the plugin because its so easy to use and manage , and the developers behind it are great . Unfortunately it wont work with MemberPress if you go that route . Good luck ! <p> Hey Ryan , you 're right that this is something that will require custom code , and I 'm not quite sure that MemberMouse would allow you to do all of this . I think Paid Memberships Pro could be a good starting point instead . <p> Great review , and Membermouse is almost a great solution . One glaring CON that you probably did not catch is that Membermouse does not support any way to automatically send an email to a member X days before their subscription is renewed . This may not be such a big deal for a low cost monthly subscription . But imagine if you charge a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no notice to the customer , you hit their card again for $1,500 , perhaps putting them over the limit and triggering a permanent major increase in their credit card interest rate . Even if it does n't  trigger an interest rate increase the surprise may make them very unhappy . <p> It amazes me that that an almost otherwise complete and well-conceived plugin like this could have such a glaring and obvious feature missing . Membermouse allows subscribers to post to a feature request board and vote for new features . This is the feature request with the highest number of votes , and the thread was started in Early 2014 so almost a year has gone by with no mention it will be done at some point . I opened a support ticket requesting they tell me how to locate the membership renewal date via their API , but that value can not be queried so it does not appear there is any way to fix this with 3rd party coding or integration . Just to be clear , even if you integrate the site with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers in advance of billing them again . <p> As I said , your review is great , and I suspect you did n't  notice this missing feature since no one would guess such a feature-rich and complete plugin would have overlooked such an obvious minimum requirement . Since almost every other membership plugin , free or premium has this feature , it slips the mind that a plugin with a high-end feature set would simply and naturally include it . <p> Your article ROCKS ! ! Thank you . I am a Constant Contact solution provider and would like to start using MM . Do you know if MM will be making a point-and-click integration with Constant Contact ? Do you know of an easy way to integrate Constant Contact with MM ? <p> Great article on MemberMouse . Do you think MemberMouse could work for a website offering a number of webinars to purchase . Webinars become available at different times eg 3 months apart , and people that pay for the webinar get ongoing access to the video for say 1 month after it has run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new webinar is available for people to purchase . Rinse and repeat . Is MM a viable option do you think to provide access to the videos ? Thanks ! <p> Hey David , MemberMouse could definitely do this you could create a membership that expires after one month . If you 'd like all memberships to expire on a particular date rather than after a certain period , you might also want to check out Paid Memberships Pro , which has a free add-on to set expiration dates instead of expiration lengths . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138182 @2338182/ <h> Setting Up Your First PPC Campaigns for eCommerce Stores <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is a guest post from Patrick Rauland , an eCommerce educator and entrepreneur . You can find more of Patricks writing on his blog , or learn how to choose the right marketing channels to get your store off the ground via his freeLift Off Summit , which runs June 19 to 23 ! <p> Setting up a PPC campaign can be daunting , especially if this is your first venture into online advertising . You 're spending actual money upfront for the chance that the user buys something down the line . <p> Let me dispel a few myths today about how to run effective PPC Campaigns , and to learn how advertising in general and PPC specifically can be a tool to help grow your eCommerce store . <h> PPC Campaigns : Lead Quality &gt; Quantity <p> Running ads is all about generating quality leads over quantity . You do n't  need to target the largest keyword to run a successful PPC Campaign . Instead , you can target a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process ) as long as those users convert . <p> In fact , that 's usually the goal with advertising . Find the largest highly-converting group you can . <p> 1000 users with 1% conversion = 10 sales <p> 100 users with 10% conversion = 10 sales <p> We 've found that the average company gets all of its conversions from only 6% of its keywords . The rest of the catch is worthless , but still eats up 76% of the PPC budget . PPC Hero <p> Since you 're usually paying by the click , look for keywords that have a high conversion rate to set up your campaigns . You probably wo n't get this right immediately ; however , its important to start gathering data on ads and conversions , as the more data you have , the better you can hone-in on quality leads over time . <h> PPC Campaigns : Segmentation <p> The key to getting a highly converting group is to segment the audience . You 're trying to find the very best leads and only the very best leads . <p> If you 're using a search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long tail keywords ; they 're much more specific and your ad is more likely to appear to a good lead . <p> You can also use negative keywords . If you sell a form plugin for WordPress you could target WordPress form plugin ; what may work better is if you target WordPress form plugin -free . In this case , free is the negative keyword , so we could remove it . <p> You probably do n't  want someone who is looking for a free plugin . While they could result in a conversion , you do n't  want to spend your money on potential leads you want to spend it on hot leads . <p> If you 're using Facebook instead of search-based ads , then use the insane amount of data they give you . Basically everyone is on Facebook , and they have data from several aspects of each persons life . You can target geographic areas or interests , and you can target a potential customer at any point on the customer journey , which is insanely powerful . <p> You can target someone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has visited your website <p> You can target someone who has visited your website and is or is n't on your newsletter <p> You can target someone who has visited a specific product and using retargetting show them that product again <p> You can target someone who has added the item to the cart but did n't  purchase . <p> So if your website has n't  been discovered yet and you 're getting very little organic traffic , you can target people who have n't been to the website and point them to a piece of content that should sell them on your services . If your website has been discovered , target people who have already been to your site and maybe show them to a specific product page . <p> Finally , if you 've already had a ton of views on your product pages and you want more people buying , then you can retarget those users . Facebook provides tools for sites in pretty much any " launch " stage . <p> Getting highly converting ( meaning cost effective for you ) campaigns is all about segmentation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . <h> PPC Campaigns : How Much Should I Spend ? <p> Advertising does n't  have to be expensive . I interviewed Facebook marketing expert Megan Adams on my Lift Off Summit , and she says : <p> " In the beginningstart with $5 a day and see where that takes you . Or $100 a campaign " <p> " You can start a $5/day campaign on Facebook and see where that goes . Or $10/day on Adwords " <p> Start small to begin gathering data on what works for you , and you can then scale up your campaigns later along with optimizing them . <h> PPC Campaigns : How Much Time Do I Have to Invest ? <p> Ads do n't  take a ton of time to set up . If you 're setting up PPC campaigns and you know what you 're doing , you can do it in less than an hour . <p> The same goes for Facebook if you already have a Facebook page set up with product photos , setting up your first ad shouldnt take more than a few hours . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup will go much faster . <p> Once you have your ads setup they run on their own . You do n't  have to do anything to maintain them . <p> On Lift Off Summit , Megan Adams recommends logging in once a week and tweaking campaigns . Do n't  login mid-week or mid-campaign when you 're first getting started you wont have enough data and you 'll waste your time : <p> " I recommend two hours a week " <h> PPC Campaigns : Conversion Tracking <p> One final thing ! To make sure you can actually measure and track your progress , ensure you have conversion tracking set up . Each ad platform will have different technology that you have to setup on your site so you can track eCommerce sales . <p> For Facebook create your own Facebook pixel . I recommend setting up the Facebook tracking pixel even if you are n't  planning using Facebook ads right now , as you can get interesting audience demographics even if you are n't  using ads ( here 's an extensive guide to using Facebook Pixel ) . <h> Measuring Success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in one dollar and expect two dollars to come out at least not at first . The first thing you should shoot for is breaking even . Amber Turrill says : <p> " Will that one dollar turn into two dollars ? It will . But first , go for break even . And then go for that positive return on investment " <p> Managing effective and revenue-positive PPC campaigns is a process , like anything else . And there is a learning curve . If you cant spend $5 a day for a month learning how to use this channel , you probably should n't get into PPC just yet . But if you can spend a few hundred dollars learning the channel , you should be able to turn it into a cash-generating machine . <p> If you want to learn more about marketing channels and hear the full interviews with Amber Turrill &amp; Megan Adams , check out Lift Off Summit .

@@98138183 @2338183/ <h> Better Order Received Emails : Receiptful Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> You have a fantastic source of revenue that you may not be aware of sitting right in front of you . <p> No really , its true . Your current customers are also your best customers , and should be a key area of focus for your marketing efforts . For example , Marketing Metrics asserts that businesses have a 60 to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer . The prospects for selling to a new customer ? Only 5% to 20% . <p> People that have already purchased from you are more likely to purchase in the future . You can take advantage of this fact by making the most of your communication with these customers and either offering upsells or promotions to encourage them to purchase again . This increases the LTV of your customers with minimal effort . <p> This is the driving principle behind Receiptful , a new product for WooCommerce . Receiptful is built by WooThemes co-founder and former CEO Adii Pienaar , and its geared towards effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read but under-utilized communications between your store and customers : order received emails . <p> Oh , and you can use Receiptful to drive revenue for free . No fake the service is free to use and currently supports WooCommerce with other integrations on the roadmap . <h> Receiptful Review : Overview <p> Receiptful was inspired by this post on email receipts from Jimmy Daly at Vero . Most email receipts give customers the basic information about their order a receipt for their records , what was purchased and the shipping method chosen , and perhaps includes some order status or tracking information . <p> However , Daly writes that this email is vastly undervalued by stores , as customers have just purchased and given you explicit permission to email them . Receiptful is designed to turn this email into a selling opportunity and a way to turn customers into repeat purchasers . <p> So why emails receipts ? Because almost everyone opens them . Receiptful studies open rates , and came to this conclusion : <p> During beta , we have tracked open rates on receipts to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can regularly get close to that kind of attention ( and opportunity ) . Receiptful <p> Receiptful combines the attention that order received emails get with promotions or upsell / cross-sell opportunities , which are incredibly effective . For example , as far back as 2006 Amazon , reported that 35% of its revenues were as a direct result of its cross sales and upselling efforts ( Source ) . <p> Receiptful founder Adii Pienaar has seen this already with the first merchants to use Receiptful : <p> Data in our first month shows that our customers have experienced an increase of up to 5% ( i.e. additional revenue directly related to an upsell in a receipt ) in their overall revenue since implementing Receiptful . <p> Receiptful is designed to deliver attractive and effective emails for your WooCommerce store , increase revenue from existing customers , and you can get started with $0 and about 10 minutes . <h> Receiptful Review : Setup <p> You 'll need to setup a Receiptful account and install a connector plugin to get up and running , which took me about 10 minutes total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get an API key to connect your store . <p> Signup <p> Install the Receiptful for WooCommerce plugin , and this will add a settings page to add your API key . This is all you need to do for setup ! <p> Install Receiptful Plugin <p> The only other thing the plugin adds is a new option under WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Emails to disable your Receiptful emails if desired . Once you 've set up your account and connected it to your store , you can then create your emails . <h> Receiptful Review : Create Your Template <p> Your Receiptful dashboard includes an option for creating your email template . You can add your logo and adjust colors as needed . You can also add your store information and a standard email message that will be included in all order received emails . <p> Edit your template <p> There are some merge tags that you can use in your email templates , which are available in a slide-out menu . No HTML can be accepted in the template , but you can insert customer names , dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insert template variables <p> Once you 've created your message and template layout options , you 've created the bulk of your email . You can now add upsells . <h> Receiptful Review : Create Upsells <p> Upsells will be added to your email after the message , and can be before or after order details . There are a few types of Upsells included : Custom , Discount Coupon , Shipping Coupon , and Similar Products . <p> Upsell types <p> The custom type will let you create a customized call to action section with a title , message , and call to action button ( with link ) . This can be used to drive traffic to a particular product , page , promotion , survey , or any custom link . <p> The coupon upsells can be used to automatically generate a coupon for the customer upon purchase . Receiptful uses the WooCommerce REST API to create the coupons , so you wont have to do any creation or management to use this upsell . Add your title and description , as well as an expiration date and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , this upsell will create a new , one-time use coupon for each customer and include the unique , random code in the email receipt . <p> The product upsell type will recommend similar products for customers based on the product tags and categories ( though the development team is continuing to work on this to make sure the algorithm provides the most relevant recommendations ) . <p> Create product upsells <p> The product titles an a description excerpt will be shown in the email if this is active . <p> Product Upsell in Emails <p> Once you have some upsells created , you 'll need to choose which campaign can be active , as only one upsell can be added into your email at a time . You can simply click " Activate " to swap between upsells in order to create upsell campaigns . As you can note the date you switch and pay attention to conversion rate , this can help determine which upsell is most effective for your store . <p> Activate upsells <h> Receiptful In Action <p> As all of the interaction with your store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about tracking coupons or changing options . The coupons created by Receiptful will have unique codes when created , and will reflect your expiration date and discount options . <p> Receiptful coupon created <p> Theyll also be limited to one-time use so that they ca n't be shared with friends or on coupon sites . <p> Receiptful coupon : limits <p> Receiptful also interacts with a couple areas of your WooCommerce site . Once its been activated , it will replace the " Processing Order " and " Completed Order " emails in your shop so that only one receipt is sent when the order is paid . These emails will be disabled from your WooCommerce settings . <p> The order details for customers when viewing their accounts in your store are also changed . Rather than a " View " link to see order details , theyll be able to view the detailed receipt generated by Receiptful . <p> Detailed receipts on " My Account " <p> You 'll also see an order note in your admin to let you know that the email was dispatched successfully . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My favorite part about Receiptful are the reporting options . You wont have to guess at how successful your order received campaigns are ; everything is tracked . You can view sent emails , opens , and clicks from your Dashboard : <p> Dashboard <p> This let 's you see conversion rates for your emails , and you can also view the statistics by day in the detailed view below the reporting graph . <p> Detailed Tracking <p> Coupled with the upsells , this can be a great way to test what kind of upsells lead to new sales at the highest conversion rate for your store . The detailed breakdown can also let you view customers to see customer data , how many emails have been sent , opened , and resulted in clicks , as well as the customer value . The sent receipts view will provide metrics on which receipts resulted in opens and clicks . <p> Customer View <p> Sent Receipts <p> The best part of all of this is that these are sales for which you paid no customer acquisition costs .

I really liked the ability to automate upsells as part of the receipt emails and activating them to create " campaigns " is pretty neat . I 'd like to see more integration between the active upsell and the reporting options ( i.e. , knowing conversion rate of an upsell ) in the future as the app grows ( which is in the plans for the development team ) . <p> Expanding and tightening this WooCommerce integration is next up on the roadmap for Receiptful , which is good news for WooCommerce store owners . As Receiptful is using the WooCommerce REST API to automate a lot of functionality for you and interact with your site externally , you 'll need to be running at least WooCommerce 2.1 to use it , so keep this in mind . <p> As for users of other eCommerce plugins , there are also plans to eventually integrate with some of the other WordPress eCommerce plugins as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , if you 're a WooCommerce store owner , you can check out Receiptful now for free . While there are premium features coming , the current version of the service is precisely $0 , so you can start driving sales from existing customers immediately . <p> Note : This . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138184 @2338184/ <h> Better SEO for Stores on WordPress <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Like many things on your eCommerce store , SEO is something that constantly requires time and effort to improve . Many factors go into increasing the search ranking for your store for relevant keywords . In my previous post about SEO , I covered the basics of search optimization and a few tips to improve it for product pages . <p> In this post , I 'll list a few more tips that you can use to create better search optimization for stores built on WordPress with plugins like WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads . First , let 's do a quick recap of how SEO works . <p> You have to define certain terms called keywords for which you want to rank high in search engines . For example , if you are selling phone cases , then you probably do n't  care to rank high on searches for yard equipment . And so , the content on your store will be focused around phones and phone cases , rather than anything else . These can form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now , specifically for stores on WordPress , let 's take a look at a few more things you can do . <h> Better SEO Tip #1 : Use your blog <p> WordPress is built around publishing on a blog . So it is a waste if you do n't  utilize your blog to create unique content around relevant keywords . You can use your store blog to post about : <p> sales and promotions <p> product announcements and updates <p> customer stories <p> product information and use cases <p> industry news and information <p> You do n't  have to start with all of these . To start , pick one or a few categories that you can create content for on an ongoing basis . Its important to post regularly whether that 's weekly , biweekly , or monthly so that you create an expectation with customers for when new content is posted . Ten posts spread out over some time period will serve you better than posting them within a week and then going silent for a few months . <p> With each post , you can grow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you establish your brands voice that can come from the content and your interactions in the comments section . The blog can be a really flexible place as each post can be about and be optimized for something completely unique . This way , you can develop content that 's not pushing products , and can be more detailed than what you would post on social media . <p> As more customers come to and spend time on your blog , comment on posts , and share your articles , your search optimization improves . In addition , each post can contribute unique content towards your site that can move the dial on SEO . <h> Better SEO Tip #2 : Make navigation easy <p> One of the factors for SEO is the bounce rate which is the percentage of people leaving your store after viewing only one page . This tells search engines that visitors probably did n't  find what they had hoped for on your site . And Google does n't  really want to send people where they cant find what they had searched for . That 's just bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store is to have a engaging sales copy on the landing page with compelling calls to action . This keeps the customer journey going by navigating visitors to the logical next step in the sales funnel . <p> The other thing you can do is to have a clear and well-structured navigation on your store . This will enable customers to filter through to main areas of your shop products . <p> Example of simple top navigation with additional links in the footer <p> If you have a large number of informational pages , consider moving them to the footer . This will keep the top navigation easier to follow . <h> Better SEO Tip #3 : Include a sitemap <p> As the name suggests , a sitemap maps your entire site , i.e. , it creates a list of all the pages on your store . This enables search engines to see all the pages you have and how they are organized . This is typically stored in an XML file on your site servers . <p> Luckily , you do n't  have to know how to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of plugins ( including Yoast SEO ) that can create an XML sitemap of your store . <h> Better SEO Tip #4 : Use a sensible amount of keywords <p> Back in the day , SEO meant carpet-bombing your site with keywords that you want to rank for , whether the content or sentences made sense or not . Today , SEO is a product of well-structured user-friendly content . This means active voice , few or no run-on sentences , areas of emphasis , rich elements , and logically-organized content . <p> This is rarely achieved by having your keyword show up in every single sentence . For example , as I write this post for better SEO , I think to myself how I can improve my ranking for better SEO . I want readers to learn about better SEO , but I do n't  want to inundate them with information about better SEO . <p> As you guessed , my keyword of focus here is " better SEO " . Including it in each sentence is well cringe-worthy . And looks spammy which is the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have actual content of value . That 's why , you want to keep the density of keywords reasonable roughly 0.5% to 3% . <h> Better SEO Tip #5 : Cut down on load times <p> This goes back to the lowering the bounce rate on your site . According to one report , roughly 40% of people abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load . In addition , about half of those surveyed expect websites to load in 2 seconds or less . <p> If your store pages take a long time to load , you may be losing potential customers as they become frustrated and leave . You can reduce load times on your store by : <p> Faster load times can lead to higher conversions for your store . This is because fewer people will leave your site , reducing the bounce rate , which ultimately will improve the SEO . <h> Better SEO : Summary <p> Thanks to the evolution of Googles algorithm over the years , SEO largely goes hand-in-hand with user experience today . Majority of SEO is driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should really consider investing time and effort into creating relevant sales copy , product descriptions , and store content . <p> A good user experience generally means that people spend more time on your store . This feeds into your search optimization as it is a signal for good content . You can actively use your blog to engage customers , make navigation around your site easier , and cut down on load times to keep customers on your store . <p> One of the easiest ways to start fixing your SEO is by using the free Yoast SEO plugin for your store .

@@98138185 @2338185/ <h> Sell Per Unit with the WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Do you need to sell your products based on measurements entered by your users ? WooCommerce is the only platform that will allow you to do this without having an entirely customized solution developed for thousands of dollars . The WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator ( $129 ) allows you to sell items based on weight , volume , length , and other measurements entered by customers . It also allows you to sell items in set quantities , such as boxes , while still displaying pricing per unit to users . You can even let users enter the needed measurements and calculate how much of a product they should order for them . <p> As this is pretty cool and unique functionality , were bringing you a review and tutorial of using this WooCommerce extension today . Full disclosure : I work for SkyVerge , who developed this extension . However , I 've had some inquiries about the plugin and what it does , and decided to share this tutorial / review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the plugin and how to use it . If you need to use measurements at all for your products , the WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator is worth the download . <h> WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator setup <p> For the purposes of this review , I 'm going to assume that you have your WooCommerce store setup in terms of payment gateways , shipping , and other options so that we can focus on creating your measurement products . Once youve setup the WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator , you 'll be able to sell tons of different products , such as : <p> Tile by the box <p> Fabric by the square foot <p> Ribbon by the yard <p> Corks by the pound <p> Garden mulch by the cubic yard <p> Wall paper using room dimensions <p> Fencing for a yard based on perimeter <p> Services that are prices by the minute , hour , or word ( you can add your own units , as these are not included by default ) <p> You 'll also be able to display pricing per unit to customers ( e.g. , $1.29 per ft2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements for , calculate shipping costs based on measurements , and display pricing tables with quantity breaks for your measured items to encourage bulk purchasing . <p> For the initial setup , you only need to select two additional units from WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products : Area and Volume ( and make sure other units are selected ) . <p> Once you 've selected your default units , you can then start setting up measurement products . You can use the calculator in a quantity-based mode or a user-defined mode to make sure you price your products exactly how youd like to . <h> Mode 1 : Quantity-Based Calculator <p> The Quantity-based mode for the WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator is best for selling items that have a defined quantity , such as boxes of tile or flooring . This mode will allow you to optionally display pricing per unit instead of the price for the box , and you can even add inputs for users to calculate how many boxes / units theyll need to purchase . Let 's create a sample product for a box of tile to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a product , and under " price " , enter the price of a quantity rather than the price per unit . For our example , this will be the price of an entire box of tile : <p> You can manage inventory if desired ( i.e. , stock = number of boxes ) , but the next mandatory step is under the " Shipping " tab . Here , you 'll need to set the area or volume per box ( per quantity ) . Since my tiles are 13+13 inches , and there are 16 tiles per box , each box contains 17.3333 ft2 . I 'll enter this along with shipping details for the box : <p> Setting quantity measurements <p> Great , almost done ! Now you 'll need to go to the " Measurement " tab to select what kind of measurement to use . Since tiles use area , I can choose the simple area or LxW calculator . This will simply affect what customers can enter simple area will require them to enter their own area , while LxW will allow them to enter room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many boxes to order . <p> Select Measurement Type <p> Enter Labels <p> Enter the labels youd wish to use for your inputs and save your product = . This is all that 's mandatory ! The only other option you may want to check is the " Show Product Price per Unit option " . This will allow you to show the pricing per unit rather than the price per box so customers have an easy comparison . You can even customize the label to use superscripts if you prefer : <p> Enable per-unit pricing <p> here 's a side by side of what the final product will look like with regular pricing or per unit pricing . Note that when customers enter their required measurements , the quantity is automatically updated for them to reflect the minimum needed : <p> Regular Pricing Display <p> Price-per-unit display <h> Mode 2 : User-Defined Calculator <p> The second calculator mode that you can use is the user-defined mode . This mode is a popular choice for shops that sell measurement-defined products . The user-defined mode will allow you to simply set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact amount needed . The WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator will then automatically calculate the price for the needed amount , and can even deduct the correct stock amount and set the right weight for shipping rates . You can also create a pricing table to provide bulk discounts for higher quantities , and display this pricing table anywhere with the LONG ... shortcode . <p> Let 's use a sample product that 's sold by the cubic yard ( garden top soil ) to illustrate each of these features in action = . We could create a user-defined product using any of the measurements listed , including the " Room Walls " calculator . <p> The first thing you should do for this kind of product is visit the " Measurement " tab , and select the desired measurement . I 'm going to use the Volume ( LxWxH ) measurement and select the units I 'd like to use for each measurement , then enter the labels I 'll be using for each measurement : <p> Enable User Defined Mode <p> If you enable the " Calculated Price " option , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the frontend . Once you check this box , you can then continue setting up your measurement product . I 'm also going to opt to use the user-defined measurements to track inventory and to set shipping rates . <p> User-defined mode settings <p> Note that you can enter option values if desired . If you leave the " Length Options " , etc. , fields blank , users will be able to enter any value . If you enter a comma-separated list of values , this will create a dropdown on the frontend and users must pick one of your predetermined values . <p> Now you can go through the rest of the Product Data tabs to finish product setup . I started with pricing , which will look very different now that we 've enabled calculated prices . Instead of simply entering a regular and sale price , you 'll now be able to enter regular and sale prices per unit ( in our case , price per cu . yd . ) . You can also define a minimum price . This ensures that , even if customers order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing for the order . <p> Entering Price per Unit <p> After setting up pricing per unit , we can then move to inventory . Notice how my " Stock Qty. " has changed instead of defining stock in terms of quantities ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . ) , I can now set stock in terms of my measurement units . In this case , I can enter stock in terms of how many cubic yards of top soil I have available . When a customer enters an amount of product to purchase , the correct amount will be deducted from this stock amount . Woohoo ! <p> Measured Inventory <p> We can also do something similar with shipping . Instead of simply setting the weight value for one " quantity " of our product , we now define weight based on our measurement units . Rather than entering a weight for a box or for a single product , I 'll enter the weight of one cubic yard of top soil . This way , when customers enter their custom measurements , the correct weight will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product ordered . <p> Setting weight per unit <p> That 's it for setup ! We can save our product , and take a look at what happens on the frontend : <p> User-defined : Min Price used <p> User-defined : Min price not needed <p> There are a couple things to notice in these examples . <p> See that dropdown for " Garden Height " ? That 's there because I entered a list of options when I set up my product . If I left it blank , users would be able to enter their own values . <p> In the first example , the price should be $4.22 . However , since we set a minimum price , the price will remain $9.95 until this price is exceeded . <p> The second example exceeds the minimum price , so the price increases ! <p> This redefines the " quantity " for the product . I could increase quantity to " 2 " and I 'd get 2 servings of dirt in the measurements I defined = . <p> That 's all there is to creating super-customizable products ! The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide quantity discounts . <h> Using a Pricing Table <p> Pricing tables are really easy to set up for those of you that would like to offer discounts for bulk purchasing . Pricing table set up will be under the " Measurement " tab as well . <p> When you go to this tab , you can click " Pricing table " and this will enable to you start entering pricing tiers . Note that using the pricing table will move all pricing within the table , so you 'll probably want to set up a tier that starts with a quantity of " 0 " . Youll have to set a range of measurements , then a price for that tier , and can optionally set a sale price . <p> Make sure that your tiers are continuous if one tier ends at 2 cu . yd. , my next tier should start at 2 . If you leave an upper or lower limit blank , this is understood as well . Look at my last rule this will be understood as anything greater than 2.5 cu . yd. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiers as you 'd like by clicking the " Add Rule " button . When you 're done adding rules , you 'll need to choose where to display your pricing table using the LONG ... shortcode the product description usually works well , or if you use the WooCommerce Tab Manager , you can create a new tab for this ( my example does ) . <p> Customers will then be able to view a pricing table and see the price that they 're getting as they enter their measurements : <p> Using the Pricing Table <p> Notice that the price shown is in the middle tier since I 'm ordering more than 1 yd3 but less than 2.5 yd3 . If I order exactly 1 yd3 , then the price will be $18.99 . Customers must exceed the lower limit ( i.e. , 1.001 yd3 ) to get the discounted price for the next tier . <h> Conclusions <p> The WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator is a really power solution for selling products using measurements , and offers functionality that 's fairly unique when compared to what 's offered on other platforms . You 'll gain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can easily convert from quantity-based product management to measurement-based management . You can also use the calculator to help customers determine how much of a product theyll need to purchase even if you 're selling in quantities . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Building a new website , saw WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator ( WMPC ) plugin . We sell fabric , so a person buys 3 meters of fabric called Maple Leaf , BTW we have removed the " Quantity +- from being displayed . So now I 'm ready to go view my cart and I want to buy 2 more meters but i cant change the quantity of the WMPC quantity field . I would like to be able to update this field on the cart page before checkout and not have to go back to the Product Page Note that we have also remove the " quantity =- " from the cart page because it was confusing for customers . If customers wants 6 meter piece of Fabric and not 3 meter ( WMPC quantity field ) X 2 ( woocommerce quantity +- box ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong or is the plugin missing a major component ? <p> Hey Dan , sounds like you 'd need to re-enable quantities to do what youre asking . If you only sell this in 3m pieces , you can also sell it in quantity-mode and let users enter what they need like the first sample here ( which auto-calculates quantity ) : LONG ... However , this wont let them edit what 's already in the cart . <p> 1 . I did n't  disable quantities just hiding the from being displayed via CSS style . 2 . We sell in whatever quantity you want 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.5 meters etc .. hence why we looked at WooCommerce Measurement Price Calculator ( WMPC ) plugin. 3 . My biggest issue with this plugin is that you should be able to update the WMPC quantity field on the cart page . we assumed that this would work . Nobody wants to have to go back to the product page in order to do that ! <p> Hey Dan , you can definitely update quantity for user-defined products on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig into this further sounds like you 've got some sort of conflict going on . <p> Hi ! I have bought this extension , and it is working great , except for one thing that is major . The measurement , ( in may case length for a fabric by the meter sale ) does n't  display in cart or checkout pages . is there a snippeyt to add to my theme ? or a known bug ? <p> I am looking at building a website for window coverings . These would be custom cut to fit each window . So a customer would measure all the windows they want covered and order a quantity of each of the custom sizes they require . <p> There are two things I would like to know if your plugin can do : Can you set a maximum length and height ? Can an additional fee be added ? In our case if someone orders a large number of small covers there is the need for a cutting fee . <p> Hey Ian , per your Qs : 1 ) only a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used ; length / width ca n't have a maximum value set separately 2 ) It sounds like there 's some custom logic around your fee , so youd probably need a custom companion plugin developed to tie into both the measurement and quantity to assess the fee . <p> Hey Ian , I have n't used that plugin myself , but at first glance I think it would be . Does n't  look like its modifying the product pricing / quantities at all , which is where we typically see incompatibilities ( i.e. , Composite Products is incompatible ) . <p> i like to show price in per 300gms by default instead of per unit gram .. is that possible ? ? ? if so how ? for ex. i want customer see price of 500grams onion by default in catalog pages and product page both . <p> Hey there , I 'd recommend just using a variable product or standard product then , and allowing customers to adjust quantity as needed you could adjust this in the title or change your pricing display with custom code for that product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required length ? This would affect the shipping options available . For example , if length is below 8ft Canada Post options should display if over 8ft then Motor Freight . I am trying to get this right but to no avail . If i leave any dimension blank under Shipping Tab then on the Cart page I am getting an error Product # is missing dimensions . Aborting . If I input width x height then the same error . If I enter length x width x height then the required length that customer inputs is being ignored . Am I doing something wrong ? <p> Hey Dan , no hacking necessary = . You can enter a comma-separated list of accepted values instead of lettings customers enter one , and this will create a dropdown with those choices ( see docs here ) . <p> I 'd love to be able to only allow customers to purchase in 1/4 yard increments so if someone tried to order 1.22 yards or 1 2/3 they could n't OR they could add 1 yard + dropdown 1/4 . I do n't  think having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution : i.e. 1 , 1 1/4 , 1 1/215 1/2 etc etc etc . <p> Hey Anish , I 'm afraid custom increments are n't  really possible . You could just make this a simple product for 1/4 yard , then the quantity can be adjusted so the customer can select the total amount this way , i.e. , 1/4 yard x quantity of 8 = 2 yards ( could be done automatically using quantity-based mode as well ) , or include a notice in the short description that 1/4 yd increments should be used . <p> Hi , Client purchased this plgin , and i used it for the product as calculator . Now he wants only the calculator on home page.How do i do it ? ? Its simple Product names value X area wise installation charges = price estimation I do n't  know php ? ? <p> Hi thanks for the info . My question is about comma-separated list of accepted values and inventory control . I sell fabric and if I provide a list from 0.5 , 1 , 1.25 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease as the product sells ? Or will I need to manually adjust the list to customers are not able to order more than what is in stock . TIA <p> Hey Marlene , if you enable calculated inventory then whatever the customer orders will be deducted from inventory automatically . If there 's not enough inventory to cover an amount in your list ( i.e. , " 20 ft " is an option , but I only have " 18 ft " in stock ) , then that value will still be in the list . However , the customer will get a notice when trying to add it to the cart that says there 's not enough stock : <p> " You can not add that amount of ProductName to the cart because there is not enough stock ( 18 remaining ) . " <p> I can see that Measurement Price Calculator supports the Product Variations . <p> " The Measurement Price Calculator quantity and user-defined calculators are compatible with product variations : product measurements from the selected variation are used if defined . The user-defined calculator is also fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product variation " <p> Example : user fills in width &amp; height of product , the Price Calculator generates a price , let 's say 212$ . Now the user selects a variation , a different color than default , which is 50$ extra . Am I correct that it will add the two prices together creating a total of 262$ ? <p> I am very new to all of this website building and have a couple of questions that I think you may know the answer to ? I have installed WooCommerce to open my Roller Blind Store online and I have purchased the Measurement Price Calculator plugin . Is there anything else I need to install to do the following : <p> Create a Length and Width option for my customer Write a formula so the price calculates for their window measurement ? <p> Also is there a video on how to set up the measurement price calculator because I 'm slightly stuck and can not seem to find the answers on where/how to write my prices for specific measurements ( the customer will manually be putting there measurements into a box on the website ) .

Yknow , bang on a keyboard and make money come out . I love being able to manage accounting , invoicing , products , and communication for a business entirely from my laptop , no matter where I am in the world . <p> However , our customers are not inside of our laptops just like our business they 're out in the real world , and parts of our business need to reach them . They need to know where you are or where to find your products if they 're out there ( think brick-and-mortar store , events , and more ) , which means you may need a way to display store , distributor , event , or pickup locations to your customers . <p> I 've recently found a pretty cool app to do just that : StoreMapper.co . You can use StoreMappers app to display locations to customers , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search radius , whether or not customers can change search radius , add custom location information such as operating hours , and easily integrate it anywhere on your WordPress site . <p> I 'll go through some basics and three scenarios that I 've either worked with or have been asked about for WordPress stores and how StoreMapper can work for each . <h> StoreMapper Basics <p> StoreMapper is a subscription service , so you can get started with a 7 day trial and sign up for a plan that ranges from $7.50 to $30 per month ( annual discount ; monthly pricing is $9-$39 ) . All plans include some essential features like the ability to bulk-upload a list of locations or export locations to CSV , and maps can be used internationally . StoreMapper even has a mobile display that will use the native Maps app when customers want to get directions to a location . <p> You can integrate your maps anywhere on your WordPress site , and they can also be integrated on other platforms like Facebook . You can add information about each location , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom fields for information like operating hours or manager names . <p> Settings <p> Pro &amp; Premium plans also have cool features like the ability to custom style your maps ( theyll inherit your themes CSS and can be styled further ) , and premium plans include an analytics suite : <p> Analytics suite <p> This can be really powerful for a couple of reasons . First , you can see where search queries are coming from to know where your potential customers are . If you 're looking to add locations , events , or distribution , this can be a great market research tool . Second , you can see which locations have the most searches close to them to adjust your resources ( such as staff or number of events ) appropriately . <p> So now that we know some basic information , let 's talk about use cases StoreMapper supports . <h> Scenario 1 : Store &amp; Product Locations <p> This is the obvious one = . So here 's the scenario : <p> You have a thriving WordPress eCommerce store probably powered by one of the plugins we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These may either be stores of your own , or stores that distribute your products . <p> StoreMapper can be used to add all locations that sell your products outside of your website , and can be embedded on a page or within a widget on your site . Customers can then search for the closest location . <p> Real-life example : My company had a client that sold their own products via WooCommerce , but also sold products through CVS , Target , and Walmart . Customers wanted to know if they could purchase products elsewhere to avoid shipping costs , so StoreMapper provided a way to upload all distribution locations and easily display them . <p> Customers could then search for locations that sold these products closest to them by entering their zip code . We embedded the StoreMapper app in a page , then added a link to this locator page from the single product page template with a link that said , " Want to purchase this in-store to avoid the shipping ? Check for a location near you . " <p> This would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can easily map all paid listings in the directory , and visitors can search for listings near them . You can even use custom fields as ratings ! <p> StoreMapper can be used to create an interactive map of all event locations . For example , let 's say you 're selling concert tickets for an artist on tour . Customers can enter their location to find the closest event , then you can link to the product page for them to purchase the tickets . <p> Rather than linking to a " website " for each event , you 'll link to the appropriate product page . Customers can click the " Website " link to view full details and purchase . This way , they can find the event or location closest to them within a couple of minutes and get right to booking those tickets or appointments . <p> More importantly , they never have to leave your site to do so . Any time someone leaves your site , you run the risk that they wont return . Give them all of the information needed within your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to be able to do this for WordCamps close to me = . <h> Scenario 3 : Find a Member <p> Instead of using StoreMapper to display where you are , you can show your members where other members are located . This can be great for nonprofits or member networks , as members can search for other members close by . <p> Rather than using the store list for store locations , you can enter each members location and their website or contact information ( whatever they 've agreed to make accessible to the network ) . This can be more effective than just having a public members directory or listing depending on what your member network is for . Using your membership plugin , you can restrict the page or post that displays the StoreMapper app to be available to members only so that its not accessible to non-member visitors . <h> Usage &amp; Screenshots <p> Let 's treat this like a , " Where will you find Beka Rice this month ? " game . Kind of like Wheres Waldo ? . Ill map out some of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was able to get this set up and running on my site in 7 and a half minutes . <p> First , I 've set up my custom fields and basic styling settings under the " Settings " page . If you 're using a Pro or Premium plan , you can change styling . I recommend setting the default width to 100% instead of 750px so that your StoreMapper widget will fill the space its in . <p> Now you can add some locations . I 've added a few of my favorites , and included basic information like websites , emails for the location , and phone numbers . You can also include a link to a logo or image for that location . <p> Add New Location <p> If you do n't  want to add locations manually , you can simply upload a list of event or store locations from a CSV to make location addition quick and easy .

@@98138188 @2338188/ <h> Email Case Study : Order Confirmation Email from Bellroy <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This month , we take a look at the order confirmation email and the accompanying shipping confirmation email from Bellroy , makers of leather wallets . The order confirmation email is one of the default emails in WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads . <p> In this post , we break down the email from Bellroy to see what works , what does n't  , and what gets us to click . <h> Bellroy order confirmation email : What was good about the email ? <p> Bellroys order confirmation email top half <h> 1 . Conversational tone <p> The content in the email is in a conversational and casual tone . This helps set the tone and voice of the brand . Although the content is bare , it accomplishes in getting across the message . The simplicity and cleanliness is part of the Bellroy brand and products , and the content in the email exemplifies that . <p> In addition to the active voice , the email has small personalizations within the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are part of the sentence before the order details section . These are small details , but leave a good impression as these show that extra thought and effort was put into the construction of the email . <h> 2 . Information <p> The email contains useful order , shipping , product , and contact information . Customers can see the shipping addresses and how long the shipment will take . The email also includes specific order information like the SKU code . All this can help customers easily convey information if they need more information or need to talk to a customer service . <p> Bellroy order confirmation email bottom half <h> 3 . Design and layout <p> The email has a simple and elegant design . The colors and styles are consistent with the brand . The email is broken up into different sections containing different information . This helps organize the information in chunks so that it is easily consumable . <h> Bellroy order confirmation email : What was bad about the email ? <h> 1 . Product images <p> One of the things that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a customer regularly orders from the store , it may not be readily clear which email contains information about which product . This is especially true when most products have similarly labeled variants . <p> In such cases , including product images can help distinguish each product in the email from other products , and from products in other such emails . This can create a better customer experience as customers have to spend less effort to find the same information . <h> 2 . Call to action <p> Each touchpoint with a customer is an opportunity to continue the customers interaction with your brand . To this effect , having a clear and highlighted call to action can prompt customers to engage with your brand in a way that you want them to . <p> In this email , the focus for next steps is not very clear . Customers are asked to provide feedback , stay connected , and join the Bellroy communities . However , there is no defined hierarchy of actions . You should always set and highlight the action of highest priority that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear , you can contextualize it in the email with additional details or incentives for people to click . For example , if you are asking for feedback , you can more clearly define what type of feedback you are looking for a rating on a scale of 5 , about the product quality , about the store experience , etc. <h> 3 . Reason to come back <p> One of the things you can always aim to grow is the customer lifetime value . Part of growing this metric is to keep customers engaged with your brand . The Bellroy email does n't  necessarily give any reason to customers to go back to the store . <p> In your emails , you can include information about related products , store credit or coupons , etc. to give customers an extra incentive to go back to your store . <h> Order confirmation email : What got us to click ? <p> The shipping information was one of the best things about the emails . The shipping address and estimated time to delivery is outlined in the order confirmation email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more specific information about when the order was shipped . <p> Shipping confirmation <p> The image at the top right of the emails clearly distinguish the type of the email . Many times , stores use a similar template with only changes to the content . This can make the emails harder to distinguish . By having the image at the top , you know right away which email you are looking at . <h> Order confirmation email : Takeaway <p> In this case study , we did a break down of the order and shipping confirmation emails from Bellroy . The emails were well designed , included personalization , had a conversational tone , and incorporated useful information . All these resulted in a very clean email experience . <p> On the detracting side , the emails lacked product images which could make the emails more visually stimulating , and lacked a clear and strong call to action . There is no defined action that you are are required to take at the end of the email , which can be a lost opportunity . For your emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do next whether that 's liking or sharing on social profiles , signing up for an email newsletter , browsing recommended products , or assigning a coupon for their next purchase . <p> If you would like to customize your default WooCommerce order confirmation email template , read our recent post , and this post . <p> Are there other things that you include in your order confirmation emails ?

@@98138189 @2338189/ <h> WooCommerce Payment Gateways Comparison <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> While WooCommerce has various payment options built into the core plugin , such as PayPal Standard , most stores will need another payment option for payment or credit card processing . If you 're not locked-in to a particular payment processor , you may want to check out our overview on how to select one . In this article , well compare some of the top options with WooCommerce . <p> However , if you know you want to use WooCommerce and have a plan for your site , such as the ability to accept recurring payments , you may want to have some more information about the WooCommerce-specific options available . We also have a comparison chart for your visual people at the end of this article . <h> WooCommerce Payment Gateways Comparison <p> There are a lot of points to consider when selecting a processor that we 've covered already . However , the integration between a cart system and processor is also important , and different integrations provide different functionality for the merchant and users that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consideration when selecting a processor for a WooCommerce store and will compare some of the most popular WooCommerce gateway integrations . <h> Location <p> Before searching for an appropriate gateway integration , the merchant location will probably be the first limiting factor . If you 're in the US , you 're not going to be limited by much . However , for merchants outside of the US , this could very well influence the entire decision-making process . Most processors support merchant accounts in the US , Canada , and EU , but merchants outside of those regions will probably be limited to PayPal for payment processing . <p> If PayPal Standard does n't  work for you , then you can upgrade to PayPal Pro , Advanced , or Express depending on your needs and what kind of checkout type you want . If you operate or sell high volumes of products in the Netherlands , you 'll probably want to look into using iDeal Mollie , as debit cards are used far more than credit cards by Dutch citizens . <p> Some processors , such as Stripe and Braintree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU and could become alternative solutions for international merchants soon . Both are solid choices , and have completely PCI compliant integrations , though we do prefer Stripe at Sell with WP . <p> Note that all gateways that support Subscriptions also support storing credit cards for customers , which helps reduce friction for purchases and encourages customers to buy , even if you 're not selling a product that uses recurring billing . <p> PayPal Standard is built into WooCommerce , and supports Subscriptions so that you can get started without another gateway integration . However , PayPal Standard does not support changes to recurring billing amounts , nor does it support date changes for businesses that prefer to bill all customers on the same day of the month . Stripe sticks out again here , as its WooCommerce integration fully supports all Subscriptions features , along with Authorize.net CIM , Braintree , and Intuit QBMS . First Data also supports almost all Subscriptions features ( except payment method changes ) . <p> Chase Paymentech also fully supports Subscriptions , but Chase requires an intensive merchant validation process to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a few different ways to implement payment integrations with a cart system . Many integrations use a direct on-site checkout method , which keeps the user on your site and routes payment information through your servers . Many businesses prefer this approach , as the checkout experience is seamless and allows the business to customize the checkout process . It also reduces the likelihood of abandonment , as customers do n't  get nervous when they 're taken to a different site to complete the payment process . In addition to many of the gateway integrations already listed , Authorize.net AIM is also very popular for this sort of checkout integration , as Authorize.net is popular processor , but AIM does not incur additional monthly costs like CIM does . <p> Direct checkout integrations require an SSL certificate to protect payment information since data is routed through your servers to complete the transaction , which can affect PCI compliance . <p> If you do n't  want to keep customers on your site for checkout due to security concerns , you can use a redirect / off-site checkout method instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are routed to PayPal to complete a transaction , then redirected back to your site so that processing is routed through PayPals servers instead of your own . Since sensitive payment information is n't processed by your sites servers , SSL certificates are not required for these integrations . <p> If you want an approach that takes a middle-of-the-road approach , you could look at PayPal Advanced or the Chase Paymentech integration . Both of these integrations iframe the checkout page , which gives the appearance that customers have not left your site , as the checkout form is embedded into the checkout page . However , payment information is routed through the processors servers . While this limits flexibility on how the checkout process is displayed , it does add a layer of security for customers . <h> PCI Compliance <p> PCI compliance is near impossible for most people to understand ( myself included ! ) , and most sites that accept payments are actually not 100% compliant . Not only does PCI compliance set requirements on your site and processing integration , but also relates to your websites servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your control . Unfortunately , the best comparison I can think of is like sex education abstinence of processing payments through your servers is almost the only guaranteed method of PCI compliance . Other methods can cover most security concerns , but never reach 100% compliance . And now that 's more than enough of that metaphor . <p> The exceptions to this are integrations that redirect users through processors servers obviously , as transactional data is n't handled by your sites server ( such as PayPal Advanced or PayPal Express ) , and integrations like Stripe and Braintree that use client libraries to tokenize payment data before sending it through your servers . Using an SSL certificate covers much of the security needs for a site , and is usually good enough for most stores and payment integrations . However , some business owners are required to be 100% PCI compliant and will have to determine an appropriate integration to use . <p> UPDATE : To clarify this further : many sites do n't  need total PCI compliance ( which may or may not be required by your merchant account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the security that you need , as most sites wont be subject to attacks when there are always far bigger fish to catch ( think Target-level security breaches ; netting data for tens of thousands of users makes the work in doing so far more worthwhile than trying to hack your site , which is probably much smaller ) . You should be in contact with your payment processor to determine what requirements exist for your account to be sure you 're meeting their standards in some cases , you simply have to pay a monthly fee for non-PCI compliance . <h> Other Points <p> In addition to the particular details of each WooCommerce integration , you 'll also probably want to weigh the fees charged by each processor into your decision . We wrote an article on selecting payment processors and have a comparison spreadsheet of some of the largest processors that could help with this . <p> There are also a lot of other payment gateway integrations for WooCommerce ( 111 currently ! ) , as the ones we 've discussed are the most popular , but certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for official WooCommerce integrations , as we have n't compared those from third parties or integrations with other platforms , so please do n't  extrapolate this information to other cart systems . <h> Comparison Chart <p> As a former teacher , I try to remember to help all of you visual learners = . here 's a comparison chart that summarizes the points above , or you can check it out here : <p> Disclaimer : The author works for SkyVerge , who developed some of these WooCommerce integrations . Despite this , every effort is made to be impartial and to evaluate each plugin referenced with equal measure . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 15 Comments <p> When you write " mostly " under PCI Compliance regarding PayPal Pro what do you mean ? I have read that it is not PCI compliant . Can I do anything to make it PCI compliant without having to make my complete server PCI compliant ? <p> With PayPal Pro + an SSL , payment data is protected , but the setup is n't PCI compliant ( even with a PCI compliant server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore there 's no way you could actually make this entirely PCI compliant . However , PayPal does n't  require total PCI compliance of their merchants and instead only requires an SSL to use PayPal Pro . <p> The only way to achieve total PCI compliance would be to use a redirect payment method , such as PayPal Standard / Express , to use a hosted payment form ( i.e. an iframe such as Chase Paymentech ) , or to use a gateway that tokenizes information before sending it through your server ( such as Braintree or Stripe ) . <p> Thank you for quick reply . PayPal is claiming that the PayPal Pro plugin from Woocommerce is not accepted even when on a SSL . PayPal claims the server needs to be PCI Compliant . Though another PayPal employee said the plugin on SSL was okay . Any advice on how to proceed ? <p> Hey Wendy , that would honestly be the first time Ive ever heard PayPal say that the server needed to be PCI compliant to use the PayPal Pro integration I know most people using PayPal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 'd be fine proceeding in that direction . <p> I have once again contacted PayPal and they again claim Woocommerce PayPal Pro is not PCI compliant unless they integrate the " Hosted PayPal Pro " solution . So basically Woocommerce PayPal Pro plugin is rather useless . Perhaps it was useful before because PayPal did mention that it is rather recently that MasterCard and Visa has pushed for more strict rules . <p> Hey Wendy , this may be something youd want to contact WooThemes about if PayPal is saying requirements have to change . I 'm sure theyll be able to get in touch with PayPal directly to ensure that the plugin is going to meet PayPal Pro standards . <p> I did write to Woocommerce and they are WELL aware that people are using this plugin without being PCI Compliant . Guess they just want to sell as many plugins as possible and have no interest in informing people about the danger of not being PCI compliant . <p> They said they are planning to sort it with the " hosted PayPal Pro " solution but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort it . <p> Hey Ryan , great question ! While some of these , such as PayPal Advanced , do n't  require an SSL , it never hurts to have . Users are used to seeing this while logging into accounts , so if they create a customer account on your site , they may not be as comfortable storing personal information if they know that its sent in plain text to your server . We use SSLs on almost all of our sites for this reason alone to protect our own login information . SSL certs also build trust with users , as even though they 're redirected for checkout , they want to know that the entire process is secure , including the address / personal information they enter on your WooCommerce page . Many have been trained to look for the " lock icon " when visiting any site that accepts payments , and theyll see your site this way even if it does n't  directly gather payment information . <p> My people do n't  understand PCI . Woocommerce is not PCI-DSS compliant . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world compliant for PCI-DSS . You should look at SalesCart , as it is the first shopping cart in the world that is out-of-scope for PCI-DSS and it will work with WordPress . It is free for less 10 products at which point you probably are n't  ready for credit card acceptance anyway and at $35/month includes the cart , credit card acceptance , gateway , and no other PCI fees . At that price , the shopping cart is still essentially free because getting credit card acceptance to below $35 with Gateway and PCI is nearly impossible . <p> If your cart/online store is not compliant and is also in scope for PCI-DSS , then your website , webserver , blogging software , webhosting , network and your entire business is OUT of COMPLIANCE for PCI . Period . The End ! <p> Hey Michael , PCI compliance is definitely a murky subject , especially since there are several levels of compliance . Neither WooCommerce or WordPress itself is PCI compliant , which is why the only gateways listed as compliant are those that host the payment off-site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or those like Stripe and Braintree that can tokenize payment information before it even hits your server . This way , your servers do n't  have to come into play , as most webhosting servers are not PCI compliant , and your website does n't  necessarily need to be compliant because you 're accepting payments via a compliant site and not your own ( or using a tokenization method in the case of Stripe or Braintree ) . <p> As such , I would n't say that the WordPress eCommerce plugins , including WooCommerce , are not compliant . Rather , they 're only PCI compliant if you use certain payment gateway methods to avoid these regulations . 
@@98138190 @2338190/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> When shopping online , almost every customer expects to be able to email your store with any questions , as email is the most widely used communication method online . However , that does n't  meant that email customer service is the only contact method that your store should provide . <p> Weve written about using Help Scout to manage your customer service emails , as its a great tool and is easy to use . While Help Scout can be one piece of your customer service strategy , you may want to offer other contact methods for a multichannel customer service approach . <h> Why Offer Other Contact Methods ? <p> In a recent survey done by Shopify , successful shop owners recommended their top advice and tips for new stores , and almost half of these tips were to provide great customer service . <p> While email is expected , other customer service channels can either let customers help themselves to find the answers they need , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall service experience with your shop . Alternatives to email support could include live chat , social media , and Q &amp; A resources . <p> Well also discuss offering phone customer service in the next part of this series . <h> Pros and Cons of a Multichannel Service Approach <p> The most important aspect of customer service is to create a human connection with your customers the importance of building a quality connection with your customers ca n't be underestimated . I cant count the number of times that Ive recommended products or resources because I knew the people behind them . If all other things are equal , I 'll always recommend a service or company where I know the people behind it than one I do n't  . <p> Offering customer service channels aside from email can give you more opportunities to get in touch with your customers and communicate with them , helping you to develop that relationship and connection that can be so essential to building a loyal customer base and earning recommendations . <p> Customer service also gives the opportunity to do things that do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sending a free gift or thank you note to someone who recommends you on Twitter , getting feedback from customers via live chat and implementing it , or impressing customers with the care you put into your sales and fulfillment process . <p> While quality customer service is valuable , it can be costly . To offer multiple forms of support , you 'll deal with expenses in terms of your time invested ( if you do your customer service ) , employee costs ( if you hire someone to do it ) , and costs for tools you need to offer different types of service . <p> You 'll also need to appropriately manage customer expectations , which can tend towards expecting fast , 24-hour support that you may not be able to provide until your store is much larger , since chances are you wear several hats within your operation and do n't  focus solely on service . <h> Live Chat Customer Service <p> Offering live chat can be a great way to help customers feel that they 're getting fast , one-on-one attention with your customer service team ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or one other person ) . The benefit to live chat over something like phone support is that it let 's you manage conversations with several customers at once while still providing relatively quick answers to customer questions . <p> Many live chat services also integrate with text or chat services ( like Gchat ) so that you can answer questions on the go from your mobile device , letting you answer questions while you do other tasks like pack boxes or ship orders . <p> Live chat is preferred by many online shoppers , and typically has the highest satisfaction levels of any customer service channel . <p> Live chat has the highest satisfaction levels for any customer service channel , with 73% , compared with 61% for email and 44% for phone . Econsultancy <p> No matter which eCommerce plugin powers your site , you can implement live chat via a WordPress plugin . While I do n't  often use live chat , here are some popular and frequently recommended live chat plugins and services : <p> Zopim let 's you add live chat and automatically trigger chats for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress plugin to integrate with your site . <p> Click Desk can let you integrate live chat with a help desk starting at $20 per month , and integrates with your site with a free plugin <p> Tidio offers live chat that you can use for free ( one user ) or for $10 per month ( unlimited users and access to mobile app ) . You can integrate it on your site with a free plugin <p> If you 'd rather use an installable plugin instead of a monthly service , you could also look at using the WordPress Live Chat plugin . This makes it easy to offer live chat while you 're working on your site , such as updating orders or emailing customers . <h> Social Media Customer Service <p> You 're probably already marketing to customers via social media and maintaining a presence via Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , Instagram , or other sites . This can make communicating with customers via social media a natural fit for your company . <p> While responding to customers via Twitter can be simple , your ability to offer customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how complex answers may be . As you start out , you may not get too many questions via Facebook or Twitter , and can thus manage them pretty easily . <p> Its also okay to funnel them into a contact form or email if you cant respond appropriate via message or need more time to respond . A response is usually expected , but that does n't  mean you have to solve the issue immediately via social media , and can ask the customer to DM you or email you to send a full response later . <p> Tools like Hootsuite can help you get started for free and make it easy to centralize your social media management so you can respond to all channels from one dashboard . Hootsuite also let 's you create views ( " Streams " ) that let you keep track of mentions , or search for your company name to keep track of conversations in which you 're not directly mentioned . This way , you can respond to any questions or mentions to answer customer questions from one place . <h> FAQs &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be constantly available for customer questions around the clock . The nature of selling online is that customers can visit your store 24 hours a day , and you may not be able to help them while they 're shopping . While live chat and social media can help with immediate questions , you should prepare to help customers outside of the hours you can provide these services . <p> Maintaining an FAQ section for both your products and general store questions like shipping estimates can help to proactively answer these questions and improve customer during times you 're not available , while also potentially reducing the number of customer questions you receive . <p> While you answer customer questions , you should track them to determine which questions are asked multiple times and can be organized into an FAQ document on your site . These can be questions such as : <p> Which shipping service do you use ? <p> How long does it typically take for me to receive my order ? <p> What 's your refund policy ? <p> Linking to this section from your contact page can help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer service team and help your customers easily find the information they need around the clock . <p> If you commonly get questions for particular products , keeping a Q&amp;A section the product page can also be helpful . This can be a static information that you update manually , or it can be a dynamic section where customers can ask their own questions . A plugin like WooCommerce Product Reviews Pro can help out here by adding the ability to accept and answer questions . <p> Ask a Question <p> Product Reviews Pro Questions <p> You can also embed a " submit your question " form to make it easy for customers to ask questions . <h> Improving Customer Service by Offering Multiple Channels <p> Providing great customer service when your eCommerce business starts out is imperative to your growth , as it drives customer loyalty and makes customers more likely to recommend your store , helping you grow via word of mouth . It let 's you build relationships and human connections with your customers . <p> However , there are significant costs associated with customer service in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help via email is a great place to start , offering service via other channels can help you get in touch with more customers and improve their experience with your store . Offering Q &amp; A sections on your site or publishing common questions should also go hand in hand with email , and these should be accessible from your site and contact page . <p> You 'll need to determine which other service channels can fit into your workflow , such as live chat and social media , without impacting the quality of the service experience . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Users also tend to stay logged into social networks , which makes it dead simple to stay logged into your site for faster , seamless shopping and checkout experiences . <p> How compelling is social sign in ? <p> Almost 80% of customers prefer social login to registering when visiting an eCommerce site . <h> Social eCommerce Rule 3 : Add Sharing Buttons <p> Want customers to share cool products they find on our site ? Make it as easy as possible to do so . When you reduce barriers , people are more likely to take action . <p> For social eCommerce , this means making it easy to share from the product page . You can add social sharing buttons to product page with many eCommerce plugins . <p> We previously mentioned WPSSO ( or the pro version ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social sharing buttons that will add your sharing buttons throughout your site , including on product pages . You can determine the location of sharing buttons , such as in a floating bar , before or after content , or within a widget . <p> You can also use EDDs Social Discounts as a sharing tool , as it can be used with or without discount functionality . <h> Social eCommerce Rule 4 : Share User Content <p> This really gets to the heart of getting social interact with your users via social media , and checkout what they have to say about your store . One of the best ways to do this is via Instagram . <p> There are a couple of cool plugins to integrate Instagram with your WordPress site . The Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram will let you display both your own Instagram images or your feed via shortcode so you can show users what you 've been up to on Instagram . However , I really like the idea of using this plugin to display images from a global tag on your site . <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the #sellwithwp tag on your Instagram photos . I could then display any photos with that tag on my site , no matter which user they 're from . This is a cool way to incorporate your customers photos on your site , and you can even choose the best Instagram photo each month for a prize . <p> Alpine PhotoTile Sample <p> You can also import your Instagram photos to WordPress instead of fetching them via the Instagram API using the Instagram importer plugin . This will import Instagram photos into your media folder . <h> Social eCommerce Rule 5 : Use Social CTAs <p> Remind customers to take action as part of your social eCommerce strategy by using social calls to action . For example , you can remind them to share a purchase from a WooCommerce store using the WooCommerce social checkout plugin . Social recommendations like this are trusted by readers and provide a valuable source of traffic people want to know about what their friends buy . <p> If you 're using a different eCommerce plugin , you can also use a social sharing button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as WPSSO SSB ) . You can then put a message on your " Thank You " / Order Received page with the corresponding buttons shortcode to remind customers to share their purchases . <p> You can also use calls to action with an associated reward . <h> Social eCommerce Rule 6 : Offer Rewards <p> You can also reward customers for taking action on social media . Offering an incentive drastically increases the likelihood that customers will take the action you want them to take . <p> Using WooCommerce ? You can check out the Social Coupon extension . This shows social buttons on the product , cart , and/or checkout page . When the customer takes the social action you want , a coupon that you 've created and selected for the action is automatically applied to the cart contents . <p> Using Easy Digital Downloads ? The Social Discounts extension is something you 'll want to look at . This extension applies a discount as soon as a post , page , or product has been shared via social media . You can even customize the shared message and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Social eCommerce Conclusions <p> Social eCommerce should put the focus on interaction rather than information . You can interact with your customers by making it easier to share your content and engage via social media , let them use their favorite networks to log into your site , and offer rewards to thank them for sharing your products or content . You can even include user content in your store , such as Instagram photos , to forge a better connection between your site and customers and to bring them closer to your brand . <p> The beauty of using WordPress for eCommerce is the sheer number of integrations and extensions available , and social media is no exception . There are tons of plugins available to support your social eCommerce plan . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138194 @2338194/ <h> The Importance of Product Reviews for eCommerce sites <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Merchants very frequently underestimate the importance of product reviews for eCommerce stores . With all of the other concerns that eCommerce sites have to worry about , such as increasing conversions , optimizing site design , customer service , and administrative tasks ( anyone that 's had to dive into tax rates and laws knows exactly what I 'm talking about ) , site owners can get bogged down by too many tasks to manage . <p> Do n't  let that become an excuse to forget about details like customer reviews , as they typically have a very strong influence on customer purchase decisions . When customer reviews have been included , 42% of site administrators have reported increases in average order value , versus only 6% that report a decrease with inclusion of reviews . <p> Obviously , there are a lot of factors at play in average order value , which makes it difficult to isolate reviews as the sole source . However , the strong correlation between reviews and conversions , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer confidence , make a compelling case for including product reviews in your eCommerce store . <h> Why Customer Product Reviews Matter <p> eCommerce pioneers like Amazon and eBay have been using product reviews since 1997 , so many consumers have come to expect and appreciate the ability to evaluate products before purchasing . About 40% of customers even say they would n't buy electronics without reading online reviews . Reviews become even more important in the absence of the ability to test products prior to purchasing online , which is not a concern in brick-and-mortar stores . <p> Advances in Economics and Business ( an international peer-reviewed journal ) has conducted studies into the likelihood of product reviews influencing purchase decisions . Their findings are very interesting , and point to reviews as an important part of the research process for customers : <p> 85.57% of the participants stated that they read reviews often or very often before they purchase online . Of the participants who read reviews , 83.65% compare positive and negative reviews with each other ( p. 3 ) . <p> Customers will first look for product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see which products deserve their attention ( for example , they tend to ignore products with an average rating of 1 out of 5 starts ) . Once a product has been clicked on , prospective customers will then compare reviews to one another and depend on the feedback from other customers . The study cited above has also found that 75% of customers state that reviews , not just ratings , are " Important " or " Very Important " to their decision to purchase a product from an online store . <p> There are also benefits to including reviews aside from conversions . Asking existing customers for product reviews can also help to make them feel as if they 're part of your brand or important to your business , according to these tips from SteamFeed , which increases loyalty . <p> Reviews also allow customers to help you with your products SEO , as they the content of their reviews can be indexed and used for search results . Many times , you may be targeting a specific keyword or set of words within your product descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which targets long tail keywords and helps to give you an SEO boost . <p> If all reviews are positive , customers tend to trust the reviews less . While it may be counterintuitive , poor reviews help to give your customer reviews credibility and to build trust between your store and customers . Theyll view you as more real instead of a scam site , which is essential for building a relationship as an online store . <p> A single negative review wont be a deal breaker . From the Advances in Economics and Business citation above : <p> 11.54% of participants who read reviews stated that a single negative review was the reason for not buying and 18.27% stated that a single positive review was the reason for buying a product . <p> Isolated poor reviews will influence 1 in 9 customers to avoid purchasing your product . However , 3 of 4 customers deem reviews to be important to the purchasing process . While some negative reviews may cause you to lose some customers , you 'll lose a lot more who will avoid purchasing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all reviews ? Nope . Set rules for review approval for your site administrators or customer service team . If the review is libelous or uses obscene language , you can moderate or block it . Otherwise you should approve the review , even if its difficult to allow someone to speak negatively of your product . <p> You could always allow your team to respond to reviews , which is what many stores will do on Yelp or Amazon , in order to offer help or to resolve a situation . Always remember to be as polite and professional as possible . If you 're not asking a question in your response and are instead attacking the review , you 're #DoingItWrong and will look unprofessional to potential customers . Use negative reviews as an opportunity to solicit feedback from unhappy customers and as another avenue for customer service . <p> As we said before , unless reviews are obscene or libelous , you 're probably better off approving them , even if they seem negative . ( Though if they 're all negative , you should probably get in touch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase trust , as customers view this as honest feedback and as validation that others have purchased the product . <p> here 's a comparison spreadsheet of major WordPress eCommerce platforms and product review functionality of each : <h> Further Reading <p> Here are some other articles and studies that detail the importance of customer product reviews for eCommerce stores : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 9 Comments <p> Great thoughts , Beka ! In fact , its making me think pretty hard about what place in our core plugin review should have . If you or anyone else are interested in weighing in , we have a ticket for this idea open on our GitHub tracker LONG ... <p> Thanks ! Reviews are always interesting to me since I 'm that person that researches all Amazon reviews before buying = Researching this post did make me notice that I favor products with any reviews ( negative or positive ) over products without reviews since I feel like other people have n't bought / tried the product if there 's no feedback . <p> excellent idea for e-commerce sites is to put out reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create attention and spotlight the new items , driving new sales . You can also write articles <p> I was thinking about implementing an automatic e-mail follow up with customers a couple of weeks after a purchase to encourage them to write a review . Is there any generally accepted thought on when this kind of e-mail should be sent ? Or if it should be sent at all ? <p> Hey Daniel , I think these kind of emails are fine , and I do n't  mind being sent these emails as a customer . For example , I get them from Amazon for purchases and it sometimes does prompt me to leave a review when I otherwise would have forgotten about it . I 've also had clients use this tactic with success ( 2 total that did so with WooCommerce + Follow Up emails ) . <p> I think the timing depends on your product , but 2 weeks after purchase seems pretty typical . It gives the customer enough time to have tried the product but not forgotten about it . <p> Cool . Thanks for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to use their new Automation workflow to follow up with customers so with the WooChimp plugin implemented I can use MailChimp to automate it all which is nice . Ill try 2 weeks and see how that goes . 
@@98138195 @2338195/ <p> Really ? An eCommerce platform that only allows you to sell one kind of product ? Oh yes , friends . And it does it so well . Easy Digital Downloads let 's you sell simple and variable downloadable products using WordPress , and it does it without any fuss or difficulty . The core plugin is lean and streamlined , and executes exactly what its name suggests : it let 's you easily sell digital downloads . Even better , the plugin is extremely extensible , and I got excited thinking about all of the possible business models that could use EDDs simple but effective sales implementation . Anything else ? Yep . The core plugin is free , and paid add-ons are reasonably priced . <p> Because Easy Digital Downloads is a free plugin , there should be nothing holding you back from downloading it and taking it for a test drive . If you do n't  want to download and install it , you can play with the demo site to get an idea instead . Costs are going to come from paid " Add-ons " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and running , and it looks like the only real marketplace for EDD Add-ons is the official store . You 're most likely looking at $100 to $200 to get rolling , since you 'll need a payment gateway ( unless you 're okay with just PayPal Standard ) and will probably want a couple of handy extensions . <p> As far as themes go , it seems that EDD plays nicely with different themes , so you should n't incur huge costs there . If you want an EDD supported theme , you can check out the theme listings on their website . Some are in-house themes , and others are from Theme Forest or iThemes . Pricing ranges from free to about $80 for supported themes , and there are some really beautiful options . <h> Cost summary : <p> Bonus points for a free core plugin . Theme price is up to you , and you 'll probably spend $100 to $200 on paid extensions . <p> Installation and setup is super easy for Easy Digital Downloads . Settings have good descriptions within the plugin , and if you 're stuck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you need to know . I did n't  need it for much , but the documentation I did look at was pretty thorough and easy to understand . <p> Backend : Admin Settings <p> Under " Misc " settings , you can set Terms of Agreement for the products you sell , which is an fantastic addition for stores selling digital goods , and should be a no-brainer . For example , if you 're selling stock photos , you can required that customers agree to terms before purchase that specify how those photos can be used digitally , in print , and more . If you need to change the terms based on product , the Terms Per Product Extension will do just that . <p> The essential features are included , and not much more than that ( which is a good thing ) . EDD is designed to be general enough for all forms of digital downloads , and the additional specialization you need will come in the form of paid add-ons . For example , if you sell music using EDD , then the Audio Player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to give your customers a preview of the music they are buying . The core offering does exactly what it needs to , then gives you the choice on how you want the rest of the setup to go for maximum flexibility . <h> Tax Settings <p> Tax options are included if needed , which depends on where you 're selling . This varies by state in the US ( I 'm not sure how this works in other countries ) . If your business has nexus ( meaning operates ) in a state that requires tax on digital goods , you 'll be required to collect this tax for customers who purchase goods in your state ( this applies to all states in which you have nexus ) . You 're not required to assess tax on out-of-state purchases . If the customers state requires tax on digital items , according to this site , " It is then purchasers legal obligation to remit the use tax directly to the state where they are using the item if it is taxable . " Yikes . However , I pretty much have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , so I 'd encourage businesses doing a large volume of sales to look into this . There are a few ways of implementing regions to be a bit more technical about collecting tax . <p> First , if you want to just require tax for everyone , and keep track of states to which you 'll have to remit tax , you can just set a default tax rate . Do n't  want to add tax for everyone ? Then you can take a couple other approaches . If your business operates in an area that does not assess tax on digital goods , you can to set your default tax rate to 0.0% and leave it at that ( customers would have to be responsible for tax themselves if required , but it probably would n't be an issue ) . <p> On the other hand , if your business does operate in a state ( or region ) that requires sales tax on digital goods , then you can set a default rate of 0.0% and you 'll want to configure a regional tax for customers in your state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied if the customers billing zip code falls in the specified region . Again , note two things : ( 1 ) I am not a tax expert ( and you know because I just gave this advice for free = ) , so please do n't  take me at my word , and ( 2 ) I have only looked to taxes concerning digital goods in the US . Whew . Now back to the task at hand : No matter how you need to configure tax rates , EDD will let you do it : ) : <p> Backend : Tax Setup <h> Products <p> Product addition is super simple , and creates products as new WordPress pages . You can add simple and variable downloadable products . Product pages include a title , product description , simple or variable pricing , and excerpts . You can also keep track of download stats right from the product editor . <p> Backend : Adding a Downloadable Product <p> Switching between simple and variable pricing is incredibly easy . Check a box . That 's it . You can also allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an album ) or choose one variation ( maybe for software available in a Standard or Pro version ) . <p> Backend : Download Configuration <p> If you 're selling software , you 'll probably want the Software Licensing Add-on for $82 , which provides a complete license key generation , activation , and checking system . You may also want to look into the Lock Downloads to IP Extension to prevent users from sharing file download links . Selling documents ? Then the PDF Stamper Extension to add a watermark may come in handy . No matter what kind of digital good you 're selling , product addition is easy , and you 're almost guaranteed to find an extension ( out of about 160 ! ) that will help you sell your digital product . <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Products are inserted in pages or posts using shortcodes . In your page / post editor , you 'll see an " Insert Download " button , which will help you insert the purchase options , price , and a " Buy Now " or " Add to Cart " button ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downloads Using Shortcodes <p> Now , if that were the extent of the shortcodes available , I 'd be a bit disappointed , since I 'd have to manually add all products to my catalog and set up the layout myself ( and I definitely was disappointed at first ) . However , there are more shortcodes you can use , which the basic documentation covers . The documentation also tells you that you can display products in a grid format using the downloads shortcode , and gives you a list of accepted attributes/parameters . The grid format includes the product image , description , and link to the product page instead of just a purchase button . Sounds great , right ? Now I can set up a page to display all of my products in a given category and create my own shopping pages . For some reason , neither the sales copy nor the installation guidelines tell you this up front ( which is true of a lot of plugins and drives me nuts ) . <p> Products in the Grid Format Display <p> But wait , there 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the documentation . That would have been pretty awesome to know up front , and I would have liked to see it somewhere in the plugin on the WordPress side since that is the major way you 're displaying products . Links to the shortcode reference , or better yet , some integration with the " Insert Downloads " button would have been awesome . That forms one of the few complaints I have with this plugin since I had to go find this out on my own , and brand new users are unlikely to understand everything they can do with shortcodes without some nudging . <p> While we all know shortcodes are super useful , and you can use them with the basic WP widgets , EDD also includes a couple of widgets of their own for a shopping cart ( you can create a cart page with a shortcode instead if you want ) , product categories or tags , and customer purchase history . <p> The customer experience is pretty customizable , and is really up to you . You can determine the layout , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more . Basic product pages display the featured image , product name , description , and pricing information : <p> As we noted before , the easiest way to set up the shopping cart is by using the EDD shopping cart widget . If you do n't  want to do this , you can create a shopping cart page as well , or use the freeWP Menu Cart Extension ( which has a Pro version for added features ) to make your cart accessible from your navigation menu . <p> Frontend : Shopping Cart Widget <p> Easy Digital Downloads supports both registered user and guest checkout , and , as many plugins boast , uses a one-page checkout , which helps to minimize cart abandonment and maximize conversions . The checkout is very clean and easy to follow : <p> Frontend : Checkout Page <p> Once a customer has purchased your products , they can be taken to the " Purchase Confirmation " page ( make sure to use this in your settings ) , where they can gain access to their downloads . They can also access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to get back to this confirmation and access downloads at a later time , which they may need since you can also force downloads links to expire after a certain time . <p> EDD comes with PayPal Standard built-in . Unless this will work for all your processing needs , you 'll probably need to purchase a payment gateway integration . However , the best bargain for your payment gateway integration may be the Extensions Bundle , which comes in a Stripe Edition , Authorize.net Edition , and a PayPal Edition ( for PayPal Pro and PayPal Express ) . All of these bundles include the payment gateway integration , along with the Mail Chimp Integration , a User History extension to track behavior before purchase , the Amazon S3 integration , and a couple other goodies . If you do n't  use one of these gateways , you can also purchase the integrations individually . Other popular processors that have EDD integrations include Braintree , SagePay , and FirstData . <p> Easy Digital Downloads nails reporting , and provides useful data for your store . You can view Earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for custom date ranges ( in an easy to understand graph ) . You can also view downloads and earnings for products or categories , order data for customers , data for payment method successes and failures , and tax collection data . The " Reporting " menu also boasts a built-in CSV/PDF exporter for sales , customers , and downloads , and logs for file downloads , sales , and more . <p> Backend : Sales Reporting <p> Want to get this information on the go ? You can use the Easy Digital Downloads iOS app for $2.99 , which provides sales tracking , earnings stats , and product overviews for your EDD store . <p> You have to be impressed by a plugin that reaches a 4.8 star rating on WordPress.org with about 150,000 downloads , and EDD does it with 102 five star ratings . What 's more impressive is that reviews show people are pretty pleased overall but especially like the support . Most reviews gush about the help available , as well as the fact that its a durable , flexible , and easy-to-use plugin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including videos , basic support , and a documentation collection that has won some fans . Most support is handled in the EDD basic support forum , and responses seem to be prompt and helpful . If that 's not fast enough or effective enough , priority support will run you $39 per month ( or $129 per year ) , but unless you need answers yesterday , it seems that basic support is great for the average user . <p> One of the really cool potential uses for Easy Digital Downloads is the ability to turn your EDD store into a virtual marketplace . If you want to allow fledging authors to submit sample chapters or ebooks , or if musicians want to upload songs to sell , you can use the Frontend Submissions Extension to allow potential vendors to upload their products for you to review . You can create an affiliate system using the Affiliates Pro Integration Pack , or integrate with the Share a Sale Platform to manage affiliate sales of these products , or simply pay commissions for products sold to create your virtual marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The user interface is intuitive and easily understood , and browsing is simple on the frontend . The level of customization this plugin provides is fantastic , and it offers loads of flexibility in what digital products to sell and how to structure your store . Support and quality is top-notch as well . To top it off , its crazy extensible , and the estimated $200 you 'll spend on your store is well worth it for the quality you get from the plugin and corresponding add-ons . If you 're selling only digital goods , Easy Digital Downloads should be your clear-cut favorite . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article ; If I did n't  test it , I 'm basing my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138196 @2338196/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> However , you may not love coupons there 's a reason for it . Everyone hates to think that they may have missed out on using a coupon , so this little box can be a killer on your checkout page : <p> Customers see this box , and think , " Oh I can probably find a discount , sweet ! " and off they go . Either they find one and use it , or they cant find one and are then disappointed in their shopping experience ( which we definitely do n't  want ) . <p> We wrote a bit more about this when we discussed improving eCommerce conversions , but hiding or renaming the coupon code field can decrease your cart abandonment , as customers do n't  jump away from your site to spend hours at RetailMeNot . This can also save you money on affiliate referrals , as customers wo n't end up clicking a referral link at a coupon site that did n't  actually send them to you in the first place . KISSmetrics has an interesting study that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their advice and change the coupon field around , I do n't  think we need it at all . Easy Digital Downloads has a pretty cool feature that was added in version 2.0 that will allow you to pass discount codes via URL , so we can give out links for coupons instead . <p> Let 's discuss how we can hide the coupon field and only use URLs to apply coupons in our Easy Digital Downloads store . This should help us ensure that customers do n't  leave our checkout to go coupon hunting , but we can still offer discounts as needed . <h> Do I need to do this ? <p> Before we begin : do you need this code ? If you 're not using discounts at all , the answer is no . The discount field is only shown if you 've created discount codes in your shop . <p> This is meant to hide the coupon field on the checkout page even if you have discounts created . This will prevent customers from entering them in the discount field box and wont give an indicator that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still give out coupons via a URL . <h> Provide Coupon Links <p> First , let 's discuss how to remove the discount code field from the checkout page . We can remove this field with a one-line code snippet . The discount code field is added via this action , so well simply remove this action to hide it : <p> removeaction ( ' eddcheckoutformtop ' , ' edddiscountfield ' , -1 ) ; <p> here 's our result on the frontend : <p> Before <p> After <p> Now how you do apply coupons ? The basic structure that well use to apply a discount will look like this : <p> http : //mystore.com/ ? discount=CODE <p> We can add ? discount=CODE to the end of any URL , and this will apply a coupon with the corresponding code ( replace CODE with your coupon ) . <p> You can also use this as part of an add-to-cart link , which can work very well for email campaigns that provide a discount on a particular product . Here are a few example URLs to show you how to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your store URL . <p> Add a simple product to the cart , land on LONG ... Replace the " 123 " with the I 'd of your download , and the " 10off " with your coupon code instead . <p> Add a product variation to the cart , land on LONG ... Replace the " 123 " with the I 'd of your download , 0 with the I 'd of your variation , and the " 10off " with your coupon code instead . <p> You can send these URLs with the discount passed into your customers or email list , and theyll be able to take advantage of coupon codes , while customers who do n't  have a code wont leave your checkout page . <h> Get Fancy : Advanced Tips <p> Okay , that 's pretty neat . But what if your goal is to make sure customers cant see the coupon codes at all ? This way , they assume that the link ca n't be used by others , or you can tell them that the link is uniquely generated for them . <p> Personally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand why some shops want to let Easy Digital Downloads hide coupons completely . You could do this with a few extra steps : <p> Give out shortened links for the URL that contains the code something like bit.ly works fine <p> Create a redirection for the actual add to cart / discount link so customers wont see the naked URL when the bitly link expands . This will add 2 redirects , which may be a bit slow , but its fairly easy to implement ( we have a way to generalize this below ) . <p> Hide the discount code in the checkout table when its applied . <h> Step 1 : Give out a Short URL <p> If you use a custom link shortener , great . Use that . If not , use bit.ly to create a redirect for that ugly URL we made LONG ... <p> You 'll give out the shortened link in your email or marketing campaign to customers . <h> Step 2 : Create a Redirection <p> Well let the shortened link act as a pass through . This ensures that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then well redirect customers to the checkout page , items and discount in hand . <p> I use the Redirection plugin for this . You can create a redirection that uses your ugly URL as the source URL , then the /checkout/ as the target . <p> However , I 'm lazy . I do n't  want to make a new redirect every time I use an add-to-cart or discount URL . The good news is that we can use Redirection with a regular expression . This will allow us to match a URL pattern instead of an exact URL . Let 's redirect any URL that ends in discount=CODE . I 'm going to assume your discount codes only contain letters , numbers , + , . , or a hyphen ( - ) . <p> Well enter our regular expression as our source URL : / ( . * ) discount=A-Za-z0-9+. -+ and redirect this to /checkout/ . This redirection will match anything that ends in discount=CODE , including add to cart links , then send them to the checkout page . <p> This gives us a series of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the add-to-cart / discount link ? before they know what hit em , they 're redirected to the checkout with a discount <p> This applies the action and discount in the background without being seen . <h> Last Step : Hide the Codes ! <p> There 's one last place that coupon codes are used : the checkout order details show the coupon code when its applied . We can rename the discount code on the checkout page to something generic instead , like : " Discount applied " rather than using the code . There 's a handy filter that will let us change this . <p> Now we wont be using the discount code , but will rather use our message instead . You can replace " Discount applied " with whatever text you want . Now we 've got a generic message at checkout that does n't  reveal our code : <p> Code removed <h> Summary <p> That 's it ! I 've got a full gist for summary if you 'd like to view the code in one place , and thanks to Justin for fixing my regular expression madness for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through all this hard work , then include discount codes in your emails = . You can change your standard email template to ensure this . <p> I 'd love to hear about it if you use this tip ! Let me know in the comments . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 5 Comments <p> Beka , thanks for this clear walk-through , I completely agree with the rationale of not showing a coupon field based on my own behavior as a consumer ! <p> How would you go about notifying people clicking through a couponed URL that they have a discount through the whole store , if you were to send them to the storefront instead of using direct add-to-cart ? In a way that goes through the whole coupon logic of course , i.e. checking that its the right URL parameter , is the coupon active , are we during the coupons authorized timeframe <p> Hey Olivier , glad this was useful : ) .

@@98138198 @2338198/ <h> Adding an Easy Digital Downloads Custom Payment Status <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> The core Easy Digital Downloads plugin includes pretty much any payment or order status you 'd need to sell a downloadable product : <p> ! <p> Pending <p> Complete <p> Refunded <p> Failed <p> Abandoned <p> Revoked <p> Core statuses <p> Orders will be created as pending if they 're awaiting payment , and be set to completed once they 're paid since products are delivered automatically . Because your shop does n't  need to worry about shipping , etc. , there are n't  typically other fulfillment or payment statuses needed for order management . <p> While these should meet the needs of most shops , you may want to add your own status to this list . For example , what if you 're using EDD to sell services ? You may need a status to designate that an invoice has been paid , or that a project is in progress . <p> This tutorial will walk through how to add an Easy Digital Downloads custom payment status for use in your store . Well also include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workflow . <h> Add an Easy Digital Downloads custom payment status <p> Adding a new payment status to your store takes only a few lines of code since there 's an eddpaymentstatuses filter to make this very simple for us . <p> I 'm going to use two new statuses throughout this tutorial ( " Invoice Paid " and " Project in progress " ) for my hypothetical services website . <p> To add these statuses , well use this snippet to include them in the array of available payment statuses . You can add as many payment statuses as needed you 'll only need a new i 'd / slug and name for each . Note the i 'd you create , as you 'll have to use this to reference your order status elsewhere ( if you follow other parts of this tutorial ) . <p> And were done = . I did mean easy that 's all you have to do to start using a new payment status in your EDD shop . You can now use these statuses from the Edit Payment Screen . <p> New Statuses added <p> With that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme a bit more . For example , what if you want to bulk-update payment statuses , or include these in your earnings reports ? We can do that , but itll require a bit more code . <h> EDD Custom Payment Statuses : Bulk Actions <p> Let 's first talk about adding these new statuses to our bulk payment history actions . If you 're processing several orders a day , you may be managing them in bulk . EDD includes several core bulk actions that you can use to select multiple orders , then update the status . <p> Core Bulk Actions <p> We have a couple of very well-placed filters and actions that will let us add our new statuses to this list . First , well use the **27;1774;TOOLONG filter . This will add new statuses into the dropdown for use on the Payment History screen . However , I 'm going to insert them into this list before " Resend Email Receipts " rather than on the end so they 're grouped with other status changes . <p> To do so , well need to loop through the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in this case , it will be after the " Set To Cancelled " action ( though you can use a different one ) . <p> This will now insert our two new statuses into the bulk actions list so they can be selected for orders . <p> New bulk action <p> Now our payment statuses will be included in the bulk actions dropdown , but there 's a slight problem : they wo n't do anything yet , because they 're not tied to an order change . <p> We need to take one more step to ensure that the right action is executed when this bulk action is used . That 's where the **28;1803;TOOLONG action will help us out . Well add our actions here so that they 're performed when selected in this dropdown . <p> When we select a couple of existing orders , well be able to use the bulk actions we 've added into our dropdown . <p> Apply a bulk action <p> When this action is applied , the payment statuses will also be updated for each of these orders as a result . <p> Bulk Changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've inserted statuses that would be between a " paid " and " complete " status , you 'll probably want to include them in your earnings reports . While an " Invoice sent " action should n't be included , an " Invoice paid " order should certainly be counted in our earnings along with those that have completed statuses . <p> This filter includes the arguments for what should be included in reports , and the post status argument is what well need to update ( as each payment status is saved as the WordPress post status for the order ) . Because both of my new statuses represent orders that have already been paid , I 'll want to include them in earnings reports and will merge in two new post statuses for our two new payment statuses . <p> Now all revoked , completed , invoice paid , and in progress orders will be accounted for in your earnings reports so you have a more accurate reporting overview with your custom statuses . <h> Taking it Further : Payment History Screen <p> There 's a final thing we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our store . If you 'd like to filter orders based on our new statuses , we can include this ability in the Payment History screen . <p> Well use the eddpaymentstableviews filter , but these must be valid post statuses to use this filter effectively ( to actually be able to filter orders by our new status rather that just include a dummy link ) . As a result , well need to register our new statuses , then add them to the Payment History page . <p> The only thing we cant do here is include the counts for these order statuses , as wed have to do a bit of hacking to include the post status count for our custom statuses . <p> Now that we 've ( 1 ) added these as valid post statuses ( just like other core payment statuses ) and ( 2 ) added them to our Payment History screen , theyll be displayed along with other order statuses . <p> Filter by new status <p> Clicking on our order status link will filter orders to show only those with the desired status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happens if you remove this code ? Your order will still exist , but wont have a status set . This means that it wont be included in reporting , etc. , so youd probably want to change it to a core status if you decide to remove this code at some point in the future . <p> No status set <p> I have a gist here of all of the code in this article if you want to copy / change it and add all of the features above into your site . This should completely integrate your new Easy Digital Downloads custom payment status entirely into your order workflow . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

I currently only have one small ebook which right now I want o market as a " freebie " . But , then do the road , I hope to have one that will be purchased for a price . Does Selz have an option to offer " free downloads " of something like a digital product as part of their service and have a way t skip the whole check-out process . Basically , it would work almost like an autoresponder . Someone would choose the product they want , and then be sent an e-mail with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for it or go through checkout . Also , since the price is zero , does this mean there is no charge for this under the SELZ model ? I currently use MADMIMI for my mailing list , but I have the free service which does n't  have autoresponder support , so I cant use that for sending out free downloads , so I was hoping to use SELZ to do this , and then I would use it later when I had an ebook to actually sell for some money . <p> Hey Michael ! Thanks for your interest in Selz . We do have a way for you to give away free products all you need to do is set your price to free in your product listing . There 's no transaction fee on free products = You might like to have a read of this article Kristi Hines did a case study on using Selz as her email opt in with some really positive results LONG ... and if you have any other questions just let us know at help@selz.com . Melissa <p> I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment wall . First I set up woocommerce on my site , then I add a virtual product Then I upload my video to youtube but as a private video ! On the advanced tab of my woocommerce product I add the link using html on the optional section to leave buyers a comment after purchase . <p> Then after they purchase through my website it will show the buyer a message . To view the full length video go to " **31;1833;TOOLONG " When they click it ( if your html is correct ) it takes them to my video . <p> This method is unsecure because users could share the link to other people . I definitely track my views to purchases and if it starts to have more views than purchases I just reupload the video to change the private link resetting the issue . <p> I will definitely be checking out selz though it seems like an easier hassle free and cost effective alternative . Thank you for the awesome comparison ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138200 @2338200/ <p> Helpful tips on increasing average order value in your shop , as well as plugins and tools to implement these tips . <p> On Monday we gave you 8 strategies to increase average order value in your eCommerce store . This let 's you maximize revenue without increasing the traffic to your site or the number of conversions from that traffic , both of which can be costly endeavors . Implementing strategies for increasing average order value is a great place to start in optimizing your shops revenue streams . <p> While we talked about general strategies in this article , we did n't  address specific tools that can be used to increase your AOV using the strategies we mentioned . Well revisit each of these strategies to discuss tools you can use with your eCommerce platform to implement them . Todays focus is increasing average order value with WooCommerce . <p> Let 's take our 8 strategies and see which tools or plugins can help us implement them . <h> 1 . Use Free Shipping Thresholds <p> WooCommerce has the ability to set a free shipping threshold built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping &gt; Free Shipping . You 'll enter your threshold under " Minimum Order Amount " : <p> If an order subtotal is below this amount , then the free shipping method will not appear or be available for customers to select . As soon as the subtotal goes above your threshold , this method will appear for customers to choose on the cart page and at checkout . <p> You can also restrict free shipping to your own country or certain countries so that you do n't  end up paying more than an order is worth to ship it halfway across the world with free shipping . <p> To encourage customers to hit this threshold , you 'll also want to be sure to let them know that free shipping is available . There are a couple of options you can use to do so : <p> The WooCommerce Cart Notices plugin ( $49 ) is useful for WooCommerce , as you can set up a notice to alert customers of the minimum amount needed for free shipping . If free shipping is available for orders of $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30-60 to encourage further spending by setting a threshold amount for the notice : <p> This will then show up automatically when the cart contains $30 to $60 worth of items . <p> Something like Hello Bar can also do the trick , as this will add a notice to the top of your site that remains there , regardless of cart amount . You can create your HelloBar account , make a bar , and use their WordPress plugin to add it to your site . <p> The " promotion / sale " bar is probably the best fit , as this can have a message and a call to action : <p> Which can be set up easily : <p> If your site has header or footer widget areas , such as the Storefront themes header widget , these can also be used ( a text widget in that area works great ) . However , you may need to add some CSS to style this area if you 're using a text widget. <h> 2 . Use Discount Thresholds <p> WooCommerce offers a few ways for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet a minimum amount and increase average WooCommerce order value . <p> Coupon : You can configure a coupon code to only apply for a minimum order amount using the " Usage Restrictions " tab while creating the coupon and setting a " Minimum Spend " : <p> This will ensure that the coupon can not be applied unless this order subtotal is met . <p> Automatic discounts : You can also automatically apply a discount for order thresholds rather than doing this via a coupon code with the Dynamic Pricing extension ( $129 ) . This plugin will let you set the order amount needed , and it takes care of any discounting behind the scenes without the need for a coupon code . You could advertise the automatic discount instead , like : " Spend $50 or more and your cart will be discounted 10% ! " <p> When a customer hits this order subtotals , discounted prices will automatically be displayed in the cart and at checkout . <p> Discounted price display <p> Tiered discounts : Dynamic Pricing can also take this further to do tiered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mentality . You can give customers a steeper discount for a larger order , such as : <p> Spend $75 , save 5% <p> Spend $100 , save 10% <p> Spend over $150 , save 15% <p> Dynamic Pricing can set up multiple tiers for your discount thresholds by adding more pricing rules : <p> Notify customers : Again , do n't  forget to let customers know about these discounts to encourage them to meet order minimums and increase your average order value . The Cart Notices extension and Hello Bar also work well here to advertise the discount be sure to let customers know of any restrictions on the coupon , such as a minimum spend , so its clear how it can be used : " Use coupon 10off to get 10% off when you spend $50 or more ! " . <p> Below threshold : show amount and code <p> Above threshold : provide coupon code <h> 3 . Provide Volume Discounts <p> Rather than discount based on the order subtotal , you can also discount based on the quantity purchased of a particular item or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . <p> This is where Dynamic Pricing comes in handy again , as you can have quantity-based discounts to encourage bulk purchases . <p> Discounts can be on a per-product basis , as you can set up one or more discount tiers for product quantities : <p> This will discount the price of that product only rather than the price of the entire order , but it still encourages customers to buy higher quantities of the item . <p> You can also create category-based discounts . These discounts are triggered by products within a category . For example , I can trigger the discount based on my " Hoodies " category . If a customer purchases 3 or more hoodies ( any product in the category ) , the discount is triggered . I can then discount certain categories , or all of them to discount the order subtotal. <h> 4 . Bundle Related Products <p> WooCommerce can sell bundled products with the help of the Product Bundles extension ( $49 ) . This extension creates a new " Product Bundle " product type . This bundled product can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle : <p> You can set the pricing for the bundle as a whole , or you can set a new discounted bundle price for each product individually . <h> 5 . Upsell and Cross-sell <p> WooCommerce has built-in options for upselling and cross-selling within the core plugin that you can use for all products in your store . You 'll find upsells and cross-sells in the " Linked Products " tab of the Product Data section . <p> These will be displayed in a couple of places . At the bottom of your product page , you 'll see all upsells in a " You may also like " section . The " Related products " section will also display a mix of cross-sells and upsells . <p> On the cart page , your cross-sells ( one to two ) will be added below the items table in the " You may be interested in " section . <p> You can also automate this process by showing a " Customers who viewed this item also viewed " section that generates cross sells and upsells for you with the Recommendation Engine plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-sells and upsells may not be as tailored to your product as you 'd like , but over time they should be beneficial for customers to see what other customers are interested in . <p> So what other options are there for upselling and cross-selling ? Chris Lema has a good overview of some available options , and there are options you can also use after the order has been placed in your shop . While this wo n't help average order value , as these customers have already been acquired , it can boost their lifetime value to your store and your revenue . <p> First , Receiptful ( free plans available ) can add cross-sells or upsells to your order receipt emails to show customers related products immediately after purchase . <p> Second , AutomateWoo ( which we recently reviewed ) , is an excellent plugin for triggering actions and emails after purchases . This plugin can send an email to cross-sell related products after an order has been placed in your store as well . <p> Cross Sell Products <h> 6 . Create a Loyalty Program <p> Loyalty programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store to gain repeat purchases , but they can also increase average order value with WooCommerce because customers will purchase more to gain more points or to earn bonus points . <p> Unfortunately you cant create a " tiered " system of earning points , e.g. , spend $100 , get 25 bonus points ( though its possible with custom code ) , but you can do bonus promotions for a particular product to drive increased sales of that product . You can set a multiplier or a custom points value for a product under Product Data . For example , setting points earned to " 200% " will let customers earn double points for purchasing that product . <h> 7 . Sell Add-ons or Services <p> Selling add-on products or services is simple with WooCommerce , as there are two extensions available to do this . <p> If you want to sell add-ons on the product page , such as monogramming or product assembly ( or other product services ) , you can use Product Add-ons ( $49 ) to do so . This let 's you add several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text , checkbox , or radio button fields ( and more ) , and then optionally charge for these add-ons . <p> Add-ons are added to the product page above the add to cart buttons , and total costs are shown if an add-on has a cost . <p> If you 'd like to sell add-on services or add fees on a per-order basis , WooCommerce Checkout Add-ons ( $49 ) can do so . This let 's you create add-ons for the entire order , which can optionally have costs associated with them . You can offer gift wrapping , rush handling , insurance , or other services and small products at checkout to upsell your customers . <p> These additional fields will then be displayed on the checkout page and the fees will be included in the Order Review table ( screenshot simplified here to include both ) : <h> 8 . Raise Prices <p> Our final strategy for increasing average order value was to raise prices in your store . While any eCommerce plugin will let you edit the price of an item , you can also edit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do a percentage or dollar amount increase across the board for all of your products by going to " Products " , selecting which products you want to change prices for , and selecting the " Edit " bulk action . You can then increase price by an amount or percentage : <h> Summary <p> There are tons of tools available to help you increase average order values with WooCommerce , and you can begin implementing any of these strategies today , some even at no cost . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138201 @2338201/ <h> Drive eCommerce Form Conversions with an Affiliate Network <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> If your site is focused on selling a very small selection of products , you may not need a full eCommerce solution to manage the sales of your product(s) . In this case , you might have a landing page with an ordering / sign up form to manage transactions for your eCommerce site instead , as you do n't  need product catalogs , tags / categories , or a " shop " view . <h> Promoting eCommerce Forms with AffiliateWP <p> The downside to using a form plugin to manage your sales is that you may miss out on some of the features that eCommerce plugins include , such as the ability to have a customer account section , or to use affiliate referrals to encourage affiliates to promote your site . <p> Affiliate programs are an excellent way to promote your store , as they essentially provide a commission-only sales team to help drive traffic and customers your way . Affiliates promote your products via content or advertising in exchange for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landing page or sales form for your products , affiliates can easily drive traffic to this page to expand your sales efforts . However , if transactions submitted through the form are not tracked , affiliates do n't  have an incentive to promote your site . <p> The goods news is that AffiliateWP can track referrals via a payment form so that affiliates get a commission for promoting your products . The downside to using AffiliateWP previously was that there was no specificity to which forms allowed referrals . For example , if you wanted to give affiliates a commission on a purchase form for one product , they would get this but also commissions on any other payment forms you had on your site . <p> Recently AffiliateWP released version 1.7 , which makes a significant change to the way payment forms are handled . Version 1.7 included : <p> However , the one change that 's very important for our eCommerce form is this one : <p> Option to disable referrals for specific forms in Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms <p> Now you can control which payment forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an incentive to promote your products and payment forms , but that you can control which forms produce referrals . <p> This can let you offer referrals on a general sign up form , while still keeping a restricted ( logged-in customers only ) form for other payments , such as upsells , referral-free . <p> Let 's take a look at how this works with both Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms . <h> Using AffiliateWP with Gravity Forms <p> To use AffiliateWP with Gravity Forms for purchasing or eCommerce forms , you 'll need : <p> This setup is also hugely helpful for Easy Digital Downloads-powered sites . Weve written about using Gravity Forms Checkout for EDD before , which let 's you leverage a Gravity Forms payment form for an EDD product , so you can use this integration to allow AffiliateWP referrals for both EDD and Gravity Forms transactions . <p> Next , you 'll need to create your Gravity Forms payment form . Our tutorial on using Gravity Forms for eCommerce will help out here , as you 'll need a form that includes ( 1 ) purchaser billing details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any options , ( 3 ) any shipping costs or other fees , and ( 4 ) the credit card / payment details . <p> Once your form is set up and tied to your payment fields via your payment method , you can enable the Gravity Forms integration for AffiliateWP . Go to the " Form Settings " for your transaction form that should have referrals enabled , and scroll to the bottom . You 'll see a setting to enable referrals for the form : <p> Enable Form Referrals <p> This will be off by default to ensure affiliates only get referrals for the forms you want them to . <p> Now any time a successful payment is submitted via this form , the referral will be created for the affiliate that sent the customer to you under Affiliates &gt; Referrals . The " Reference " column will also link back to the form submission so you can quickly view details . <p> Form Referral <p> Payments submitted via other forms , even if an affiliate refers a customer to them , will not be tracked as referrals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll need to add fields for ( 1 ) user billing information , ( 2 ) the product name and pricing ( can be a hidden field if desired ) do n't  forget to automatically include this in calculations in the fields calculation settings ( 3 ) any shipping costs or other fees , ( 4 ) the calculation / total field , and ( 5 ) the credit card / payment details . <p> When your form is set up , you can go to the forms settings tab and add your payment method information and fields . You 'll also find the ability to enable referrals here at the bottom of the " Restrictions " section : <p> Enable referrals <p> When this is enabled , any successful transaction that runs through this form will generate a referral for the affiliate . The " Reference " column will link back to the form entry just as it does with the Gravity Forms integration . <p> Form referral <p> Transactions or payments submitted via other forms will not be tracked for affiliate commissions unless you 've enabled these . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over how referrals are counted for your eCommerce form , and affiliates still get commissions for the forms you have enabled everybodys winning so far = <p> However , I 'd be pretty remiss if I did n't  mention another great feature of AffiliateWP 1.7 that helps your affiliates . While the ability to track referrals on a per-form basis is immensely helpful , your affiliates also have a great new feature they can leverage : affiliate campaigns . <p> Affiliates can now set a campaign in their referral URLs along with their referral I 'd , LONG ... <p> This let 's your affiliates track where their conversions are coming from , giving them insight into which sources of traffic convert the best . They can then optimize their campaigns for different sources of traffic , helping them increase sales and drive more revenue for your site . <p> Campaign Tracking <p> While per-form referrals help protect you against paying out additional referrals , campaigns help affiliates determine how to be most efficient in their marketing strategies so they can track which traffic sources are most effective . <h> AffiliateWP version 1.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both site owners and affiliates , as site owners have increased flexibility , while affiliates can better manage their campaigns while promoting your site .

@@98138202 @2338202/ <p> Next up in our eCommerce guide is the WPMU DEV eCommerce offering : MarketPress eCommerce ( Lite version ) . While MarketPress is billed as the best platform for use with BuddyPress or WordPress multisite ( see this also ) , well be taking a look at these topics later , and will focus for now on its use for a single site eCommerce store . MarketPress Lite is pretty minimalist when compared to its premium counterpart , so well give you some comparisons between the two and different features each offers , but our testing was done with the Lite version of the plugin . That 's what well be referring to unless otherwise noted . <p> MarketPress Lite is a freeWordPress.org plugin , so downloading and installing can give you a good idea if you 'd like to use it or upgrade to the premium version . If you 're looking for some extra functionality ( such as multi-site compatibility , which well discuss in a later post = ) , styling , and payment/shipping options , you 'll want to take a look at MarketPress Pro , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support and updates ) . However , WMPU DEV also offers a membership subscription for about $40 per month ( sale price retail is $99 per month ) , which gives you access to all plugins , themes , and premium support . <p> If you do n't  want to go down the membership route , then you can still purchase other plugins and themes a la carte . As for themes , there are some good free ones , such as Frame Market , or paid themes , which have $19 individual price tags . All themes are also part of the membership if you purchase it , but you do n't  necessarily need a MarketPress theme , as it seems to work well with any of the themes we tested . <h> Cost summary : <p> Overall costs can vary . You can choose from the free core plugin or the Pro version for $19 if you only want the eCommerce platform . You can also choose the $40 per month subscription for access to all plugins , themes , and support . In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd personally go with the $40 per month for the access to other plugins and support , since I am going to be making a livelihood using this store after all , and probably want to spend more time selling than troubleshooting . <p> Installation and setup of MarketPress Lite is simple and just like any other WordPress plugin . You can find some stats and order information in the WordPress dashboard , but all configuration is done from Products &gt; Store Settings , where you 'll first be asked to set basic store information . If you need help , you can click the " Help " tab at the top right , and you 'll have built-in docs at your disposal , which is super helpful . After entering my basic store info , I took a look at the Presentation Settings , which are pretty average for the Lite plugin : <p> Backend : Presentation Settings <p> You can upgrade to the Pro version of the plugin in order to change a lot of presentation settings , such as how the store pages are displayed , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a list view . The Pro version also includes more built-in style , and a lot of other features , which you 'll see as you browse through your settings . Personally , I think the the $19 investment for the Pro version makes sense for the grid view alone , which is less than the cost of some plugins that add this functionality to other platforms . <p> One setting you 'll want to check out if you 've already created a store on another platform is the Importers tab . MarketPress includes a built-in CSV importer , as well as a WP eCommerce plugin importer to make store setup easy . <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options for your store are pretty basic , and enable you to set a flat rate ( no bands , reduced rates , or multiple rates to be had ) . However , you can set special tax rates based on product , which will be very helpful if you sell both physical and virtual products . <p> Settings : Tax Options <h> Products <p> Product creation is very simple and similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types . You can add simple , configurable/variable , downloadable , and affiliate products using MarketPress , and there a couple cool features that you do n't  see in many plugins , such as the ability to allow personalization of products ( only in the Pro version ) . However , there are also negatives , such as the fact that you can only upload one image per product , as opposed to using an image gallery . This means that , especially for variable products , you 'll have to create your own gallery in the description if needed . Otherwise , product creation and editing is straight-forward using the product editor : <p> Backend : Product Editor <p> If you want to add variable products , you 're going to have a slightly more difficult time . You have to add all variations manually , as you cant link any attributes together ( for example , you cant create values for the " size " attribute , then colors , and link all possibilities for the variations you 'll enter every possibility yourself ) . This is tedious if you 're selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is done the same way in the Pro version of the plugin ( which is a bit of a let down ) . I think its easier for customers to select ( for example ) size , then color , or other attributes , then having to scroll through an entire list to get the variation they want . <p> Backend : Adding Product Variations <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> One of things I really appreciated about MarketPress is that there 's a shortcode reference included in the Store Settings : <p> Settings : Shortcode Reference <p> This makes shortcode addition super easy , as you can just have your reference open in a different tab . There 's no shortcode button in the visual editor , but with the reference handy , I do n't  think its really needed . I liked being able to display products by category or tag , which allowed me to display " featured " and " new " products using a tag , as these are not automatically created as taxonomies ( which would have been helpful , but is n't necessary ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backend : Inserting Shortcodes <p> Some widgets are also included with MarketPress , and are pretty useful . I found the shopping cart and product list widgets to be my favorites , and you can also include a tag cloud or product categories widget . The product list widget is something else I used to create a " featured " product list , so it helped to make up for the fact that this is n't an included taxonomy ( remember , you can also do this with a shortcode if you prefer ) . You can set whether you want to filter products based on a category or tag , so you can create a " featured " category or tag , and use this widget to display your products . <p> The customer experience with the Lite plugin is n't bad , but leaves a little bit to be desired . The default store page provides an overview of the eCommerce side of the site , but you 'll want to take a look at styling this yourself or setting up your own store page . For example , I 'd prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting / filtering later ( or put options at the top of the page ) so that there are less steps between my customers and shopping or purchasing . <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> Product pages are good with a standard theme , but a little unexciting . Using a MarketPress theme , upgrading to the Pro version to get more styling options , or changing styling around yourself will help with this . For example , I like to have product information next to the featured image or further up on the page so its easier to see and I can immediately start to sell customers on the product . I 'd also recommended adding in product reviews ; a good option is the WP Customer Reviews plugin . Aside from styling , you have a lot of freedom to adjust image sizes under the Presentation Settings , which is really nice to have . <p> Frontend : Variable Product Page <p> After the browsing experience is done , customers will find the purchasing experience easy and intuitive . Cart pages and checkout pages work exactly as you 'd expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product details from the cart before checking out . <p> Frontend : Cart Page <p> One thing people may end up disliking about MarketPress is the multi-step checkout . Simpler checkouts usually lead to more conversions as they provide fewer places for customers to abandon their orders , which is why many plugins use a one-page checkout . <p> Frontend : Checkout Experience <p> Following the entry of shipping and billing information , you 'll have to review and confirm your order , which brings the checkout process up to three steps instead of one . <p> With MarketPress Lite , payment options are limited , while shipping options are fairly usable . However , upgrading to MarketPress Pro provides many other payment processing options , and will probably cover the needs of many businesses . <h> Payment Options <p> MarketPress Lite includes both manual payments and PayPal Express for payment processing . Upgrading to Pro again provides a ton of value by including other gateways integrations , such as Authorize.net , Stripe , PayPal Pro , and more . Purchasing one integration on other platforms can cost anywhere from $20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gateway integration developed , so including these in the Pro version provides good value and convenience if you decide to switch processors . <p> Backend : Payment Settings <h> Shipping Options <p> MarketPress offers shipping that is added on a per-order basis . You can set flat rates for regions ( but can not adjust these regions yourself ) , such as US rates for the lower 48 states , Alaska/Hawaii , Canada , and international shipping . You 'll need some custom development done if you want to break these regions up any more than that . You can also ship using weight tiers for the order , or by using table rate shipping ( tiers by total price ) . If you upgrade to Pro , you can also use calculated shipping , with integrations such as USPS , UPS , FedEx , and more . <p> Backend : Shipping Settings <p> However , there 's also a little shipping gem hidden away on product pages . Using MarketPress , you have the ability to add a shipping surcharge for large or specially packaged items , which is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Im aware ) includes zero built-in reporting features . You can track orders and see basica sales stats in your dashboard , but will have to export sales information for detailed reporting . <h> Inventory <p> MarketPress does a great job of inventory management , and allows you to add inventory only for products you choose , which is great for store with both physical and digital products . While viewing all products , those with low stock or are out-of-stock will have inventory highlighted in yellow or red so that you can easily pick out which items are in need of reorder . You can also manage inventory for individual product variations . <p> If you join the WMPU DEV membership program ( $40 per month currently ) , premium support is included in your membership , and is advertised as being 24/7/365 . However , I have n't tested this myself and cant make any claims . I did contact them about other issues and received responses within 24 hours , so I 'm sure that support is probably efficient as well . If the WordPress.org support forums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the claims to lightening-fast support . As for other support , MarketPress includes some documentation built right into the plugin itself : <p> Built-in Documentation <p> This documentation links to several video walkthroughs ( specific to the Pro version ) , which are helpful for beginners and cover setup and configuration . However , there 's no detailed or developer documentation for extending the plugin or trouble-shooting , which is a concern some have voiced . There are also community forums for questions . <p> If you 're looking to create memberships to divide your site into free and paid content , you can use the Memberships Plugin , which let 's you set which content will be for premium users , as well as configure subscriptions payments or recurring billing for your content . You can set different membership levels with access to different content , and choose whether to provide all content at once , or " drip " it out over the course of a membership . <p> You can also create an affiliate network using the Affiliates Plugin . This will allow you to manage leads from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last cool plugin pick of the review : Check out the Chat Plugin , which allows you to set up public chat sessions , one-on-one chat session , chat sessions between users on your site , BuddyPress Group chats , BuddyPress Friend chats , and more . <p> Overall , MarketPress Lite provides a lightweight , easy-to-use WordPress plugin . However , its name is spot-on : functionality is on the light side ( which is perfectly fine for the free offering ) . You 'll probably want to invest in the WMPU DEV membership to get the most out of other plugins , themes , and support so that you can gain access to the Pro version of the plugin and complementary plugins . Besides some of the benefits mentioned throughout this review ( more payment and shipping options , product and store page styling , etc ) , the Pro version also allows you to integrate with Google Analytics , export orders to a CSV , includes BuddyPress and multisite compatibility ( more on these later ! ) , and more . <p> Some other positives include pretty extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit tedious to add , and I 'd love to see an image gallery rather than a single featured image . I do n't  believe this is included in the Pro version , but if I 've made any mistakes , I 'd love for someone to correct me : ) . Extensibility of the plugin is also good , but not great , and is something I hope expands with more plugin / add-on offerings in the future ( currently , you really only have WMPU DEV add-ons available , and there are few options for store add-ons ) . In total , MarketPress delivers a solid eCommerce choice ( more with the Pro version and for multisite users ) that will meet the needs of many users , and will hopefully grow and become more extensible as the number of users grows . <p> p class= " small " &gt;Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

@@98138203 @2338203/ <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping for WooCommerce <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce gives merchants basic set up options for shipping rates so that merchants can get going with some flat rates offered to customers without the need for further customization . <p> WooCommerce 2.6 added even more to the basic shipping options , ensuring you could configure rates for regular shipping , expedited shipping , or free shipping based on where the customer is located by letting you add more than one flat rate method . <p> However , this does n't  let you limit rate availability based on something other than customer location . While you can add multiple rates , you ca n't control when these rates or show , or to whom they 're made available . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Overview <p> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce will allow merchants to limit rates based on customer location ( as WooCommerce core does ) , but it also can make this feature available to stores running WooCommerce 2.4 or 2.5 as well . <p> However , the most powerful features are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , and user rules . These will let you determine when to make certain shipping rates available , letting you consider : <p> certain users or roles <p> cart details like total value or total weight <p> whether certain products , categories , or tags are in the cart <p> These can let you create flexible systems of shipping rules to offer different rates to different customers or for different orders . here 's a full set of conditions you can leverage for your shipping rate availability : <p> Location <p> Product <p> User <p> Cart <p> Schedule <p> Operators <p> Country <p> State <p> Postcode <p> Zone <p> Product <p> Category <p> Tag <p> SKU <p> User <p> User Role <p> Cart total <p> Quantity <p> Weight <p> Coupon <p> Shipping Class <p> Enable or expire on a specific date <p> Less than ( &lt;= ) <p> Greater than ( &gt;= ) <p> Between ( 0-10 ) <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Set Up Zones <p> The first thing I 'd recommend doing would be to set up the shipping zones youd like to use , if any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WooCommerce 2.6+ , and will help you limit certain rates to particular areas . <p> I would have liked to see the plugin leverage the core WooCommerce shipping zones instead of creating its own , but this was built originally before WooCommerce added zones , and it let 's the plugin remain compatible with lower WooCommerce versions for now . DotStore aims to use the core zones in an upcoming release . <p> Setting up zones should n't be too time consuming for most stores , so you could probably replicate any zones you have set up in WooCommerce itself . <p> To add a zone , click " Add Shipping Zone " from the " Manage Shipping Zones " section , and determine where this zone applies : <p> Add a Zone <p> Youll be able to add multiple zones if needed . Note that there 's no " Rest of the World " zone by default in Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce , so either you 'll need to have a zone that applies to all countries as a fallback , or you could leverage the WooCommerce zones alongside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WooCommerce free shipping rates to keep them tied more tightly to coupons even though you could do this with either WooCommerce or this plugin . <p> Shipping zones <p> Once your zones are set up , you can now set up some rates , using these zones , locations , or other parameters to limit rate availability for your customers . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Set Up Rates <p> While WooCommerce 2.6+ will let you set up location-based flat rates , Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method rates will let you add other parameters aside from zone or location , such as product data , order data , or user information . <p> This can let you create WooCommerce VIP shipping , offer reduced shipping rates for meeting order thresholds , or limit shipping rates by product ( without having to try to muck around with shipping classes ) . <p> When creating a rate , you can give it a name , cost , and other information , such as whether or not its taxable , only available during certain dates ( great for sales or holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once youve added basic data , you can also limit your rate to certain customers , products , or orders . Rates can leverage location restrictions based on your configured zones , or use certain countries , states , or postcodes . <p> Location-based rules <p> If you want to limit a shipping method based on certain products , you can do so by requiring some products , categories , tags , or SKUs to be present in the cart . <p> Product-based rules <p> I 'm not 100% sure when you 'd use a SKU-based rule over a product one since WooCommerce forces SKUs to be unique , but I could a system in which products are " retired " and replaced ( using the same SKU ) perhaps leveraging this . <p> User-based rules are also available , letting you give out certain shipping rates as a benefit to certain customers , such as active subscribers , or your best customers to improve loyalty . <p> User-based rules <p> Finally , cart / order details can influence rate availability as well . You can make some rates available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free shipping coupon . <p> You can also account for order values , cart quantities , or cart weight using less than , greater than , or between operators to set up your limits . <p> Order-based Rules <p> Once you 've configured rules for a particular rate , you can save it , and its now ready to be used ! Finish adding all flat rates you need , and you 're ready to adjust display settings . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Customer Usage <p> Finally , we can move onto settings for what your customer will see . The " Master Settings " will affect display on the frontend , so you may want to determine what to do when multiple rates are available , as there are a few choices : <p> Allow Customer to Choose will present all shipping choices to your customer to allow them to pick which method theyd like . <p> Apply Highest will automatically apply the most expensive shipping rate available without offering shipping choices . <p> Apply Smallest will do the opposite : it will apply the lowest available shipping rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of all available methods for shipping . <p> This let 's you determine what your customer sees , and can simplify shipping choices if need be . For example , if you wanted to automatically choose the lowest rate for the customer , you can use " Apply Smallest " to cut out the shipping choice completely . " Force all methods " would let you total the methods in the cart , useful if you want a per-product shipping charge approach . <p> Display settings <p> You can also show shipping rates as a dropdown or as a radio button ( an option that was removed from WooCommerce in version 2.5 ) by adjusting the display settings . <p> This would let you bring back a dropdown selector if desired . I 'm not a huge fan of this set up and prefer radio buttons , but it can be useful if you have a lot of choices for shipping ( though that 's another point to consider = ) . <p> Dropdown shipping rates <p> If you 've added tooltips to a shipping method , these will also be shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more details about the shipping method . <p> Tooltips <p> That 's all it takes ! You can set up as many rates as you 'd like limited by location , product , order details , and user information . Let 's take a look at a few example set ups you could create with this increased control over WooCommerce shipping rate availability . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : WooCommerce VIP Shipping <p> Want to reward your best customers to keep them loyal to your store ? You can do so by providing them with free or reduced shipping costs as a thank you for purchasing from your store . <p> To do so , you 'd set up a user-based rate restriction : <p> User-based rules <p> For example , if you use WooCommerce Subscriptions , you can provide reduced shipping rates for your active subscriber role as a perk for signing up for a recurring plan . <p> If you want to set up WooCommerce VIP shipping , I 'd recommend doing the following : <p> For your VIP customers , create the opposite rule : " Specific User Role " &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These customers will get the special rates for shipping automatically when signed in . <p> This will let you offer benefits for certain customers or customer roles , making it more compelling to subscribe to your site . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Minimum Threshold Shipping Incentives <p> One of the best ways to increase your average order value is to use incentivized order thresholds . Typically you 'll see these as " Orders over $50 get free shipping ! " or something similar . <p> These can be great drivers of higher order values , but you may not be able to afford free shipping , or you may want to incentivize lower thresholds , especially if you have a fairly low average order value to begin with . <p> If so , you could offer reduced shipping for meeting certain thresholds , ie " Orders over $60 get reduced shipping !

In my case , I set up the following : <p> US Ground : ( orders &lt; $60 ) $4.99 <p> Expedited : ( orders &lt; $60 ) $8.99 <p> Free ground shipping : ( orders &gt; $60 ) $0 ( I used WooCommerce core for this , but you could use an Advanced Flat Rate also ) <p> Discount Expedited Shipping : ( orders &gt; $60 ) $3.99 <p> Now when I have an order of less than $60 , my regular ground and expedited rates are shown : <p> Want to inform customers of these rates ? Something like Cart Notices can help you add information for customers to know these discounted rates are available . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : WooCommerce Heavy Item Shipping <p> Have some particularly heavy items in your store that require expensive shipping ? You can set up weight-based rate limits as well . We 'd basically be doing the same thing as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping rates : <p> Set up default rates for weights under your weight threshold <p> Set up " heavy " item rates for a weight over your threshold . <p> You could even scope this to certain products or categories if one product would n't cause increased shipping , but multiples of the product would ( since it will use your overall cart rate ) . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : WooCommerce Holiday Shipping <p> For a final example , the rules available in Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method could let you create WooCommerce holiday shipping rates , as you could offer expedited shipping for your country around holiday seasons , encouraging customers to purchase on a deadline to get an order on-time . <p> This can be useful especially around Christmas-time , as you can offer a rate for only a selected date window , guaranteeing holiday arrival for customers with that rate . <p> To set up a holiday rate , well use the start / end dates for the rate , along with location-based rules . <p> First , add the dates during which your rate should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , you probably ca n't offer this guaranteed rate to all customers . Ensure you limited by certain shipping zones , or by location . You can limit by country , state / province , or even certain postcodes . This way , you do n't  offer a guaranteed rate to a customer if they 're not in an area you can get guaranteed delivery for . <p> Limit by Location <p> Now this rate will only be available before the holiday , and within your defined locations , helping you create a sense of urgency to drive purchases around holidays . <h> Advanced Flat Rate Shipping : Other Notes <p> If you 're not sure if the plugin is for you , you can give the free demo a try to see it in action , or see the lite version on WordPress.org which has a limited set of some of the featured offered by Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce ( and over 1000 installs ) . <p> I liked that Advanced Flat Rate Shipping Method for WooCommerce let me set up product-based restrictions , including using categories or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely exclude certain items from certain methods with little effort . <p> I especially liked the order details limits and the user-based limits for flat rates , as these give you a lot of flexibility in offering some rates to certain customers . For example , having order limits let 's you set up discounted rates for higher order values , or even offer tiered rates based on order value . <p> User limits helped me create a WooCommerce VIP shipping system to reward some of my customers , either individually or based on their role with my store . <p> In terms of negatives , I was n't crazy about the plugin overriding some core WooCommerce cart functions or the cart template . As such , you 'll definitely want to keep this plugin up-to-date , as these parts of WooCommerce are often subject to change , and this plugin would need to ensure it remains compatible . <p> I would have liked to see it leverage WooCommerce shipping zones , as I mentioned previously , but I can understand that trying to support lower WooCommerce versions may make this a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement 2 separate shipping zone approaches ) . It sounds like this is coming soon though . <p> However , none of these downsides affected functionality , and I was able to do some really advanced set up for my flat rates for several kinds of products and customers . <p> Note : This see our editorial policy . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138204 @2338204/ <h> How Choosing WordPress Hosting is Like Choosing Your Apartment <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Imagine for a minute that you live in a world where the only homes you can inhabit are apartment buildings . You have a choice as to what kind of apartment building you want to live in , but you must live in an apartment building . Each building is broken up into floors , and each floor has 20 apartments . However , the number of residents on each floor can change . <p> &lt;aside&gt; This is kind of a boring world , I know . However , each apartment building is really a server and this is a giant metaphor for website hosting . Weve talked about different kinds of WordPress hosting before , but its sometimes difficult to understand the differences between shared hosting , VPS servers , or dedicated / enterprise hosting , and which type of hosting is right for your business . <p> Most people think that the the differences between each type of hosting are solely related to pageload speed and the number of visitors you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware , and you 'll need a rough understanding of how hosting works . &lt;/aside&gt; <h> Typical Shared WordPress Hosting <p> Apartment buildings that offer really cheap living space are abundant , and theyll gladly take more tenants . You can pay a pretty nominal fee to live in one of these building each month , but these buildings will put as many tenants on each floor as they can since living space is cheap you may be sharing your floor with 300 other tenants . With 20 apartments , this means you do n't  have much room to yourself . <p> Now let 's think about the downsides of this : lots of people living in this space means that you may experience problems with trash or noise , as more people on this floor naturally leads to the problems associated with groups of people . You could have really good neighbors , but you might also have one or two that leave trash everywhere and ruin the floor for the rest of you . <p> What if someone on your floor is famous ( even just for 5 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . If there are paparazzi or visitors on your floor trying to get a glimpse of this famous person , it may affect parking , how easy it is to get to the floor , or how much room is left for your friends to visit ( if they can visit at all ) . <p> You might even have really bad neighbors neighbors running a meth lab or other sorts of awful , dangerous stuff . This definitely runs the risk of blowing up part of your floor , which is certainly going to affect your apartment in some way . <p> This is your typical shared hosting . Not only do you not have a lot of server resources ( living space ) dedicated to yourself , but you 're sharing this space with no control over who lives with you . This is the part of shared hosting that most business owners do n't  understand very well , since you cant see your neighbors or what they 're up to . <p> Bad neighbors , like our meth lab apartment , could affect your living experience . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spam emails . This can affect the deliverability of your own emails , and can result in them getting spammed because they 're all coming from the same server . ( We do have advice on using transactional email services to help with this . ) <p> Neighbors could also leave trash everywhere ; these neighbors may be infected with malware and this can also compromise your own site . By sharing a server , hacked sites can give malicious code entry into your own site . <p> The number of visitors your neighbors on the server receive will also affect you , and can make it difficult for your visitors to get to your site if they 're swamping the server resources . <p> Are most apartment floors full of bad neighbors ? Not at all , and sharing hosting does n't  mean that you 'll be sharing a server with a spam site . This just means that the possibility of these bad neighbors exists and you have no control over the situation . <p> Now here 's the thing : weve all probably lived in a place like this at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment building if I 'm being honest . This kind of hosting is your typically cheap hosting , and it can be fine for when you 're starting out . However , your eCommerce business probably does n't  want to live in a server like this for the rest of its life . As soon as it can afford to move out , its probably a good idea to do so . <h> " Dedicated " Shared WordPress Hosting <p> Some apartment buildings will still ask you to share your floor , but theyll keep fewer tenants per floor maybe 20 to 50 instead of 300 . While there may still be issues with your neighbors or the space you share , these issues become less severe . You have a lower chance of being on the same floor as a meth lab or famous person , and the floor has more space to deal with famous people or trash . <p> Of course , these buildings are slightly more expensive than the buildings that will try to accept as many tenants as they can . Youll be paying a premium to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors . <p> This set up is like SiteGrounds GoGeek hosting plan or Pagelys business plan : While the hosting is still shared , the server resources are more strictly managed to make sure there 's enough room and resources for everyone there . In fact , SiteGrounds GoGeek sites have one-sixth the amount of sites that the other shared servers have . <p> You could still get stuck with really bad neighbors or suddenly-famous neighbors , but the chances of this happening are much lower , and more resources are available to deal with these issues . <h> VPS WordPress Hosting <p> If you can afford to upgrade your living space , you could rent out a floor on the building . This is analogous to VPS WordPress hosting . Youll have a " virtual " server a dedicated portion of the server without having the entire thing at your disposal . <p> While you 'll have neighbors on other floors , they wo n't really affect life on your floor . This means that you do n't  have to worry about neighbors leaving trash on your floor , you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire building up , and you can have all the visitors you can handle . <p> In other words : other sites cant infect yours with malware , and spammers wont affect your site since your server is n't being shared by anyone else . <p> When you 've moved up to VPS hosting , you avoid a lot of the problems that can occur with shared hosting , as you do n't  have neighbors to influence your living environment . <h> Dedicated WordPress Hosting <p> Now what if you become famous yourself , or you just have a lot of resources to work with ? You could rent the entire building . That way , you 're not influenced by anyone else within the building in terms of traffic , sending mail , parking , or the visitors you can have at any given time . <p> Very few sites need completely dedicated hosting , and this becomes extremely expensive . You 'll typically see this referred to as " dedicated " or " enterprise hosting " . This would entail renting the entire server for your website(s) alone . <h> Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone need VPS hosting ? No . You may not be able to afford it , and your website may not have enough traffic to justify the additional resources , and that 's okay . However , you should now how different types of hosting work so that you can determine what 's best for your site . This is why I typically recommend starting with a SiteGround GoGeek plan for most sites , as you 'll start out with shared hosting that 's more careful about managing its resources . <p> As you scale , I typically recommend moving up to a VPS , which is where Pagely is excellent . I migrated all sites to Pagely early this year , and have not been disappointed in performance , security , or reliability . <p> Want some hard numbers on performance for these hosts ? Review Signal just published their 2015 hosting benchmarks , which include super-detailed performance metrics for each host . <p> Both SiteGround and Pagely performed well . SiteGrounds shared hosting was an honorable mention for top tier service : <p> For example , Global Dots has case studies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 second of improvement they experienced up to a 2% increase in conversions <p> For every 100 ms of improvement , they grew incremental revenue by up to 1% <p> Amazon experienced similar results : <p> Amazon increased revenue by 1% for every 100ms of improvement ( same as Walmart ) . <h> Other Notes <p> On a final note , while the type of hosting is important , there are a couple other factors you should consider when choosing your sites living space . <p> First , the building maintenance is important . This is where using a managed host comes in . Theyll take care of the routine maintenance and upgrades in the building . In terms of hosting , this means that theyll ensure WordPress and plugins are up to date , and that your site has backups if needed . Here are some thoughts on what managed hosting covers from Pagely . <p> We only recommend managed hosts to make sure that you do n't  need experience maintaining and updating servers , and to ensure that your sites living space is looked after . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just anyone to be able to walk into your building and vandalize it or break into apartments . In terms of hosting , the security measures the hosting company takes to protect your site become extremely important when you 're running a business and storing customer information . This is also a reason I recommend Pagely and SiteGround . <p> For example , I had a client hosted on WP Engine whose site was infected with malware via a common hack using an outdated version of Gravity Forms . The updater for the plugin was broken so they did n't  know to upgrade it , but no security measures were taken to protect the site from this attack vector ( which is one reason I no longer recommend them ) . Even after the site was cleaned and " hardened " , the same attack occurred again within an hour before I could get to it to upgrade . <p> The clients site was infected and our team was able to replicate the attack ourselves within 30 minutes on the same server . However , attempting this attack on a testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their security measures blocked it , even with the compromised plugin version . If this had been an eCommerce site , the issue would have been extremely serious , as customer accounts would have to be reset , and payment details could have been compromised . <p> If you 're running a business , you owe it to your customers to ensure that your site is maintained and secure ; both Pagely and SiteGround will ensure that your site is covered . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

You could sell CDs , but also sell a package that includes a physical disk signed by the recording artist . If you sell services , you may want also want to offer tangible goods like stickers or tee shirts . <p> Once you start to ship products , its difficult to sell them with Easy Digital Downloads because you 'll need to eat those shipping costs , and you can only gather a billing address from customers .

@@98138206 @2338206/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Todays case study brings together two plugins I love using : AffiliateWP and WooCommerce . AffiliateWP is a great solution because it integrates easily with almost any eCommerce plugin , and using AffiliateWP with WooCommerce is no exception . <p> The WooCommerce integration can be enabled with one click , and the AffiliateWP Add-ons ( both free add-ons and those only available to certain license holders ) fully support WooCommerce , even when they might not support integrations with other platforms . For example , some add-ons , like Affiliate Product Rates or Checkout Referrals , only work with Easy Digital Downloads and WooCommerce . <p> Affiliate networks are a great way to promote your store , as you only pay for converted sales , and fortunately they 're very easy to set up with AffiliateWP . <p> I spoke with Damian from Nanshy about how using AffiliateWP in their WooCommerce store affected sales , and why they chose AffiliateWP over other solutions . He chose AffiliateWP to integrate with their WooCommerce shop because of the tight integration with WooCommerce and the features it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I compared all of the systems available that integrate easily with WooCommerce . All had some lack of features , but AffiliateWP ticked most of the boxes . <p> The decision has paid off , and AffiliateWP has made managing the partner program simple . <p> Since launching our affiliate program using AffiliateWP , managing our partners has never been easier . <p> Let 's take a closer look at why Nanshy uses AffiliateWP and how the program impacts their store . <h> About Nanshy and Why They Use Affiliates <p> Nanshy is a company devoted to providing makeup tools that provide top-tier quality without using animal products . Their makeup brushes are 100% vegan and PETA approved , and they use entirely nylon synthetic bristles rather than animal hair . As a result , their brushes are more durable , flexible , and easier to clean since they do n't  require the harsh disinfectant treatments that organic brushes require . <p> typically 4 week payout for commissions ( paid out after return period has passed ) <p> I found the 25% discount on all purchases for affiliates interesting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up for the program , thinking they can use their own referral link and pocket the commission as a discount , which is usually disallowed for most programs to prevent everyone from solely using affiliate referrals as personal discounts . <p> However , Nanshy does n't  use this discount to work around the " sign up to use commissions as a discount problem " . Instead , its an incentive to sign up and promote the brand for people that would already use their products . <p> Would-be customers sometimes ask for free products in exchange for writing a blog post or some other form of referral marketing , so asking them to join the affiliate program instead was a natural fit . Damian asserts that it ensures they 're serious about promoting the product and do n't  just want free products in exchange for marketing that may or may not turn into leads : <p> To be honest , due to number of requests I get for free products I decided to send them to our affiliate program . If they truly want to promote the brand they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution , as these customers can get a steep discount on products while still earning commissions for promoting Nanshy . This also incentivizes them to ensure their promotion of Nanshy is high-quality and relevant , as commissions are dependent on converted , non-returned sales . <h> Managing WooCommerce Affiliates with AffiliateWP <p> One strategy they use it to review affiliate applications before approving affiliates , which is very easy to do with one setting in AffiliateWP : <p> AffiliateWP Misc Settings <p> This gives Damian a change to ensure that the affiliate is a good fit for the program , that the Nanshy brand will be represented appropriately , and that affiliate referrals will be quality leads . <p> I like to review websites and social profiles to make sure the affiliate is in the right niche and have access to potential customers . <p> They also use the free AffiliateWP MailChimp add-on to allow affiliates to subscribe to the newsletter so they can get updates about products or current promotions . <p> I love MailChimp myself , and I 'd also recommend checking out this recent AffiliateWP tutorial that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MailChimp . This way , you can send affiliate newsletter with pre-made sharing link that include the affiliates I 'd , making it easy for them to promote your new products or sales . <h> The Effect of the Nanshy Affiliate Program <p> While some affiliates are potential customers ( such as those that request free products ) , many affiliates that have signed up are actually bloggers or vloggers for whom promoting Nanshy fits with their audience . Due to the success of these affiliates , Nanshy is looking to recruit more dedicated affiliate marketers in the future . <p> So far , these affiliates have proved important for driving new sales even though they 're not currently the main source of traffic : <p> Affiliates are important to our store .

@@98138207 @2338207/ <h> Automating WooCommerce Memberships with AutomateWoo <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> As your sites membership community grows , managing communication and gathering feedback from your members becomes far more difficult . Maybe youd like to follow up with members whove cancelled to see why they left , or welcome new members with a personalized email a couple days after they sign up . As your site scales , these sort of actions can be tougher and more time consuming to do . <p> Likewise , you may have manual workflows around creating or updating users and memberships that do n't  scale well as your member list grows . For example , you may edit roles for new members so you could offer advanced discounts with something like Dynamic Pricing ( which is based on roles ) , but these processes take up valuable time that could be used on marketing or adding new products . <p> Automating these processes can often be difficult without a developer , which is why AutomateWoo is such a powerful tool for running automated workflows on your site . <p> AutomateWoo has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run workflows from Memberships triggers , or take action for a membership based on another trigger . Automating your membership workflows can save you hundreds of hours in site management per year , cutting down on manual management and review of your site . <h> Automating WooCommerce Memberships : Membership Triggers &amp; Actions <p> AutomateWoo uses the concept of triggers and actions to create automatic workflows for your site . A workflow can have only one trigger ( such as an order being placed ) , but this trigger can prompt your site to run one or more actions ( such as emailing someone and updating user details ) . <p> AutomateWoo currently has one major trigger for Memberships : status changed . Any time a membership changes from one status to another , you can run a workflow to trigger emails , update the membership , or take other actions . <p> You can scope this trigger to certain plans , or listen to changes for memberships in any plan . You can also leave the trigger open-ended , e.g. , " any status " to " expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " expired " . <p> If you 'd like to take an action for a membership instead , the main action available is to create or change a membership . You can change a membership from one plan to another , or opt to create a new membership if one does n't  exist to modify . <p> There are tons of combinations for these Memberships triggers and actions that can tie into other AutomateWoo workflow components , helping you simplify your site management and reduce the number of manual tasks you have to take every day . <p> One of the best examples for using the Membership " create / update " action is a lifetime spend trigger . <p> Many sites want to reward loyal customers for their patronage , and giving away a complimentary membership is a great way to reward a customer for reaching a total lifetime spend . For example , you can give away a VIP membership once a customer spends $500 with your store , letting them access special products , content , or discounts . <p> To do so , well need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enter your desired threshold : <p> Optionally , you may want to tag users when you do this workflow so this process cant run twice ( it shouldnt but its a good safeguard ) . You could check this tag to ensure you do n't  run it again if so . <p> Now you can add your action : create a " Silver membership " for the user ( and optionally add your tags ) , as the result of this workflow . <p> This membership will follow all rules youve already configured for the plan , such as the access length for the member before the membership expires . <p> While memberships has some emails to members around expiration , it does n't  let an admin know when a member cancels an account , which could be pertinent if you want to follow up or offer partial refunds ( for memberships that werent tied to subscriptions ) . <p> If you 'd like to notify yourself or anyone on your team when a membership is cancelled , you can set up a trigger for a status change from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be to send yourself and email with the details for this member , letting to determine if further action is needed . <p> If you want to take this further , AutomateWoo also let 's you modify dates . If you wanted to show what the members end date would have been , you could modify the start date and include this information in the email to yourself . <p> For example , let 's say all of my memberships run for 1 year . You could grab the start date , modify it +1 year , then include that as the " original expiration date " to see how much time was left on your customers membership before cancelling . <p> Handling role changes can help connect your members even further to plugins that work with roles , such as some discount plugins . Memberships does not leverage roles on its own , as it stores data outside of the WordPress user data to make it easy to query memberships or add custom data . <p> AutomateWoo , however , can let you modify roles based on status changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a membership moves to an active status : <p> A quick note : a " membership created " trigger is coming soon , which will make the " membership become active " trigger more reliable , as currently when a membership is immediately set to active without a change . You could also trigger on a membership product purchase instead for now . <p> Do n't  forget to then return members to the basic " Customer " role when the Membership moves to an inactive status : <p> I 'd just be sure that you exclude higher level roles on your site , lest you lock yourself out while testing out membership workflows by making yourself a customer = <p> Memberships can also be a great incentive to encourage product reviews in your store . You can give away short-term or trial membership in exchange for product reviews by leveraging the " User leaves a product review " trigger . <p> When this is fired , you can add a new membership for your user to gain access for your trial membership . This plan could give them access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memberships with AutomateWoo <p> While WooCommerce Memberships gives you the tools needed to control member access , perks , length , and other facets of your site memberships , there may be tons of manual workflows you have around day-to-day management for communication or plugin compatibility . <p> AutomateWoo helps you to streamline those processes , simplifying your day-to-day site management and communication . With the new triggers and actions for Memberships , membership site owners can now automate communication , cancellation follow ups , award access for user actions or spending goals , or handle role changes without the need for custom code . <p> You could take these triggers even further : adding notifications for members who complete a free trial , cancel during a trial , add more admin notifications around membership changes , or give away memberships for other site events like mailing list subscriptions . AutomateWoo gives you tons of triggers to work from to ensure you can let your site run on its own . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Do n't  forget to back up first ! <h> What 's New ? <p> There are some massive changes to the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some core integrations . One of the most exciting new features is the REST API from one of our authors and founders Max Rice . What does this mean ? At the user level , admittedly not too much . However , it opens up a lot of possibilities for developers and has allowed the development of the official WooCommerce iPhone app , which is slated for release in late March . This also opens the door for other integrations without the use of plugins . <p> The inclusion of the API has also reduced the number of pages installed by default . Previously , eleven pages were installed with WooCommerce , but in version 2.1 , the only pages installed are the Shop , My Account , Checkout , and Cart pages . Sub-pages ( like Checkout &gt; Order Received ) are now API endpoints , which makes them more reliable and prevents them from being deleted . For example , the Order Received page will now always be located at **42;1866;TOOLONG . As a result , shortcodes for these pages will no longer work , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> WooCommerce 2.1 Bulk adjust variation prices <p> So what else is new ? One feature I really like is the ability to bulk adjust prices for product variations by a percentage or fixed amount . You could previously set a price or sale price for all variations , but could n't adjust these prices unless you did it individually for each variation . You can now increase or decrease both regular and sale prices right from the " Product Data " screen , which vastly improves product variation handling . <p> Reporting has undergone some changes in WooCommerce 2.1 , but some new features were also added . First , taxes are now included in reporting , and can be viewed by code and by date . Taxes are also broken down by item and shipping tax amounts . Reports include a new CSV export capability for reporting as well . <p> Customers can now edit account information . First , customers can add new saved payment methods credit cards or bank accounts directly from the " My Account " page without needing to go through the checkout process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , customers could previously change addresses and reset passwords . Now names and email addresses used to identify an account can be changed by customers from the " My Accounts " page as well . <p> WooCommerce 2.1 : Customers can now edit " My Account " info <p> Account creation has also been simplified , as the need to create a password can be removed from the registration process . Customers can be sent a temporary password to facilitate account creation during checkout so that barriers are eliminated . Customers get easier account creation , and you get increased conversions by limiting the amount of decisions customers have to make at checkout . <p> Product reviews have also been tweaked , and can now optionally be limited to " verified owners " , which are customers that have purchased the product from your store as a customer ( similar to Amazons verified purchase reviews ) . <h> What 's Changed ? <p> When you set up your WooCommerce shop ( or edit the setup while upgrading ) , you 'll notice that the settings page has been simplified , and settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to products , including inventory , is now under the " Products " tab . <p> WooCommerce 2.0 Settings <p> WooCommerce 2.1 Settings <p> One of the biggest improvements has been the built-in reporting . WooCommerce has always had great reporting capabilities , but they 've been completely redone in 2.1 and have a brand new look and simpler interface . <p> WooCommerce 2.0 Sales Reporting <p> WooCommerce 2.1 Sales Reporting <p> You can also view far more detailed customer reports in the newest version of the plugin . Not only can you view a customer list , but you can also view signups for custom date ranges and compare the number of customer versus guest purchases for that period . <p> WooCommerce 2.1 Customer Reporting <p> Order administration has also been improved and redesigned . Marking orders as " on-hold " is now an option for bulk editing orders from the " Orders " page . The Orders page has been simplified , and icons have been redesigned to be consistent with the WordPress 3.8 design . <p> Orders in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> Orders in WooCommerce 2.1 <p> Orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email used if they were placed before the customer registered so you have an accurate record of customer purchases and lifetime value . <p> Coupon creation and editing has been improved . Usage limits can now also be assigned based on user I 'd or email to prevent users from applying the same coupon a number of times . <p> Coupons in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> Coupons in WooCommerce 2.1 <h> What 's Gone ? <p> The three WooCommerce dashboard widgets ( Right Now , Monthly Sales , and Recent Orders ) have been axed in favor of one " WooCommerce Status " dashboard widget whose design is consistent with the upcoming iPhone App . All icons also link to the relevant pages so that you now have one command center that provides a store overview . <p> WooCommerce 2.1 Dashboard Widget <p> The changes in WooCommerce 2.1 aim to make the core plugin as lean as possible and to shorten development cycles . As a result , several of the core integrations have been removed and are now separate plugins . This means that they can be developed faster while independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security by removing pieces that are n't  used by the majority of shops . Here are the links to the free integration plugins for everything that 's been removed from core : <h> WooCommerce 2.1 Review Summary <p> In summary , though the development cycle for WooCommerce 2.1 was pretty long , Im excited about the changes that the development team has made . Many times , it seems that plugins continue to expand and constantly add settings , which can lead to bloat over time . Rather than simply add the features that users have requested , WooCommerce 2.1 also slices away some settings and features that are n't  needed by most users , which keeps the core plugin lean and stable and improves the user experience . <p> Some users have been confused by the addition of endpoints rather than using shortcodes to generate pages , which is understandable given the lack of a detailed upgrade guide . However , I think these endpoints and structural changes provide some exciting possibilities for future WooCommerce integrations and improvements for existing shop owners .

@@98138209 @2338209/ <p> There are a lot of really awesome WooCommerce extensions that can help you sell just about anything using WooCommerce . However , many of them are complex or require a lot of support , and are thus premium add-ons . Do n't  let that deter you ! There are also some great free WooCommerce extensions that can help your store learn some really cool tricks = . Here are 12 free extensions that we 've found very useful in our own WooCommerce shops . <h> 1 . Amazon Payments Advanced <p> The Amazon Payments Advanced extension is developed by WooThemes and provides a payment gateway integration between your store and Amazons credit card processing . This extension embeds an Amazon Payments widget on your site , and all the buyer interactions with Amazon Payments Advanced take place in this widget so that the buyer never leaves your site during the checkout process . You can accept all major credit cards using this gateway . <p> Normally I do n't  recommend free gateway extensions , as its imperative that your payment gateway integration is kept up-to-date and supported for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensions fall by the wayside or are ignored . However , as the core WooThemes team updates and supports this extension , that is n't the case . <p> You 'll still need an SSL certificate to use this payment gateway integration since payment data is collected on your site . <h> 2 . Product Details Customizer <p> This plugin allows you to customize the details on individual WooCommerce product pages . You can show or hide core components such as product images , tabs , product up-sells , and related products should you not want to show them all to customers . This is a great tool for stores whose themes do n't  allow for options to change what 's displayed on product pages . <h> 3 . WooCommerce Product Gift Wrap <p> Many customers love using the gift wrapping services that major retailers , such as Amazon or Bed Bath &amp; Beyond , offer on purchases especially around the holiday season . This extension let 's you add a gift wrap option to your products , and set an optional price for this service . If the customer selects the gift wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the order page . The plugin also adds your defined gift wrapping cost to the items cost as well . <h> 4 . WooCommerce Customizer <p> here 's one from SkyVerge , who is our sponsor . The WooCommerce Customizer helps non-coders customize WooCommerce button text , labels , and more . This extension provides a settings page that helps shop owners modify WooCommerce filters without templates or code . You can use it change the " Add to Cart " button text , number of products per page , tax label text , and other WooCommerce defaults ( though some themes do provide settings for some of these items ) . <h> 5 . WooCommerce Smart Sales Badge <p> The WooCommerce Smart Sales Badge plugin changes the way the " Sale ! " sticker is displayed in your WooCommerce store . Rather than simply letting customers know that a product is on sale , you can tell them exactly how much theyll be saving by purchasing the product while its on sale to give them an incentive to buy . The new sticker will say " Save $x ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable products . <h> 6 . YITh WooCommerce Zoom Magnifier <p> The YITh WooCommerce Zoom Magnifier is developed by Your Inspiration Themes , and allows you to create a zoom effect for your product images so that customers are able to see product details ( similar to what Zappos does when you click an image ) . This way , customers simply have to hover over your product image ( or select a new one from the image gallery ) to see the image in more detail rather than opening it in a lightbox . <p> The plugin also adds a slider below the featured image with your product gallery images . Want to see how it works ? There are live demos here and here . <h> 7 . Order Delivery Date for WooCommerce <p> The Order Delivery Date extension for WooCommerce allows customers to optionally select a future delivery date for their order while ordering from your store , which is great for stores that offer local delivery ( i.e. , flower shops ) or sell oversize items ( such as furniture ) . The delivery date that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields " as well so that administrators can view delivery dates for an order . <h> 8 . WooCommerce New Product Badge <p> NEW badge example <p> here 's another one from some of the core WooCommerce team . The WooCommerce New Product Badge extension is from James Koster and Coen Jacobs , who 's another lead developer for WooCommerce . This plugin adds a small NEW badge to products that have recently been added to your shop so that customers can check out your new inventory . You can set the number of days for what 's new in your store under the catalog settings . <h> 9 . WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers <p> here 's another SkyVerge production . By default , order numbers are not always sequential with WooCommerce , as the order number is generated from the post I 'd ( orders are a custom post type ) . Therefore , any time you add a new page , post , product , etc. , the post I 'd is incremented and order numbers may skip when they pull in the next post I 'd . Many times , continuous order numbers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require them , or regulate that invoice numbers must match order numbers . <p> WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers remedies this issue by creating its own counter to increment order numbers . The plugin does n't  have any settings , but installing it will cause order numbers to pick up from the highest available order number , then become sequential from there . For example , if your highest order number is " 343 " , then this plugin starts numbering from that . The next order will be " 344 " , and order numbers will be continuous from there . <h> 10 . WooCommerce Photos Product Tab <p> The WooCommerce Photos Product Tab extension adds a tab to your product pages that stores all product images in your gallery , which can help clean up your product pages . Depending on your theme , your image gallery may be messy or take up a lot of real estate on your product page . By storing these images in a tab , you can clean up your product pages while still using the WooCommerce image lightbox so that customers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Product Tabs Lite <p> Want another option for adding tabs to your product pages ? The WooCommerce Custom Product Tabs Lite extension allows you to add one additional tab to your WooCommerce product pages that can contain content ( such as assembly instructions ) , other text , html , or shortcodes ( i.e. , video embeds ) . The Photo Tab extension is great for embedding your images , and Custom Product Tabs can help with anything else you want to display in your product tab . <p> Almost any WooCommerce extension that generates its own shortcodes can use the new custom tab to embed those shortcodes ( i.e. , pricing tables , product documents , and more ) . Its also very handy for sizing information for apparel or product FAQs. <h> 12 . WooCommerce Checkout Manager <p> The WooCommerce Checkout Manager extension helps you manage the checkout process in WooCommerce . You can remove fields that you do not need , remove the required attribute so that fields are optional to customer , and can add more fields to the checkout page . This makes the checkout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your store . <p> You can add new checkout fields using four different field types : Text Inputs , Check Boxes , Select Options , and a Date Picker . These will also be included in order details . <h> Bonus Round ! WooCommerce Product SKU Generator <p> This is one of mine , so I did n't  feel like I should include it as part of the 12 extensions I promised = . The WooCommerce Product SKU Generatorautomatically generates SKUs for all products and parent variable products using the product slug . This is handy for stores using fulfillment services , such as Shipwire , that require SKUs for each product ( which is what a customer wanted it for ) . This way , SKUs are automatically generated every time a product is published or updated , and you can simply copy them into your fulfillment service . Bulk updating will also update SKUs for products so that you can create them for old products . <p> You can optionally create unique SKUs for variations of variable products as well , which will append the attributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates ) . For example , let 's say you have a " WordPress Tee Shirt " product . The parent product slug is wordpress-tee-shirt , so this will be used as the SKU . Any variations can optionally use that to create their own SKUs . If there 's a medium variation in blue , the SKU will be **31;1910;TOOLONG so that all variations are unique . <p> Have any favorite free extensions that we missed ?

You can download it for free &amp; join our VIP section : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 27 Comments <p> Nice ! I think the most important extension is the WooCommerce Custom Product Tabs , to be able show custom information under product page . However this plugin has not any custom function or features in its tabs . Recently I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to allow them ask pre-sale questions for each products . A simple discussion or commenting plugin will be very helpful to allow them discuss and ask any questions before buying . So I 'd recommend add some plugin here which allows to discuss , comment and ask questions in a new tub under Product page . <p> Great article and do you know of a WooCommerce plug in that means you can attach an SKU to a coupon . We are trying to link to a fulfilment service using Linnworks but when the coupons are pulled through it does n't  know what the coupon is although it does know the value . Any recommendations ? <p> Is there an easy way to move the page text below the product listings on my home page when I use WooCommerce and have chosen the home page for my products page ? As of now my original text/article that was on this static page before installing WooCommerce is now being showed before the products . I want it to be shown after the shop products . <p> Hey Erik , I 'm afraid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a WooCommerce shortcode to display a selection of products and then link to the shop instead , as you could insert that before the content rather than setting this as the entire shop page . <p> Hi there , Great blog on top plugins , thank you ! I have been searching everywhere for the right plugins extensions to help with woocommerce shipping . I sell a variety of different products and weights so the flat rate does not work for me , also the classes does not either , both of which are included in the free version . Do you have any reviews of those or if not would love to see a review of the best plug in extensions to go with woocommerce and that do n't  cost a ton of money . It seems like I 'm reading various comments ( in my search for extensions ) on how woocommerce is charging quite a bit extra on extra extensions and by the time you are done it costs more then just getting a different shopping cart plugin in the first placeIm starting to see why people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful ? <p> Alsonot sure if this is the right place to ask this question . When I add products to my woocommerce in wordpress.org it has the tags placehow is this supposed to work ? I 'm new to this . Is it for SEO purposes , convenience , to help the customersall of the above ? I have read some people say put as many tags as you can think of because it will be picked up in search engines ? Is that correct or just on your website itself ? Is there a way to hide this under the product description or is the idea for it to be showing ? <p> I 'm looking for a plugin that can substitute the " add to cart " ( when hovering over a product picture inside the category ) to several icons with options like : cart , heart ( add to favorites ) , thumb up ( fb like ) , P ( pinterest ) <p> Also I heard about a plugin that is displayed on the checkout page , and when the user likes or shares the product/picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight after sharing/liking the product . Do you know it ? <p> I love your articles . Im stuck though . As you know from previous comments , I have a service based business that does custom work for my customers . I 'm looking for a plugin that will allow me to organize orders and change status in a virtual assembly line . Like Trello for Woocommerce orders . Do you or any of your readers know of anything like this . I 've scoured the web to no avail . <p> Hey Mark , afraid I 'm not aware of something like this . The only solution off the top of my head would be : 1 . Use WooCommerce Zapier to create a new card for every order in Trello. ( easy step ) 2 . Use your Trello stacks as order statuses ; moving a card to the next " stack " should be the next " status " 3 . Use Zapier ( or your own custom Trello integration ) to catch the Trello webhook from moving the card so you know when its moved and can trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code to update the order status via the WC REST API <p> So you could manage orders in Trello , but youd need custom code to tie order status updates to the card movement , and Zapier would help a lot with this ( you can do a Trello &gt; " custom code " Zap for step 3/4 ) . Definitely not simple , but a cool idea = If you wanted to over-engineer it you could even have card comments add order notes and stuff like that . <p> Hello Beka , Thanks a lot for the interesting post , I would like to know if have used or had experience with variable price plugins . I am trying to find a plugin that allows me to manage checkouts for a custom T-Shirts Store , I know T-Shirt stores are very popular e-commerce sample , in my particular case I want to offer discount per quantity , and I will have price also variables based on 4 different printing techniques each applicable to a single product , lastly , I would like to advertise the lowest price of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want the customers to suggest based on promotional basis . <p> I have checked all over , and there are plugins for variable prices , but none I feel comfortable spending my money as the descriptions are not really showing all I need . <p> Sounds like Dynamic Pricing would be a good fit you could do variable pricing within the product set up itself , quantity-based pricing with Dynamic Pricing . However , advertising the lowest possible price would require some modification , Dynamic Pricing will display the regular price instead . I 'm not sure of a plugin that would show the price based on quantity breaks available myself . <p> I will double check on that one , I had it in my scope but the description of its features is too general that I was n't so sure if going ahead with it , and for the price I guess I still have to double check to see if it fits before making my final decision . 
@@98138210 @2338210/ <h> Email Case Study : Feedback Email from Clearly <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this months email case study , we look at the feedback email from Clearly , an online retailer of contact lenses and other eye-wear . The email prompts the customer for feedback after they have purchased products on the store by directing them to an online survey . <p> Similar to last months email break down of the survey email from The Den , we will look at what works well in this email , things that can be improved , and unique things that got us to click . <h> Feedback email : What was good about the Clearly email ? <p> There are a number of things that work well in this email . <p> Clearly state that the survey wont take long <h> 1 . Reiteration of shipping and return policy <p> Since this email goes to customers after they have purchased the products , it is helpful to reiterate your stores shipping and return policy . This is especially true if your store has free shipping and free returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do n't  have to dig around anywhere else on your site to find out what the return policy is . In addition , this is a great way to build a brand reputation for providing free shipping and returns . <h> 2 . Navigation mimics website <p> Recreating your websites navigation in the email helps build a consistent experience for customers browsing your products . Customers are able to browse through a familiar layout directly from the email . You can also highlight pages in the navigation that customers may be interested in. <h> 3 . Explicit time required to complete survey <p> One of the best features in this email is the mention of how long it will take to complete the survey . For people who read the email and think about putting off or not completing the survey , knowing that itll only take a few seconds can change their mind . <p> If your surveys are usually pretty short , mentioning the completion time can help get you feedback from more people . Even in case of longer surveys , mentioning how long itll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit . Customers may feel slighted if the survey takes longer than they expected when a time is not given . <h> Feedback email : What was bad about the Clearly email ? <h> 1 . No personalized signature <p> The email is signed by " Clearly " , which is a company name instead of an individual . This makes the email feel mass-produced and impersonal . Even though the email may accomplish its core purpose , which is to get feedback , it is a missed opportunity to form a connection with your customers . <p> Instead of signing the email with the company name , include a persons name and title in the email . The higher this person in the organization , the better . But even if the founder or CEO is not comfortable putting their name , include somebodys name from the customer service team , or something similarly relevant . <h> 2 . Uninteresting copy <p> This might be a bit subjective , but other than asking to fill out the survey , the email does n't  say anything else . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not have lost anything meaningful from the message . Although it is a good thing that the " CLICK HERE " is highlighted , the rest of the email feels more like a filler . <p> Each email is a very important touchpoint with your customers . Each email is your opportunity to connect with your customers , make your brand more memorable , and potentially increase your sales . Getting somebody to open your emails is half the battle , but if they do , make sure you provide as much appropriate value to customers as possible . In this email , a number of things could have been highlighted current promotions , any referral programs , link to eye-glass care instructions , etc. <h> 3 . Social profiles not explained <p> Although it is a good thing that the social profiles are included in the footer of the page , there is no context provided for these profiles . This continues from the above point that very little context is provided for anything other than the survey in this email . <p> For your emails , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shared on your social profiles can help guide what customers can expect to find . This can be user-generated content , educational or instructional posts about your products , posts about special sales and offers , and more . <h> Feedback email : What gets you to click ? <p> The major thing that gets me to open the email and then open the survey is knowing the time required to complete the survey . This is not only part of the copy in the email , but also the subject line which gets me to open the email in the first place . <p> Mention in the subject that feedback wont take long <p> The email tells customers exactly how long it will take to complete the survey instead of just stating that its a " short " survey . This signals that Clearly cares about their customers time and does n't  want to get them started on a survey that takes longer than people might expect . After all , length of a " short " survey is subjective . <p> Stating the time required to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives people more control over how they spend their time . Many blogs ( like ours ) now state the time required to read an article at the beginning of each post which tends to increase user engagement . <h> Feedback email : Takeaways <p> Between last months survey email and the Clearly feedback email , there 's a pattern that emerges for the layout header/navigation , big image , and content prompting feedback . One way to get higher response on the feedback is to offer rewards . But , people may not even open the email unless you have an attention-grabbing subject line . <p> In the case of Clearly , they explicitly state how long it will take to fill out the survey . By stating that it will only take less than 20 seconds in the subject line , customers get an idea about the time commitment right away . For too long people have been asked to fill out surveys that take 10 15 minutes . Designing a really short survey respects your customers time , allows you to get feedback from more people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve on your store . <p> In next months email case study , we will look at some feedback emails with embedded polls , and how you can create such polls for your store . <p> Was there an email from a retailer that really caught your attention ?

@@98138211 @2338211/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Many of us have probably been beaten over the head a bit with the famous statistic on cart abandonment from Baymard Institute : 68.81% of all shopping carts are abandoned , meaning over 2 out of every 3 customers who have placed items in a shopping cart have left your online store . <p> While many merchants may be familiar with this metric , knowing what to do about it is an entirely different battle can you do anything about cart abandonment ? Can you reduce this percentage ? What about saving any of those abandoned sales is that possible ? <p> You can indeed affect change on your abandonment rate by improving checkout flows , ensuring all costs or fees ( like shipping charges ) are presented up-front , and offering guest checkout . However , there 's only so much you can do to make these improvements , especially if you do n't  already work with a developer who can help you properly customize your checkout . <p> With the holiday season coming up , its also not the best time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be sure you 're not encountering bugs in the middle of a Black Friday sale . You can , however , work on saving those lost sales and recovering the lost revenue from abandoned carts very easily . Now is a great time to recover abandoned carts to bump your holiday sales revenue . <p> If you want to work on recovering orders after theyve already been abandoned , you can send recovery emails to your customers to encourage them to complete the purchase on your site , and even work to address some of the common reasons they may have left the purchase in the first place . Today well take a look at using Jilt , an Easy Digital Downloads and WooCommerce abandoned cart app , to help merchants save these sales . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Overview <p> Jilt has long been available for Shopify stores to recover abandoned carts , and has already helped merchants recover almost $14 million USD in abandoned revenue . <p> Rather than providing a plugin to install on your site , Jilt is a hosted app that tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect your store to the Jilt app , and then Jilt will handle all order tracking and recovery emails via the app . This provides you several benefits over using a plugin alone on your store : <p> Think of the number of orders you have on your site right now now triple that amount . That 's how much data you 'd have if you tracked every cart , including those that were abandoned , as only 1 in 3 people who add items to the cart place an order . If you stored all of that data on your site , you 'd have a lot of tracking data being written to your sites database , potentially slowing down your site or requiring you to upgrade your hosting to store this data . <p> Jilt takes this massive amount of data off your hands and stores it for you ; the connector plugin sends data on abandonment to the app , and it will track these shopping sessions in its own database . This means that you can store data without worrying about memory limits from your hosting company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  have to worry about deleting it every so often to save space ) . Your Jilt reporting dashboard will let you analyze your abandonment and recoveries based on this data . <p> Sending emails via your site is also a huge pain to deal with , and something we do n't  recommend . In fact , we 've recommended using a transactional email service for your order emails before . When you send emails directly from your site , they 're at a higher risk of being spammed , especially if you use shared hosting . Email services can validate your emails with service providers to improve deliverability rates and reduce spam rates for emails . <p> As the Jilt app sends your recovery emails , this means that they 're validated and sent from the app , not your site , so that deliverability is as high as possible , and scheduled send times are more accurate . <p> When you use an app , you can also connect multiple stores to your account , which tends to cost more with a plugin . Jilt let 's you connect as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can connect staging sites , wholesale versions of your store , or other store sites to your account : <p> Jilt costs start at $29.99 per month , and this let 's you create as many campaigns as you 'd like , send as many emails as you want , and connect any amount of stores to your account . <p> Let 's take a look at how you connect a store and get started with recovery emails to save your lost sales . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Connecting Jilt to Your Store <p> To connect your store , to Jilt , you need the following steps : <p> Sign up for a Jilt free trial ( which runs for 14 days or more , depending on when you recover your first order ) <p> After saving your settings , you 'll see a " connected " notice here as well to indicate that Jilt is ready to track abandoned carts . <p> That 's it ! Now Jilt is tracking cart abandonment for your site , and you can set up your recovery emails to save these abandoned sales . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , you can do so by clicking your store name to open the store selector , then clicking " Add store " . You 'll follow the same process on every store to connect it to Jilt . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Setting Up Campaigns and Emails <p> Now that your store is connected , you can get your recovery emails set up . There are two components to sending recovery emails : campaigns and emails . <p> A campaign is a collection of emails that are sent after an order has been abandoned . Jilt let 's you add as many campaigns as you want , but typically youd only want to leave one campaign enabled at a time . <p> This let 's you use specific campaigns for sales periods ( such as your holiday sales ) , storewide sales , holidays , or just to create a generic campaign that 's used by default . This means that you can have different content and email images sent out at different times of the year , ensuring your emails are always relevant to the season and what 's going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many recovery emails as you 'd like . When a campaign is active , its recovery emails are sent in order to the customer based on the sending delay you 've set . Sending delays are based on when the cart is considered abandoned , not when the customer leaves it : <p> A customer adds an item to the cart , and begins filling out the checkout form . As soon as an email has been entered , Jilt begins tracking the email ( or for a registered customer , tracking starts when an item is added to the cart ) . <p> As soon as its been 15 minutes since the customers last activity on the site , Jilt notes this cart as " abandoned " . This is the time at which your email delays start . <p> If you have an email sent at 1 hour after cart abandonment , it will be sent 1h 15m after the cart was left , as the abandonment threshold + sending delay is used . <p> Once youve determined when you want to send your emails , you may also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By default , when you add a new campaign , Jilt will use some industry best practices to help you get set up : a new campaign has 3 recovery emails set up at recommended send times with some starter content . <p> However , you can modify the email settings or content as desired for your store . This let 's you ensure emails reflect your brand , and you can personalize email content as well to include the customer name , email , cart contents , or other details . Personalization is a huge win for abandoned cart emails , as personalized emails can increase open rates and recovered revenue : <p> If you 're editing your email content , you should probably take into consideration why carts are abandoned as well , and adjust your messaging to reflect this . <p> 61% of abandonment is due to unexpected or high shipping costs ( this is the leading cause for abandonment ) . You could consider including a free shipping coupon in one of your recovery emails to combat this I recommend creating a free shipping coupon limited to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second or third recovery email . <p> 27% of abandonment is due to a long or complicated checkout process . You can ask the customer if s/he had issues in completing checkout with your recovery email , as this presents a customer service opportunity for you to save the sale . <p> Customers also cite the following as sources for abandonment : not enough payment options , refund policy was n't clear , the customer couldnt see an order total up front . You can link to your site policies on shipping times and refunds within your recovery emails to clarify this information . <p> When you 're happy with an emails content , you can adjust the email settings ( such as the " sent from " details ) , and adjust the email template , or preview your changes . You can also send a test email to yourself to confirm you like the email design . <p> After you 've finished with an emails settings and content , you can change it to " Send automatically " to begin using it for customers whove abandoned a cart . <p> View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited and configured to send automatically , ensure the campaign you want to use is enabled , and youll begin sending recovery emails directly to customers . <p> Only the active campaigns emails are sent , so be sure you 've activated the campaign you 'd like to use . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : What Customers See <p> Once Jilt has a campaign active with its recovery emails being sent automatically , it will begin recovery attempts for your store . Emails are sent on your schedule to guest and registered customers , asking them to complete their purchase . <p> These emails can include your personalization details , and will give customers a link to complete the purchase . This link is important for a few reasons : <p> This link will use cart regeneration to refill the cart and shipping method selections that the customer had prior to abandoning the cart <p> Customers are immediately directed to the checkout page so they can complete the purchase in one or two clicks <p> If your customer has an account with this email address , clicking the link will log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready to click place order . ( This wo n't work for your admin account for security reasons , so youd need to test it as a customer or guest . ) <p> Cart regeneration is an important tool , as half of abandonment emails are opened on a different device than the one on which the cart was originally created regenerating the cart can therefore lead to a 34% increase in recoveries by cutting down the number of steps required to purchase . <p> Jilt removes as many barriers as possible to helping your customers complete purchase . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Tracking Orders <p> Jilt will store all data on abandoned orders for you , letting you see lost and recovered orders from the " Orders " list . <p> While the order is abandoned , it will have a temporary order number in Jilt , such as JILT-#122 . Once it has been recovered , Jilt will use the order number from WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads instead so you can correlate your store records with Jilts data . <p> You 'll see the status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lifecycle this order rests : <p> If the order is " abandoned " , Jilt will actively try to recover it . <p> If an order is " placed " , this means the customer came back to complete the purchase before a recovery email was sent . <p> For an order that 's been " skipped " , this means the customer created a new order after leaving the initial one , or the customer returned and cleared the cart , so no emails are sent . <p> Orders marked " recovered " have successfully completed the sale due to a sent recovery email . <p> If you want to view the specifics for a particular order , you can click on the order number to view the record in Jilt , letting you see customer details and line items : <p> This gives you some insight into abandoned vs recovered emails , and you can get more details from the Jilt dashboard . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Reporting <p> Since Jilt is tracking both abandoned and recovered orders , it can give you some basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much revenue you 've recovered , the order count recovered , abandoned count , and recovery rate . Jilt will also show you how this compares to the previous period in the report . <p> You can also get some insights into campaign and recovery email performance to evaluate revenue driven , open rates , and recovery rates . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Track Outbound Emails <p> Jilt will also let you view outbound emails from the app and whether they 've been opened or not from the Outbound Emails list . You can see which emails are scheduled to send , which have been sent , and which have been aborted ( in case the order was already recovered , as you do n't  want to continue sending emails ) . <p> You 'll also be able to see the associated customer and whether or not they 've opened the recovery email , along with the associated order . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : View Customers <p> Jilt tracks abandoned carts for both guest and registered customers on your site , so you can see a complete list of customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email address , while registered customers will show other details , such as the customer name . <p> You can view more details for a customer to see how many orders have been abandoned or recovered for the customer . <h> Jilt Abandoned Cart App : Other Details <p> The email editing experience is the weakest part of the app at present , so a guide to personalization is helpful . While editing the email content is possible , editing the design is difficult without the help of a developer . This means that you could use your own HTML templates for emails , which is a big bonus , but that you 'd need some HTML or CSS skills at present to make larger design changes . Jilts support team is available to make these changes for you during onboarding ( e.g. , color or design changes ) , so its possible to adjust email styles if you do n't  feel comfortable making the changes yourself . <p> One of the major concerns with cart abandonment recovery emails is customer perception some merchants are concerned that sending emails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that they find abandonment emails helpful , a portion of customers ( up to a third ) find them annoying depending on context ( and whether they include discounts or not ) . <p> The response to abandonment emails is largely based on demographic , so you can check out Marketing Sherpas research to learn more about whether your target customers enjoy receiving these emails . <p> If you want to see abandoned cart emails for your self , you can go to the SkyVerge demo site and add an item to your cart . Go to checkout and enter an email address , then toggle away from the email field . You can now close the browser and youll receive your first recovery email 30 minutes later . <h> Saving Lost Sales and Abandoned Carts with Jilt <p> Jilt provides an Easy Digital Downloads or WooCommerce abandoned cart app solution to help merchants track abandonment and recover lost sales . This can help you drive additional revenue by converting abandoned carts , and also gives you insight into why customers leave purchases , helping you to improve your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Jilt : <p> Jilt is a hosted app , not a plugin , so it incurs a monthly fee rather than an annual purchase ( starting at $29.99 per month ) <p> Editing email design is difficult for non-developers ( this is an area of the app actively being improved , though ) <p> Dashboard reporting is available , but basic ( another area actively being built ) <p> Depending on your target customer , abandonment emails may not be as effective or welcome <p> Along with several upsides as well : <p> Abandoned carts can be tracked for both guest and registered users <p> Capturing email addresses is extremely reliable and quick , as it happens as soon as the email field is completed at checkout <p> The large amounts of data generated by tracking abandonment is stored off of your site <p> Email deliverability and reliability is improved by using a hosted app vs sending them directly via your sites server <p> Multiple stores can be connected to a Jilt account <p> You can use several campaigns to accurately reflect holidays , store sales , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates and recovery <p> Cart regeneration is used to improve recovery and reduce purchasing barriers <p> Disclosure : The author of this post works for SkyVerge , who owns and operates the Jilt abandoned cart app ( though on a separate team from the Jilt development team ) . Despite this , all efforts were made to present an impartial and balanced review . See our Editorial Policy for more details . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> This sounds great . Can you explain in more detail how it handles license renewals ? I ended up hacking CartHook to exclude renewals because it would repopulate the cart without license key / discount . I was also worried about the customer being bombarded with abandonment emails in addition to the multiple EDD renewal emails . How does Jilt handle these things ? <p> Hey Steven , great question = Jilt will send recovery emails if a renewal transaction is abandoned , but it will also include the license key / renewal flag when it repopulates the cart . This ensures that the session data is accurate so license key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our own Easy Digital Downloads store thanks to this article and I have been very impressed . The support is absolutely fantastic , the best I have seen from any plugin company ( apart from ourselves but that 's why I 'm so impressed at the level of support we get from Jilt ! ) . I always receive quick answers from the developer of the plugin and they go above and beyond to get Jilt working as I want it to . I 'm looking forward to the introduction of coupon codes that are automatically generated and sent with abandoned carts , which they have promised to add soon

@@98138214 @2338214/ <p> This series pits plugins and services against one another in head-to-head comparisons . <p> Hosting is one of the most important foundations on which you 'll build your eCommerce site , and there are tons of options available . If you 're just starting out , you 're probably looking for a relatively inexpensive option that will deliver great value . However , if you 're building a business out of this site , there are several features that you should prioritize along with ( or above ! ) cost . <p> While you 're looking for a web host for your eCommerce site , performance is one of the features you should make a priority . We discussed this a bit in our WordPress hosting overview , but your page loads times directly impact your search rankings and conversion rates , so optimizing your hosting is really important for your business . <p> For example , KISSmetrics notes that : <p> A 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions . ( Source ) <p> In a separate post , they also note : <p> 79% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they wont return to the site to buy again and around 44% of them would tell a friend if they had a poor experience shopping online . ( Source ) <p> Its imperative to ensure that you 're not leaking conversions due to poor site performance . However , site speed is not the only factor to consider when selecting a good hosting provider for an eCommerce site . There are other features that are essential for running an eCommerce business that you should pay attention to as well , such as the ability to install SSL certificates or use development sites . Support is also an important consideration . <p> In this article , well compare 3 hosting plans that have the features that we recommend : SiteGrounds GoGeek , Media Temples WP Hosting , and DreamPress from DreamHost . Each of the plans we 've selected below are great introductory plans for eCommerce sites , and they 're all available for less than $30 per month , so theyll deliver performance and value . <p> You can also view our comparison chart below and get an insider tip on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DreamPress <p> First of all , let 's start with performance and other similarities between these hosts . I 've hosted sites with each of these companies at some point and had good experiences with them in terms of performance and support . They also have a one-click WordPress install so you do n't  have to install WordPress yourself and will manage servers for you . <p> You may be concerned about Media Temples performance since they were acquired by GoDaddy , as I was . I have no love for GoDaddy with respect to any of their services , so when they acquired Media Temple , I was leery of how the " new " Media Temple would be , as I still host a couple of smaller sites with them . However , I 've not experienced any performance issues while hosting with them since the acquisition , and have been pleased with their performance . In fact , my site load times have actually decreased with Media Temple over the past year . <p> I 've also tested SiteGrounds GoGeek plan and have been impressed with the performance and service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check out this overview from Review Signal . We also have a detailed review of their service . <p> The only plan here I have n't used is DreamHosts DreamPress . I 've used their shared hosting and had good experiences with them previously , so its something I would use again ( just havent had an excuse to use DreamPress yet ! ) . <p> Want to check out a comparison of these three hosts in terms of performance ? WP Site Care has a great comparison of 7 major hosting companies that includes SiteGround , Media Temple , and DreamHost ( though not these specific plans ) . <h> Similarities <p> So now on to similarities . eCommerce hosting has to have a few main features for me to use it . First , SSL certificates have to be allowed . Not every plan for every hosting provider allows you to install an SSL certificate , which eliminates some plans . <p> You can certainly select a payment gateway that does n't  require an SSL certificate to be used , but I always recommend that a business use SSL certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without an SSL certificate installed , login information is sent in plain text to your server and could be intercepted . For the minimal price of SSL certificates , there 's no viable reason to me to avoid using them . <p> Second , FTP / SFTP access is mandatory . You will need this at some point for troubleshooting , updates , or when you accidentally install something that breaks your site . As someone that also supports eCommerce sites , I can tell you that Ive run into many situations in which FTP access is a lifesaver and I do n't  feel comfortable testing some things without it . <p> Along with the idea of security and fallbacks are site backups . Each of these plans can do daily backups of your site to ensure that if anything goes wrong you have access to a restore point . You can also do your own backups if needed . <p> I also think that staging / development areas are essential . While a one-click staging area is ideal , the ability to set up some kind of testing or development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have a huge issue if a new theme , plugin , or update breaks your site and you start losing money . They should always be tested prior to being deployed on a live site . <p> Having a staging or development site available is also super handy for support . If you have a live site taking orders , you may not want support personnel debugging on this site . However , if you can spin up a staging site that experiences the exact same issue , you can easily give support access to the staging or development site so they can debug until their hearts are content without interrupting your business . <p> All of the plans in this comparison have these features available , so you 'll want to take a look at some of the differences to see what works best for you . <h> Differences <p> Pricing is obviously going to be a point of differentiation here . While SiteGround is the least expensive choice for the first term ( you can pay for 1 , 2 , or 3 years as your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive after this . However , I have had the fastest response times from their support team ( GoGeek includes priority support ) , so I think the price is justified . <p> One of the major differences here is that DreamPress uses a Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) , while Media Temple and SiteGround provide shared hosting for these plans . A VPS can provide improved performance since there are n't  as many sites hosted on the same server . The way the server is configured is also different . A VPS segments a server into " virtual machines " so that your site has a semi-dedicated environment you do n't  have all server resources devoted to your install(s) , but other sites on the server can not interfere with yours . <p> Having used the shared hosting for SiteGround and Media Temple , performance has been high anyway . SiteGround also uses upgraded hardware and fewer installs on the server to improve the performance when using the GoGeek plan . On the other hand , using a VPS can give you a bit more piece of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have complete control over the DreamPress VPS as you would with a different VPS since this is managed for you . <p> Another difference is with SSL Certificates while you can install 3rd party SSL Certificates with all of these plans , SiteGround will provide one in-house free for one year ( they do charge setup fees for 3rd party SSL certs , but not in-house SSL certs ) . However , if you choose to use an in-house SSL versus a 3rd party SSL , DreamHost will be cheaper in the long run at $15 per year . Note that Media Temple limits the 3rd party SSL certificates you can use to GeoCities or GoDaddy . <p> The number of sites and bandwidth for these plans also have some slight differences . Media Temple and DreamPress limit the number of installs you can have ( though you can add more sites with Media Temple each with a bit extra storage for a fee ) , while SiteGround recommends a limit to the number of visits per month you can have ( though 100,000 per month is a lot ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage exceeds their recommended limits . You can also have different numbers of staging sites , though these will take a bit of setup with DreamPress ( you can develop at a subdomain then transfer changes ) . <p> Data centers should also be considered . This is where site information will be delivered from , so you 'll want it as close to your main audience as possible . SiteGround offers a choice among 3 data centers in the USA , Europe , and Asia ; Media Temples WordPress hosting uses a data center in Arizona ; DreamPress uses a data center in Los Angeles , USA . <p> SiteGround will also transfer your WordPress site to their servers for free , while you 'll have to pay for transfers with other providers , or you can do them yourself . <p> There are a few more minor differences , such as the guarantee period for you to get a refund , so I 've tried to summarize them in a chart : <p> Please let me know if you have questions = . So far , I 've been very impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these plans . There are also enough differences to help you make a choice do you need multiple staging sites ? Will you be using several sites or just one ? Is this a new site or one that will require a transfer ? These are questions that will help you pick out the right plan for you . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Let 's start with the admin : all WooCommerce settings now use Select2 inputs rather than Chosen for settings fields , as Select2 is slated to be included in WordPress 4.2 as well . You 'll see new select and multiselect fields in your admin : <p> WC 2.3 settings : Select2 <p> The frontend styles have also been updated to help WooCommerce blend in with more themes . Rather than the previous default styles that used the gradients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature a flatter , simpler design . For example , here 's the difference with notices on the Checkout page : <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Coupons <p> One of the biggest changes in this release is how coupons are handled within WooCommerce . The way coupons are applied has been rethought in version 2.3 , and coupons are now only applied before taxes . The goal in this change is to address the fact that applying a discount after tax is illegal in many countries ( not to mention that brick and mortar stores almost always handle coupons before tax ) . <p> As a result , the " Apply before tax " option has been removed from coupon creation . <p> WC 2.2 Coupons <p> WC 2.3 Coupons <p> No other coupon settings have been altered , but if you typically applied coupons after tax , you should be aware of how this will change from WooCommerce 2.3 onwards . <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Settings Changed <p> Settings have also been adjusted in WooCommerce 2.3 . The majority of the changes have been made to the " Product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a few changes of note : <p> General Settings : The " Scripts and styles " section ( which used to let you adjust default colors ) has been removed in favor of simply allowing themes to change this . As most shops are using a WooCommerce theme rather than a default theme , these settings were not widely used . <p> Product Settings : While the settings themselves have n't changed , they 've been broken up into several new sections . In WooCommerce 2.2 , the Product settings were divided into " Options " and " Inventory " . <p> WC 2.2 Product Settings <p> Theyve now been subdivided further to make them a bit easier to navigate and better organized . There are now settings for " General " , " Display " , " Inventory " , and " Downloadable " product settings . <p> WC 2.3 Product Settings <p> The settings page has also added a Webhooks UI . While Webhooks were added in WooCommerce 2.2 , they were strictly limited to developer usage and were part of the API . This new UI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , remove , and edit webhooks , and can also view logs . <p> New Webhooks UI <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Default Style Changes <p> Most of the UI on the frontend of your site will remain the same . However , the default WooCommerce styles have gotten a facelift in order to help them blend in with most modern themes . <p> Notices , buttons , tabs , and sales flashes will also feature an updated look . <p> WC 2.2 Product Page <p> WC 2.3 Product page <p> These can be seen on the shop page where styles have changed as well ( marked by " 1 " ) . If you use the " WooCommerce Cart " widget here , you 'll also notice that products can now be removed from this mini cart ( marked by " 2 " ) . <p> WC 2.2 Shop Page <p> WC 2.3 Shop Page <p> There are more updates made to the cart page , as this template and the structure of the order review table at checkout have changed . This is where you 'll want to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WooCommerce , as outdated templates bundled in your theme may cause issues and should be updated by your theme developer . <p> The most noticeable difference on the cart page is the location of the " Proceed to Checkout " button . This is now located at the bottom of the order review instead of at the bottom of the cart / product table . <p> WC 2.2 Cart Page <p> WC 2.3 Cart Page <p> The " View Order " templates seen by your customers from the " My Account " section have also gotten a facelift . While these changes are n't  substantial , the styling is updated and customer details are now displayed in a table format . <p> WC 2.2 View Order <p> WC 2.3 View Order <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Emails <p> The rest of the major changes in WooCommerce 2.3 have been made to the WooCommerce emails . The email system has been refactored to send all emails through a common send() method . This means that all emails sent via WooCommerce will be able to use the core email templates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop emails or adjust the styles of your emails . <p> Speaking of email styles , there 's a new email-styles.php template that can be used to easily adjust email CSS . Changing the CSS for emails was previously a bit difficult , while now this template can be overridden and adjusted . <p> My preferred method to change these styles would instead be to use the new woocommerceemailstyles filter . This will allow you to add styles to emails via a companion plugin or your theme . Something like this code snippet would do the trick : <p> Finally , a Cancelled Order email added , which is sent to notify the shop admins if an order is cancelled . <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Other Changes <p> There are a couple of other minor changes to note . First , support for JetPack Markdown has been added to product pages , which will now allow you to use markdown in your product descriptions . <p> Second , WooCommerce now includes the ability to geolocate customers using an IP address , which can be used to display tax based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU merchants who need to display the correct VAT to customers while browsing . <h> WooCommerce 2.3 Review : Summary <p> While this WooCommerce release is more about refinement that revolution , the changes to the default styles are very welcome . It may not seem like it , but the changes to emails and coupons are also fairly large , and the email changes especially will help with extensibility moving forward . <p> My favorite feature of this release is probably a toss up between the improved default styles and the Webhooks UI . I think that having a UI in the settings will help users recognize and take advantage of the webhooks that were added in version 2.2 , which can make it easier to integrate with 3rd party services . This should hopefully lead to some interesting integrations with WooCommerce shops . <h> Further Reading <p> Looking for more detailed reviews ? Weve reviewed other major WooCommerce releases : 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Now back to the update . In a perfect world I would have had a post going over all the great new things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't  happen . So instead , I am going to send you over to the SellWithWP site where Beka Rice wrote this great review . <p> Thanks for the review . I am using the coupon for after tax rebate . We need to charge the full tax to a customer before we can apply an instant manufacture rebate . Ie. Sell at 100 x 5% tax = 105 20 rebate = $85. what do you suggest for me continuing to do this ? <p> Hey Justin , I 'd probably use a gift certificate ( or similar ) instead , as this would most likely be applied after tax and treated just like cash . I think Smart Coupons could be a good fit for this , but you may want to submit a pre-sales Q to be sure : ) . <p> I currently updated my Woocommerce to 2.3 and since I am using a Cash on Delivery method , the default status has changed from On-Hold to Processing ! I really want to bring it back to On-Hold once we receive such an order ! Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter better because that way you do n't  have to keep up with template overrides . If the email-styles.php template is updated in the future , you should pay attention to this and merge updates back into your override . Using a filter ensures that you do n't  have to worry about the template changing . <p> As for custom fonts , I think you could probably use Google Fonts by using the @import url(stylesheet-url) ; CSS and then setting the font , but not sure worth a try though ! <p> Hi Beka , thank you so much , I used your code and it worked ! Custom fonts also worked , but only in certain email programs , so I guess it is always advisable to use a fallback ! By the way , I have submitted a question on Skyverge for another problem I have and that I cant seem to get solved <p> Take care , Dora 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138217 @2338217/ <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> The unfortunate reality of running an eCommerce store is that 68% of all carts are abandoned . Think about that in terms of your conversion funnel for a second that means that 7 of every 10 people that add items from your site to their cart will leave their purchase . Not 7 of 10 people that visit your site , mind ; 70% of people who are considering purchasing will leave . <p> That number illustrates one of the biggest leaks in the eCommerce conversion funnel : customers leaving from the cart system . However , there are ways to improve your conversions by reducing cart abandonment as well as plenty of tools available to help . <p> First , we should understand why customers abandon purchases . Of all abandonment reasons , 3 of the top 41 are related to price usually with unexpected costs . For example , the leading cause of cart abandonment2 is unexpected shipping costs . In fact , 53% of customers3 who abandon carts do so due to high delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cart just to check shipping costs . <p> We can help to address these concerns by setting up effective shipping methods and making them apparent , but we can also get in touch with customers to reduce these costs if they 're standing in the way of purchasing , or just to remind them to complete their purchase . <h> Table of Contents <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro plugin : Overview <p> While there 's a Abandoned Cart Lite plugin available , well focus on WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro with this review , as it allows you to track sent emails , coupons , products in the cart , and more . <p> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro is available for $119 to $249 , depending on how many sites will be using the plugin ( 1 site , 5 , or unlimited ) . As the plugin has the potential to directly increase revenues , I was excited to try it out and see what I could do in terms of setting up emails and recovering carts . <p> If you 'd like to check this out in action , there 's both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a go . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Setup <p> Once you install the plugin into your WooCommerce shop , a new menu will be added under WooCommerce &gt; Abandoned Cart . This is where you 'll configure all options , as well as set up and track your emails . You can also enter your license key for updates under the " Abandoned Cart License Management " menu . <p> The first thing to do is to go to the " Settings " tab . You can enable notifications here , and set a time after which a cart is considered " abandoned " . For example , you may not want to set this as low as one minute , as customers may be reading something on your blog or viewing product reviews elsewhere . Set a time for the abandoned cart cutoff that will most likely indicate that a customer has left . I 'd recommend 1 hour , but as always , test , test , test what 's best for you . <p> Admin Settings <p> You can also determine how long to keep data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So how will this work ? Any time a logged-in user adds items to the cart , even if they do n't  reach the checkout page , their session will be tracked for cart abandonment . Guest users will only be tracked if they get to the point of entering an email on the checkout page , as per the plugin documentation : <p> A record is created for logged-in users even if they do not reach the checkout page . However , for guest users , a record is created only if they reach the checkout page and enter their email address . <p> Once you 've got your settings configured , you 'll want to set up your emails under the " Email Templates " tab . You can add an unlimited number of recovery emails , and send each after a certain amount of time . This will be added onto the time after the cart has been considered " abandoned " ( which is configured under settings ) . <p> For example , if a cart is considered abandoned after 1 hour , and my email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , customers will get an email 2 hours after leaving your site . This will allow you to " drip " out recovery emails , as you can set up multiple emails in time slots after the cart has been left . <p> Set the name of the template for your reference , as well as the from and reply to email addresses . <p> Creating email templates <p> For now , you 'll need to set up all email templates on your own . However , pre-made templates are coming in a future release of the plugin to get you started . <p> When you draft the content of the email , you 'll probably find the merge tags extremely helpful ( as I did ) . These will allow you to dynamically insert content into your emails to recover WooCommerce abandoned carts . I inserted information such as the customer name and a checkout link . The checkout link will take customers directly to the checkout for their saved cart to complete and recover the purchase . This provides a smooth , easy experience to finish the order . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd recommend using the checkout.link merge tag as part of a " Click here " link rather than leaving is as a plain string . This will make it easier for customers to return to their carts , as they can simply click the link to complete the purchase rather than copying it and pasting it into the browser . The checkout and cart link merge tags will both work as the URL for the link . <p> Finally , once you 've drafted your content , you can configure the email settings . Activate the email , set the time after the cart is abandoned to send the email , and optionally add any coupons youd like to insert into this email for customers to use . This will correspond to the coupon.code merge tag for that email . <p> Email settings <p> As we mentioned above , shipping costs are one of the leading causes for cart abandonment , so Ill offer a coupon that grants free shipping to my customers to incentivize them to complete the purchase . You may not want to do this as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its a strategy to keep in mind to overcome the most significant hurdle to purchasing that customers encounter . <p> You can continue adding emails as needed to create a sequence of emails that are sent to customers to recover the abandoned purchase . If you send more than one abandoned cart email , it may be a good idea to include the " Unsubscribe " link from the merge tag list so that customers are n't  sent any further recovery emails if they do n't  want them . <p> All emails <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Customer Experience <p> Now that my emails are set up , let 's take a look at what my customers will see . When a customer visits my store and logs into an account to begin shopping , their session is tracked . If they add items to the cart without purchasing , theyll be sent the recovery emails , regardless of whether they 've visited the cart or checkout pages . <p> If a guest user adds items to the cart , theyll only be tracked if they enter an email on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a setting to enable or disable guest user abandoned cart recovery emails , but its still pretty neat that they can be tracked if an email is entered . <p> Any customer , once they 're part of the WooCommerce abandoned cart cycle , will receive your emails based on the schedule you 've set . here 's a sample of my first email , and notice that my merge tags have been replaced with the corresponding values : <p> Sample Email <p> Also note that customers are provided with a coupon and a link to complete the purchase , which makes this process as seamless as possible to bring customers back into your purchasing funnel . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Tracking <p> One of the best parts of WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro is the ability to track sent emails and whether or not they resulted in a recovered cart . You can view all abandoned cart emails under the " Sent Emails " tab . <p> Sent Emails <p> This tab will let you track which emails resulted in abandoned versus recovered orders to get an idea of which email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also click to view the WooCommerce order for recovered orders , or the Abandoned order details for orders that havent been recovered . <p> You can view which carts are still abandoned under the " Abandoned Orders " tab . This part is really cool , as you can see if customers have created another order since abandoning the cart , as well as any coupons they tried to use before abandoning the order . This gives you insight into whether the coupon has anything to do with the customer leaving ( for example , if they tried to use an invalid coupon and gave up ) . <p> Abandoned orders list <p> You can also view more details about abandoned orders from this screen by clicking on an Abandoned Order number . This will show you all of the items in the customers cart at the time they left it , as well as any details within their account ( or any information entered at checkout for guest users ) . <p> An Abandoned Order <p> This can be used for your internal analytics , as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing or offer coupons for these products to improve conversion rates . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Recovered Orders <p> You can also track recovered orders from the " Recovered Orders " tab . You 'll see a list of all orders that have converted , as well as a link for more details . <p> Recovered carts <p> Youll be able to view recovered orders up to one year old using the date range picker : <p> I really loved the ability to see which abandoned orders were recovered at a glance . You 'll get an overview of the total number of orders that were abandoned , as well as those that were subsequently recovered . You can also view the total cost of abandoned and recovered orders . I liked that I got a quick view of the direct impact of the plugin and WooCommerce abandoned cart emails on sales . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Support <p> While the plugin was really easy to set up , there 's documentation available to help you get up and running if needed . I did n't  use this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity and liked the video quick start guide . <p> Each plugin purchase includes updates and support for one year , and support can be access via forums or email ticket . I did n't  need to access support for the plugin since it worked as expected , but the forum responses are active and questions are answered . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Other Comments <p> While being able to view which items are in abandoned orders is fantastic , I 'd love to see some aggregated reporting on this in the future . A list of most frequently abandoned items under the WooCommerce Reports would be a fantastic tool for shop admins to analyze whether certain products are more frequently abandoned in purchases compared to others . While I 'd expect the most popular products to be abandoned most frequently , it would be useful to compare top abandoned products to the top sellers list . This could also display the number of recovered orders for a product to see if some orders with a particular product are recovered more frequently or are never recovered , indicating that product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which emails best convert into recovered carts would also be very useful , as I could then note which emails can be improved and compare them to high converters . Seeing this under the " Sent emails " list is handy , but there 's no easy way to see this information at once something like a " Percent recovery " stat in the emails list would be superb . <p> I know that a few pre-made email templates are up next in terms of features , which I 'm excited to see , but either built-in reporting or an add-on would make this already useful plugin a great recovery and analytics tool . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Conclusions <p> I expected the plugin to require more setup than it did , so I was pleasantly surprised when I just had to configure a handful of settings and set up emails , then I was up and running . The ability to insert merge tags and offer coupons within recovery emails is very handy , and can be used to help you overcome the most common barriers to purchasing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see which templates converted , and view all recovered sales in terms of orders numbers and total value is very useful , and its motivating to see sales that youd probably otherwise lose . <p> I would have loved to see more aggregated reporting , but the plugin functions very well as is and provides valuable insight into your conversion funnel . WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro is a great tool for increasing any shops conversions and recovering abandoned orders . <p> Note : This post . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Thanks for the time it took you to write this review . Ive been looking for an " abandon cart " plugin , and have been overwhelmed . here 's a question about the process for the customer , to make it as few clicks as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can follow up on the customer : <p> Is there a way to have the shopper enter an email address only , and then they are automatically " logged in " to WordPress ? <p> Hey Pam , glad its helpful ! Since the recover link is sent to the users email , the plugin can log the user in automatically when they click the link so that they can complete the purchase immediately . They actually do n't  have to manually log in to recover the cart . 
@@98138218 @2338218/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> Most people do n't  know much ( or care much ) about DNS hosting services , since many times , DNS hosting service is provided by your domain name registrar . However , we 'd like to point out some issues that may make you consider changing your DNS hosting and using your DNS hosting from your name registrar solely as a backup . <h> What is a DNS Hosting Service ? <p> When you register your domain name , the company that handles registration simply submits the information necessary to establish your ownership of that domain name . However , the information that ties you and your ownership to the actual domain name , as well as to where ( which servers ) that domain name points , must be housed somewhere . That 's what DNS hosting services are about : storing the information tied to your domain name . This way , when someone types your domain name into an address box in their browser , their browser has a server it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should look at to find your site . <h> Why should I use a service other than what 's provided by my name registrar ? <p> Many people do n't  really understand this process or do n't  like having to search out multiple companies to provide a solution for this problem when many domain registration companies provide this service for free . However , there are a couple reasons that you should look into dedicated DNS hosting services . <p> First , security for your domain name information is paramount ; if your domain name is hijacked , its super difficult to repossess and negates all of the time you 've built into branding your website and familiarizing customers with your internet address . <p> In addition , if your DNS hosting is down , customers wont be able to find your website , regardless of whether everything is working on your site or not ; their browser wont be able to find out which IP address it should visit to find your site . Its like not listing a company in the phone book ( circa 1950 ) : even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly , and has an address , customers wont be able to find which address to visit to find you . <p> Now imagine if you 're using paid advertising you could be spending thousands of dollars driving traffic to your site , and if your DNS server crashes , the down time just cost you all of the money you spent driving people to your site , all the money you could have potentially made form those customers , plus the fact that those customers are unlikely to return , all because their computer simply could n't find your site . Maximizing uptime starts to make a lot more sense in this case , as the potential costs of downtime are pretty huge . <p> Good DNS hosting can also improve the load time for your site , as it cuts down the time spent for a customers computer to look up your IP address and display your website . Good companies usually achieve this by having multiple servers all over the world ( " geographically dispersed " servers ) that store the IP address tied to your domain name so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Recommended DNS Hosting Services <p> While I love Namecheap as a domain name registrar , I 'd only use their DNS hosting as a backup , and use DNS made easy for DNS hosting services since they have an awesome track record when it comes to uptime and are reasonably priced . If you want to use an all-in-one solution , I might go with DNSimple instead , as they have quality DNS hosting , but will charge for more services . CloudFlare is a popular service , and offers some free and premium plans ( including some spam protection , but it can be a bit aggressive ) . However , I 'd recommend disabling caching with them so that website changes show up immediately ( the caching can be a bit of an annoyance ) . <p> Others I know of but havent tried : ClouDNS provides limited free services and premium services with servers located globally ; PointDNS is a solid service with servers located throughout the US and UK ; and Easy DNS provide solid hosting and name registration services . Finally , Amazon offers DNS hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more involved , so I would recommend having a developer do it for you if you 're not experienced in site setup . <p> Have a different service you 'd recommend , or love one of the ones Ive referenced ? Let everyone else know in the comments ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138219 @2338219/ <h> Getting a Detailed Look at Your Customers : Users Insights Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> As giant retailers like Amazon or established brands like Macys have grown to dominate eCommerce sales , small retailers can have a tough time determining how to carve out a unique selling proposition in the eCommerce arena . For many independent merchants , competing on price with titans like Amazon or Walmart is almost impossible , so many turn to dominating a specific niche ( like Tattly for temporary tattoos ) , or building a reputation for fantastic customer support ( as Zappos did before being acquired ) . <p> As competition grows among eCommerce stores , many merchants realize they need provide great customer service on top of quality or speciality products to be able to charge enough to be profitable . Since quality customer service has become non-negotiable , using tools to manage the customer service process can help merchants deliver on service as well as product quality . <p> Using a Customer Relationship Management ( CRM ) tool can help you track information about your users and personalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only can you add notes or specific information about users , but you can also analyze user data for improved support and communication . <p> Well take a look at the Users Insights plugin ( $99+ ) today , which can help WordPress eCommerce merchants improve their customer service and communication . <h> Users Insights Review : Plugin Overview <p> Users Insights is a CRM tool that fits right into your WordPress dashboard to let you analyze user data on your eCommerce site . You can search user data and filter it based on several criteria to get insights into customer and user behavior . <p> You can select almost any user data or choose certain purchasing behaviors to filter your customer lists , letting you track behavior internally to provide better customer service , or export customers to CSV based on the data you 've selected to segment customers for email lists . <p> One of the best features about Users Insights is that it works seamlessly with tons of popular platforms so that you can access data from WooCommerce , Easy Digital Downloads , or other plugins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at specific strategies you can use to both track customers and segment or personalize communication , then take a detailed look at how Users Insights can work with your eCommerce platform to analyze valuable customer data . <h> Users Insights Review : General Usage <p> The major features of Users Insights center around the customer list that you 'll find under the " Users Insights " menu when the plugin is activated . From this list , you can manage your users , add data or notes to a customer , filter your users lists by several criteria , or export your customers to CSV ( even a filtered view of customers ) . <p> You can filter on WordPress core data for your users , such as the date the user registered an account . This could help you , for example , to send " birthday " -type emails , such as " thanks for registering a year ago ! " with a coupon at the beginning of each month . <p> Filter by Registration Date <p> You 'll also be able to filter by eCommerce fields , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has purchased a membership or subscription product , who has purchased a product that 's since been recalled , or generate a list of customers to email about a particular purchase . <p> Filter by Purchased Products <p> If you have multiple conditions you want to search your users for , you can apply multiple filters at the same time . This can let you search by order count and product purchase simultaneously ; search by total spent and user role ; or combine any other data to get a drilled-down list of customers that meet these criteria . <p> Use Multiple Filters <p> Once you have the list of customers you want , you can export this list to CSV . The CSV file will include the fields you have visible at the time ( which can be adjusted with the " eye " icon ) . This can let you export a pared-down list of name , email , and a couple helpful fields to generate a mailing list for your email software of choice , or put together a detailed export for marketing campaigns or shipping sample products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ways you can segment your customer communication , as you can build email lists that center around your Users Insights filters to target specific customers . You can also personalize emails by using your Users Insights data as fields in your emails ( such as merge tags in MailChimp emails ) . For example , if you add " Total Spent " to exports , you could then import this data into MailChimp as a subscriber field , and use a merge tag to include it in email content . <h> Customer Information <p> If you want to see information about a specific customer , you can click the customers username to get an overview of the customers details . <p> This will show you customer data , customer activity , and let you add customer notes for internal tracking . If you have geolocation enabled , you can also see this customers location in the customer details . <h> Geolocation <p> Speaking of geolocation , you can get information on where your customers are coming from . Aside from seeing the customer location information the profile page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , city , and region ( state / province ) . <p> One of my favorite things , however , is the " heatmap " of customer locations . You can view this by clicking the " globe " icon on the right above your users table . <p> This tells you where your customers are coming from , along with a count for each region . You can drill down into regions to see where customers come from in more detail . This can be an excellent tool for targeting trade shows , partnerships with retailers , or possible brick-and-mortar locations based on where your customers are located . <p> You can even see a heatmap for a filtered view , so you can target locations of only your top customers . <h> Users Insights Review : Example Filters <p> As filters are the most powerful tool in Users Insights , let 's take a look at a couple filters you can use to segment your customers . <p> Get a List of Product Reviewers For most eCommerce plugins , WordPress comments are used to add product reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter to let us find customers who have frequently reviewed products . As these customers have shown that they 're willing to write reviews , they 're great customers to target with sample products or new catalog additions to get those initial reviews for your products . <p> You can filter based on the number of comments a customer has had to get customers who have frequently engaged on your site . I 'd also recommend that you filter for your " customer " role , as your site admins or shop manager most likely have a lot of comments , too = <p> Filter by Comments <p> While this may have some blog comments mixed in with product reviews , its a pretty good starting point for our list of avid reviewers . If you wanted to pare this list down further , you could view the customer data for each person on this list to see how many of those comments are on products vs other content types . <p> Get a List of Inactive Customers Users Insights has some tips on finding your inactive users in their resources , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has n't  purchased in a given time period . You can filter your customer list by the last order date so that you have a list of customers whose last purchase was before a cut-off date . <p> You could then email these customer to re-engage them or inform them about new products or sales they may be interested in . <p> Get a List of Failed Payments Sometimes payments fail , and customers may not always be aware of the failure , depending on which payment method was used , or they may not have been paying close attention . You could email the customers who have failed orders each month to try to recover these orders over time . <p> A filter based on order status will let you export a list of customers who have at least one failed order . <h> Users Insights Review : Adding Customer Data <p> While we mentioned previously that geolocation can be enabled and this is a useful piece of data for your customers , its not the only piece of additional data you can add to your customer records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the ability to create user groups for your customers . This can let you categorize your users , such as grouping together VIPs or loyal customers . You can use a color indicator for the group , which can be displayed in your users list for quick reference . <p> Manage User Groups <p> You can also create custom user fields to add additional data to customer records . This data can be completed by your team during customer service interactions , and this data can then be included in your user exports , making custom fields a great tool for email personalization . <p> User Custom Fields <p> Groups and custom fields can easily be edited while viewing a customers information . <h> Users Insights Review : WooCommerce Insights <p> You can activate the WooCommerce Module under " Users Insights &gt; Module Options " to seamlessly connect Users Insights to WooCommerce . This let 's you add eCommerce fields into your Users Insights filters , making it easier to segment customers based on purchase behavior . <p> When this module is active , you 'll see a few new filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of orders theyve placed <p> Last Order Filter customers based on the date of their last order <p> Ordered Products Filter customers based on whether or not they 've purchased a particular product <p> Orders status Filter customers based on whether or not they have an order with a given status <p> However , there 's one field I think is missing there that I 'd love to use with WooCommerce : lifetime value ( although I hear this is coming soon ! ) . Until this is available in the plugin , you can add the amount of money spent in total by a customer fairly easily using a custom field . Add a field with the key moneyspent to add this to your filtering options . <p> Add Customer Spend Total <p> This will now let you filter by the total amount spent by a customer , making it easy to get a list of your VIPs or most valuable customers over time . <p> Filter by Total Spent <h> Users Insights Review : Easy Digital Downloads Insights <p> Easy Digital Downloads can easily connect Users Insights to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this module is active , the Easy Digital Downloads filtering options will be available : <p> EDD Orders Filter customers based on the number of orders theyve placed <p> EDD Lifetime Value Filter customers based on the total amount spent with your store <p> EDD Last Order Date Filter customers based on the date of their last order <p> EDD Ordered Products Filter customers based on whether or not they 've purchased a particular product <p> EDD Orders Status Filter customers based on whether or not they have an order with a given status <p> The built-in support for lifetime value is a great tool to target your best customers . <p> Filter by Total Spend <h> Users Insights Review : Gravity Forms Insights <p> When Gravity Forms is active on your site , you can leverage a couple new filtering options by enabling the Gravity Forms module . This let 's you filter based on whether or not a user has completed a form . <p> This is helpful to see if surveys or feedback forms have been submitted by certain customers . <p> However , Users Insights is most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gravity Forms professional license holders ) . User fields that are part of your registration forms will automatically be added to the Users Insights custom fields and filters , letting you filter your users based on the responses theyve submitted . <p> This is great if you register wholesale customers , members , or other site users via Gravity Forms User Registration . Any fields you 've added to this form can be included in customer data without additional effort , letting you get tons of personalization data with every sign up . <h> Users Insights Review : Support &amp; Documentation <p> Every Users Insights purchase ( $99+ ) includes a year of updates and support , so you can get support via email for any questions or issues . <p> I also found the resources on the Users Insights site helpful for questions and new ideas . The features list answers a lot of general questions about how the plugin , filters , and integration modules work . <p> For more advanced usages or specific questions , the answers collection has several example set ups that walk you through how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insights as a CRM for WordPress eCommerce Stores <p> Users Insights ( $99+ ) provides a helpful tool for WordPress sites and eCommerce stores specifically to get data on customers and to export customers for improved communication via segmentation and personalization . Using the built-in eCommerce integrations , you can filter customers in several different ways to get accurate lists of customers : <p> Get lists of customers who have purchased a particular product , as these customers can be notified of recalls , launches for similar products , or solicited for product feedback <p> Get a list of VIP customers whove spent a certain amount of money with you to potentially send thank you cards or gifts <p> Use geolocation to see where your VIP customers are location , or to get a feel for where your customers come from overall <p> Get a list of avid reviewers who have left multiple product reviews and solicit reviews for your newest products with samples or gifts <p> Get a list of inactive customers who have not purchased with your store yet this year to win them back ( perhaps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage the " notes " tool to ensure that your customer service team tracks data on refunds or customer interactions . This helps you improve customer service alongside of customer communication . <p> I would have loved to see the ability to take bulk actions while viewing users , such as the ability to add all users to a group . This would be especially useful for filtered views for example , to add everyone with a total spend above $500 to a " VIP " group . <p> The only downside to bear in mind is that the data you 're viewing or exporting is only for registered users , so guest customer data will not be tracked . While most of the time you 're managing registered customers , this may not give you complete lists for some views or filters , such as lists based on product purchases ( as guest orders are not considered ) . <p> Overall , the Users Insights plugin is dead-simple to use , and the filters , user groups , and custom fields give you lots of handy tools for customer management to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This post see our editorial policy . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> AutomateWoo could let you run workflows on customer tags , but I 'm not sure if their tags system would integrate or pick up the tags from Users Insights . <p> As Users Insights also does n't  have any " actions " to hook into , your AutomateWoo emails would still be triggered by the Woo actions ( like placing an order ) , but perhaps the User Insights tags could be used / added via AutomateWoo . Would be worth reaching out to Dan at AutomateWoo to see if any workflow data could be synced.

The beta announcement details most of the major changes to the plugin , but here are some details and screenshots of the changes . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 Review : What 's Gone <p> First thing that 's gone : load times for customer queries . A new database layer for queries on customer information has significantly improved performance on customer reporting for shops with large numbers of customers . <p> Performance issues with unique hosting environments and server / plugin caching have also been minimized . In previous versions of EDD , customers occasionally experienced issues with the plugins add-to-cart behavior due to the sessions API that was used to track cart information . The plugin now detects some information about the server environment to determine when to enable the session management API . <p> The cart widget is also gone but only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart widget when the customer is on the checkout screen , as its no longer needed at that point and provides an unnecessary distraction for the customer . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 Review : What 's Changed <p> Most of what 's changed is described above in terms of performance enhancements , but there are a few cool user-facing changes and additions to Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 . <p> Variable products have gotten a little bit of love in this release . In previous versions of EDD , shop admins had to create variations in the order in which they should be displayed . If you needed to come back later and add a new variation , it would always be displayed last unless you deleted and re-added your variations ( which has the potential to mess with your reporting ) . <p> In version 2.1 , users can now drag and drop product variations into the display order they choose : <p> EDD 2.0 Variations <p> EDD 2.1 variations <p> Reporting has also gotten some upgrades .

Custom earnings reports will now allow you to set the day , month , and year for your reports so that they 're truly custom reporting ranges . <p> Before : <p> EDD 2.0 Custom Earnings Report <p> After : <p> EDD 2.1 Custom Earnings Report <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 Review : What 's New <p> In previous versions of Easy Digital Downloads , emails couldnt be customized easily without the email template packs , and plugins could n't hook into the EDD emails to make sure they were consistent . Version 2.1 adds an email class that makes email changes easier for both plugins to hook into and designers to change . <p> EDD 2.0 Emails <p> EDD 2.1 Emails <p> Users can add a logo for their emails , but can now access the email templates in /templates/emails and override them within their themes . To override an email template , create a folder called eddtemplates in your child theme , then add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy any email template in and edit it to change it . This will let users tweak email templates to customize colors and add styling of their own . <p> Email Preview <p> EDD lead developer Pippin Williamson posted a bit more insight for developers on the email templates system , but this is a fairly significant change that will make EDD emails far easier to use and work with . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 Review : Conclusions <p> The significant performance enhancements in Easy Digital Downloads 2.1 are really welcome changes and help to lay the groundwork for some even bigger changes . <p> The improvements to queries regarding customers will eventually lead to some far improved customer reporting . Now that its easier and faster to pull details on customers out of Easy Digital Downloads , this change has opened up the ability to generate more detailed reports on customer lifetime value , most / least valuable customers , and customer base growth and value over time . <p> While these changes wont be available in this version , the groundwork has been laid to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic reporting will be added , and there 's a lot of room for plugins to do some detailed customer analytics on your EDD customer base . <p> The changes to email templates have made emails more flexible for both developers and users . Now that plugins can hook into the templates for these emails , any emails generated by EDD plugins could use this template system to remain consistent with the other emails from your store . The ability to override templates also makes it easier for business to keep their automated receipt emails consistent with other emails sent , such as newsletters sent via MailChimp . <p> Even though many of these changes are not user-facing , they 're still very significant and will impact both the core plugin and extension development in the future , helping Easy Digital Downloads to mature quickly as a platform . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138221 @2338221/ <p> This series covers creating membership sites using plugins or eCommerce Platforms . <p> Wondering how you can tie together memberships and WordPress ? How to choose the best WordPress membership plugin for your business ? There are a lot of solid options out there . Well give you a brief overview of general plugins that work with most sites / platforms and how each relates to the checklist that we gave you in our introduction to membership sites . One thing worth noting is that our checklist asks if customers can suspend their subscriptions , and none of the general plugins we researched allow this , so you wo n't see it listed below ( though check out this comment , which brings up great points about whether this is necessary ) . A later article will tackle WooCommerce Subscriptions , which does have this functionality if its required for you . We 've also got a spreadsheet that summarizes our comparison for you tl ; dr readers at the end . <p> Worth noting before we discuss each WordPress membership plugin is that you can protect sharing of login @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only allows one user per set of credentials at a given time . While this could still allow non-simultaneous sharing of login information , it takes a step in the right direction that deters sharing membership credentials ( read more here ) and probably takes care of most issues anyway . For most plugins , you can also change what 's restricted ( posts , categories , tags , etc ) with some custom code , but well include what comes with the basic plugin . <h> General WordPress Membership Plugins <p> If you 've started your research already , I hope you 've come across Paid Memberships Pro , as it has become one of the more popular membership plugins ( with good reason ) . First , its completely free to use on as many sites as you want ( support , documentation , and installation are paid-for services instead ) . <p> For those of you that are budget-conscious , PMPro will probably be a very attractive option , and even if you 're not on a budget , the ease in downloading it and trying it out should make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase support , pricing is comparable to other options , but its very easy to set-up and use . For a plugin that will be integral to your site structure , this is important . Want to see some screenshots instead ? Head over to the PMPro website to check them out . There are also some add-ons for services like MailChimp and AWeber you may be interested in . Support , documentation , forum access , and premium content costs $97 for 1 year , or you can get a " do it for me " membership that includes set-up and consultation for $497 ( also includes a 1 year membership ) . <p> Content Dripping : Content dripping is not included . However , you can drip content by downloading the PMP Series add-on via GitHub ( get details here ) . This allows you to create post " series " and set the delay in days between each . <p> Restrict Logins : You can only achieve this with WP Bouncer ( from the same developer ) . <p> Ease of Use : PMPro scores high here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is possible to build-on or customize in the future if your needs change . The backend looks like native WordPress and is easy to figure out . <p> One of the best all-around platforms for WordPress memberships is MemberMouse . MemberMouse tokenizes customers card information to provide for the ability to upgrade/downgrade memberships seamlessly , and allows customers to store payment information in their accounts . One of the really cool features is that it automatically provides for upsells or downsells for customers who want to cancel their memberships in order to maximize revenue . <p> MemberMouse also provides unique URLs to force add products to the cart for your email / PPC marketing . However , you 're paying more than other plugins to get these features , so you 'll have to evaluate what you need and what your budget allows for . Detailed reporting and analytics are included for their enterprise level plans as well . Pricing starts at $20 per month for up to 1,000 members and increases in tiers up to $60 per month for 10,000 members ( enterprise plans are also available ) . MemberMouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other services , and is developer-friendly for tweaks or customization . <p> One of the most robust options you can choose as a WordPress membership plugin is MemberPress . Content dripping with MemberPress is well thought-out and executed , and you can add content to " groups " to make upsells easier . MemberPress can also integrate with MailChimp and AWeber , and includes the ability to create custom pricing pages for your membership levels . Fees for upgrades/downgrades can also be prorated , which is really difficult functionality to find ( I think WooCommerce Subscriptions is the only other plugin that can do this ) . <p> MemberPress also allows for the purchase of multiple memberships if you 're using a topic-oriented approach . Reporting is built-in to the plugin , and customization/tweaks are very possible . Their site has a full tour of features and possibilities . The plugin is $99 , which includes a year of support and updates . Renewals for updates and support are $99 each subsequent year if you need them . <p> Membership Levels : Create an unlimited number of membership levels , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Billing is flexible and done within the plugin , and also supports prorating fees . You can use free trials , sign up fees , different billing cycles , and discount codes . It also includes Stripe support . <p> Restrict Content Pro is another very extensible and developer-friendly membership solution available . Well have some more info on Restrict Content Pro in our article on setting up a membership site with Easy Digital Downloads , but will cover some basic points here . The plugin itself is $42 ( includes support ) , but there are a lot of add-ons available , including one for Stripe at $20 ( PayPal is the included gateway ) . This would be an option for those of you that do n't  require content dripping , but want to very easily restrict your pages , posts , and custom post types . Reporting is also useful and built-in to the basic plugin . You can set expiration dates for memberships rather than time periods ( non-automatic renewals ) to offer more flexibility for members as well . <p> One of the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single site license is $97 , which includes a year of updates and support . You can renew your support and upgrades for $47 for each subsequent year if you need them . Wishlist Member integrates with several auto-responders ( including MailChimp and AWeber ) and payment processors , but does n't  include full support or add-ons for Stripe , which is a big downside for us . Set up is quick and pretty easy , and Wishlist Member is among the easier platforms to use . However , it loses some points with us since it is n't particularly extensible or customizable ( you cant view/edit the code ) , so you wont be able to do anything outside of what the basic plugin allows . It also has some issues scaling , which are detailed here ( which is why its banned by Pressable ) . <p> Membership Levels : You can create an unlimited number of membership levels , each with unique pricing and content restriction rules . <p> Billing : Billing is handled by the plugin , and includes free trials , sign up fees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this for members , but its not possible for members to do . Upgrades can be set as a " path " for content dripping . <p> Content Dripping : Handled a bit awkwardly . You can move members among a membership path ( upgrade them for more access ) , but this wo n't stop people from purchasing your highest membership level , downloading all content , and leaving . <p> Restrict Logins : Can be restricted based on IP address to prevent sharing credentials . <p> Ease of Use : Wishlist Member is fairly easy to install and pick up , but is not possible to customize or scale up for larger sites . <p> Another WordPress membership plugin that 's been around for some time is s2Member . There 's a free version of s2Member on WordPress.org ( s2Member framework ) , but well take a look at s2Member Pro in order to provide a better comparison ( you can check out some comparison of free vs pro on s2Members site ) . S2Member is a one-off purchase at $69 , which includes support and upgrades . Support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for PayPal , Authorize.net , and other processors . However , s2Member does n't  support Stripe , which is our most favoritest payment gateway in the world . It includes some cool features , like limiting logins to a certain number of IP addresses , but is n't quite as easy as some other plugins to use . However , you can build on top of the base plugin to customize it if needed . <p> Another easy-to-use WordPress membership plugin is Magic Members . Content dripping is really well done , and integrations with MailChimp and AWeber are included . If you take a look at the article list below , you 'll see that it has some major fans for the ease of use and content dripping . The purchase price is $97 and includes one year of support and updates . Several payment integrations are included , but Magic Members does n't  support Stripe . Its got a clean , easy-to-use UI , but the admin is entirely different from the standard WordPress backend ( not good/bad , just different ) . However , extensibility may be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Membership Levels : Create an unlimited number of membership levels , each with unique pricing and content restriction rules . <p> Billing : Billing is done within the plugin , and includes free trials , sign up fees , and discounts . <p> Upgrade/Downgrade Membership : Not included . <p> Content Dripping : Very easy and can be set based on post , including different delays for different membership levels . <p> Restrict Logins : You can only achieve this with WP Bouncer . <p> Ease of Use : The UI is different than the WordPress backend , but easy to figure out . However , extensibility is n't great at the moment . <p> # If you want the selection process simplified , I 'd check out this article on choosing a membership plugin for WordPress . Keep in mind that these are suggestions from Chris Lema based on his experiences with using each plugin , but I think the recommendations are pretty solid and its definitely a great starting point for your search . There 's a full version of the flowchart in the article here . I also have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you visual people = ( let me know if you spot something in need of update please ! ) . <p> Disclosure : I have n't used all of these plugins myself , so in some cases I 'm working from talking to other users or other reviews . The most important thing is for you to try out a plugin that seems like it fits your needs and test it before building out the entire site ! <p> Instead of going through each of these plugins in more detail , I 'll leave you with that summary , and encourage you to check out the articles below instead . I do n't  think I need to reinvent the wheel for this one , as many of the posts below cover these solutions better and in more detail than I could . Instead of restating what theyve said , the former high school teacher in me would rather send you to the original source : ) . That way I 'm not paraphrasing like a book report and these authors get the credit they deserve for writing some quality content . <p> You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some people far more knowledgeable than I out there on the interwebs in addition to what Ive collected here , so if you do , please send it over or post it in a comment so that we can add to this list of resources !

It shows the main topics that people look for , on the surface , that will allow them to succeed with a membership site . <p> The issue I see here is that it is infact on the surface . Once one gets into may of these other programs , they find that they are stuck in a program they are n't  able to work well with . Code is messy , options are few , and it leads to a lot of frustration on the part of the members , and decreased value in their eyes . <p> I originally had Wishlist Member . I warn you- avoid this plugin at all costs . It does NOT do a great job of all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will just mean support headaches for your company . <p> Thanks Chris ! Agreed that being stuck is a big problem , as migrations can be tricky and time-consuming . Good advice testing if possible is always the best route . Spending some money on a plugin you wont use is better than being stuck with something that does n't  work for you . <p> Hey , take a look at : https : **35;1943;TOOLONG Its a connector I made that easily integrates Stripe payments into S2 member . I made this for a client , and then port it to a plugin . I cant understand why has n't  anyone do it before ! 
@@98138222 @2338222/ <h> Partner <p> After 8 years of development , the plugin is one of the most mature platforms available , but adoption has waned . The development team is revamping several parts of the core plugin with the version 3.8.14 and upcoming 3.9 release . Well have a detailed review of these releases for you at the 3.9 launch , including some details on the new theme engine , payment gateway API , and the in-app marketplace that will make it easier to find quality add-ons . <p> There are some really big changes coming to the ecosystem and marketplace as well , and I was fortunate enough to chat with the founder and lead developer for WPeC , Dan Milward and Justin Sainton ( respectively ) , to discuss some of these changes . <h> What 's Changing at Instinct ? <p> With the upcoming release of WP eCommerce 3.9 , drastic changes will be made made to GetShopped.org and Instinct Entertainment ( the company behind WPeC and GetShopped ) . Previously , Instinct was owned by Dan Milward , the founder of WP eCommerce . With the WPeC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Justin Sainton , who has been helping to lead development for the past few years . <p> The goal behind the official partnership is to accelerate releases and innovate for the growth of the platform . This will also simplify things for users , as extensions , development , and support efforts will no longer be fragmented . Putting one entity behind all things WP e-Commerce gives users one company to turn to for purchases , support , and information . <p> Justin is excited for the changes to the platform and ecosystem after having worked on WPeC for the past four years . " I 'm incredibly excited to be coming on as a partner with Dan at Instinct , " he said . " Having worked closely with himweve already learned our core competencies , our strengths and weaknesses , and how to work well together . " <p> Will this merger lead to a change in productivity and development ? Absolutely : " Beyond the partnership , Dan is a man I consider a close and dear friend and I think were going to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued separately , " Justin said . He s confident that officially merging their efforts will be far better in the long term for WPeC rather than continuing in the loose teamwork that previously drove the platform forward . <p> As for Dans perspective on how this brings the platform forward , he says , its " a much needed quantum leap ! " <p> Why the decision to merge now ? Dan says : <p> Over the past two years I tried to accelerate WPEC growth and stay competitive but it just did n't  really work out for us I just could n't seem to lobby the right people to get the job done ! Do n't  get me wrong , its not like we 've been resting on our laurels ; our support team and processes are now just as good as our competitors and the upcoming 3.9 release is solid BUT it was not a time of technology growth or innovation and thus we lost our edge . <p> As a result of that lull in innovation , WPEC lost popularity . Dans confident that partnering with Justin will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board means solid WordPress coding standards , a faster turn around of quality code , and getting a worthy update out the door , " according to Dan . " And hey , I 'm not getting any younger either . I got to a point in my life where I wanted a partner , somebody to share the workload of running an open source project with . I look at other companies in the WordPress space that I admire ( i.e. , WebDevStudios ) and I see not just kick-ass development teams but kick-ass founder teams , which is n't something that you can buy . " <h> How Does the Merger Change the Ecosystem ? <p> Ideally , this merger will change the WPeC marketplace and ecosystem with revitalized development and growth . Both Dan and Justin think it will be incredibly positive for the WPeC community . " It puts us back in the game , " Dan says . " Ive been sitting quietly and waiting patiently for WPEC to be worthy of my praise and it almost is when that day comes well be loud and proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For several years now , I 've been a lead developer for the WP eCommerce plugin without being a part of the company responsible for it . I think , in some ways , that has had some negative impact . Its so important for open source projects like ours to have consistent , reliable , visible leadership within our communities . Because of the nature of our relationship prior to this , I would have seasons of incredibly active , visible input to the community and then I 'd have to get back to projects that paid the bills . This partnership will allow us to be in a position where that no longer has to be the case . <p> The partnership will result in sharing the responsibility of platform growth and bring Justin into the fold officially , unifying the vision for platform growth and development under one roof . It also provides Justin the foundation necessary to invest more time into the plugins development and ensures that Dan can depend on Justins contributions since he now has responsibility and ownership for the platform . <h> What Happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to be spent on core plugin development now that development is all under one roof . " If the 3.8.14 and 3.9 releases are any indication , well see core development continue at a phenomenal pace , " he said . He continued : <p> As we continue to evolve as a platform , my role as a lead developer will likely evolve as well . The direction I see it evolving in will be to eventually ( perhaps in a year or two ) have several other lead developers as part of the lead developer team . I do n't  see any open source project succeeding in the long-term when it rests on the shoulders of one primary individual . <p> Thankfully , WPeC has several core contributors that could potentially join the team . <p> Dan is confident that Justins ability to consistently put time into WPeC core development will move the platform forward by leaps and bounds . " Justin has made more contributions to WordPress core than any of the developers in any of the other competing plugins ; he is not just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and is a contributor in the truest sense , " Dan said . " His dedication to WordPress , WPEC , and our community puts us on a good solid trajectory going forward . " <h> What Roles Do You Take on Now ? <p> With this partnership being finalized , I was curious as to how the workload would be broken up I asked if each Justin and Dan will be taking on different roles or what responsibilities will be assigned to each . It sounds like some measure of specialization will follow , but each will still be involved in the business development . For Dan , he says hell be " spending most of my time on high level strategy , forging some new partnerships and re-familiarizing myself with the art of war . And of course I intend on getting to as many WordCamps as possible . " <p> Justins role will primarily be as a developer . " That does n't  necessarily mean just code , " he says . There are three primary development areas hell be spending time on : <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , means both the core plugin and other areas like premium plugins , theme frameworks , tools for developers , etc . Ensuring consistency and quality across the entire scope of the products we offer will be a major focus for me . <p> Second , partnerships . Partnership development ( and this is an area Dan continues to excel in as well ) is vital for open source projects like ours . Working with hosting companies , third-party APIs , payment gateway providers , the core WordPress team , theme designers and more managing these relationships and aligning interests so that everyone wins is an often overlooked area of development for open-source projects . Im excited about a lot of really neat partnership opportunities that we have in the pipeline . <p> Finally , and perhaps most important of all , community . Community development and outreach is the lifeblood of our project . If our users , developers , and other community members do n't  feel they have a voice , and do n't  feel they are being fully engaged , we lose the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing without the community behind it . This year , I 'm really looking forward to seeing how we can continue to actively empower our community to be heard and be engaged , so they can have a positive effect on the project moving forward . <p> Overall , these are some really exciting changes for Dan , Justin , and the WP eCommerce plugin team . I 've always felt that the lack of a centralized team behind the project contributed to the lagging growth in comparison to other platforms , as one side was developing the core plugin while the other was handling users , platform growth , and support . The disconnect made it difficult for users to understand where to get help , purchase add-ons , and provide feedback . I 'm really looking forward to how these changes will remedy these issues and drive the plugins evolution . <p> Thanks so much to Dan and Justin for speaking with me , and congratulations on your new partnership ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138223 @2338223/ <h> Customizing WooCommerce Order Numbers <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce is engineered with a simple but effective philosophy : include all the functionality required to create a basic eCommerce shop in a free and extendable plugin , and delegate all other features to free and premium extensions . The full implications and benefits of such a strategy will be discussed in a future article ; while the remainder of this one will delve into its consequences for order numbers and how to customize them to fit your needs with the help of two different plugins . <h> Non-sequential WooCommerce Order Numbers Explained <p> Some new WooCommerce shop administrators are surprised to find that their order numbers are non-sequential by default , for instance the first five orders placed in a new shop may be assigned numbers 5 , 6 , 13 , 14 , 27 . Depending on your particular wants or **30;1980;TOOLONG requirements this behavior could range from being a non-issue , to desirable ( competitors/customers less insight into what your shop order volume is like ) , to mildly inconvenient , to outright unacceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random sequence is simply because a WooCommerce Order record is represented within the database by a WordPress Post and the post i 'd is used as the order i 'd . If you have an active site with new posts/pages being created , or other plugins also creating post records for their own purposes , you 'll wind up with order numbers with these apparent gaps . Thankfully you have a few options , both free and paid , to deal with this . <h> Attaining ( Free ! ) Sequential Order Numbers <p> If all you want or need is to have your order numbers without the aforementioned gaps you can achieve this by simply installing the free WooCommerce Sequential Order Numbers plugin released and maintained by SkyVerge ( an sponsor of Sell with WP ) . This plugin will begin assigning sequential order numbers as soon as its installed and activated ; existing order numbers , even if they contain gaps , will not be altered , both for your existing customers and your accountants sanity . <h> Taking Your Order Numbers to the Next Level <p> If you want complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind that an officially-supported premium WooCommerce plugin provides , the answer is Sequential Order Numbers Pro ( also released by SkyVerge ) . This plugin is fully compatible with the free version and will upgrade existing order numbers when installed . As you might expect the premium version guarantees the same sequential order numbers offered by the free plugin but with a number of significant benefits which , at the time of writing , include : <p> Order numbers can be started from any number . By default in a shop with existing orders the sequential order numbers will pick up from the highest current order number . If desired , order numbers can be started from a number greater than the highest order number . For new shops with no existing orders , the first order number can be whatever you want , even zero . <p> Custom order number length . The premium plugin allows you to set an order number length , which causes zeroes to be added to the front of your custom order numbers to ensure they are a certain length . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 241 will be presented as 00241 . <p> Dynamic order number prefix and suffix . You can add a custom order number prefix or suffix to your order numbers , consisting of letters , numbers , dashes , etc , and even containing the current year , month , day , hour , second or minute when the order was placed . With this feature plus the previous two , order numbers such as SV-1001-20130731 , SV-1002-20130731 , SV-1003-20130801 are a breeze to set up . <p> Free orders can be excluded from the main sequence . Useful in jurisdictions or countries where order or invoice numbers must be sequential for accounting purposes , this option allows you to exclude free orders from the normal order number sequence . Additionally , a free order prefix can be configured , so that an " order " for a sample product that does n't  represent a financial transaction could be something like FREE-10 , leaving your paid order numbers perfectly sequential . <p> Many of the above features were added to the Sequential Order Numbers Pro plugin over time and as requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and options will doubtless be added in the future as the number of WooCommerce-powered shops expands and with it the need for more customized order numbers . <h> Read More <p> Disclosure : The author of this article is a co-founder of SkyVerge , Inc. , who wrote the plugins discussed . <p> Note : Some of our posts contain affiliate links .

The problem is that competitors can check how many orders you have i a given time , simply by cancelling the order in the payment process and atching the orderid parameter in the URL . <p> Hi Bernardo , the order number used is actually separate from the order i 'd , which is the post I 'd . Technically checking order ids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been created in the meantime , not simply how many orders have been created . The order number is not accessible externally . Hopefully that clarifies how these plugins work ! <p> Hey Sjaak , thanks for sharing ! For reference to any readers , this will add a prefix to your order numbers . However , note that this wont be compatible with the free sequential order numbers plugin listed , as it uses its own order number counter rather than the order i 'd ( which is the same as the postid here the non-sequential number ) . <p> Sjaaks method works well . Simply change " PREFIX " with what you want to be in front of your order numbers . Adding a single number here will add that number in front of your order numbers Making it look as if you have had more orders or changing it to a letter to differentiate different web properties . Useful , for sure ! Thank you for sharing , Beka and Sjaak ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138224 @2338224/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> Customer service should never stop at " order completed " in your store . Picture this scenario : <p> You have a great dinner out at a restaurant with good wine , food , and company . Your server keeps the meal appropriately paced without dropping all of your courses at once , and the service is responsive without intruding on your time with friends . <p> Sounds good so far , right ? Now this happens ( which , coincidentally , is one of my biggest pet peeves ) : <p> The tab is on you , so the server brings you the bill . You 're enjoying the conversation and a final glass of wine as you sign your check . As soon as you 're done , the server grabs the bill off of your table before you can finish your drink , wrap up the conversation , or stand up to leave . <p> Ugh . I hate this . It makes me feel like I 'm being rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , or that service does n't  matter anymore once Ive paid . <p> While it may not be as obvious , a lot of eCommerce stores do the same thing . They market to customers , send discounts , helpfully guide the customer through checkout , and then after purchasing , the customer receives a confirmation email and that 's it . No " thanks for purchasing " a couple of weeks later , no additional communication once my order has been placed . <p> Going the extra mile for eCommerce stores means staying in contact with your customers and communicating with them , even after they 've placed an order . <h> Improving Customer Communication <p> One way you can improve customer communication is to send automated emails for order updates or shop events to keep your customers in the loop about what 's happening with their orders . This also helps to make them feel like they 're getting attention from your store both before and after the shopping experience rather than being dismissed once theyve bought something . <p> Most plugins will only send purchase confirmations out of the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will let you set up your own automatic emails to improve customer communication . <h> Improving Customer Communication : Easy Digital Downloads <p> The Conditional Emails extension ( $29 ) let 's you set up customized emails based on payment status changes in your shop . You could , for example , create these new emails : <p> Dispatch when status changes from " pending " to " complete " : This could be used to thank a customer for paying for their order , which is helpful for manual payments to let the customer know that payment has been received . <p> Dispatch when status changes from " complete " to " refunded " : While hopefully you do n't  have to process too many refunds , letting a customer know a refund is on the way , and ( more importantly ) how long its expected to take can keep them in the loop . <p> Each of these emails can have the appropriate status change selected , a custom subject , and a customized message : <p> Status change email <p> You can even include merge tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 've added custom payment statuses to your site , these can also be used to dispatch your emails . For example , you may be using Easy Digital Downloads to sell services rather than downloadable products , so you might have statuses like " Invoice sent " . These can be used as email conditions to dispatch emails : <p> Custom Status used <p> This automatically keeps customers in the loop on project statuses , as I can automatically tell them when invoices are sent , when projects are completed , when payments are received , and more . <p> As a bonus perk , you can also use Conditional Emails to help recover abandoned carts , as an " Abandoned cart " condition is available : <p> Abandoned cart email <h> Improving Customer Communication : WooCommerce <p> The WooCommerce Order Status Manager ( $49 ) extension let 's you create customized order statuses , but it also let 's you automatically dispatch emails based on order status changes , keeping your customers informed of order progress . As a side bonus , you can also create new admin emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You can set up any of your custom statuses : <p> Custom Statuses <p> But more importantly , these can be used to create your own automatic emails . <p> Custom Emails <p> You can dispatch your custom email to yourself or the customer , and this email can be triggered by one or more status changes . For example , you can trigger a " refund " email from " Any status " to " refunded " , or set up conditions to only send this email from changes like " processing " to " refunded " and " completed " to " refunded " . <p> Create Custom Email <p> Once you 've created the email , you can edit its content and enable it to be sent automatically . The merge tags available with WooCommerce are limited ( especially in comparison to EDD ) , but emails will include the order details table , and templates can be overridden and customized . <p> Edit Custom Email <h> Improve Customer Communication : Summary <p> Sending automatic emails to keep customers informed of order statuses is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to orders and do n't  feel like you 've abandoned them as soon as the order was placed . This gives customers a complete and attentive customer service experience with your store , and ensures that they do n't  have to question what 's going on with an order . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey i am referring til easy digital downloads = not giving them a file .

@@98138225 @2338225/ <h> Digital Marketplace Themes : Checkout Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> One of my favorite extensions for Easy Digital Downloads is the Frontend Submissions extension because its a fantastic way to create a marketplace of your own . FES let 's you manage vendors and display vendor products , as well as accept product submissions and edits from vendors without the need to provide them credentials to your site . You can display them right alongside of your own products to provide an Etsy or Amazon-like eCommerce shop . <p> We wrote a lot about Frontend Submissions when we wrote about creating a digital marketplace with Easy Digital Downloads , and we 'd also written about a specific theme that worked very well with FES ( Marketify ) . However , since that post , there have been a few great marketplace themes released , and today were taking a look at another : the Checkout theme from Array . <h> Checkout Marketplace Theme : Overview <p> Checkout was released last week , and includes a tight integration with Easy Digital Downloads , as well as several popular extensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's always made top-notch WordPress themes , so I was excited to take a look at the theme and the marketplace support . <p> At $89 ( keep reading though so we can give you a discount = ) , Checkout provides a great value and can easily create a beautiful multi-vendor store . <h> Checkout Theme : Easy Digital Downloads Support <p> Checkout includes support for Easy Digital Downloads , and can be used for any EDD store , even if you do n't  sell in a marketplace setup . I loved that the theme has a couple of homepage templates that can be configured pretty quickly , and one of them can even focus completely on the downloads in your store : <p> Product-based homepage <p> You can create this layout by using the " Homepage EDD Shop " template , then adjusting the options for your homepage using the theme customizer . <p> Customize Homepage <p> This homepage can include calls to action at the top of your page ( one or two ) , a product section , a featured products section ( which I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products to showcase ) , testimonials , and a call to action banner at the bottom of your page . here 's a diagram that can show you what each component looks like . <p> Once I 'd set up my homepage template , I also created a page using the " Downloads " template , which will display all of the download products in my shop in a grid layout . <p> Downloads archive <p> If you 're using vendors , the vendor will be displayed with each product listing . If you have a single-vendor store instead , the product listing will simply say " View Details " to link to the product page . <p> Non-vendor product <p> The Checkout theme also adds a very cool " Download Details " section that will display a list of major product features in the purchasing section . When you add or edit a product , you 'll see a new meta box for " Download details " . This will let you add a list of features for your download ( or specific options ) to display to customers . <p> Add Download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidebar . The main download content features your product image and description , but the purchasing details and feature list are displayed off to the right side of the page . This purchasing section floats next to the content so that it sticks on the page and always remains visible while the customer scrolls , ensuring its as easy as possible to purchase . <p> Single Download Page <p> The EDD core integration into the theme is capped off by a handy menu cart that will be displayed with your primary navigation . This let 's customer easily access the cart and checkout to complete the purchase . <p> Menu cart <h> Checkout Marketplace Theme : Additional Tools <p> While Checkout puts a lot of focus on the Easy Digital Downloads integration , there are ample tools for you to showcase your entire team or business . The theme uses the Array Toolkit plugin to add testimonials and portfolio items to your site ( it also adds image galleries and social icon support to the menu widget as fringe benefits ) . <p> Checkout includes a portfolio template that will display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which let 's you show off custom work or non-purchasable projects . The testimonials added by the plugin can be used in your homepage setup , or you can use the Testimonials page template to display all testimonials for your store . <p> Checkout also includes a few widgets that you 'll probably find useful . <p> Included widgets <p> The Gravatar Profile widget can be added to the " Team " template to display a grid of all team members for your store . <p> The pricing table widgets are really useful , and can be added to the " Pricing Page " template to automatically create a pricing table using your download and the " download details " you 've added . <p> The Variable Pricing Table will allow you to select a variable download , and it automatically generates a pricing table to display each variation of the product . You can also opt to " feature " an option , which will make that table slightly larger than the others . <p> Option Comparison Pricing Table <p> A regular pricing table will allow you to add multiple non-variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These can be super helpful for a few major products that will require price comparisons , such as subscriptions or memberships . <h> Checkout Marketplace Theme : Marketplace Support <p> Checkout is already a complete business theme , but it also includes marketplace support when used with the Frontend Submissions extension to make it an extremely versatile marketplace theme . In fact , it includes frontend support for all extensions in the marketplace bundle to ensure that no part of your marketplace looks out of sorts . <p> For example , if the Product Reviews add-on is active , then a section for reviews will be added to the downloads purchase section to show the average rating . Reviews will also be displayed after the product description . <p> Product Reviews included <p> Frontend Submissions support includes expansive vendor support . Vendors will be displayed in the downloads archive when the plugin is active , and the vendor archive will look similar to display all products from a vendor . <p> Vendor archive <p> I love the attention that was devoted to the vendor dashboard , as it makes managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tabbed default vendor dashboard is really shown some love , placing all vendor tabs along the side of the page for easy navigation . <p> Vendor Dashboard <p> I loved using this dashboard while impersonating a vendor , and it made my vendor products easy to see and update . <h> Checkout Marketplace Theme : Other Notes <p> One of the reason I was excited to see Array step into the eCommerce theme space was that theyve always made very high-quality themes . Checkout is no different , and it provides a top-notch integration with Easy Digital Downloads and several plugins , including some extensive work with Frontend Submissions , which looks fabulous . Code quality is what youd expect from a respected theme shop , as its well-structured and includes some key hooks that will let developers tweak it as desired . <p> After poking around and the theme pretty extensively , I was only able to come up with one thing I disliked the included footer credit : <p> This is a nofollow link so that its not used for any SEO bump , etc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I typically remove footer credits for premium themes by habit . Fortunately , this one is really easy to change because its filterable ( a very pleasant surprise , as too many themes include so few hooks to make adjustments ) . <p> You can add this snippet to your child theme or custom plugin to remove it : <h> Checkout Marketplace Theme : Summary <p> I 'm very excited to see theme companies that I 've always liked stepping into the eCommerce space , and the Checkout theme from Array does n't  disappoint . It packs a lot of compatibility into the theme , but still manages to be fairly lean . Its beautiful whether you use it for a standard store or as a marketplace theme . <p> I also liked that it helps you create a great eCommerce marketplace without losing sight of the other parts of your site , such as a blog , portfolio , or team page . I 'm looking forward to seeing more eCommerce themes , as Mike McAlister at Array has mentioned that more Easy Digital Downloads themes are a strong future possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for the great , honest review of Checkout . Glad to hear you 're happy with it ! <p> The one thing you disliked the footer credits is something we meant to add a customizer option for , but simply forgot to do in the final days before launch . I 'm adding this to our list of things to get added in an upcoming release . Thanks for offering up the code snippet for others to get it done in the interim . <p> Hey John , you 're welcome , and thanks for dropping by ! Glad to hear you 're adding the footer option I appreciated that it was a nofollow link to begin with , but its a personal preference to remove other branding and nice to hear that you 'll give users the option = . You guys did a tremendous job with this theme ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138226 @2338226/ <h> Sell Group Membership Accounts with Restrict Content Pro <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> The ability to sell a membership to a group is an extremely tough problem to solve . Tying billing to one account , but having other accounts with access that depend on that accounts billing is a pretty involved system , and not many membership platforms handle this scenario well . <p> Over a year ago , we 'd written about a workaround to create group memberships with WooCommerce , but this workaround was really only a reasonable set up if you wanted the " child " members ( non-purchasers ) in the group to have to renew memberships themselves , and it was n't a clean or automated solution . <p> Recently , the Gift Subscriptions add-on for WooCommerce Subscriptions ( which also works with WooCommerce Memberships ) has improved this process by letting purchasers immediately gift a subscription to recipient while buying , but this is best geared toward small groups or individual gifts , as parent members do n't  have a single management screen for all child memberships , or a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at selling sponsored memberships with Paid Memberships Pro , which gives you a setup in which a group administrator can purchase extra seats by giving out a discount code to members . Any membership who use this discount code become child members of the parent account , and their access is tied to the parents billing . However , using this plugin required some help from a developer to set up , and account owners could not remove child memberships . <p> An iThemes Exchange add-on then came around to allow for umbrella memberships , which was a simple solution for selling seats to a parent member , who could give those seats to child members . Parent members could add or remove child members , and child members could see who paid for the members . However , purchasers always got an included membership ( outside the seat count ) , and there was n't any admin membership around members ( ie listing them or editing them ) , so store owners could n't necessarily have full control over the setup . <p> Are we getting a clear picture yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are pros and cons to every solution available . <h> Restrict Content Pro Group Membership Accounts <p> The newest choice for managing group membership accounts is from Restrict Content Pro : the Group Accounts add-on . This add-on is available to Professional license holders ( $199+ ) and above . The Group Accounts plugin adds a great feature set to Restrict Content Pro to allow both admins and membership group owners to manage their members and their associated access . <p> After giving this a try , I was impressed with the tools that are available to group account owners and members for using group membership accounts , as the purchasing and management processes are simple for both store owners and their members . <p> When a " parent " or group owner account changes , the child memberships in the group are automatically updated with respect to subscription level , status , and expiration date so that these memberships are completely synced with the billing in the owners account . <h> Group Membership Accounts : Create Group Membership Levels <p> On your admin side , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-on in order to get group membership access set up . <p> First , you 'll need to enable group memberships for a particular subscription level under that levels settings . This is where one of the few downsides comes into play : you must set an available number of seats for a level . When purchased at the level price , the member has this many seats to fill . A purchaser can not dictate how many seats theyd like to buy . <p> For all of your subscription levels , you 'll see the maximum seats per level in your " Subscription Levels " list . <p> If you want to sell memberships with different maximum group sizes , you 'll need levels for each group size you want to offer to your members ( ie groups of 5 , 10 , and 25 would all need different subscription levels ) . <h> Group Membership Accounts : Edit Member Messaging <p> Now you 'll probably want to change some of the messaging and tools available to members . The first thing I did was adjust my " Welcome " page that members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a " manage groups " page in case the purchased membership is a group membership . <p> Next , you 'll want to give your members a way to manage any " child " members in their group . That 's where the rcpgroupdashboard shortcode will come into play . I added this on a new page to let members manage their groups from a page within their account . <p> Create Group Management page <p> Finally , you can configure a new email that 's added for group invitations . This email is automatically sent out to a child member when added to a group by the group owner or a group admin . <p> There are a few new merge tags you can use for your emails to add information to the invite email ; be sure to include the %invitelink% so that new members can access their group membership ! <p> That takes care of the administrative set up for group memberships . Now these memberships are available for purchase , we 've given owners a way to manage groups , and child members have a way to accept invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purchasing and Management <p> Within your membership registration , if a member purchases a group membership , that member will now see additional fields to create a " Group Name " and " Group Description " . Once the purchase is completed , this member will be the group owner , and can manage all other group members . <p> Group Fields added <p> After paying for the group membership , the member is directed to your " welcome " page after purchase as expected . I 've linked to my new " manage groups " page , so this member can go right to adding child members or seats to the group membership account . <p> When the member gets to the group management page , the member will see that they 're the group owner , and theyve already taken one of the seats available in their group . Here they can add new members to the group by entering basic member information . <p> Group Management <p> For larger groups , the owner can also import a CSV file of members to invite , and manage the groups basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one page , but you could also break this up into your own toggles or " tabbed " area using the other group account shortcodes found in the documentation ( for a bit more advanced users ) . These areas are also templates that can be customized with the help of a developer . <p> Once some members have been invited , the group owner can see actions available for each member to remove or promote them . A group owner can make other members group admins , which let 's other members invite new members to the group . When a member becomes an admin , that member can now access the group management page and add or remove other members . However , the owner can never be demoted or removed . <p> Once a group is full , the " add member " and " import sections " will be hidden automatically until members are removed , and empty seats are again available . <h> Group Membership Accounts : Group Member Views <p> When a member purchases a membership with Restrict Content Pro , that member typically sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Standard Member View <p> However , when a member has been invited to a group for a " child " membership , this member no longer sees management options or invoices . Instead , this member only sees group membership information , and can not make changes to the membership . <p> Child Member View <p> Since Restrict Content Pro only allows users to have one membership at a time , these child members can not make upgrades or purchase new memberships for themselves . <p> If a member is an administrator for a group , the member will be able to access the group management dashboard to add other members , but still can not control any billing access , as this is reserved for the owner . <h> Group Membership Accounts : Admin Management <p> As an administrator , you still have total control over group memberships that have been purchased , and can manually manage them for your subscribers . <p> A new " Groups " item is added to the " Restrict " menu where you can view a list of all groups on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From here you can make changes to your groups , such as adding complimentary seats or updating group names and descriptions . <p> You can also see a list of members for each group by clicking " View Members " for the group . This let 's you edit or add new members manually for the group . <p> This is the only place you 'll view members who are in a group , as the " Members " list is reserved for your paying members ( so only group owners are shown there ) . <h> Group Membership Accounts with Restrict Content Pro <p> The Group Accounts add-on for Restrict Content Pro gives site administrators the tools they need to manage multi-level memberships , while membership group owners can easily purchase and fill seats in their group memberships . I really love that group owners can manage their own invitations and group details without the help of an admin directly after purchase . Even better , they can make other members group admins so that they can add or remove members from the group . <p> In terms of downsides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner ; ownership can not be transferred , so the owner must have a membership and will always take a seat in the group . This means that a group owner ca n't just purchase a group membership for a bunch of other people if desired , but it does ensure they retain billing control of the membership . <p> I 'd also love to be able to set a " unit price " per membership , and allow a group owner to purchase the required number of seats for a level by changing the quantity needed . This would make it much easier to sell memberships to both individuals and to groups without having to create tons of levels with identical content access . <p> Overall , Group Accounts provides an easy-to-use solution that adds a lot of features to an already excellent membership solution , and I 'm excited to see this plugin grow as part of the Restrict Content Pro package . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 8 Comments <p> Beka , Thank you very much for this informative , thorough , and timely ( for me ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing a membership platform , and this will help me immensely , because having a subgroups/umbrella option is one of the several " must haves " on my spreadsheet of feature lists . <p> I could n't tell from the info posted on RCPs website about what is involved in setting up group memberships and you 've answered all of my questions and raised points I had not thought about " and I appreciate that you also included the pros and cons of the Paid Memberships Pro , iThemes Exchange and Woo groups capabilities . I have read and re-read your prior postings on each of these products . <p> I still need to check out aMember , which has a $100 subusers add-on , before deciding which one(s) to take on a test drive . <p> Hey Cecil , sure thing ! Glad it was useful = For what its worth , I 've always found the RCP team to be very helpful and responsive to questions , so if there 's something we did n't  cover here or their docs do n't  , do shoot them an email , theyd be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as all your other articles on selling sponsored memberships via WordPress . Ive read and re-read them and they have all been super informative and helpful . <p> Now I 'm hoping you have even more insight to offer , or can at least point me in the right plugin direction . We are trying to assess whether any of these plugins meet our needs out-of-the-box and we are also secretly hoping that something has changed in the world of group membership plugins since you wrote this article a few months ago . = <p> We have purchased PMPro and we originally thought the Sponsored Group Members add-on would meet our needs , but it is n't clear if the main parent user can add on additional seats after the fact ? I plan to reach out to PMPro support on that one . <p> Our current use case needs to meet the following requirements : 1. ) allow user to purchase umbrella memberships or seats where the users are not known or named at the time of purchase ( url code or other ) 2. ) ability to discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability for parent account to manage the child memberships 4. ) ability for parent account to purchase/add-on additional child memberships in the future and manage those child accounts under the same umbrella as the originally purchased memberships <p> Hey Jodie , " thought the Sponsored Group Members add-on would meet our needs , but it is n't clear if the main parent user can add on additional seats after the fact ? " this I 'm not sure about either I 'm afraid , I 'd definitely check with PMPro . <p> Point 2 ) could be done with RCP , but youd need several subscription levels ( since each one has a defined number of seats ) Points 1 and 3 are also possible already with RCP as outlined here . <p> Point 4 ) is n't possible with any system presently that I 'm aware of . I know this will be in progress soon for WooCommerce , but wont be available for a few months at least . 
@@98138227 @2338227/ <h> Top 10 Shopp Payment Gateways <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Most eCommerce plugins have a few payment gateway options built into the core plugin , and Shopp is no exception . By default , users can enable an " Offline " payment gateway , such as a Check gateway , 2Checkout , and PayPal Standard ( a test gateway is also included ) . However , these gateways may not suit the needs of every store , so several premium payment gateway add-ons are available for purchase . <p> If you do n't  yet use a particular payment processor , you may want to check out our tips on selecting a payment processor first for some help . Our personal favorite is Stripe , but there are some other great options . In this article , well compare some of the top Shopp payment gateway add-ons available , and what features each has . We also have a comparison chart to summarize . <h> Shopp Payment Gateways Comparison <p> Shopp provides some cool features in the core platform that you may want to leverage with your payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is very handy for subscription products . The only core payment gateway that leverages this ability is PayPal Standard : <p> Core Payment Gateways <p> You can also process refunds directly from the Shopp admin with some gateways , which can be a huge time saver for stores that process thousands of orders . Rather than logging into your merchant account and processing a refund , then updating the order status in Shopp , you can simply manage all of this from the order screen . <p> Process Refund <p> While these features are neat and are something to keep in mind , there are other factors we recommend considering when you decide which payment gateway add-on you need for your Shopp-powered store . <h> Merchant Location <p> Ensure that the gateway you 'd like to use is available in your merchant location . If you 're a US-based merchant , this becomes a far smaller issue , as many payment processors allow US merchants . However , merchants in other countries should pay attention to this when selecting a gateway . <p> If you 're outside of the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your only option . However , PayPal does n't  work for you , you may want to check out First Data they support merchant accounts worldwide , and the Shopp integration supports all merchant accounts . Our friends from the Netherlands will also be happy to know that Shopp offers an iDeal Mollie integration . <p> Not only must you ensure that the payment processor accepts merchants from your country , but you should also ensure that the payment gateway integration plugin you 're using will support your country . Sometimes processors use different APIs for different countries , so this is an important point to check when selecting your gateway . For example , Braintree supports several merchant locations , but uses different APIs for these locations . Therefore , some integrations only support US merchants ( as Shopp does ) while others support all available locations . <h> SSL Certifications and PCI compliance <p> Weve written about selecting an SSL certificate previously , which can add yearly costs ranging from $20 to hundreds per year , and are typically required for on-site payment processing . They typically improve trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not every payment gateway plugin requires an SSL . This is something to consider when selecting a gateway : weigh the costs of an SSL versus the trust and security benefits that come with it ( as well as the convenience of on-site payment methods ) . Most top Shopp payment gateways require an SSL , as they keep customers on-site for checkout . However , you could check out PayPal Advanced if you 'd prefer not to keep customers on-site . <p> PCI compliance is also an issue for some merchants ( we wrote a bit about this when we discussed WooCommerce payment gateways ) . Its nearly impossible to be fully PCI compliant when using WordPress and an eCommerce plugin to accept payments on-site . In order to do be PCI compliant , you 'll have to use a gateway that redirects payment through your processors secure servers via redirecting customers off-site , or using a secure iframe on your checkout page . <p> Some processors , such as Braintree and Stripe , also offer SDKs , which are code libraries that developers can use . For these processors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment information before sending it through your servers . This is an alternative that allows for direct payment processing , but protects payment information before it hits your servers . <p> These can help achieve PCI compliance if your hosting server is also PCI compliant , but not every integration leverages these libraries . Youll have to check with the individual developer to see if the integration you 're looking to purchase incorporates these libraries if PCI compliance is mandatory . <p> Some merchant accounts require PCI compliance while others simply charge a small monthly fee for non-compliance . You should know which requirements are placed on your merchant account , and determine which gateways can fit these requirements . <h> Captures vs Charges <p> Shopp also provides the ability to capture ( authorize ) charges before actually charging a customer account . Weve written more about authorizing vs. capturing if you 've never encountered this before . <p> The ability to only capture details without directly charging a customer is handy for shops that do n't  want to charge an order until its shipped . Typically , this must be managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow you to do this directly from the Shopp admin ( though you can only do this for individual orders rather than in bulk ) : <p> Charge Captured Orders <p> If this suits your stores workflow , you may want to start by looking at gateway add-ons that support capturing charges before collecting payment , as you can authorize the payment , then charge the order when you 're ready to ship . You 'll want to view Authorize.net AIM , First Data , PayPal Payflow Pro , and PayPal Pro . <h> Recurring Billing <p> As we said before , Shopp supports recurring billing within the core plugin . The ability to accept subscriptions was added in v1.2 , so its still fairly new to the core plugin . As a result , PayPal Standard ( built-in ) is the only gateway that can be used for recurring payments at the moment . <p> This has allowed the Shopp development team to see how users integrate subscriptions products in their stores in order to improve recurring billing . <p> Currently , subscription products are created by using a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will change from a product type to a " payment/billing profile " that can be applied to any product type ( shipped , virtual , download or donation ) in order to make recurring billing more flexible . This will also then prompt support for recurring billing across some of the major payment gateways whose APIs will allow this . <h> Refunds <p> Refund processing is something that can be a huge pain for stores that are processing large order volumes . With typical refunds , merchants have to get an order number , look up the corresponding order number in their merchant account , process the return from the merchant account , then go back to the eCommerce plugin and update the order status to " refunded " ( or similar ) . <p> Shopp cuts this process down tremendously while using select gateways . Instead of splitting the process between Shopp and your merchant account dashboard , you can process the refund from your Shopp admins Order page . Find the relevant order and click " Refund " . You can then enter relevant notes and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that you 'll have to back out your own shipping charges ( if you do this ) , as the default refund amount is the full order amount rather than just the item costs . <h> Other Notes <p> On a final note , you may also want to check out the Manual Payments payment gateway . This provides a connection for merchants that can already run credit cards through a processor that does n't  have eCommerce capabilities . Manual Processing allows for the secure handling of payment cards in a PCI compliant way , so that merchants can process eCommerce transactions without the need for an additional merchant account . <h> Comparison Chart <p> Here are the major payment gateways available for purchase in the Shopp store . Each is available for a $45 purchase . <h> Gateways : <p> Want to know what each can do in terms of recurring payments , captures , merchant locations , and more ?

Let 's start with downsides . <p> First , WP Engine ( WPE ) can be expensive if you 're starting out . Its definitely more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for up to 25,000 visits per month and one WordPress site . However , if you need an SSL certificate , you 'll need the Professional plan , which is $99 per month and includes 100,000 visits each month and 10 sites . If I were just starting out , I 'd probably sign up for the introductory plan and use PayPal + a payment gateway that does n't  require an SSL ( one that redirects checkout ) so you can see how things go before using a more expensive plan . <p> Second , WPE does n't  include email hosting . This may or may not be important for you , and there are other options available ( like Google Apps or free forwarding from Namecheap if you 're using their DNS hosting ) . However , some hosts do include this and youll incur extra cost ( about $2 per user per month ) to do it separately . <p> Third , since the hosting is entirely managed , your developers may be limited in what they can do with the server configuration . Neither myself nor any developers I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the couple years we 've used WPE , but I know some people have brought it up as a negative point . There are also some disallowed plugins that you wont be able to install ( typically related to caching , which WPE handles for you , or performance ) . <p> So with those few negative points , why use the service ? One of the biggest benefits to using WP Engine is scalability . In fact , many enterprise clients , such as FourSquare , HTC , Balsamiq , SoundCloud , and Unbounce , all depend on WP Engine to host their sites . Performance will scale with your site as it grows , and you can avoid migrating hosts with increased traffic . You 'll also never be shut down for traffic surges your hosting simply handles them , and you 'll pay $1 per 1,000 visitors in overages if needed . <p> Security and support are also excellent in my experience . Live chat is fast and usually resolves most issues . I 've used email ticketing for more complex issues and typically receive responses within an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site going down , I even received a response in 2 minutes . <p> Security is a priority and WP Engine offers free fixes for any site that 's hacked while using their hosting , which is a pretty rare feature . One thing many hosts should do are credits for higher-than-average downtime WP Engine offers 5% of your monthly bill for every hour of downtime . However , I 've never had to worry about this credit in two years , as uptime has been above 99.9% . <p> Performance has always been as expected want to know what others think ? WP Engine has a testimonials page available that you check out , or theyll frequently retweet compliments via @wpengine . <h> Performance <p> Just as we stated in our detailed SiteGround hosting review , there are several great hosting speed comparisons available . As the king of all hosting speed comparisons is pretty recent , I feel it would not be beneficial to rehash them myself , so I 'm going to omit this section from the review . The speed comparison from Review Signal is the one I 'd recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You could test your own hosting with Load Impact or Blitz.io and compare it to these results . WP Engine also provides a free speed tool that will email you a breakdown of site performance and some potential issues ( you do n't  have to be using their hosting to try it ) . <h> Pricing and Features <p> As we said before , pricing for WP Engine will be higher than shared hosting but comparable to other managed services , such as Pagely and Pressable . Pricing begins at $29 per month for a single site and up to 25,000 visits per month , while SSL compatible plans begin at $99 per month ( which is what I 'm testing ) . <p> Why is pricing higher than most providers ? For a few reasons . First , hosting is entirely managed : WordPress core is automatically updated , backups are taken daily ( available 60 days back ) , and more . Service is also a blend between shared and VPS hosting ( dedicated resources are used for Premium plans and up ) you 'll be sharing a server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing is limited to far fewer sites that other shared services ( i.e. , GoDaddy or HostGator ) . Hardware is also high-quality and newer than cheaper companies . <p> Each WPE plan comes with a number of free WordPress installs once you sign up and your DNS resolves , you 'll be running on a shiny new WordPress install . As WPE is entirely focused on WordPress , there 's no additional steps on selecting which CMS you want to use or providing more details about your site when creating your account . <p> As stated previously , I recommend using a Personal plan if you 're getting started , and using payment gateways that do n't  require an SSL certificate so that you can test your store and save money while traffic grows . If traffic increases or you need to use an SSL certificate , then upgrading to the Professional Plan would be your next step . The professional plan offers a lot of WordPress-specific features : <p> up to 10 sites <p> 100,000 visits / month <p> 20GB storage <p> daily backups ( 60 days back ) <p> one-click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> supports WordPress multisite <p> built-in caching <p> SSH / sFTP access <p> WP core autoupdates <p> SSL compatibility <p> staging/live Git access <p> security and free fixes if your site gets hacked <p> One thing that 's pretty cool about backups is that you have instant access to your backups going back 30 days , and backups can include media along with other files so you do n't  lose images or other uploads with a backup restore . <p> I also like that this plan allows you to enable multisite for your install at no extra cost . I know a lot of you that like to create subdomains for your membership sites will find this valuable . <h> Getting Started with WP Engine <p> I signed up for my professional plan within a few minutes . While signing up , you have the option to pay monthly , or if you pay annually , you get 2 months free . You also have 60 days to try the service . If you decide to cancel in the first 60 days , you 'll be refunded for any payments you 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include migration services within your plan . There are detailed instructions for those of you that are moving from an existing site . I 'm going to go through the process of using a new site rather than a migration . <p> Once I registered for my account , I grabbed the information needed to point my DNS to WP Engine . When you log into your account at my.wpengine.com , you 'll see your install name and IP address . This is the information you 'll need to transfer the DNS record . <p> WP Engine Dashboard <p> You can also get this information by logging into your new site . This will be a WP Engine subdomain at the moment , but you can still log in and play with your site , as well as start configuring options to be ready for when the DNS records are updated . Log in to **34;2012;TOOLONG with your username and password that you signed up with . The WP Engine plugin will be installed and accessible in your WordPress menu . Clicking on this menu will also provide DNS as well as sFTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your DNS information , you can play around with your new site while you wait for records to update . Nothing aside from the WP Engine plugin will be installed , so you can start with theme setup or your preferred plugins . <h> WP Engine Usage <p> All WP Engine resources are either in your WP Engine account or within your WordPress admin . You can check out your WP Engine dashboard to find out information on traffic , restoring backups , and more : <p> Managing Installs <p> The Installs menu will provide any site information , including the ability to download and restore backups , install SSL certificates , and access to developer tools ( myPHPadmin , git access , etc ) . You 'll also be able to add users to your account ( great for companies with a tech team ) and view all billing details from this dashboard . The experience is far simpler than using a traditional cPanel as some options are moved to the WPE plugin . <p> You can also enable the CDN for your account if needed ( included with Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading images , CSS , Javascript , and other static content faster by using a worldwide collection of servers to serve this content to your users . WP Engine has more details on their CDN . <p> Done with the dashboard ? Let 's check out the WP Engine plugin in our WordPress site . Some features of the service are accessible from this plugin to make site management easier . For example , we mentioned previously that you can access FTP information and other details from this plugin . You can also restrict access to the WP Engine Admin Bar for specific user roles ( i.e. , only let admins access these tools ) , purge your website cache if necessary , and grab error logs . <p> The best part of this plugin is the staging area tool . If you go to the " Staging " tab at the top of the menu , you 'll see this page : <p> This will allow you to build a copy of your site with one click that you can access through a separate login , which will be accessible at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /wp-admin page still , but login credentials will be exactly the same as your site . Time to build the staging site depends on how much content your site has , but is usually quick the staging area for my site with only a few pages and posts was built within 30 seconds . For most sites I work on , this process only takes a maximum of a couple of minutes . <p> The staging site will be public , but search indexing will be discouraged so that users will not find this site . Using the staging tool is an excellent way to test out updates , new themes , or plugins before making those changes on your live site . This has saved me several times while updating plugins and running into issues so I 'm able to fix the issue before running into it on the live site . <p> If you 'd like to , you can even copy changes back over to your live site when you 're done with the staging area . I do n't  usually do this , as deploying the staging site changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to your live site since you creating the staging area ( i.e. , new user comments , eCommerce orders ) , these will be overridden . <p> The only minor annoyance is that you cant clear the staging area between each use . Sometimes , this will lead to emails about posts that were scheduled on your staging area but removed or rescheduled on your live site ( I sometimes get pingback emails for internal links on my staging site because of this ) . By default , this is also accessible for outside users if they visit the exact URL for the staging site , which probably wont be a big deal unless you need your staging site to be private . <p> Once you 're done playing around with these tools , your DNS records will hopefully be updated . There 's one more step you 'll need to take to complete site setup . In your new WordPress admin , you 'll need to go to Settings &gt; General and update your site URLs . Currently , they 're housed at yoursite.wpengine.com . You 'll need to remove the " wpengine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Set Site URL <p> That 's all there is in getting started and using WP Engines hosting features ! <h> Support <p> WP Engine has a Support Garage available as a knowledge base . This is usually a great starting point for any questions or issues you encounter while using their service . They also offer Live chat and ticketed support . You can access support resources from your WP Engine dashboard or from the WPE plugin in your WordPress site : <p> Support WPE Dashboard <p> Support WPE Plugin <p> I 've referenced the support garage for several topics , such as help on getting DNS records transferred and information on features , and found the articles very helpful . There 's also some great information on using restore points and other tools . I 've used phone support ( Professional plans and higher ) as well on rare occasions when I have a quick question , and have never been left without an answer . <p> Live chat is the method by which I typically get support , and usually leads to successful resolution . Its very handy for issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features or account issues . My typical resolution time for live chat support is under five minutes , and getting in touch with a representative does n't  usually take more than a minute . <p> I 've also used ticketed support for technical issues . For some urgent issues , Ive gotten responses within minutes , though most issues usually have a response within a couple of hours . Almost every time Ive gone through ticketed support , issues are resolved within a few emails back and forth , and support techs are friendly and easy to work with . I 've had one or two very complex issues that required several emails between our developers and the WPE team , but those issues were escalated and resolved with the same care . <h> Other Comments <p> One of the major reasons that I use WP Engine really is n't actually a " tangible " reason . While many hosts have evolved quickly , began to offer great services at incredible value , etc. , WPE has continued to do so as well , but its not what makes them unique . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen and their recent post about growth they 're constantly running into and responding to issues of scale . As a result , the service gets better ( though it may have up and down cycles to do so ) . <p> WPEs team evolves at a rapid pace , its well-funded , and the team has learned lessons from scaling that many other hosts have n't always encountered yet . One of my considerations when choosing a company upon which I built part of my business is their sustainability and long-term presence , and I think WPE will be one of the companies that continues to evolve and grow as a market leader . <h> WP Engine Hosting Review Conclusions <p> As with all services , there are issues that will occur while using WP Engine and its not a perfect company . However , there are plenty of upsides to using their hosting services that keep me as a customer . As I said before , WPE will scale with your site without issues they have tons of experience with scaling . Their processes have also evolved as they routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare occurrence , but when you have over a thousand servers ( as WPE does ) , it turns into a day-to-day job for which you develop strategies and efficient responses . This leads to better service for each customer , as what used to be catastrophic now becomes routine . <p> The more issues they face now , the better they can respond to them in the future . For example , they recently address an issue regarding backend slowness that theyve responded to and fixed . No experience with any host will be perfect , but the transparency with which these issues are handled is one reason I 've stuck with them as a customer . <p> They also offer some really powerful features and performance I love using the staging area tools , having sFTP and git access , and benefitting from quality support . Security is also a priority for WPE and I like knowing that my site will be fixed if hacked . While hosting may be on the pricier side for some sites , its usually worth the investment for me and is why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading <p> Update : Please note that we no longer recommend WP Engines hosting services due to a lapse in security / maintenance with some sites hosted there , and have since moved all sites to Pagely . For sites with under 100,000 visits per month , we also recommend SiteGround . <p> Note : This post may contain affiliate links , which means the company may give us a small commission if you sign up .

Wed suggested this be fixed immediately , and they said it was n't really a problem . <p> Third , they " cleaned up and hardened " the site , and I checked the email 2 hours after they sent it , and the site was already re-infected with the same hack before I could get to it and update everything , so no " hardening " ever took place . <p> Overall theyd been really great until that point , but as security is hugely important for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@98138229 @2338229/ <p> Jigoshop is a free WordPress plugin that allows you to add multiple product types and sets up a workable shop out of the box . It has a minimalist code base , and thus performs well directly following installation . To get added functionality , you can add extensions for the core offering . We know that everyone always loves to compare WooCommerce vs Jigoshop since they have the same roots ( WooCommerce originated as a fork of Jigoshop ) . However , were not going to compare the two right now . What we will do is tell you about the pros and cons of using Jigoshop for your eCommerce store , and which paid extensions will be useful in getting your store up and running if you plan on using Jigoshop to power your online storefront . <p> Jigoshop is a freeWordPress plugin that handles setup of your basic eCommerce store . Since its free , feel free to download a copy and see how you like it do n't  forget to play around with product addition and settings to make sure its a good fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plugin to play around with it , you can use a free demo instead . Costs will come from themes and some paid extensions . Official themes range from $40-80 , while Theme Forest sells Jigoshop themes for about $55 ( there 's a small selection ) . While going through some other reviews , it seems that TemplateMonster themes and some others can cause errors , so it appears that official themes are probably the best way to go . <p> Official extensions will probably cost somewhere between $200 to $300 for basic needs such as a payment processor and some helpful add-ons . One bargain extension is the Jigoshop $100 Bundle , which includes a couple of themes , table rate shipping , SagePay , and more . You can also buy extensions from Code Canyon for anywhere between $6 and $25 , but as we 've warned in other articles , be wary of quality and the potential lack of support . There are a couple quality extensions , but in my experience they 're few in number . <h> Cost summary : <p> Free core plugin , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $275 for stores with basic needs . <p> Jigoshop installation is easy , and there are a lot settings and the ability customize the way your store is laid out . One thing that stuck out to me was that settings provided good explanations for the general user to make configuration as smooth as possible . <p> Admin Settings &amp; Setup <p> There are some general settings to customize your store layout and operation . Settings for product display will probably be helpful to ensure proper display with your theme , and setting up inventory levels and notification levels will be useful for many stores selling physical products . <p> Backend : Products / Shopping Settings <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options include the basic necessities , such as the ability to set rates by region ( for example , you can set different rates for different states in the US if you have nexus in multiple states ) . You can also set reduced rates if necessary ( or other custom rates ) . You do n't  have other options in how taxes are applied , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Options &amp; Settings <h> Products <p> Product addition is easy and creates products as WordPress custom post types with detailed descriptions and excerpts ( which will be displayed right below the product title ) . You can create simple , variable/configurable , downloadable , affiliate , grouped , and virtual products . You 'll also have some tabs at the bottom of the product page to display product information ( such as attributes ) , and product reviews , so that the general product display works well for all product types . However , you can only display one product image instead of an image gallery for products , which could prove inconvenient for some products . <p> Backend : Product Addition <p> Product variations can be added , but there 's not really explanation in the plugin itself on how to do this ( a scroll-over explanation if the product type is set to " Variable " would have helped ) . Attributes for the variation have to be added ( such as size or color ) , and all possible values for the attribute should be entered , separated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation in the plugin would help for usability , but this is pretty close to the way variations are added for most platforms and shouldnt pose an issue . <p> Backend : Product Variations <p> One thing I really did n't  like was the fact that you ca n't link variations , so you 'll have to set them all up manually ( which gets really annoying ) . ( Linking variations is the ability to automatically create all possible products based on the attributes you 've set , such as combining " gray " for color with all possible sizes , the repeating for the next color , which is obviously really useful . ) You can bulk edit variation details ( such as shipping weight , stock , or cost ) or change details manually . You can also set images for each type of variation , which was useful . However , you cant set any default values to apply automatically to new variations ( which should inherit these details to make addition of new variations simpler ) . While you can do a lot with variations , I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier . <p> Backend : Managing Variations <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> You can add individual products , featured and new products , and more using shortcodes . However , there 's no shortcode help in the plugin ( no shortcode button in visual editors , etc ) . There 's a shortcode reference in the community forum that you can refer to instead . <p> Backend : Inserting Shortcodes <p> here 's the shortcode display on the frontend ( obviously I 'd want to pay attention to how many items I 'm displaying per row = ) . <p> Frontend : Shortcode Display <p> There are also a lot of widgets available for use , such as a price filter and a best sellers widget , so that you can customize the shopping experience even further . <p> You can customize your shopping page display from the Jigoshop settings , but the default layout is easy to navigate and understand . Styling is basic and leaves a bit to be desired , but the user experience does n't  provide anything to really confuse customers . While browsing , customers cant sort products by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jigoshop Sorting extension to allow sorting by name , price , or date in your product catalog . <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> Product pages show all product details easily , and adding products to the shopping cart is easy . Tabs for product information are also useful and simple for customers to navigate . A good extension for modifying this layout is the Custom Product Tabs extension , which allows you to add extra tabs to product pages in which to display more details or other shortcodes . <p> Frontend : Product Page <p> Variations are also easy for customers to use , as they can select variations using drop-down menus . Changing the variation will also change the product image if you have an image other than the featured image set for the variation . <p> Frontend : Variable Product Page <p> You can modify your product and shopping experience further with other paid extensions . If you want to include cross-sells or upsells for products , you can use the Upsells &amp; Cross-sells extension . Want to offer accessories or the option to bundle products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of products for the customer . For example , if you sell a digital camera , you can add batteries , memory cards , or waterproof cases as accessories right from the cameras product information . The Jigoshop Extensions store provides other options for changing the way you sell products . <p> Once customers have made their selections , they can visit the cart page , where they can change item quantities , remove items , and apply coupons before proceeding to checkout . <p> Frontend : Cart Page <p> Like many platforms , Jigoshop uses a one-page checkout . Single page checkouts improve conversions and reduce cart abandonment by providing fewer steps to completing the purchase , which is obviously geared towards selling more . You can also validate post codes automatically to cut down on shipping errors by setting this under Settings &gt; General and save yourself shipping costs created by address errors . <p> Basic payment settings are fine to get started , but you 'll probably need a payment gateway integration , which costs about $50 . Many stores will find shipping options are lacking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . <h> Shipping Options <p> Basic shipping options are just that basic . You can ship items using a flat rate for the entire country ( not states/regions ) on a per item or per order basis . Free shipping and local pickup are also included by default . Most stores will probably want something like the Table Rate Shipping or the multi-functional Premium Shipping Extension to add more options , such as the much needed ability to set regions within the country . Or , you can get exact rates using the FedEx or UPS extensions . Jigoshop also just released a new USPS Advanced Shipping extension for stores shipping within the US . <p> Jigoshop includes basic reporting , which can be helpful for shop owners to get some insight on total sales and unit sales for any date range . Top earners and most units can be viewed in a pie chart as well . However , while reporting is very easy to understand , it does n't  go much further than that ( such as viewing reports by category , coupon use , etc ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Built-in Reporting <h> Inventory <p> Inventory management is included for all products , and you can view low/out of stock items in your Jigoshop dashboard . One thing you should note is that Jigoshop is one of the few plugins that allows backorders , which is a huge bonus . You can allow backorders based on product in the product editor . <p> For many Jigoshop extensions , support is not included volunteers staff the community forums , but not paid developers . For some extensions , a small support window , such as 14 days , is included to get things up and running . Clients who choose not to pay for support can access the community forums , a knowledge base , and public discussions , which will be helpful for basic problems , but not for compatibility issues , bugs , and so on . If you want help from Jigoshop developers , you 'll have to pay $39.99 per month , or $239.99 per year , for premium support ; you 'll also get access to the premium knowledge base included in that price . Most reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negative reviews on WordPress.org , but overall it seems that paid support is helpful and addresses what most users need . I did n't  test paid support myself , so I cant make a judgment on this . If someone has used it , please comment : ) . <p> If you want to sell subscription products , you can add them and limited membership functionality with the Subscriptions extension . Subscriptions can be created based on membership group , which is a bit of an odd way of solving the problem , but can do what you need it to . There 's no other way to create " true " subscriptions products , but with some tweaking you can make this work . <p> If you 're just looking to create memberships , another useful extension is the Customer Discounts extension , which allows you to set different purchase prices based on the users role . You could do this for memberships by creating roles for each membership level . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

@@98138230 @2338230/ <h> 5 Tips for Marketing Your New Products <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> When you 're launching new products , a lot of time and effort is spent on developing these products and getting them added to your store . Typically , customers wont find out about new products unless you have a marketing strategy specifically around the launch . Your new products may get buried under the list of your existing or popular products . <p> You can highlight the launch by showcasing the products on your homepage or in widget areas . But , unless customers are coming to your site , they wo n't know about these . Below are a few marketing tips you can use to build awareness , and generate sales for new products prior to , during , and after launch . <h> Market Your New Products : 1 . Leverage Your Email List <p> Email is still one of the best ways to create awareness and generate sales . You can use an email marketing platform , like MailChimp , to build an email subscriber list , and create email marketing campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investments amongst other online mediums , like social media . Through MailChimp , you can create mobile-friendly emails about the launch of new products . You can also track how many people click on links within these emails to see what type of messaging works best . <p> You can create anticipation for the launch of the new product by sharing teasers and updates about the product development leading up to the launch . In addition , to incentivize email subscribers , you can offer earlier access or discounts to new products for email subscribers . This can further build traction and anticipation by creating exclusivity . <h> Market Your New Products : 2 . Create a Launch Discount <p> You can set a discount for the first few weeks after launch to build sales for new products . By setting a discount , customers perceive a higher value through the savings , and a lower risk for trying out something new . A launch discount also creates urgency in customers which can drive purchasing decisions . <p> The easiest way to create a launch discount is to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share this with your customers via another medium , or with a site notification using something like Hello Bar . <p> In WooCommerce , you can create a coupon specific to your new products by : <p> Selecting the type of discount . For new products , select either the dollar amount or percentage " Product Discount " . <p> Set the discount amount . You can set either the dollar value or the discount percentage . <p> Set an expiry date . You can select a date few weeks from launch . <p> Next , select the new products for which the coupon is valid under Usage Restrictions . If you 've launched a new product category , you could also select the category for which the coupon will be valid instead ( see the WooThemes documentation about coupons ) . <p> Select the product <p> Many other eCommerce plugins can set up similar discounts . For example , Easy Digital Downlodas will let you create requirements for the coupon , then also restrict the discount to those products only : <p> Restrict EDD Discounts <h> Market Your New Products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a wider audience , you can try to advertise your new products on other mediums . <p> Gift guides You can send samples of your products to be listed on gift guides .

You will have to select the medium and publication in which you want your release to be included . Then , reach out to the contact person regarding news releases . <p> Not every site publishes news releases ( for example , we do not ) , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the publications readers , you can get your product in front of a new audience . <p> Blogs You can send samples of your products to influential bloggers in your market .

Customer contests <p> Run customer contests to promote your brand , and reward customers by giving away your new product for fulfilling contest tasks .

However , there 's one problem with product pages : they 're static . They 're not interactive . <p> The " Reviews " section is the only place where some interaction can take place , but this is typically reserved for customers that youve already gained not your potential purchasers .

Its compatible with both WooCommerce and the BuddyPress profile system to create a discussion area for your products . <p> When activated and configured , it adds a new tab to the product page that allows for comments to be used for customer interaction .

This takes just a minute or two upon clicking the " synchronize " button . <p> Installation <p> The plugin will add a new WooDiscuz menu at the bottom of your WP admin . This is where you can configure the general settings and adjust phrasing as needed for your store . <p> The general settings will let you enable or disable options , such as sharing and voting , as well as comment moderation ( though there is a basic Captcha included by default ) . <p> General Settings <p> Phrase settings will let you adjust the frontend text for the plugin . This is very handy if you want to , for example , use the discussion for product and pre-sales questions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phrase settings <h> WooCommerce Product Questions : WooDiscuz Admin <p> When a shop employee or a customer makes a comment or discussion contribution , it can be managed just like a blog post comment . If you moderate comments , you can approve them or edit them as needed from the Comments menu in WordPress . <p> Moderating comments <p> Just note that if you moderate comments with the plugin , this will include comments made by admins or shop managers , so theyll need to be approved from this menu . <p> Other than comment review and setup , there 's nothing else needed from the admin side ! <h> WooCommerce Product Questions : WooDiscuz Frontend <p> Customers can easily add comments or questions to the WooDiscuz tab without an account . Accounts are required for voting , but not for commenting . <p> Customer experience <p> Once a comment has been added , it will be displayed with an author title , voting and sharing options , as well as the ability to reply .

Customers can view all comments without refreshing the page by clicking " Load More Comments " , and you can change this text as needed . For example , if using this for pre-sales questions , you may want it to read " Load More Questions " . <p> Paged Comments <p> You can turn off voting , sharing , titles , and other options from the plugin settings . For example , here 's a comparison of using author titles or no titles for the Discussions tab : <p> Author Titles shown <p> Hiding Author Titles <h> WooCommerce Product Questions : WooDiscuz Other Comments <p> As this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow .

@@98138232 @2338232/ <p> This series includes detailed reviews of WordPress eCommerce Plugins and Platforms . <p> If you 're running a WordPress site , there are several options available to add eCommerce functionality . However , many of these plugins may be overkill if you just need a simple shopping cart to sell a few items on your site or blog . <p> The WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart from Tips and Tricks HQ is a free plugin that will let you easily sell items from your WordPress website , and can have you up and selling through PayPal within 30 minutes . You can sell shippable products , digital goods , and services using the plugin , as it can be used to insert purchase buttons anywhere shortcodes are accepted on your site . <p> With over 500,000 downloads from WordPress.org , its a fairly popular solution for shops that want to sell a few items , such as swag tee shirts , eBooks , or services via PayPal . <h> Table of Contents <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Overview &amp; Costs <p> As we mentioned above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install on your WordPress site , then begin to create purchase buttons , which are essentially what create your " products " . These are passed to PayPal with your pricing and any included fees , and then its up to you to fulfill and manage any purchases for your site . <p> When you install the plugin , it will add settings and a new menu for Cart Orders . The settings page is where you 'll want to head first for some quick tips on creating your shop . <p> Quickstart guide <p> There are n't  any other costs associated with using the plugin , but as its a free solution , support may be limited . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Setup <p> Even though the plugin is free , there 's tons of documentation available to help with shop setup . The setup guide pointed me in the right direction in terms of the settings I needed and a few methods on product creation or adding shipping fees . There are also some very helpful getting started videos I 'd recommend checking out . <p> I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopping Carts general settings . Here I was able to add basic store information , such as my PayPal address , shipping fees ( if needed ) , cart / product page URLs , and other options . <p> General Settings <p> I ran through the basic settings in a few minutes , and then moved on to the email notification settings . You can create email notifications for both customers and site administrators to inform them of a completed order , and there are pre-filled templates to make setup for your notifications simple . <p> Email Settings <p> Finally , I checked out the discount options . I want to enable coupons or discounts in my store , so I opted to enable these and add a couple of discount codes . You can set discounts that will deduct a percentage of the cart total when used , as well as set an expiration date if needed . <p> Create coupons <p> These discounts will be applied to cart pricing before customers are sent to PayPal , so pricing on the cart and PayPal pages will include discounts applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all there is to setup ! You can then add purchase buttons in your pages , blog posts , or widgets . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Creating Products <p> The plugin does n't  generate a product post type or product creation system , as its designed to only sell a few products quickly and easily from your blog . As such , you wont be creating products with tons of options . Instead , all products will be created via shortcode . <p> Unfortunately , there 's no shortcode generator or library in the plugin , which means that this will be far more difficult if you have several products to add to your shop ( and this is part of the reason I recommend it to sell just a few products ) . Youll be creating shortcodes manually for each product you 'd like to sell . <p> There are two major versions of product shortcodes that you can use with WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart . One will just add a cart button for the product , so you can draft sales copy , add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then use the shortcode to add the " Add to Cart " button . The general form for this shortcode is : <p> wpcartbutton name= " Product Name " price= " Price " . This will create a button that sends that product name to PayPal with the price indicated . There are other attributes that we can add to this shortcode that well discuss as we go , such as a shipping fee . here 's an example of a product I 've created : <p> Since there are no product or shop pages , the design of these pages will be entirely up to you . You can sell items directly within pages or posts , or create dedicated sales and shop pages for your items . For example , here 's a list-style shopping page I began to create using columns : <p> Add products <p> Note that the only thing being inserted by my shortcode is the " Add to cart " button . I 've created the rest of the page on my own via shortcodes / CSS . <p> As you 'll have to create this structure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend using this shortcode type if you 've already got long-form copy or blog posts prepared , as it inserts the " Add to Cart " link to take care of the purchasing functionality . <p> The second version of a product shortcode you can use will create a product display box . This may be better for sites that will sell more than just a few products , or could be used to create a " shop " page as desired , then the previous shortcode can be used within content . <p> The product display box uses a shortcode that 's very similar to the previous one , but can add a description and thumbnail : <p> wpcartdisplayproduct name= " Product Name " price= " Price " thumbnail= " URL of the image " description= " This is a short description of the product " <p> here 's an example of a product display box I 've created via shortcode : <p> These two basic shortcodes can be used to create any simple product within your blog posts , pages , or a dedicated shop page . <p> If you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can also add variations to both of these shortcodes . This will add a dropdown for the variation about the purchase button , though it ca n't be used to change an image or influence price , and merely serves as an indicator for both you and the customer . <p> To do so , you 'll add an attribute to your shortcode in the form of var1= " NameOption1Option2 " and so on . You can add more variant dropdowns by adding more variant attributes in the same way using var2= , var3= , etc . Add as many options as needed , and you can use this for both versions of the product shortcode . here 's an example with multiple variants : <p> Digital products , such as file downloads or ebooks , can also be sold using WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart . You 'll add one more attribute to either shortcode version : file= " file URL " . This will deliver files to customers via the confirmation email , which will contain the download link for the item they purchased . <p> here 's an example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2nd Grade " price= " 9.49 " LONG ... LONG ... description= " Welcome back to memories of when CDs first came out ! " <p> There are several different ways to set up products , which will be dictated by how you want to sell them . Once you 've got products created in your pages or posts , you 'll want to add the cart / checkout . You can add this as a widget if desired : <p> You can also use the showwpshoppingcart shortcode to create a dedicated page for this or show it on the same page as products . Now that settings have been configured , products have been added , and customers can check out , you 're ready to sell = . <h> WordPress PayPal Shopping Cart : Customer Experience <p> As you 'll be setting up product pages , the customer experience will be entirely up to you . There 's no predefined cart or purchasing flow when using WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart . Customers will be able to view products or pages you 've set up , then add these products to the cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to view the products theyve added via the cart widget or the cart page ( if you 've created one ) . <p> Cart widget <p> However , I 'd recommend that you enable the " Hide Shopping Cart Image " setting , as it does n't  do much for the widget or cart page when used . <p> Customers will be able to complete purchases by clicking the PayPal buttons in this widget or on the cart page . <p> Cart Page <p> This will pass all products that theyve added to the cart to PayPal , as well as any fees ( such as shipping ) and pricing . If you 've created variations for a product , these will also be included and appended to the product name . <p> Variants added to item names <p> You can determine which page customers return to from PayPal in the settings . I 'd recommend setting up a generic " Thank You " page for this purpose , as there 's no way to display purchase details or a customer account for order records . <p> The purchasing flow is simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-site purchases like this . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Payment &amp; Shipping <p> As the name of the plugin is " WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart " , I 'm sure you can guess at the payment options provided = . You can process payments through your PayPal business account via PayPal Standard , and can also pass shipping costs to PayPal on a per-item or per-order basis ( or use both an item fee and a base cart shipping fee to combine the two ) . <h> Payments <p> To accept payments using WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart , you 'll have to enter your PayPal email address under the plugin settings , then setup your PayPal IPN to ensure that your store knows when an order is purchased . This will let PayPal send information back to your store to notify the plugin that the order has been completed , which will generate an order record . <h> Shipping <p> You can also add shipping fees for your products and cart by including a shipping= " " attribute in your product shortcodes . When used , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This will add a $1.99 charge for shipping for each one of these products that 's purchased . You can do the same thing for any product you create , regardless of whether you use the simple shortcode or the product display box shortcode . <p> You can add a base shipping fee under the plugin settings , which will add a set fee to the cart as well . If I add a base fee of $3 for shipping , then someone buys my mug product as set above , theyll be charged a total of $4.99 for shipping costs . <p> You can also use the base shipping as a simple flat rate per order . If the base rate is set at $3 and I set the shipping for all products to shipping= " 0.001 " , then the base rate will be used ( unless , of course , someone orders over 50 products at once and rounds the per-product rate to $0.01 ) . <p> There 's no way pre-built method to integrate other shipping options into the shopping cart , so using order rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only solution available . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Orders &amp; Reporting <p> Simple order management capabilities are included in WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart . When a customer places and order via PayPal and the PayPal IPN tells your site its been completed , and order record will be generated under the " Cart Orders " menu . This will include the basic customer information , as well as the product(s) orders and if any coupons were used : <p> Sample Order record <p> You can manually create orders as well , which is helpful in case the PayPal IPN fails ( as it sometimes does ) . <p> Other than order records , there are no other reports or order management options . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Extending <p> There are no paid extensions or upgrades for WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart . It can be extended via custom code as needed , but this will require PHP knowledge on your part , or the help of a developer . <p> For example , I wanted to change my product details box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static images . There are no add-ons available to change functionality , so I had to write a code snippet to do this myself . <p> WPSPSC does integrate with the WP Affiliates plugin from Tips and Tricks HQ , so you can pay out affiliates for referring customers to your site . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Support <p> As mentioned previously , there 's lots of documentation available for help in setup , adding variations , changing buttons or product layout , and more . <p> However , support forums are for paid customers only , which means that you 'll have to use the limited support at WordPress.org if needed , or complete a purchase . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Code Review <p> During my testing , the plugin worked as expected without issue . The structure does n't  follow WordPress code standards , and its use of sessions may not work with some hosts or caching plugins . However , there are no major issues in the way the plugin performs on your site , and you 'll want to be aware of caching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shopping Cart : Other Comments <p> The plugin is useful for selling a few , simple products via PayPal . However , if you 'll need more complex order and product tracking , such as inventory management , then you 'll need to look for a different solution . <p> I did like that you can can use custom button text and images as needed , and can change the way products are sold throughout the site by using different product shortcodes . However , this did mean that my setup was quite intensive , and I would n't want to make changes consistently . <p> Finally , I 'd recommend that you use something like Amazon S3 and a single-use URL for file downloads rather than serving them right from your /wp-content/ folder . However , if you 're going to put the work into protecting your download links , it might be wise to consider a different solution . While this may not be an issue with a couple of digital products , its something you should consider moving forward with your shop setup . <h> WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart : Conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to add products and purchase items makes it a flexible solution for shops that sell a limited number of items . Its especially useful for shops that sell services and virtual items , as well as the occasional shippable product . <h> Cons <p> Plain download links are used for files rather than an " encrypted " link <p> No product inventory <p> Order management : no statuses or notes <p> No variation price changes <p> If you 'll be selling more than the occasional order or a limited product offering , then a more advanced eCommerce solution will probably be required . However , the plugin makes a good solution for a quick shop setup if only a few , mostly virtual products , are being created . <p> Note : This post was sponsored . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples but how did you write the shortcode to show two products with different prices with individual " add to cart buttons " within the same product box ?

@@98138233 @2338233/ <h> Build Customer Loyalty : Reward Customers <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Customer lifetime value is an important metric for any business . As acquisition costs for new customers are often high , increasing lifetime value ensures that your investment in acquiring the customer is profitable . So how do you encourage repeat purchases from your customers ? How do you build loyalty so customers return to shop at your store ? <p> Two major factors to consider are always quality and customer service . Your product quality and service have to justify purchasing from your store more than once . While product quality is entirely on you , weve already offered some tips on more efficient customer service . <p> However , most businesses that survive past a year have these bases covered , just like your store . How do you continue to build loyalty in a competitive environment ? What else can you do to encourage repeat business to differentiate yourself ? <p> One of the top methods is to reward your customers for their loyalty . <h> Effective Customer Loyalty Programs <p> Customer loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty , and are frequently included with tips like these from AWeber or Salesforce . The lack of a loyalty program is also my biggest complaint about Chipotle = . <p> My favorite resource on effective loyalty programs comes from Help Scout , who provides tons of great resources on improving customer service . Help Scout has a comprehensive customer loyalty resource available for free , and chapter 6 of this resource gives you some tips on creating effective rewards programs . <p> A few of these recommendations are particularly helpful for eCommerce stores . First , Help Scout digs into some research that shows giving customers a head start in a loyalty program yields better results . The experiment referenced involved loyalty punch cards at a car wash : one group had a punch card that required 8 washes to get a free car wash , while the second group was given a card that required 10 washes , but two were already punched . <p> Both groups required 8 washes to get a free car wash , but the second group yielded far higher conversions in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers a head start takes care of the hardest part in getting involved with a loyalty program : starting . Customers already have some points , so they 're eager to earn more and to ensure they do n't  waste the rewards they have . <p> The second recommendation Help Scout makes is to focus on your program goal . Many rewards programs flounder because the goal is n't appropriate . While most of the time your goal will be to increase purchases , this may not be an effective goal for a subscription service . Instead , you can provide points or credit for referrals . <p> Another recommendation is to use status in your rewards program . Providing tiers , such as silver or gold members , that progressively give access to more points or discounts can encourage customers to " level up " to another tier , and gives them the ego boost that comes with a gain in status . <p> Let 's take a look at some popular eCommerce platforms and see which of these recommendations we can implement with each . Regardless of which platform we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to earn and redeem points for purchases , so here are three platforms that allow you to create customer loyalty programs . <h> WooCommerce Customer Loyalty Programs <p> The most helpful plugin for creating a WooCommerce customer loyalty program is Points and Rewards ( $129 ) . This plugin let 's you create a system to earn and redeem points for purchases in your store . <h> Recommendation 1 : Give Customers a Head Start <p> Points and Rewards will allow you to assign points for actions other than purchasing when you set it up . If you 'd like to give customers a head start , you can give them some bonus points just for registering for an account to get them started : <h> Recommendation 2 : Set a Program Goal <p> However , this is where another plugin I like comes in : AffiliateWP ( $49+ ) . The freeStore Credit add-on works with WooCommerce to give affiliates store credit for every referral rather than assigning a commission . This means that you can set a $10 referral commission , and this will be assigned as credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use this credit to check out . <p> This referral credit system is not tied to Points and Rewards , so you can use AffiliateWP and Store Credit without Points and Rewards installed if you only want to give redeemable credit for referrals . <h> Recommendation 3 : Leverage Statuses for Points <p> Unfortunately there 's no automatic way to change statuses using Points and Rewards . However , you could create a manual system to " redeem " points for a membership . If a customer hits a particular point threshold ( i.e. , 10,000 points ) , they could submit a request to be " upgraded " . You could then have a customer role for " silver " or " gold " customers that provides a discount , emails a monthly coupon , or provides another benefit . <p> Points can be manually adjusted , so you can redeem the points manually , then assign the customer to this new purchasing role . You could use our tips on creating wholesale systems to create a similar discount system for these customers . <h> Easy Digital Downloads Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rewards extension ( its based off of the WooCommerce one ) for $59 , so you can achieve similar results . The setup for earning and redeeming points is the same . <h> Recommendation 1 : Give Customers a Head Start <p> You can also achieve this with Easy Digital Downloads . Unfortunately , you cant allow points to be earned for reviews , as these are n't  part of EDD core . However , you can provide points to customers who register an account to give them a head start . <h> Recommendation 2 : Set a Program Goal <p> EDD Points and Rewards encourages purchases but not referrals . However , the free Purchase Rewards extension can help out with this . While you cant offer a reward for a converted referral , you can offer a reward in the form of a discount for a purchase and social share . <p> When the customer shares the purchase at least once , the customer is then rewarded with a discount for a future purchase , encouraging a repeat visit . This does not require the Points and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards without creating an entire loyalty system . <h> Recommendation 3 : Leverage Statuses for Points <p> While you cant assign levels or statuses for points automatically , you can use a similar system to our WooCommerce recommendation : offer a customer role change for a set number of points . <p> When a customer contacts you to redeem the points for a role change , you can manually deduct the required points from the customers account , then update the customers role to the new role . Discounts Pro will let you create discounts specific to this " upgraded " role , and then you can send out codes or post them on your site since only these customers will be able to use the code . <h> WP eCommerce Customer Loyalty Programs <p> WP eCommerce shops can use the Shopper Rewards Extension ( $79 ) to add a simple points and rewards system to their sites . This plugin allows customers to earn points on purchases and redeem them on future purchases based on your rewards criteria ( you set up custom redemption criteria , such as whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <h> Recommendation 1 : Give Customers a Head Start <p> WP eCommerce does n't  make creating customer accounts easy , and assigning points for this process is not possible . For example , if you allow guest checkout at all , customers wont be prompted to register for an account at checkout . You must ( 1 ) enable open registration on your site , and ( 2 ) require store accounts for checkout in order to present a " register / login " prompt as part of the checkout process . Most stores keep guest checkout enabled , so account creation is n't typically coupled with checkout . <p> Regardless , there 's no way to reward customers for creating an account , nor is there a way to manually assign points via Shopper Rewards . You can assign points for previous purchases , however , using the " Import " function , so a workaround could be to manually create purchases for customers ( you 'd have to use a manual purchases plugin ) , mark them as paid / complete already , then import the additional points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program goal can add points for purchases , but there 's no way to reward referrals or other goals with WP eCommerce / via add-ons . <h> Recommendation 3 : Leverage Statuses for Points <p> Admins can manually redeem points for customers with Shopper Rewards , so you could manually create a role discount system for status rewards . However , the Role-based discounts plugin for WP eCommerce has been removed from WordPress.org , so there 's no way to create discounts based on role . <p> With some custom code , you could limit certain coupons to your upgraded role , but there 's no pre-built way to do so . <h> WordPress Customer Loyalty Programs : Summary <p> Building customer loyalty depends a lot on your product and service , but that does n't  mean there are other strategies you can follow to augment your efforts . Rewarding customers for loyalty , repeat purchases , or referrals is an excellent way to reward customers and encourage them to continue to purchase and support your store . <p> Existing extensions can make creating a customer loyalty program simple , and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that program goals are a good fit for your site , or tie statuses to points to make your rewards program more effective . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

If you sell products worth $20-$200 , this is usually a pretty good deal for affiliates , as they can make up to $20 on a single sale , and even more if customers purchase multiple products . However , let 's say a membership starts at $20 per month they 're only going to make $2 on your membership product . Making more will be difficult , as customers do n't  typically purchase multiple memberships at one time . Not a very compelling prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliate commissions . Typically , this flat fee is worth the first recurring payment , or even more . If we return to our $20 per month membership , the commission might be $20-$50 to entice affiliates to sell the plan . The goal behind this strategy is to get customers in the door , then make money after they 've been around for a bit . However , this shifts a great deal of the risk to you as the business owner ; affiliates are paid even if the customer leaves before you make money . <p> Recurring commissions allow you to keep the risk balanced between yourself and your affiliates while still making the sale enticing for your affiliate network . Rather than set up a one-time payment , you can set up a recurring percentage or fee for affiliate commissions on your subscription products . <p> This ensures that affiliates have a reason to promote your product while safeguarding you so that you do n't  run the risk of losing money on affiliate commissions . This also prevents affiliates from sending poor leads just to get the signup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affiliate to make money . <h> Creating Recurring Commissions for Memberships or Subscriptions <p> Setting up recurring commissions for affiliates is simple using AffiliateWP and the Recurring Referrals Add-on . All official add-ons , including Recurring Referrals , are available to Professional ( $199 ) or Ultimate ( $449 ) license holders . <p> When I say simple , I mean dead-simple . Recurring Referrals does all of the work for you . All you have to do is enable it when its been installed . <p> Enable Recurring Referrals <p> If installed , this will track recurring commissions if applicable for your memberships or subscriptions . Each time a new subscription or renewal order is placed , a new commission will be assigned to your affiliate for the appropriate percentage or fee . <p> In addition to the MemberMouse and MemberPress integrations that have just been added , you can use Recurring Referrals with the following platforms : <h> Pros and Cons of Recurring Commissions for Affiliates <p> So are there any downsides to paying affiliates recurring commissions ? There are always downsides to something = . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as recurring commissions could be lower than one-time payouts ( there are also no guarantees on what theyll make ) . They also have to depend on you to keep the customer around , which they have no influence on . <p> For example , the affiliate could do the legwork to bring you a new customer , and then only get one or two months worth of commissions if the customer is unhappy with your product or service . As an affiliate , this is frustrating since the sale was closed , which is what affiliates are typically paid to do they 're not paid to keep customers happy , as that 's on you . <p> While many affiliates like one-time signup commissions , that does n't  mean this is best for your business . However , if you 're going to provide recurring commissions , affiliates need to have a compelling reason to buy into your system and business . You can help with this by filling them in on your churn rates so they 're aware of how successful recurring commissions could be and perhaps rewarding some of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term customers . <p> Some affiliates will choose not to participate in recurring programs because they are n't  involved in maintaining customers , just in sending them , and they do n't  like their sales being tied to your businesss performance . However , there are also affiliates that will be encouraged to participate in an affiliate program that will reward them for sending valuable customers , as their potential earnings are higher with recurring commissions as time goes on . <p> Ultimately you 'll need to decide what will both make your affiliates happy and provide an acceptable risk for you as a business owner to then determine what kind of affiliate program you 'd like to run . AffiliateWP is already great for any kind of eCommerce affiliate program , but the option to provide recurring commissions is a huge bonus and makes it a great option for membership or subscription-based eCommerce businesses . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138237 @2338237/ <p> The eCommerce space in WordPress is constantly expanding with new plugins and extension , and Exchange is part of that expansion . Its one of the newest eCommerce offerings for WordPress , and is developed by popular theme shop iThemes . Exchanges minimalist approach to store setup ( most functionality is activated via add-ons ) makes it easy to use and tailor to store needs . However , this platform shows its youth with respect to extensibility , and while add-ons and features are in constant development , it needs some time to mature to offer a lot of store options . <p> Exchange is available as a freedownload from the iThemes website , and is also available on WordPress.org . Installation was easy , and the ability to test drive the plugin before purchasing extensions is obviously a plus . Theming does n't  seem to be an issue , as Exchange was compatible with the themes we tested . However , if you 'd like an Exchange-specific theme , you can purchase them from iThemes at $80 each ( bundles are available ) . <p> Premium Add-ons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access them directly from the WordPress admin : <p> Paid Add-ons in WordPress Admin <p> Ca n't find an add-on to do what you want ? With a public roadmap available , you can see if the functionality you want is in the works , as Exchange is a very young platform and does n't  have a lot of add-ons available as of yet . <h> Cost summary : <p> Free core plugin , which is great , and you may spend about $170 on add-ons or themes if you want them . Obviously , costs will grow as functionality is available be added . <p> Setup for Exchange is very easy , but some options are limited . For example , Exchange recommends that you only use one payment method , which will make your life difficult if you want to accept both credit cards and checks . Tax and shipping options are also basic . I did like that all Exchange settings and information is located under its own menu in the WP backend . <p> Backend : Admin Settings <p> One of the cool features of Exchange is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Want to enable only physical products and get rid of downloadable products ? No big deal . You can also decide whether you need shipping or tax included , and more . You can enable or disable add-ons , including built-in add-ons , right from the WordPress admin : <p> Backend : Managing Add-ons <p> One thing users may want to note is that you ca n't edit Exchange pages from the WordPress admin . You 'll also have to make sure you add them to your navigation , as they wont be added automatically and are in their own category . <p> Backend : Navigation Setup <p> One small usability note is that orders are called " Payments " , which was a bit confusing to me at first . You have to go to Exchange &gt; Payments to view order information . You can only edit order status , and can not update customer information , add notes , or manually create orders . <h> Tax Options <p> You can enable simple tax options as an add-on if you 're selling physical goods . However , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied to all products . If you sell both physical and digital goods , this may not be ideal if you 're not required to assess tax on digital goods in your region . You cant change this on a per-product basis . <p> Backend : Tax Options <h> Products <p> Exchange allows you to add simple ( " physical " ) , downloadable , and virtual ( " simple " ) products . " Simple " products seem a bit redundant now that physical products are supported ( functionality that was just added ) , as simple/virtual product addition appears to be exactly the same as physical product addition when shipping is disabled . <p> Despite the seeming iteration of simple virtual product addition , adding any kind of product is easy and intuitive using Exchange , as products are added using a custom post type . You can choose which kind of product addition to enable , then add info such as a short and/or extended description , images , and more from the product editor : <p> Backend : Adding Products <p> Downloadable product addition is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to add download limits and expirations : <p> Backend : Adding Downloadable Products <p> One downside is that Exchange does not currently support variable product addition , so you 'll have to add all of those tee shirt variations as individual products , which will clog up your store catalog a bit if you 're selling variable products . <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Presently Exchange does n't  support shortcodes to add products to pages or posts , which is a bit of a downer if you want to organize product display in any way ( for example , by category ) . You also ca n't feature a product in a post , and will have to link to the product page instead . However , it does offer a " super widget " , which will display a shopping cart , buy now information , and more : <p> Customers will find that Exchange handles the basic frontend experience well , but is in need of some growth to build a truly great user experience . The customer account section is handled very well , and customers can view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy and clear , but there are a few downsides . First , the shopping page only displays 2 columns of products in the grid display : <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> While this is better than a list view , it will still be a bit difficult to navigate for stores with hundreds of products . There 's also no way to segment browsing by product category or other attributes , and since shortcodes are not supported , you cant set this up on your own , which will make browsing tedious for customers of larger stores . <p> Product pages are clear and allow you to add multiple product images . Customers can also scroll over images to zoom in . Call to action buttons will be added by default , or will transition to the super widget if in use . <p> Frontend : Product Page <p> The shopping cart is easy to get to and use , and I liked that customers can apply discounts without having to click on a link to do so . Quantities are also adjustable from the cart page : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of steps to complete , and guest checkout is not currently supported ( this is on the roadmap as " coming soon " ) . Customers have to submit a shipping address ( or billing address if you have this enabled ) , then select shipping options to check out . Payment options are also limited at the moment , but more options are being added soon . However , you could go through the entire checkout using the super widget , which is kind of cool . <p> Exchanges payment and shipping options are limited at present , but more options are in development . <h> Payment Options <p> Exchange supports offline payments , Stripe , and PayPal Standard out of the box . However , installing only one payment method is recommended , which puts a damper on accepting credit cards and another payment form , such as checks or payment on pickup . Authorize.net , PayPal Pro , and 2Checkout are in development . <p> Payment Options <h> Shipping Options <p> Shipping options are also very simple , and are enabled as an add-on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Free shipping is enabled for all products if allowed ( permitting the customer to choose , which is not what you want ) , and ca n't be set on a per-product basis , rendering it a bit useless . <p> Flat rate shipping is set as one rate , and is not based on zone or region . However , you can override a products shipping charge to increase or decrease shipping . This will allow you to set free shipping , as you can set an items shipping to $0.00 ( which again , is why I feel like free shipping is a bit useless in the current form ) . Basically , youd want to choose one shipping method , and it would obviously be flat rate unless you ship all products for free ( although , you could just set the flat rate to $0 if that 's the case for the sake of flexibility ) . I 'd rather see custom methods , such as " standard " and " expedited " , as both methods would actually be useful , rather than the free shipping option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Exchange includes only basic sales stats , which can be enabled for the WordPress dashboard , and provides no real reporting . However , it looks like a more advanced reporting add-on is on the roadmap for future release . <p> Sales Tracking in Dashboard <h> Inventory <p> Exchange also includes basic inventory management , which can be set on a per-product basis ( useful if you sell both physical and digital goods ) . However , notifications for low or out-of-stock items are not available . <p> iThemes offers free community forums for basic Exchange issues ( with fairly prompt responses ) , and paid support subscriptions for all other issues at $47 per month . Basic issues brought up at WordPress.org are also answered in a timely manner . However , documentation and video tutorials are pretty extensive , which should help many new users with setup and troubleshooting . Paid support will probably be most useful for stores that use a variety of plugins or add-ons in case of compatibility issues . Support is also included with some bundles . <p> The public roadmap available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and has a way to go before its fully functional as an eCommerce solution . The Recurring Payments Add-on , which is also included in the purchase of the newMemberships Add-on , is one of the most interesting add-ons , as it allows stores to create subscription products . <p> The addition of a membership add-on also starts to make Exchange a more compelling platform , as it expands the possible use past simple and downloadable products . iThemes wrote an introduction to the Memberships Add-on upon launch with more details . <p> Exchange is a light-weight , well-executed , minimalist plugin for WordPress eCommerce . While the plugin is immature and has a ways to go before it can be considered a fully-functional solution for larger stores , its beginning with a very solid foundation , and I like the approach that iThemes has taken by making a lot of core functionality optional to tailor the plugin to a stores needs . Basic options are very limited , and the inability to add variable products will eliminate Exchange as a contender for some stores . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more add-ons are developed and the core offering is refined . Overall , Exchange is a young , but very promising eCommerce platform . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article ; If I did n't  test it , I 'm basing my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

@@98138238 @2338238/ <p> This series includes detailed reviews of WordPress eCommerce Plugins and Platforms . <h> Ecwid Review <p> Ecwid has been an interesting competitor in the WordPress market since its launch in 2009 . While Ecwid is n't truly a WordPress plugin , it does integrate with WordPress sites and provides a managed shopping solution ( similar to Cart66 Cloud ) . At its heart , Ecwid is a SaaS solution for eCommerce stores : all store management takes place within your Ecwid account , including inventory and product management , as well as payment processing . Your store and content is then displayed on your site or mirrored anywhere you choose , such as in your Facebook store as well as within your primary website . While this makes inventory management easy , as all " stores " draw their information from a central source , it does limit flexibility since developers are limited by the Ecwid API for customizations and changes . <p> Pricing for Ecwid is tiered based on the number of products in your store and your stores needs . Free plans are available for stores with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $82.50 per month for stores with greater than 2500 products . All plans come with varied payment and shipping options , but you 'll need to upgrade for more products , and support or marketing tools ( such as coupons and discounts which are not included in the free plan ) . However , the free plan is a great place to start if you 'd like to check out how the software works . If you 'd like to see a demo instead , they also have one available as well as a full feature list . <p> Since Ecwid integrates your store content into a " store " page using JavaScript , so theming should n't be an issue and you 'll probably be able to save some money here . You can also change the store design if you 're familiar with CSS . There are themes available on ThemeForest for Ecwid if you do want a new theme , but its designed to work well with the website you already have . However , you will need to upgrade from a free plan to get access to coupons , volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality , and more . <h> Cost summary : <p> Since theming costs will be up to you , store costs will range from free to $82.50 per month ( $990 per year ) . <p> Since Ecwid is a hosted solution , some of your setup will have to be done within your WordPress admin , and the rest will be done in your Ecwid account . Basic appearance settings are handled within the WordPress integration plugin , while tax and shipping options , as well as product and order creation and management are handled from the Ecwid backend . You can also check out the guide for WordPress installation for help . <p> The first thing you 'll have to do get started is register for an Ecwid account , and go through the setup steps listed in your account when you log in : <p> Ecwid Store Setup <p> Obviously , well be selecting WordPress in our case , and were directed to download the WordPress plugin : <p> Ecwid setup for WordPress <p> After you 've grabbed your store I 'd , you can put in in the Ecwid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WordPress integration <p> Once your Ecwid account is connected to your WordPress site , you can then configure your stores appearance in the WordPress backend under Ecwid &gt; Appearance : <p> Ecwid Plugin Settings <p> If you want to change the way your store looks , set up a category structure for products , or change other options , you 'll need to log in to your Ecwid account to do so . Most options are under System Settings , such as the ability to enable or disable guest checkout and more . <p> Ecwid Store Settings <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options allow you to create tax rates based on regions where you 'll be selling and shipping . You can configure a general tax , then set rates by region ( for example , set a physical goods tax and a virtual goods tax ) . You can set as many taxes as necessary , and divide each rate into separate regions . <p> Ecwid Tax Rates <h> Products <p> Product setup and configuration is also done from your Ecwid admin rather than within WordPress . Before setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; Categories , as there 's no way to bulk-edit product details and you 'll have to go back and set up categories for each product later if you do n't  have them done in advance . You can also set up sub-categories if you 'd like to break up large categories like " Home " . <p> You can also set product types , which each have certain attributes . For example , a " clothing " type product will have space for brands , gender , colors and more . Adding product types prior to configuring products will also help you out so that you do n't  have to go back and edit each product later . <p> Product Types for Attributes <p> Once your product categories and types are set up , I 'd then move on to product addition . Simple product addition is pretty easy to figure out , as it contains many of the same fields and options as other eCommerce solutions . You only have one description for Ecwid products versus a short and long description in some other WordPress plugins , but other features and fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to set Brands under " Attributes " , which I know is a must-have for some store owners , and you can set related products for cross-sells . Ecwid also allows you to set up a product image gallery for each product . While this wo n't change to reflect selections for variable products , you can label each image appropriately . <p> Ecwid Product Addition <p> You can also get fine-tuned control over product options , such as the ability to set individual stock levels and low stock notifications for each variation . However , this is only available to Business account users . <p> Variable product addition is also pretty easy , but will not allow you to manage inventory for each variation with some accounts . To create a variable product , you 'll simply go through the same setup as a simple product , but will then add product options under the " Options " tab . Options are what will change about the product , such as color or size . You can then add selections for each option , which would be the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes , such as small or medium . <p> Creating Variable Products <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Ecwid comes with four built-in widgets . Two will add the " Shopping Bag " ( cart ) to your sites frontend ( each with a different style ) , while the others add a product search and product categories list . <p> Ecwid displays products based on category by default , and there are no widgets or options to display new products , featured products , or best sellers . You can use the free Ecwid Product Advisor plugin to show random products , bestsellers , as well as on-sale and latest products using a shortcode or widget instead if you 're looking for this functionality . <p> Categories and subcategories are fixed at the top of the page , and users can navigate using this tabbed menu , or can drill down to what they 're looking for by clicking on the appropriate categories , subcategories , and items : <p> Catalog Menu / Navigation <p> Ecwid Catalog View <p> Navigation will be intuitive for most customers , and the tabbed menu provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling down for a product . Simple and variable product pages are clean and display product information , attributes , and related products ( if selected ) : <p> Simple Product Frontend <p> Variable Product Frontend <p> Customers can easily add products to the shopping bag , and you can optionally force customers to view their shopping bag with product addition . You can also float the shopping bag below the catalog , or place it in a widget . When customers view their bag , then can adjust quantities , product variations ( size , etc ) and remove items if needed : <p> Shopping Bag View <p> From the bag , customers can view a cart estimated total and proceed to checkout . The checkout process for Ecwid is not a one-step checkout , which has the potential to lower conversions as it provides more opportunity for the customer to abandon the purchase . However , it is easy to follow and quick to complete , so it shouldnt pose too many difficulties to customers while they complete their transactions . <p> The number of shipping and payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set shipping rates or calculate them based on your carrier , and can select from several payment methods and processors to integrate into your Ecwid store . <h> Payment Options <p> Ecwid has several payment solutions bundled into the core product , such as Authorize.net SIM , First Data , Sage Pay , iDeal ( Mollie ) for our Dutch friends , and others . Stripe is also included , which is a huge bonus for us as were big fans of using Stripe for payment processing ( though this is n't advertised for US customers and I was pleasantly surprised to discover it ) . You can also accept offline payments and PayPal . <p> Ecwid Payments Setup <h> Shipping Options <p> Ecwid also contains a lot of built-in shipping methods , and you can create several methods to fit your stores needs . You can obtain carrier-calculated rates from various carriers , including FedEx , UPS , and others . If you do n't  have an account with a carrier , you can use the default Ecwid account for fairly accurate estimates based on a default package size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrier Shipping Method Setup <p> You can also set flat-rate shipping based on a set amount or an order percentage and include a delivery estimate . Using a flat rate will also allow you to create a free shipping method , though this can not be tied to the order total and will always be presented as an option . Ecwid also allows you to set a rate table based on subtotal or weight . <p> Table Rate Shipping <p> Finally , you can also adjust shipping on a per-product basis , which is great if you have products you want to set free shipping for without enabling it for the entire catalog : <p> Ecwid has built-in order management so that you can view sales , but has no built-in reporting options . <h> Inventory <p> Inventory management is easy and functional within the Ecwid admin . While setting up a product , you can choose whether inventory should be unlimited or set inventory levels and optionally set a low-stock level for notifications . <p> Inventory Management <p> To effectively manage inventory for variable products , you 'll need at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you cant manage inventory based on product options with lower level accounts . <p> My experiences with Ecwid were good , as I received a couple of on-boarding emails after creating my free account which offered a free set-up consultation and encouragement in finishing store setup . <p> Ecwid On-boarding Email <p> All users have access to the knowledge base and community forums for support . The knowledge base does a good job of covering setup and general questions , but I found Ecwid to be pretty easy to use after playing around with all settings for a couple of hours . They state that their goal is to make a product so user friendly that a guide is n't necessary , and I think the product comes close . <p> In order to access ticketed or live chat support you 'll have to set up a paid account . All paid account have access to community and email support , but only business plans and above have access to live chat . Unlimited plans ( &gt; 2500 products ) also provide access to desktop sharing and store setup consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank boxes pop up , like the ones below . Not sure where these are coming from or if it could be fixed , as the problem was intermittent and it was n't a huge issue so I did n't  take the time to diagnose it . Note : Check out this comment , which states that this issue is being fixed . <p> Ecwid Glitches <p> Another consideration is the fact that Ecwid is AJAX powered , which typically does n't  help your sites SEO since search engines cant index all content . As one of the huge benefits of using WordPress is the fact that its SEO-friendly , this can be a downer . However , this will help store speed for clients using less than optimal hosting services . As always , everything has an opportunity cost = . <p> So now on to some positives : Ecwid has the ability to set a minimum and maximum subtotal for checkout built-in . Under System Settings &gt; General &gt; Cart in the Ecwid admin , you can optionally set values for minimum and maximum subtotals . Ecwid also boasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , and a CSV importer for products . <p> Ecwid is a great platform for non-technical users . Its easy to install and set up , and provides some pretty robust options for payments and shipping . I see it as a great solution for store owners that want an easy , all-in-one solution , and benefit from the ability to mirror their store in multiple places , such as on a website and Facebook store ( especially if they already have a site and want to add store functionality ) . However , there are some trade-offs to consider . First , Ecwid does n't  support recurring billing , so subscription and membership products are out the window . You 'll also be trading flexibility and the potential for customizations by using a hosted cart solution , as developers are limited to using the API for changes rather than diving into the software itself . You also lose out on the fact that search engines gobble up WordPress content , and plugins that use custom post types for products enable this process rather than block it ( as Ecwid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider that moving data between Ecwid and other solutions may not be as easy as a truly WordPress-based solution . <p> On the whole , Ecwid is a solid solution for basic stores selling physical and digital goods , and will work well for users that want to sell products from multiple avenues , but lacks the flexibility of other solutions . <p> p&gt;Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

We appreciate your contribution . <p> I 'd like to add a few comments , if you do n't  mind . Hopefully , they will be useful for you and the readers of the article . 1 ) SEO Ecwid plugin for WordPress automatically makes store products and categories indexable by search engines , even though Ecwid is indeed AJAX-based , as you properly noticed . For that , Ecwid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search engines and has already proven to work well with Ecwid stores in WordPress store products get to search results as well as the other static site pages . <p> 2 ) iframes You mentioned iframe when describing the way Ecwid is integrated into a WP page . In fact , Ecwid does n't  use iframe , rather does it directly integrate store widgets into page HTML structure using Javascript . It is actually one of the greatest unique Ecwid advantages . We want an online store to be an integral part of your website , therefore iframes are n't  an option , they are n't  flexible enough and have a lot of limitations . With Ecwid approach , a store is a part of website , so for example you can change the store design with the websites CSS code . <p> 3 ) Small blank boxes pop up issue Thank you for noticing this . Please let me know which theme you were using when discovered that so that we could fix the issue . <p> Hi Matvey , thanks so much for your comment ! I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigate the difference between an AJAX site and pure HTML pages , but ( to my understanding ) does n't  completely overcome the difference . I appreciate this does far improve the SEO of AJAX-based systems , but to me is a valid point of comparison since there is still a difference in SEO compatibility . <p> I 've updated the part about iframing to be more accurate , as I realized saying " essentially iframes " is a poor comparison from a technical perspective , and have used some of your explanation instead . As for the box issue , I test everything using TwentyTwelve with nothing else active . Hope this helps ! 
@@98138239 @2338239/ <p> This series includes detailed reviews of WordPress eCommerce Plugins and Platforms . <h> WP eStore Review <p> WP eStore is one of the more mature WordPress eCommerce plugins available , as its been in development for about five years . While it works for stores with physical products , it seems to more frequently be a contender for stores with digital products or memberships due to the ability to encrypt download links and the inclusion of recurring billing ( along with eMembers integration ) . Our WP eStore Review will cover how the plugin handles some basic eCommerce functionality . <h> Base and Ancillary Costs <p> WP eStore is a premium WordPress plugin , so you 'll need to purchase the plugin to fully test it out and see if it will work for your store . The initial purchase price is $50 , which includes an unlimited license for the plugin ( you can install it on as many sites as you own not a developer license ) . The purchase price includes all functionality , so you wont have to buy add-ons to get subscription pricing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also means that you ca n't use bolt-on extensions to customize your store , and you may not end up using all of the plugins features . <p> WP eStore worked well with the few themes we tested , so we do n't  anticipate that theming would be an issue and shouldnt incur a major cost . <h> Cost summary : <p> Since all eCommerce function is included in the core plugin and theming should n't be an issue , you can expect to stay close to the $50 price tag for your store . <h> Overview and Usability <p> One thing that sticks out about WP eStore is that there are tons of settings for you to slog through before your store is up and running . Almost every plugin on earth likes to boast about a " quick and easy installation / setup " , but many are lying this one is unfortunately in that group . In its defense , many of the default settings will work , but I would n't recommend setting up shop without making sure your store is set up to your exact specifications , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless this is done . <h> Installation and Setup <p> WP eStore Menu <p> When you install WP eStore , the plugin creates a new menu item solely dedicated to running your shop . This is where you 'll manage settings , products , coupons , and customers . You can also view sales stats and other pertinent store information . <p> I first went through all of the plugin settings after installing . There 's ample documentation available for setup , which you 'll probably end up using . Many of the settings link to the relevant documentation by way of explanation , so I found myself digging through the docs while making sure that all settings were configured . <p> There are also video tutorials you can follow along with for setup , though admittedly I did n't  use many of these ( I almost alway hate videos and prefer reading I 'm not sorry = ) . Apparently they are " must view " , so I 'm sure I broke some rules , but I did manage to set everything solely using the documentation . <p> One thing that surprised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they 're not automatically created upon installation , nor are there any shortcuts to creating necessary pages . The theory behind this is to offer greater customization in store setup . <p> WP eStore Pages Settings <p> If you look at the plugin as an option for digital goods rather than a traditional shop , then you may like this setup . Rather than having a static catalog with all available products ( though this is possible ) , you can instead create customized product or shopping pages , and can optionally create a customized checkout page . The ability to provide long-form copy and customized selling pages may work well for stores with a few premium products . <p> Other things of note : first , I appreciated that you can include a terms &amp; conditions page , which is very helpful for your digital products . Along the same vein , you can also use a squeeze page to collect information ( i.e. , email addresses ) for your free products . There 's also a setting that allows you to provide a minimum or maximum checkout price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the plugin , but are very basic . You can enter one default tax rate for your entire store , and decide whether to tax shipping or not . You can also override this tax on a per-product basis if needed ( for example , if selling both digital and physical goods , which frequently have different tax rates ) . However , you cant set multiple tax rates for stores with nexus in several states in the US or selling internationally . <p> Tax Rates / Settings <h> Products <p> Before you set up any products , I would create product categories first . Unfortunately , this will require you to plan how your product catalog should be set up before you actually get started , but there are a couple of reasons for doing this . First , you cant add a new product category while creating or editing a product , so you need to have the categories available before doing this . Second , its far easier to assign categories while creating products than doing it later . As there 's no way to bulk-edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category after its been created . <p> After categories are out of the way , you can start adding products . There are a lot of options available , which has both positives and negatives . For simple products , this can be an overload and most options are n't  necessary . However , you can definitely customize the way you sell your products with the included options . I would have appreciated a way to select my product type first , then only seen relevant product options to simplify this screen . <p> Adding Products <p> You can add multiple images per product , set pricing , additional shipping charges ( good for oversized items ) , and override tax rates . You can set up product variations from this screen as well . You may want to reference the documentation for some help setting up variable products , as there are n't  detailed instructions within the plugin and I screwed up a couple times before reading it . <p> Variable Products <p> One of the cool things you can do with variations is optionally add costs for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra costs for both a certain size or color for each variation that will be in addition to the base product price . <p> There are some handy options for digital products , such as the ability to set download expiration times , download limits , and encrypting download links ( which prevents customers from finding where your downloads are stored ) . WP eStore also allows you to set up licensing rules for those of you selling software or other licensed products ( you 'll have to create a pool of license keys to choose from ) . <p> Digital Product Options <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Shortcodes are going to be the most integral part in setting up your shop for browsing . There are several shortcodes included with WP eStore , so you 'll want to read the full shortcode reference that 's available to help out . <p> To add an Add to Cart button for a given product , you can simply add wpeStoreaddtocart id=PRODUCT-ID into your post , page , landing page , or wherever you 're selling the product . Replace PRODUCT-ID with the actual product i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your products can be found in the Manage Products section of the WP eStore menu . <p> Using this shortcode wont display product images or provide an attractive layout , so you can alternatively use the wpeStorefancy1 id=1 or wpeStorefancy2 id=1 shortcodes instead : <p> Fancy Product Shortcodes <p> I did n't  like that there 's no feedback to alert the customer that the product has been added to the cart , as customers may end up adding an item multiple times before checking the cart ( though you can add an AJAX action to provide feedback under " Advanced settings " for one possible solution ) . You can also get around this by adding a shopping cart to your product pages instead . <p> To add shopping cart that 's constantly present , you can use the wpeStorecart shortcode ( you can also use this to create a static Cart page ) . If you only want the cart to appear when it contains items , then you can use the wpeStorecartwhennotempty or **30;2088;TOOLONG ( fancy version ) shortcodes . <p> Finally , that takes us to catalog display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it will be up to you to create your product catalog . You can display a list of products in a category using this shortcode : LONG ... ( replace with the appropriate category i 'd ) , or you can display all products with this : **30;2120;TOOLONG . <p> Note that all display shortcodes use a list format rather than a grid format ( which is very helpful for browsing catalog with large numbers of products ) . I could not find a way to create a grid layout without manually creating a product catalog using my own columns / rows . <p> Finally , you can also display your shopping cart using a widget instead of a shortcode , which can also give feedback when a product is added to the cart : <p> eStore Cart Widget <h> Customer Experience <p> The customer experience while browsing your store will be entirely up to you . You can create your own product pages with long-form sales copy , or create a catalog page for a category or all products . This will allow you to determine the customer experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on the best layout and approach . <p> If you want to create individual product pages for each product , be aware that you need to create the product page manually , then add the URL of that page to the " Additional Product Details " for the product page URL . This will change the product name to a link wherever that product is displayed , which takes the user to the product page that has more details . <p> If you choose to create a catalog page , be aware that products will be displayed in a list form . I recommend using one of the fancy layout shortcodes for your products if you go this route . If you want to create a grid catalog , you 'll have to do so manually ( which may not be feasible for those of you with large product quantities ) . <p> Shop Page <p> One thing you should be aware of while structuring your products is how the image galleries work . Only the featured product image is shown to customers while browsing , and there 's no indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image in a lightbox , you are able to scroll through the entire image gallery . You should inform customers of this in the product description ( i.e. , include " Click for more images " right away in the description ) . <p> Image Gallery <p> Since your product pages or catalog pages and store structure are really up to you , the customer experience will depend on your setup and decisions . This requires more planning on your part and more setup , but does afford you some customization on how your store is arranged . <p> After customers select the items for purchase , you can display the shopping cart on your catalog / product pages , or on an individual cart page by using the cart shortcode . You can choose from a regular shopping cart or from a fancy cart layout : <p> Regular Cart <p> Fancy Cart <p> Notice the save and retrieve buttons in the cart . This allows customers to save their carts for later purchase if enabled under your settings . <p> Finally , customers will go through the checkout process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be redirected to the checkout page . You can create a customized checkout page for your checkout , but can not rename your checkout methods on the page . For example , you can use Authorize.net for credit card processing . However , you cant rename this gateway to " credit cards " so that customers understand what its for ( as they probably have n't heard of Authorize.net ) . The checkout options use a one-page checkout , so it should be simple for customers , but theyll be redirected to another site for payment methods other than the " manual " method , which may result in a decrease in conversions . <h> Built-in Payment and Shipping Options <p> There are basic built-in shipping options and payment gateway integrations available for WP eStore along with a paid upgrade for payment gateways . However , I could n't find any shipping integrations what you see with shipping is what you get , so if you have complex shipping needs , then this may not work for you . <h> Payment Options <p> WP eStore offers a few payment gateway options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks ) , Authorize.net DPM ( redirected to an Authorize.net pay page ) , and 2Checkout . Since these payment methods do n't  collect sensitive payment information on your site ( they all redirect the checkout through the payment providers servers ) , you wo n't need an SSL certificate installed on your site . <p> If you want work with a different payment gateway , you can purchase a payment gateways add-on for $40 that includes other options from PayPal , Authorize.net , SagePay , Stripe , and more ( the upgrade includes all of these rather than selling them individually ) . Keep in mind that you may need an SSL certificate if you use a different payment method . <h> Shipping Options <p> WP eStore allows you to set basic shipping charges per order and additional shipping charges per each item . You can set flat shipping rates per order , then create a " shipping variation " that can optionally add costs to that rate . For example , if you create a flat $5 rate , you can then add additional shipping costs based on region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the regions specified ) . Adding a cost will be in addition to the store rate plus any product rate/surcharge that 's set . <p> Shipping Rates <p> However , these rates do n't  work perfectly . If you set a store rate , but the product does n't  have its own shipping rate , then no shipping will be charged to the customer . This is so that you do n't  charge shipping for digital products , but it makes setup a bit of a pain . The way I got around this was by making my store shipping rate $0.01 , then setting a shipping rate for every product ( $4.99 or higher for oversized items to bring the shipping total to the desired rate ) , then leaving the shipping blank for digital products so its not charged at all . <p> This could be solved by selecting a product type to begin with , then clearing any shipping charges for a digital product type . However there are no product types , which is why shipping must be configured this way . <p> While this is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more involved . You can ready more about shipping options in the plugin documentation . <h> Reporting and Inventory Management <p> WP eStore has basic reporting and store stats capabilities built in , which include total sales by amount and item quantity . <p> Store Stats <h> Inventory <p> Inventory management is included , and inventory is set on a per-product basis . However , there 's no alerts for low-stock so you 'll need to keep an eye on stock yourself . A " Sold Out " button is displayed to customers if the product has no copies / stock left . <p> Inventory Management <p> This can help you set limits on the amount of " available " digital copies of a product if you 're trying to create scarcity ( i.e. , offering 50 copies at a reduced price , then the item at full price ) . <h> Support <p> Support is included with a plugin purchase from Tips and Tricks HQ . Users have access to a support forum and the publicly available full plugin documentation for help . Anyone can view most of the topics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post threads for help ( and view some protected threads ) . <p> I did n't  use the support forum , so I cant really comment on response times or quality . I did use the documentation for the plugin in several instances , which I found helpful . <h> Other Features and Comments <p> There are some interesting features and add-ons available for WP eStore . Customers can specify a price for a product , which can be useful for donations or " pay what you want " products , though you cant set a minimum payment amount for these products . <p> If you want to extend the WP eStore functionality , you 'll want check out the free WP eStore add-ons . There are n't  many available , but there are handy add-ons for bulk discounts and subscription discounts . <p> WP eStore is also fully integrated with the Tips and Tricks membership plugin WP eMember so you can easily create a membership site . The structure for digital products and recurring billing is already included , so eMember helps with restriction and access rules . Integrations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and GetResponse ) . <p> WP eStore also allows you to change product pricing easily . You can create coupons or discounts based on a number of rules . For example , you can offer free shipping based on cart total , and can offer other discounts based on cart totals or for specific products . <p> Coupon Creation <p> You can also change pricing by setting up recurring billing for a product based on a number of days , months , or years . You can also set free trial periods or signup fees . <p> Recurring Billing Settings <p> As a final note , you can also view a list of customers , or a list of customers based on the products theyve purchased . This can be useful for sending up-sell or cross-sell emails to customers based on previous purchases . You can also view and update the payment status , but the customer management is basic , and a new customer is generated for every order , even if purchases are made by the same person using the same email . <h> WP eStore Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fit for digital products than for physical products ( which is what the plugin is primarily geared towards ) . The plugin lacks bulk product editing options , effective order handling ( or the ability to view all orders for a customer ) , or flexible tax and shipping options . Once more than a few orders are processed per day , order management will probably become more integral to the store admin process than this plugin can handle , so there are better choices for stores that sell physical products ( though these options may be more expensive overall ) . <p> For digital products , WP eStore becomes far more compelling , as the limitations with shipping and tax options become almost irrelevant , and there are a lot of handy options for digital products . Encrypted download links , download link expiration and limits , as well as the ability to set license keys for products all provide great options for digital goods . <p> If you 're selling primarily digital products , then WP eStore may become a contender for you . Order management and limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical products , but the inclusion of secure downloads , license keys , and recurring billing for a fixed price of $50 make WP eStore viable for stores with digital offerings . <p> Full Disclosure : Tips and Tricks HQ provided a trial copy of their plugin ( at our request ) to allow this review to be written . The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 5 Comments <p> I 'm working on a website for a client and looking for a shopping cart .

@@98138240 @2338240/ <h> Ask Sell with WP : Authorize vs Authorize and Capture <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> What 's the difference between authorizing a charge versus authorizing and capturing a charge with a payment processor or a gateway integration ? <p> Authorize vs. authorize and capture is a topic that many eCommerce merchants are n't  used to at first , so here 's a breakdown . <p> Many brick-and-mortar stores are no stranger to authorizing a charge then capturing at a later time . For example , let 's say you 're filling up your gas tank . The gas station usually authorizes a charge greater than the typical price of a full tank ( usually $100 , which sometimes irritates people at first ) . Authorizing does n't  actually charge the customer ; it simply verifies the customer is able to pay the total cost based on funds available or the customers credit limit . Authorizing a charge is usually valid for a period of 10 days , but this varies depending on several factors , such as which type of card is used . <p> Once the total price is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in a payment from the customer . The capture is what transfers the money to the merchants account and finalizes the charge against the customers credit . Typically merchant accounts will allow any charge lower than , or up to , the authorization amount ( which is why many gas stations authorize such a large amount ) . If you authorize and capture , these two processes happen at the same time and you do n't  have to manually capture the charge at a later time . <p> So how does this relate to eCommerce ? The easiest example I can give you is Amazon . When you place an order with Amazon , the total amount for the order is authorized on your card . However , that charge is n't actually captured until the order is shipped and on its way to you . Many eCommerce merchants like to replicate this practice in case an order is cancelled before shipping , which is why they like payment integrations that allow you to first authorize charges rather than simultaneously capture them . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture a higher value later ? Example : a rental clothes ecommerce ( woocommerce ) . In the case when the custumer did not return the clothes or return it damaged . I 'm wondering if Paypal can make it in authorization mode Using a plugin . Thank you very much ! <p> Hey Andressa , most payment processors do n't  allow you capture more than is authorized . Restaurants / gas stations typically need a pre-approved SIC code to do this , and I 'm not aware of any eCommerce processors that allow this unfortunately .

The admin UI is improved , along with better invoices and saved card management for customers . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : Improved Content Restriction UI <p> The biggest ( and most welcome ) change to Restrict Content Pro with this release is the improved restriction metabox . In previous versions , all possible restriction options were displayed to users while editing pages , posts , or other content . <p> RCP 2.5 content restriction <p> This could be a bit overwhelming when setting up restriction rules , and all of the options only applied if you actually wanted to restrict the content . <p> Version 2.6 rethinks this restriction box to first determine if the content even should be restricted . <p> RCP 2.6 Restriction box <p> If not , you wont be shown all of the possible restriction options , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the content should be restricted , you can determine whether you 'd like to restrict it by subscription level , access level , or user role . <p> When restricting by subscription level , you can limit access to any subscriber , only paid subscribers , or specific subscription levels . <p> Or , you could restrict your content based on the users role within your site instead of using subscription or access level . <p> These changes make the restriction meta box much easier to understand and use while creating restriction rules for content . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : Improved Payment Invoices <p> The payment invoices available to customers have been improved with version 2.6 as well . Previous version of Restrict Content Pro used a PDF generation library to create invoices , and used a two-column layout to display company and invoice details . <p> RCP 2.5 Invoice <p> Version 2.6 replaces this with a generated HTML invoice that customers can then print regularly , or print to PDF . The new invoices feature a single-column invoice that puts the company logo into greater focus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.6 Invoice <p> Members can still access invoices within the subscription details page in the same way . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : Update Saved Cards <p> The rcpupdatecard shortcode gets an update with this release for wider support . This shortcode adds a form that allows customers to update saved credit card details for their subscriptions ( its best used on the subscription details page ) . <p> Previously , this shortcode only allowed customers to update credit cards saved with Stripe , but support has been added for saved PayPal payment methods as well . <p> Update PayPal cards <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : Content Drip Add-on <p> One of the biggest announcements related to version 2.6 was n't quite part of the release . The improvements to the content restriction UI allowed for a drip content add-on to be released a couple days after version 2.6 . This is not included in the basic Restrict Content Pro purchase ; instead , it requires professional license at $199 ( which gets you access to all Pro add-ons ) . <p> However , content dripping is a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price to access the pro add-ons . This allows you delay access to restricted content for members for a time period , ensuring that members cant access everything in the membership immediately , then cancel . You can set a delay for different types of content based on the members subscription level , and this will delay the members access to that content . <p> When creating or editing a subscription level , you can add dripping rules for subscribers of this level . Content can be dripped on an individual post or page basis . For example , you can show some posts immediately , but then delay others so that members can access a new post each day into the membership . <p> Dripping from Subscription level <p> You can also add rules for entire taxonomies at once , such as a rule that grants access to all " Video " category posts after a month . <p> If you do n't  want to set up rules from the subscriptions level pages , you can also create new dripping rules while editing or adding content . The restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content you 're editing , and you can determine when different subscription levels should be able to access the content . <p> Dripping from post editor <p> Since its helpful to see what content members have access to , a rcpdripmembercontent shortcode is available . When used on a page , this will display a list of all of the content the member can access . <p> If content is n't yet accessible , the member will see when theyll have access . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : For Developers <p> Developers can now take advantage of two new APIs for subscription level meta and payment meta . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 : Other Changes <p> There are some additional minor changes and fixes within Restrict Content Pro 2.6 that refine the admin and member experiences . <p> The admin tables ( such as members list ) and views are now responsive , ensuring you can easily manage your site from a mobile device . This also resulted in slight improvements in quick actions and general display . <p> Comments are now restricted if the content they 're attached to is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alipay support has been added to Stripe Checkout . <p> An add-ons page has been added to help you find new pro or free add-ons for Restrict Content Pro . <h> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 Review <p> Restrict Content Pro 2.6 brings some very welcome changes to the content restriction UI for site administrators , along with some nice refinements for customers . The restriction box changes were a massive win for this release , making it far easier for a new user to get up and running with the plugin , as content restrictions are now more understandable . <p> The updated invoices are also a nice change for customers and provides a cleaner layout . More importantly , this now uses an HTML template that developers can easily customize for branded invoices . <p> However , the update with the biggest impact is the content drip add-on , which the 2.6 release paved the way for . This gives Restrict Content Pro a much more competitive feature set with other large membership plugins , as content dripping was always one of the main features I felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a great bonus , the content dripping omission disqualified it for some sites . Releasing the restriction improvements and a drip add-on pushes Restrict Content Pro back among the top membership solutions for WordPress. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98138243 @2338243/ <p> Before we look into conversion rate , you should determine if this is a valuable metric to measure given your stores size . Not every store can optimize conversion rate in a measurable way since it depends on your number of orders ( and thus you have to have enough orders for statistical significance ) . Regardless , measuring your conversion rate over time will be valuable for when you get to the point where you can test and optimize it . <h> Conversion rate : How to calculate <p> The conversion rate relates the number of visitors to a site with the number that take a specific action over a set duration . In the context of eCommerce stores , this is typically making a purchase by submitting an order . Other actions can include subscribing to newsletters , or contacting the site owner . For the purpose of this post , we will consider conversion to be the action of submitting an order . <p> Conversion rate = total number of orders / total number of visitors <p> For example , if for a given time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the conversion rate for that period would be 10/500 = 2% . The better conversion rate you have , the more profitable your store will be . A typical conversion rate for eCommerce stores is between 2-3% on average . The rate would be lower for new stores , and higher for established brands with known products . <p> This rate falls at the end of your marketing funnel , and is determined by the last step in a customers journey completing the checkout . Every touchpoint with your brand in the customers journey affects this rate . This includes your marketing efforts , the store website experience , the product quality , and the content caliber . <p> At a fundamental level , a potential visitor will convert to a customer if they can trust that you will be able to deliver on their expectations . Handing over their money is the ultimate measure of trust that a customer can put , especially without knowing about or having prior transactions with your brand . <h> Conversion rate : How to improve this metric <p> There are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of them happen offline , and a number of them happen before a potential customer arrives on your store . Below , we will focus on 10 things you can do to improve conversions after a potential customer has landed on your store . <h> 1 . Content <p> Content is the bedrock of eCommerce stores . Since customers cant talk to you or a sales representative like they would in a physical store , your content copy is what informs customers about your brand and your products . The copy has to be a good balance between providing useful information to customers while overcoming their potential objections to making a purchase . <p> Make sure your content is error free . Nothing kills a stores credibility faster than having typos and errors in the content . It signals a lack of thoroughness and care . Customers may translate the same attributes for your products . <p> There are certain things you can do to improve the content on your site : <p> Use active voice with clear headlines for each section of the website . <p> Add the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Include thorough and unique content for product pages . <p> Remember , customers may not notice the amount of effort you put into creating great content , but they will certainly notice if there is little effort put into content . <h> 2 . Trust seals <p> Add trust badges or seals to your store , and especially to your stores checkout page . According to a case study , adding a trust seal on the checkout page increased conversions by 60% . <p> Checkout seals <p> These trust seals add credibility to your store , and signal some level of security to customers who are trusting you with their credit card and personal information . Learn more about adding trust badges and seals to the checkout page in our previous post . <h> 3 . " Contactability " <p> Online stores are inherently digital and impersonal interactions between brands and customers . It is still important for potential customers to know that there are people on the other side of the website . You can add and highlight ways that customers can contact you . These include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably toll-free ) , including a physical address for the business , and links to your social profiles . <p> You can use the free WP Live Chat Support plugin for any WordPress site to add the live chat functionality . You can also use the LifeChat platform to integrate live chat with your WooCommerce store . <p> Even if customers do n't  use these options to contact you , knowing that these exist will help them trust your store more . <h> 4 . User flow <p> Keep the user flow from the landing page or home page to the checkout page as short and simple as possible . Do n't  get in the way of customers making a purchase . The customer journey should be straightforward , and customers should know what they need to do at each step of the process . <p> This means that your landing page should focus on a single highest-value action whether that is leading customers to the product page , or to your most popular product . In addition , keep your pages decluttered of other action items , and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 5 . Reviews and testimonials <p> Reviews and testimonials are great user-generated content that give potential customers a glimpse of how other people have used your products . More than 80% of people read reviews before making a purchase , according to one study . People would almost always trust what an aggregate of other people have to say about your products , rather than what you have to say about your products . <h> 6 . Promotional pricing <p> You can display a discounted or sale price on your products to encourage customers towards a purchase . Both WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads have the ability to show the discounted price . This creates a higher perceived value in a customers mind as they are able to get a bargain on your products . This higher value can tip them towards making a purchase . <h> 7 . Retrieve abandoned carts <p> Many times , customers may add your products to a cart but never checkout . This is called cart abandonment . You can increase conversions by sending these customers a notification about their abandoned carts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these notifications through this post , and this post . <h> 8 . Lifecycle emails <p> Lifecycle emails include all emails that a customer receives from you throughout the lifetime of their interaction with your store . These include welcome emails , survey emails , new product emails , reward and recognition emails , and more . Lifecycle emails help keep your brand on the customers radar . The higher touch-points also help build trust , as they signal a more robust customer relationship than a single sale . <h> 9 . Videos <p> Add videos to your store to provide customers with richer content . Videos can help distill a lot of information , or can even be used as sales channels for your products . <p> You can include product overview videos to give customers a better idea about your products .

@@98138244 @2338244/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> If you want to process payments directly on your website , you 'll be handling some sensitive data , such as customer and payment information . In order to protect this data while requests are sent between visitors browsers , your sites servers , and payment processors , the information will need to be encrypted so that it ca n't be read by anyone who has intercepted the data . That 's where SSL certificates ( Secure Sockets Layer certificates ) come into play . <p> So youve probably heard of an SSL certificate , but may not be sure why you need it , how to pick one , or what it does for your site . I 'll go over what an SSL certificate does and some different options so you can determine what 's the best fit for your site . <h> What is an SSL certificate ? <p> SSL is a protocol that directs communicating devices ( such as visitors browsers and your website server ) to encrypt their exchange in order to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called a Certificate Authority ( CA ) , to establish valid identity for one end ( or both ends ) of a transaction . Basically , the Certification Authority verifies that a site is owned by the entity that claims to own it , and for some certificates , will dig deeper to verify details about the ownership entity ( such as name and location ) . Once the CA has verified that the site ownership details are valid , the SSL certificate is generated , signed , and validated , and it instructs the browsers and servers that are communicating to use SSL protocol for their exchange . <p> Browsers will display this information to your sites visitors to let them know that the site has a valid certificate and that data will be encrypted when exchanged by displaying " https : // " in the address bar . The HTTPS indicates that the site owns an SSL certificate and will follow SSL protocol when sending information . Essentially , the browser has asked a Certificate Authority if the site can be trusted/has a valid certificate . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will recognize the security logo in the address bar : <h> Types of SSL Certificates <p> So now that we know what an SSL is for , we should talk about what kind of SSL certificate you 'll need . All SSL certificates in use must be 2048-bit according to new guidelines , so you 'll want to confirm that this is the case for your SSL certificate when purchasing . Certificates are also tied to your domain name , so they may need to be reissued if you change DNS hosting or other services , and you should consider reissue costs . While all certificates will use the same protocol and therefore are inherently secure , there are 3 major types of SSL certificates that you can choose from for your site , and each will have a wide range of costs associated with obtaining them . <p> The simplest SSL Certificates ( and least expensive ) are Domain Validation ( DV ) certificates . For these certificates , the CA simply checks the right of the site owner to use a specific domain name . No identity information is vetted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . For an eCommerce site , while this certificate will work , I would n't recommend using it , as customers will notice that company information is n't displayed and it may reduce trust and lower conversions . Sometimes these certificates also use 128-bit encryption , possibly increasing your security risk . Customer data is still protected , but the marginal cost associated with getting a better certificate to increase trust and therefore conversions is probably well worth the investment . <p> One step up from a DV Certificate is an Organization Validation ( OV ) SSL Certificate . To obtain this type of certificate , the CA still checks the right of the site owner to use a specific domain name , but it also conducts some vetting of the organization and researches ownership and company details . Additional company information is displayed to customers when clicking on the Secure Site Seal , providing more information related to who is behind the site . This usually results in enhanced trust in the site from the customer . <p> An Extended Validation ( EV ) SSL Certificate involves the highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of days to obtain . The CA checks the right of the site owner to use the specific domain name still , but it conducts a thorough vetting of the organization for maximum security . The guidelines for obtaining an EV certificate are strict , and specify several steps that must be completed before issuing the certificate . Some of the steps include verifying the legal , physical , and operational existence of the entity ; verifying that official records match the entitys identity ; and verifying that the entity has exclusive rights to use the specified domain name . Extended Validation certificates will also change the way the browser displays your SSL to customers , and will show the owners name in the address bar , greatly increasing the trust customers place in the site : <h> Where to Get an SSL Certificate <p> Many times , your domain name registrar may provide SSL certificates if you need them , and they 're usually reselling other services . For example , NameCheap resells SSL certificates from several major providers . You 'll want to pay attention to browser compatibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for a customer to see that your sites secure . Quality SSL certificates will probably cost at least $100 per year , and will be compatible will virtually all browsers . <p> My favorite place to buy SSL certificates is DigiCert for a few reasons . First , they offer excellent support if you have questions about how to get a certificate , or , more importantly , if there are any issues with your certificate that need to be fixed . Theyll also offer free reissues for life in case you change DNS services . They also offer extensive browser compatibility and high warrantees for issues resulting from improper certificate issues , which protects you if customers suffer damages . DigiCert will probably be slightly more expensive than other CAs , but I think its worth it to pay a slightly higher price for the benefits you 'll get . <p> Aside from DigiCert , here are some specific SSLs from NameCheap I 'd look into : <h> Posted by Max Rice <p> Max Rice is a frequent Sell with WP contributor and cofounder of SkyVerge .

@@98138245 @2338245/ <p> The eShop plugin for WordPress offers another free , usable eCommerce platform for store owners to test out when deciding which plugin to use for selling with WordPress . With about 5 years of maintenance and tweaks under its belt , eShop has continued to add functionality and has amassed more active installs than many eCommerce platforms . The plugin has had to evolve with WordPress , so some features are in need of update , while others have improved as the plugin has matured . Its history and ability to blend in with most themes is what makes eShop a competitor . <p> The WordPress eShop plugin is free from WordPress.org , so you know what I 'm going to say download it and try it out before adding real products and investing in development to make sure its a good fit . eShop is one of the less expensive platforms available for use , but that 's mostly due to the lack of extensions / add-ons available , which may limit options for some stores . Themes wont be an issue as eShop works with many , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dashboard . There are a few eShop-specific themes and plugins available at Theme Forest and at Quirm.net , but options are n't  extensive . As a result , costs can be as little as $0 , but may be around $50-100 to get a couple of add-ons . <h> Cost summary : <p> Installing a theme and some paid and some free add-ons to increase store functionality will probably total $50 to $100 , which will depend on the quality of your theme . If you 've already got a theme , you could be looking at even lower costs . <p> Setup and configuration of eShop is n't as intuitive as other plugins , but it does allow you to make a lot of adjustments ( though there are a few usability changes I 'd make ) . The settings are spread throughout the WordPress dashboard , which is something I personally do n't  like , but that will depend on the user . For example , most eShop settings are under the WP settings , so that its integrated into the rest of your site . However , I prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal , and as I 've said before , some people will prefer the integrated approach . You may have to explore a bit or view some documentation to find everything . Most information is available at the eShop wiki to help you out . <p> Basic settings are under Settings &gt; eShop , and will allow you to set up display and product options . Keep in mind that these settings will be applied to all products , which can simplify things for some stores , but make selling inconvenient for stores with a variety of products and limits your flexibility in product setup . <p> You can also enable stock management . However , you cant change this on a per-product basis . Let 's say for example you sell physical books and ebooks , and you want to manage stock . Youll have to enter a stock of 999 or something similar for your ebooks to ensure that they 're displayed to customers , since you ca n't turn off stock management for digital products . If " stock " of the digital product runs out , then you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving a high volume of digital goods ( especially because you wo n't get stock notifications to know when to do this ) . <p> Backend : Admin Settings <p> Product details can be customized as well from the same general settings page , but were a bit odd to set up . I needed experience shopping at my own store to understand what each setting did , and then I had to go back and adjust my product details and update product pages . For example , you 'll probably want more than three product options if you 're selling variable items , like shirts , bed frames , etc ( more on this later ) . I would also recommend going to the cart page after adding products to the cart and not having users stay on the product page when they put items in the cart , as no notification or visual cue pops up to let users know that the addition has taken place . I added an item a few times before checking my cart page the first time I did this , and as a result I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart . <p> Settings : Product Details <p> Under Settings &gt; eShop &gt; Downloads you also have the option of setting your store up for downloads only , which modifies the checkout pages to a bare minimum since shipping address is not needed and could be pretty useful . You can also set up Tax Options , Special Pages , Discounts and more . <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options are basic ( I believe they were added fairly recently , but could n't confirm this ) and are therefore a little inflexible . You can set tax by shipping zone if needed , and set up " tax bands " within a zone ( for example , for regular and reduced rates ) . If taxes are n't  based on shipping , you can select the band per item while creating or editing products . Rates can be set for your country , and you can create bands for other countries . <p> Backend : Tax Options <h> Products <p> The first thing you 'll probably notice with eShop is that viewing eShop &gt; Products wont actually let you add products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than using a WordPress custom post type eShop is " compatible " with this rather than just using it for simplicity ) , which can prove inconvenient . Ill review the plugin as-is , but know that you could add support for custom post types if you 're inclined . <p> If you choose to add products as posts , you 'll benefit from using the post category and tags ( which can be used in shortcodes ) , but you 'll have to do some fancy work to hide them from your blog if you 're maintaining one ( work that you probably wo n't want to/be able to do yourself , so this may incur additional cost ) . Since blogs are a great way to drive traffic to your site , you will probably want to be able to use it rather than give it up to product addition . <p> If you decide to use pages for products , you avoid the blog issue , but lose the ability to categorize and tag products . The freeeShop Custom Types plugin is geared towards fixing this , but it really should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make product addition harder than it has to be when you could benefit from using categories and tags without blowing up your blog by simply using a custom post type . <p> From the post / product editor , you can edit the " Product Entry " information to create a product . If you 've enabled a field , like SKU , it must be filled in to display the product correctly . You can set product options and basic variations in this area , but remember , you cant change the number of product options unless you change it for the entire store under " Settings " . You 'll also what to make sure that you check " Stock Available " to show your product , or it ca n't be added to a cart . <p> Backend : Adding Products <p> Variations can get a little bit more involved by using Option Sets . Youll have to create an option set under eShop &gt; OptionSets , which can be used for any product . I would recommend making the option set the variable that does n't  change price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charge more for a XXL . I would probably want to make my colors an option set , then set the sizes as product options so that I could manually set pricing ( I 've done the reverse in the image below changed price with color ) . Notice that you can also set prices for option sets if you want to do all pricing there instead , but doing so makes option sets less relevant to other products . Its an odd system for complex variations , and I was n't a fan of having go through hoops to create something as simple as a tee-shirt . It also complicates stock management . Youll have to take additional steps to hide your option sets table if you do n't  want it there , as its included automatically , so this adds to the complexity . <p> Frontend : Option Sets <p> The core plugin only allows for the addition of one image per product ( the featured image ) , even if you have multiple options for a product , which could be inconvenient for users that want the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery yourself on the product page and label them , but this wont be interactive . To create a gallery automatically , some users recommend the freeImage Gallery for WordPress plugin . This wont get you an interactive gallery , but it will be better than the basic setup . <p> Frontend Variable Product <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> There 's no shortcode help available in the plugin itself , and there 's no shortcode button in the visual post/page editor . However , there is a shortcode reference available on the eShop wiki that you can review , and it includes the accepted attributes for each shortcode . <p> Backend : Adding Shortcodes <p> Shortcodes will be necessary to create shopping pages , and youll probably have to edit the layout yourself to get a polished display . This is where using posts for products would be helpful , as the shortcodes will accept categories and tags to display products . However , shortcodes will automatically generate a list display , which makes browsing difficult . You can create a " panel " display ( seen below ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users suggested for doing so is the freeCategory Grid View Gallery plugin to create the grid layout for you , which makes browsing easier for users . <p> Frontend : Shortcode Display <p> You an also make use of some built-in widgets . The " products " widget can be pretty helpful , as you can display best sellers , featured products , new products , and more . <p> eShop Widgets <p> Using the cart widget could also be useful depending on your theme : <p> Frontend : Cart Widget <p> If you 're not a fan of having your cart on a page or in a widget , you can also use the WP Menu Cart plugin to add a cart icon to your navigation menu instead . <p> The eShop plugin includes access to the eShop CSS under Appearance &gt; eShop . Although it creates more work for you ( or your hired help ) , this will allow you to change the frontend to update shopping pages or other eShop features . <p> Adjusting eShop CSS <p> As we stated previously , browsing can be improved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change product pages to **25;2152;TOOLONG size featured images . Otherwise , your images will use its actual size on the product page , which can give your store an inconsistent feel if your images are all different sizes . The page content will be displayed under the title , and you can also add a product description ( and whatever options you 've set under " settings ) . <p> Frontend : Simple Product Page <p> Adding products to the cart is easy , and customers can adjust quantity from the product page before adding to the cart . Quantities can also be adjust from the cart page before proceeding to checkout . The included cart page will also display image thumbnails : <p> Frontend : Cart Page <p> Checkout is advertised as a one page checkout ; however , that 's not the case . Customers will enter shipping information , then have to confirm it ( its not automatically validated ) and acknowledge tax/shipping before an order can be submitted , so the process will be 2-3 steps . <p> Shipping options with eShop are pretty usable ( though will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eShop are limited , and you may need some custom development if you want to use a popular payment processor . <h> Payment Options <p> Default payment options include PayPal , cash on pickup/delivery , and bank transfer . However , there are several gateway integrations built into core plugin that are no longer supported or actively developed : Authorize.net , Payson , iDeal lite , Web to Pay , and eProcessing Network . Ideally , I 'd rather see these as free add-ons rather than part of the core plugin , especially since they 're not being supported , to keep the core plugin light . Aside from these built-in options , there are very few other gateway integrations available , so you may have to pay to develop one if you 're not happy with just PayPal . <p> Backend : Built-in Payment Options <h> Shipping Options <p> Shipping options are pretty flexible , but will be intensive to set up . You wo n't find them with other settings ; instead , you have to go to eShop &gt; Shipping . You can set flat rate shipping by zone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can instead enable shipping by weight . You can override these features if you want more specific rates with the eShop Shipping Extension plugin , which will integrate with Canada Post , UPS , USPS , Fedex , and Correios for real-time shipping rates and services . Canada Post integration is free , and you 'll have to purchase the modules for other shipping services if you want them . <p> Backend : Shipping Settings <p> Shipping by zone and class can be very promising instead of getting exact shipping rates ( especially since this is included ! ) . First , you can set your zones and get an idea of differences between classes ( for example , light items could be shipping class A , while heavy items could be shipping class E this is up to you ) . You can also set a discount for multiple items if you 're charging per item . Free shipping can be added if the order amount is over a certain value , or for individual products by setting shipping class to " F " . <p> Setting Shipping Rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set your zones ( up to 9 possible ) . You can change the zones based on country ( for international sellers ) . You 'll then want to go to the last tab to set up zones or regions within your country . Youll have to select your country from the menu on the right to set zones based on states or regions . This is essential ; if you do n't  have your country selected , your shipping zones will not work , which the documentation does n't  tell you ( and probably should be updated with more detail ) . So as an overview , you can delete or add countries and assign a zone , and you can assign zones by region within your own country . <p> eShop does n't  include any built-in reporting features or sales information ( other than a list of top sellers in your WordPress dashboard ) . You can view orders placed , but sales reporting will have to be done manually . <h> Inventory <p> You can enable stock management under your settings , and set quantities while adding or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing all products under eShop &gt; Products . There are no low or out-of-stock notifications , so you 'll have to set these up yourself or just keep an eye on stock levels . <p> The eShop wiki has a lot of documentation published for users to sift through , and quality is pretty good , but could use some clarification . Sometimes it restates information that 's already in the plugin instead of going through a detailed explanation . There are also some videos posted to help with setup and usage . Reviews on WordPress.org seem to indicate that support is good and the plugin author is active in responding to support requests in the forums ( 20 of 22 resolved in the last month ) . Support is also addressed on eShop support forums . For a free plugin with very few paid add-ons , this is pretty impressive . <p> Under settings , there 's a page for " eShop Base " products , but I still have no idea what that does . You can also view the base in the eShop menu . Anyone have explanations as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google shopping feeds . <p> As a general eCommerce platform , eShop will serve the needs of small stores , but probably wont be a functional solution for larger stores unless you have an aggressive developer who wants to build on top of it . Costs are low and usability is pretty good , which will work for stores that are selling few products and do n't  need to use a large merchant gateway to process payments or a lot of added functionality . It also plays well with many themes , and has had 5 years to mature . <p> While the core plugin has many good features , it leaves something to be desired in terms of extensibility , which is why larger stores will pass it over . Variations are difficult to add , and there are few marketing add-ons or methods to modify price ( creating pricing tiers or bulk discounts , for example ) . Payment gateway integration with larger processors is also non-existent . Products are not added as custom post types ( unless you want to custom code this ) , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to weigh the pros and cons of using posts or pages for product addition . Finally , a lot styling will be required to set up shopping pages for a user-friendly experience . <p> eShop is a viable option for small stores that are looking to sell basic products , but is unable to scale to meet the functionality that larger stores will need . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138246 @2338246/ <h> By the Numbers : WordPress eCommerce Plugin Statistics <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Take an already analytical person , add a degree in Chemistry , plus a career as a Division I softball player , and you get someone that really loves math , tracking data , and statistical analysis ( ballplayers love stats also , this is me ) . As a result , I typically think of things in terms of percentages . I like knowing what part of the whole something represents , and I like to see how it changes over time stats , in the long run , are very insightful . <p> This led to me being curious about statistics on WordPress eCommerce plugins , and I periodically look them up . Ive put together an overview of my most recent look into stats on how many shops are using each WordPress eCommerce plugin to share a bird-eye view of WordPress eCommerce . <p> Before we begin , note that I 'm typically looking up stats from BuiltWith , so I do n't  have insight into their accuracy . With that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can at least bet on being proportionally and directionally correct ( if stats are off , they 're probably proportionally off for everything , and we can probably get an idea of whether they 're going up or down ) . <p> Does this represent every site using WordPress for eCommerce ? Probably not . I have n't included every single plugin out there , and I 'm sure there are custom carts or generic ones that have been installed but then customized / altered that are n't  being accounted for . <h> WordPress eCommerce Statistics : The Disclaimers <p> So aside from the fact that these stats are coming from a third party , here are a couple things to note : <p> Ive omitted Ecwid and Cart66 from this analysis since they 're plugins that integrate with hosted services . I originally decided to omit Ecwid since I had no way to tell if its stats were WordPress-specific , so I then axed the Cart66 cloud stats as well to focus purely on installable plugins . If you 're curious , there are 23,650 total shops listed as using an Ecwid plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know if that represents the cloud service or the pro plugin ( another reason its omitted ) . <p> BuiltWith does n't  have any data on iThemes Exchange or WP EasyCart . I 'm not sure if this is because usage is too low or how new they are . They did n't  have data on Easy Digital Downloads until about 4-6 months ago , so perhaps novelty is the issue . Regardless , they 're not included because stats were unavailable . <h> WordPress eCommerce Plugin Usage <p> WooCommerce leads the pack in terms of WordPress eCommerce marketshare at 78.4% . WP eCommerce comes next with close to 10% of the WordPress eCommerce plugin market . Here are the percentages of shops using these plugins as well as the absolute numbers in the table below : <p> I was most surprised by the statistics on WP eShop , as its one of the oldest eCommerce plugins and has n't  been updated in over a year . It does n't  take advantage of much of the WordPress 3.0+ architecture , such as custom post types , so I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been able to update or migrate to another cart . <p> I 'm also impressed at the marketshare held by EDD when its far more specialized than the rest of these plugins . While WP eStore focuses a lot on downloadable goods ( head-to-head of these here ) , its meant to be a general eCommerce solution capable of selling shippable goods as well . Easy Digital Downloads is the only plugin completely focused on one kind of product ( downloadable / virtual goods ) , and yet its third in terms of total sites using it . <p> The total number of sites included in these BuiltWith statistics is 505,409 . The breakdown of active sites using each plugin is as follows : <p> Plugin <p> Total Sites <p> WooCommerce <p> 396,260 <p> WP eCommerce <p> 49,471 <p> Easy Digital Downloads <p> 13,813 <p> WP eStore <p> 13,138 <p> WP eShop <p> 11.962 <p> MarketPress <p> 8,333 <p> Shopp <p> 7,445 <p> Jigoshop <p> 4,987 <h> Non-WooCommerce Marketshare <p> Since WooCommerce is taking up a large part of that pie , I was curious to see more when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugins stack up against one another . <p> here 's an overview of the 109,149 stores tracked in BuiltWith that are using something other than WooCommerce . <h> WooCommerce by Version <p> I also noticed a new breakdown that was recently added by BuiltWith : WooCommerce by version . This is meant to show the total number of stores using each version of WooCommerce , and it already includes version 2.3 , which is currently in beta . <p> Unfortunately I do n't  think its entirely accurate , as the " unknown " version statistic is generated by me after adding up the totals for WooCommerce 1.5 to 2.2 , there were 108,999 stores unaccounted for . I 'm not sure if the version couldnt be detected , or if they just havent been analyzed since BuiltWith started tracking this statistic . <p> The most recent version of WooCommerce ( 2.2 ) leads the pack with 1/3 of all stores using it . With the version 2.3 release upcoming , I 'll be very curious to see how this changes . <p> The number of stores still using WooCommerce 2.0 is disconcerting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores avoid upgrading if their theme does n't  update WooCommerce support or if theyve added custom code , but the fact that 55,772 stores are running completely out of date software is n't the best news . I 'm guessing that part of this may have to do with the version 2.1 changes , which affected themes that improperly override several templates ( as lots do , which is a poor practice ) . Since version 2.3 also affects the core templates , I 'll be keeping an eye out to see how many sites upgrade to this version or if some hang back to upgrade themes and custom code . <h> WordPress eCommerce Statistics : Recap <p> Keep in mind that the overall marketshare percentages for each eCommerce plugin are overstated , as some plugins were excluded due to unavailable or unclear statistics . This is n't meant to be the definitive guide to WordPress eCommerce plugins by marketshare , but provides a comparison of some of the top plugins available . <p> We 've also excluded other plugins that are n't  used for traditional eCommerce , such as membership plugins like MemberPress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a better WordPress eCommerce plugins comparison ( though the same problem exists there are no stats on active use ) . <p> I 'm a bit surprised that plugins like eShop are still holding strong , but knowing how time-consuming it can be to migrate cart systems , I 'm not necessarily surprised that there are legacy shops out there . I do think that the growth plugins like Easy Digital Downloads have seen is fantastic , especially when you consider that its the newest eCommerce plugin in this comparison and its extremely specialized . <p> Anything that you find surprising , or would you have guessed at these statistics ? Even if BuiltWith is n't 100% accurate , I enjoy keeping an eye on the trends and overall numbers for each eCommerce platform , and I 'd be curious to hear from those of you who do the same thing . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 8 Comments <p> Nevertheless , on the first day I was there , Brian Krogsgard launched The Club over at Post Status .

You can then go through each to restrict content with your new subscription . The process will be a bit time intensive , but content restriction can be achieved . <p> Note that members can purchase more than one subscription for content-based models , but can only purchase them one at a time . This is common with a lot of subscription services , but you may want to clarify checkout instructions for customers so that they 're aware of the fact that memberships must be purchased independent of other products . Members will also have to be logged in so that a membership can be associated with their WordPress user account , so make sure you allow subscriber logins . <p> There 's also no way to offer discounts to memberships , and the add-on is geared towards content restriction and recurring billing alone . However , you can sell subscriptions for physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to be tied to content restriction and are linked to a product . <h> Content Restriction <p> Content restriction is possible for posts , pages , and custom post types . When you create a subscription , you can ( optionally ) add posts , pages , and custom post types that will be available to users who have purchased the subscription . You 'll also have to check the subscription restriction on the corresponding post or pages to complete setup . <p> Since you 'll be restricting individual posts , you can technically restrict post categories and tags as well , but will have to manage restriction manually , which may be prohibitive ( or just tiresome ) for sites with large numbers of posts being added to the category / tag . <p> Content dripping is not possible with Members Only , so for those of you selling access to courses and other evergreen content , you 'll have to couple it with another plugin , set this up manually , or find a substitute . <h> Recurring / Subscription Billing <p> One downside to using Members Only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to select a payment processor of your choice . Subscription products can be billed in terms of days , months , or years , and can be applied for both memberships and physical products ( such as subscription boxes ) . Billing cycles are set when the subscription is created and are fairly flexible . <p> However , Members Only does not support sign-up fees , free trials , or member discounts . You can create a pay-per-post system by creating a subscription product for each post , but this will be labor intensive for multiple posts . Since subscriptions have to be linked to a product , members have no way of upgrading or downgrading memberships without canceling and repurchasing memberships . <h> Support <p> Support is not included , and support tokens must be purchased at $47 per incident . If you 've purchased the Gold Cart add-on , however , a support token is included in this purchase and can be used for help with the Members Only module . <p> Since the WP eCommerce plugin has been around the longest out of all WordPress eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll most likely be able to find a developer that could do what you require . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138249 @2338249/ <p> Overall , version 2.6 adds some useful new tools , such as new importers and customer management tools , that will improve the experience store owners have with day-to-day management . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : Product CSV Import <p> EDD version 2.5 improved the product export capabilities within EDD core , so this release follows on the heels of that with a native product CSV import tool . Between the changes in versions 2.5 and 2.6 , the free CSV Manager plugin is no longer needed to manage products via CSV , and can be done entirely with the core EDD plugin . <p> You can access the new product importer under Downloads &gt; Tools &gt; Import / Export . Here you 'll see two new importers , of which the product importer is one : <p> EDD 2.5 Tools <p> EDD 2.6 Tools <p> This tool allows you to import hundreds or thousands of products at a time , as the import is processed in the background to avoid timeouts . You can also map columns to product data during the import process , ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDD 2.6 Product Import <p> The import and export formats for products are compatible so that you can export products , edit product data , then re-import them . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : Payments CSV Import <p> In addition to the native product CSV import , a payments CSV import has been added in Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 . This allows you to import payment records from Downloads &gt; Tools &gt; Import / Export . <p> The payment import also features a column mapper so that you can determine which columns in your CSV file correspond to which payment data , making it easy to export several CSV formats . <p> EDD 2.6 Payments Import <p> This is useful for updating order records in bulk or migrating them from other platforms . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : Multiple Customer Email Addresses <p> Most of us have more than one email address , and your customers do , too . Easy Digital Downloads now accepts multiple email addresses for a customer account . This let 's you keep payment records accurate , as all of these email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a customer purchases with a different email , it can be linked back to the customers account . <p> EDD 2.5 Customer info <p> EDD 2.6 Customer info <p> You can manually add new emails for the customer , and determine which one should be the primary email address for the customer account . <p> This has some really interesting implications for B2B sales , as the " customer " concept is n't as tightly tied to a specific user . You could link multiple business emails to one business customer " account " , letting you accurately see sales for a business as a customer . <p> This is n't true " sub-accounts " for a company , but it could be a step in that direction for companies using EDD to sell digital business tools or services . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : PayPal Standard Refunds <p> One of my favorite features in this release is the addition of automatic refunds for PayPal standard purchases . This let 's you process a refund entirely within your EDD dashboard rather than having to both update your store record and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice some new fields for the " PayPal Standard " gateway settings . In order to process refunds via PayPal , you 'll need to add API keys for your business PayPal account . <p> EDD 2.5 PayPal settings <p> EDD 2.6 PayPal Settings <p> When viewing an order via Downloads &gt; Payment History , you can change the status to " refunded " . If the customer purchased via PayPal Standard , you 'll see a " Refund in PayPal " option added when you select the " refunded " status . <p> EDD 2.6 PayPal Refund <p> If you enable this and refund the order , the refund data is automatically sent to PayPal . This will process the refund for you without any additional action needed , saving you the hassle of locating and refunding the order in your PayPal account as well . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : Other Changes <p> There are some minor improvements for both store owners and customers as well . <p> First , the mobile checkout experience has been improved to make it easier to enter credit card numbers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type to trigger a numerical keyboard on mobile devices rather than the full alphanumeric keyboard . <p> EDD 2.5 Mobile checkout <p> EDD 2.6 Mobile checkout <p> This makes it far easier for customers to go through the checkout process while using a mobile or tablet device . <p> Second , if your store is running WordPress 4.4 or newer , you may have also seen that your products can be embedded on other sites via oEmbed . This is helpful if you have affiliates writing about your products on their blogs , as they can embed product data directly into the post . <p> When embedding a product from your site onto another site , the product prices are now shown as part of the embed . <p> EDD 2.6 Product Embed <p> And finally , the admin experience has been improved with more context for new store owners . Helpful tooltips have been added throughout the admin to explain settings and key actions that admins can take so they can learn about store management when they begin to use EDD . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer metadata API that developers can leverage to store customer information . This works very similar to the way WordPress core treats postmeta so that a customer record can have additional data added , modified , and used via custom code or plugins . <p> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 also brings version 2 of the Easy Digital Downloads REST API . Changes include improvements to the coupons endpoint and taxonomy support for the products endpoint . Developers can check out the GitHub repo for all v2 API changes . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 Review <p> My favorite changes in Easy Digital Downloads 2.6 are the changes to customer management and processing refunds . The ability to store multiple email addresses per customer moves the concept of a " customer " away from being heavily tied to a WordPress user , and also allows you to ensure sales tracking is accurate for a specific person . <p> The ability to process full refunds for PayPal Standard via EDD is also a really nice addition for store owners , as they no longer have to log into PayPal to process refunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( core gateway ) , Stripe , PayPal Website Payments Pro , and PayPal Express to add another gateway that automatically processes refunds . Perhaps this means partial refund support will come soon ? = <p> Overall , the 2.6 release provides some nice refinements for store management with native importers and improved customer management , while the mobile checkout enhancements will also help with customers and ( hopefully ) conversions .

@@98138250 @2338250/ <p> Sure , you want to make the most out of the traffic that comes to you , so all of the advice we 've offered is valid and valuable . However , there 's another problem you 'll have to solve before any of that takes effect : How do you drive traffic to your store ? Where do your leads come from ? <p> That 's where an affiliate program can come into play . <h> Why Create an Affiliate Program ? <p> Imagine that you 've built a beautiful hotel . The main entrance opens up into an airy hall with a pristine tiled floor , tasteful design , and a bellhop waiting to help with bags . The receptionists are friendly , helpful , and offer great advice as to local eateries and activities . They even go above and beyond to help make dinner reservations for guests as they check in , or refer them to the concierge for further help . Rooms are clean , the mattress is the perfect softness , and the sheets feel like satin . Your hotel is awesome , and there 's no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to drive traffic to your swanky hotel . You need to find a way to reach out to prospective guests , and to have a way for guests to find you . This is where your marketing / advertising team comes in . <p> However , there 's one other thing that 's really effective in getting people in the door : peer pressure and peer confirmation . You want people whove stayed at your hotel to tell others about how much they loved it so that theyll help convince prospective guests that they too should stay . This is why sites like Trip Advisor are so popular readers can learn about others experiences and get real feedback as to what places are great and which are n't  . <p> ( And in case you have n't noticed yet , the hotel is a metaphor for your eCommerce store . Just figured I 'd be obvious = . ) <p> Setting up an affiliate program helps with this process . Your affiliates become your brand ambassadors they tell people about you to send leads your way , and you in turn send them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel . You provide a financial incentive to ensure they have a reason to share their experiences . However , in this case , you 'll be paying commissions for sold products instead of overnight guests . <p> Affiliate referrals are a powerful form of marketing for your store , as people tend to trust other people more than magazines , newspapers , or other sources . Getting a referral from someone else who 's experienced a service or used a product is a far more powerful motivator than reading about a product in a magazine , so having an affiliate network allows you to leverage this tendency for your brand . <h> Great ! What should I use ? <p> There are lots of affiliate programs out there that you can use for your eCommerce store powered by WordPress , and many work well . However , there 's a new one called AffiliateWP that I 'd like to share with you today , as its developed by one of my friends ( Pippin Williamson ) , and will be released later this afternoon . However , we 've got a sneak-peak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> AffiliateWP Review <p> AffiliateWP is an easy-to-use affiliate plugin for WordPress . This plugin will provide affiliates with an " I 'd " that they can add to the end of a URL when linking to your store or a product . For example , let 's pretend I 'm an affiliate for our sponsor , SkyVerge , and that they 're using AffiliateWP . If my affiliate I 'd for their program is " 1 " , and I want to link to their homepage , the URL that I 'll give to readers may look like this : www.skyverge.com/ ? ref=1 . AffiliateWP will take note of that URL and will cause a cookie to be installed in the users browser when they visit SkyVerge . If the user makes a purchase , it tells AffiliateWP that I should get a commission based on that purchase . <p> here 's a very simple rundown of how it works : <h> Setup <p> When you install AffiliateWP , you 'll probably want to check out the plugin settings . You can set a default rate for affiliate commissions and go through other basic setup . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some advanced settings . You can allow users to register for your affiliate program or to disable registration . This way , you can manually create affiliates and keep your program closed , or allow open registration to your affiliate program . You also have the option to take the middle road and allow registration only upon approval . <p> AffiliateWP Misc Settings <p> Another handy setting is the ability to reject unpaid referrals when purchases are refunded so that you 're not paying out commissions for sales that you no longer have . This helps to ensure that leads are quality , as affiliates do n't  want to send you traffic that wont generate a commission for them . <h> Integrations <p> The best part about AffiliateWP is how easy it is to use . There are a lot of integrations built into the core plugin that you can enable simply with one click . For example , if you 're selling using WooCommerce , EDD , Shopp , or others , you can enable the AffiliateWP integration for the platform and it adds support for order notes , customer records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrations available to see if your platform of choice is supported . <p> UPDATE 2014-04-14 : Integrations are now included for other popular platforms , including MemberMouse and Jigoshop . <h> Tools <p> As a site owner , AffiliateWP gives you some very handy tools for managing your affiliate traffic and commissions . The plugin creates an overview that shows paid and unpaid commissions , as well as other information , so you can get an idea of affiliate commissions at a glance : <p> AffiliateWP Overview <p> Bulk Referral Actions <p> There 's another screen that shows referrals from your affiliates , and provides some really useful bulk editing actions for these referrals . You can mark selected referrals as accepted , rejected , paid , or unpaid easily from the Referrals screen . You can also mass export unpaid referrals for a date range to a CSV file . The best part about this feature is that exported referrals are automatically marked as paid , and you can upload this CSV to PayPal to automatically pay out all unpaid commissions . <p> Want to export more than just unpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export referrals for a particular affiliate , or for other referral statuses . Note that if you export unpaids referrals here , they 're not automatically marked as paid . <p> There 's also a tool for viewing stats by affiliate , which is great for determining the quality of leads a particular affiliate is sending to your store . <p> I also like the built-in reporting for AffiliateWP . This can show you data on pending , paid , and unpaid referrals for your affiliates , as well as data on total paid / unpaid earnings and referrals . <p> AffiliateWP Reporting <h> Affiliate Area <p> Finally , what about your affiliates ? Can they get feedback on how their leads convert ? Yep . Affiliates can log into an Affiliate Area for AffiliateWP to view referrals and earnings , as well as their own version of reporting . They can also get their affiliate I 'd and easily generate affiliate links to any page on your site . Having used several different affiliate areas myself , I can say that this one does a great job of making it easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affiliate Area with Referral Stats <p> Overall , AffiliateWP makes creating and managing an affiliate program really simple for a store admin , and provides several great management tools for your affiliate program .

@@98138251 @2338251/ <p> This series covers helpful plugins and integrations for WordPress to improve your eCommerce stores customer service . <p> Customer service is one of the essential elements of any successful business , including eCommerce stores .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than multiple ones which are not thoroughly planned . Learn more in our post about offering multiple communication channels . <h> 2 . Customer service tips : Always follow up <p> All customer complaints or issues are worthy of a response . Customers provide feedback or take out frustration in different ways . It is important to follow up with every single customer so that they do n't  feel that they were ignored . The customer made an effort to write to you about their issue . Reward the effort by sending a reply , even if you may not have a solution . <p> For example , you will have times when customers message with nothing specific a simple note that your products are " OK " , or a customer venting about how horrible the product is without asking for any resolution , or a customer asking about something that is clearly stated on your homepage . In such instances , it may feel like a waste of time to respond , but a response can help you create the conversation that you want one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the customers out , or finding ways to improve your products , or adding to an FAQ section so that you template commonly asked questions . <p> In addition , you can reach out to your customers proactively , especially if your store is new , to get their feedback and opinion about your brand . This can not only signal that you care about what your customers think , but also provide valuable feedback you can use to improve your store . There have been many studies that suggest that users can help provide a lot of ideas for innovation of products . <h> 3 . Customer service tips : Empathize with your customers <p> Sometimes there are things that just go wrong whether its your fault , the customers fault , or nobodys fault at all . If it is your fault , own up to it and fix the situation . If it is the customers fault , or nobodys fault , do n't  put blame on the customer or anyone else . Take ownership of the issue and focus on how to remedy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry or unhappy customer . Offer a complete refund to the customer , and provide an additional gift card or coupon ( see coupons for WooCommerce ) to your store . Remember that they are frustrated because something in their customer journey did n't  meet their expectations . Your product is only one of many they will consume , but your products are the sole focus of your business . <p> According to an Eptica study , more than 80% of customers are likely to switch away from a brand based on a poor customer service experience . You will have customers who have a bad experience with your store or products , but the more important part is how you deal with it and how an unhappy customers last interaction is with your brand . It is that last interaction that can help influence them to come back to your store , or at least , not speak poorly of your brand to their friends . <h> 4 . Customer service tips : Respond to customers in a timely manner <p> Customers should n't be waiting for a week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immediately reply to customer queries , but customers should n't be kept waiting too long . The longer they wait , the more frustrated they will get , and start to look at your competitors . <p> You can be up front about average response time . This helps set an expectation with customers for when they will hear back . Set something that you think is doable , but also reasonable . " Within 48 hours " is typically a good expectation that allows you some leeway if you are a small shop . It allows you time to think about all aspects of the request before you respond . According to a Gallup study , a " thorough " response is much better than a fast response when it comes to customer service . <p> Display your operating hours clearly if you are providing live chats or phone support . This will reduce the number of times a customer tries to contact you without getting through . <h> 5 . Customer service tips : Do n't  try to hide policies or extra charges <p> If your products typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear about them on your store before the customer reaches checkout and certainly before they purchase the items . This can be shipping costs or handling fees , shipping policies with select couriers , or return policies and warranties that are atypical . <p> Good customer experience is about setting expectations . A recent personal example was when I booked a car rental that required a specific type of insurance , and a credit hold . But I was n't informed of either at any point during the booking process , and was only told about them the day before the rental . This had me scrambling at the last minute to make sure I could provide both those things . <p> Good customer experience is about setting expectations . If customers know about additional fees or charges , they can factor those into making their purchasing decisions on your store . More than 70% of customers abandon their carts at checkout due to hidden charges or high delivery fees . By making those charges clear earlier in the process , you may deter some customers , but you will avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips : Do n't  forget to include business details <p> Contact information is one of the most important ways to build trust among new customers . Detailed information about your business , including team photos , and contact information that includes a physical address and a phone number , can significantly increase the trust potential customers place in your store . <p> This information helps customers differentiate " shady " stores from legitimate ones , and also reassures them that they can get in touch if with you if something goes wrong . In addition , since online customers cant physically visit your store location or see your products , knowing a bit about your company helps them connect with your brand , and humanizes your store . <h> 7 . Customer service tips : Avoid being defensive about criticism <p> Criticism from your customers is n't about you . It is about the process that they took to purchase your products . Instead of defensively trying to justify why things are the way they are , use the criticism as a platform for dialogue with your customers on how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve your process or products . Thank customers for pointing out something that you had n't  considered or something that you did n't  realize was a pain point . Remember , a lot of customers may have had the same issue but they did n't  care to point it out . <h> 8 . Customer service tips : Never insult customers <p> Service is the make-or-break facet of your business when acquiring new customers . According to the RightNow survey , 55% of respondents became customers of a company because of the companys reputation for good customer service , and 40% had switched to a competitor because the competitor provided better customer service . <p> Insulting customers or being rude during interactions will lose you customers , and potential word-of-mouth leads . Of the respondents in the survey , 82% had stopped doing business with a company after a poor customer experience , and 79% told others about the experience . <p> As you try to build a positive brand , make sure your interactions with customers remain positive and constructive . <h> Customer service tips : Summary <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can differentiate your brand from others in the same space .

@@98138252 @2338252/ <h> Partner <p> Obox just launched a new product last week that 's pretty interesting , so we wanted to give you an overview today of Obox Instant . <h> What is Instant ? <p> Instant is a service that 's intended to give you an instant eCommerce site . This white glove service clocks in at $49 per month , and all you have to do is pick how you 'd like your site to look . Obox handles the site setup process for you and offers premium support throughout the life of your subscription . <p> Obox co-founder Dave Perel sent out an email explaining why they launched Instant : <p> Its not uncommon that our customers purchase a product from Obox without knowing that they need to setup hosting , install WordPress , and configure their theme . <p> Choose a business or eCommerce theme , which is how your site will look . <p> Sign up for Instant and choose a domain name ( the URL people visit to find your site ) . <p> Sit back while your new site is built to look like the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of all of the behind-the-scenes setup needed to get a WordPress business online . You wont have to purchase your own domain name , get set up with hosting , or configure a theme and install WooCommerce . <h> Customer Upsides <p> If you 're a customer , the benefit to this is that you 're handed the keys to a new website , which is the goal behind Instant . You do n't  have to worry about learning each of these aspects of site creation and management . You 're also given the freedom to modify themes or upload plugins , which isnt the the case with entirely hosted services ( like WordPress.com for business ) . <p> Heres what happens when you purchase Instant these are all things youd normally have to do : <p> Obox gets your domain name ( if available ) and <p> sets up cloud hosting ( where all of your site data is stored and efficiently served up to people viewing your site ) <p> installs and configures WordPress <p> installs and configures your theme to look the way the demo looks <p> installs WooCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SSL certificate if you purchase one <p> sets up what you need showcase your company , such as team pages , services , portfolios , testimonials , and contact pages <p> gives you the ability to change to another Obox theme in the future <p> The domain name for your site is registered in your name , which means you can take it with you if you ever change services . Obox will then give you hosting information , such as access to your cPanel , which is needed if you want to make changes or hire someone to manage or further customize your site . <p> If you need an SSL certificate for your payment gateway integration , you 'll have to purchase this they cost anywhere from $15 to hundreds per year ( depending on which type you want to use for your site ) . However , Obox will install this for you . <p> Any time something is going on with your site , you do n't  have to contact a theme provider , domain name registrar , or hosting company . You simply contact Obox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedited support in place with their hosting partner . The only other support you 'll have to worry about will be support for premium plugins that you purchase from other authors ( for example , youd contact WooThemes for help with WooCommerce extensions ) . <p> You 'll also get discounts from other companies , such as WooThemes , for being an Obox Instant customer . This helps you purchase popular extensions for WooCommerce , which let you do more with your store . <p> Finally , you 're not locked in to Instant with a minimum contract . Youll be able to take your data to a different site if you want to move to your own hosting provider in the future ( though you 'll be responsible for migrating your data yourself ) . <p> You should still learn how to manage your own site unless your hiring a store administrator , as basic knowledge of WordPress and the structure around your site is really helpful when running your store . Even though Instant gives you a pre-packaged WooCommerce website , you 'll still need to run your store yourself . <h> Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee for site setup , this could be more expensive in the long run . Price is n't usually the most important consideration for me , but I have to see the value behind what I 'm spending . For example , WP Engine is one of the hosts that we recommend , and they 're typically more expensive than the competition . However , they offer features that we value enough to pay their prices . The question for you is what you 're willing to manage and how much Instant is worth to you cut out your management . <p> If you do n't  go with something like Instant , you 'll have to pick out a WooCommerce theme ( $50-$100 ) , then pay for each of these things separately : <p> Hosting is paid monthly ( hosts we recommend install WordPress for you ) for $5-$25 <p> Installation &amp; configuration of themes / plugins can cost a few hundred dollars <p> There could be costs for ongoing support / management for your site if you want someone on-call to help out ( as Oboxs advanced support does for Instant ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like SiteGround , who is another host that we recommend and who has great support ) for $5-15 per month . You can also pay companies like WP Site Care to install and configure your theme and plugins , and price will depend on how complex setup is and the extent of configuration required . <p> However , once these things are done , the costs are over with rather than recurring . Youll have to decide how much you want to learn , and whether or not you want to invest this money up-front . You should also consider if you want to contact theme , plugin , and hosting providers separately for support , or if you want to only contact one provider ( Obox ) . For users very new to WordPress , the " do it for me " route is really attractive , and you have somewhere to turn for help . You can of course lower your costs , but this requires some learning and management on your part . <h> Instant for Developers <p> Instant offers a good alternative to which developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have any idea how much a customized site costs to develop , and get sticker-shock when they 're told what it will cost to launch a site . Instead , developers can refer customers to Obox Instant and then partner with the customer to do any custom work or hash out a retainer for maintenance and support outside of what Obox offers . <p> This allows you to establish a relationship with a customer that generates recurring revenue and allows them to set up a site for a low initial investment . Since access is provided to the cPanel and the site acts like a self-hosted install , developers can still modify themes , upload new plugins , have FTP access , and do everything needed to maintain or customize a site . <p> Customers also benefit from simply " signing up " for a site and paying a set monthly fee rather than sourcing all of these solutions separately and investing money in the site up-front . <h> What I find interesting about Instant <p> Most people care first about what their website will look like , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start when building an eCommerce site . Instant fulfills this expectation by allowing customers to pick what they want their eCommerce store to look like , then handing it to them . Post Status has some interesting insights on this as well . <p> This also centralizes where to get help for the customer and makes the process of debugging issues far less taxing . Some people are n't  sure of why some issues are related to themes or hosting , so Obox takes the hassle out of this for you : you simply ask the same company for help . Theyve also worked out a solution with support for their hosting partner to ensure there 's no lag involved while they act as a support conduit . <p> I also really like that customers are n't  tied into the service with a minimum service contract or domain names that are held hostage . Obox registers the site in the customers name so that they can take everything about the site with them if they switch away from Instant . This is n't usually the case when hosting providers include a domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While the initial investment needed to get a site up and running is low , customers will have to assess whether or not the $49 per month provides the value they want . If customers are willing to learn about site setup themselves or to hire someone to do this , they could save money by doing so and getting inexpensive hosting from SiteGround . However , paying $49 per month let 's customers get going right away , provides one centralized location for all website support , and makes for a really easy and smooth website launch . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138253 @2338253/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> While there are some things you can pay attention to in a theme demo , there are lots of things in a theme that you do n't  know about until after purchasing . Sometimes a demo can look great , but then you buy the theme and realize that its not what youd hoped for in terms of usability and quality . <p> We 've got three new WooCommerce themes to take a look at today Hub from WooThemes , Pop Up Shop from RichWP , and Uno , which is a Canvas child theme from WooThemes . <h> Hub WooThemes <p> Hub is a fairly new theme from WooThemes that fully supports WooCommerce and WooThemess Sensei plugin , as well as the other free plugins from WooThemes ( such as Features and Testimonials ) . For $79 ( unlimited sites ) , Hub ensures that you have a complete and unified design , from you blog template all the way through WooCommerce shop pages . <p> With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homepage sections , such as an intro section , an " Our Team " section ( using the Our Team plugin ) , recent posts , and others . You can also use a " Business template " as your homepage to leverage a slider ( a " lite " slider is built-in ) and other components . <h> Pros <p> Hub has a bold , flat layout that can be easily customized to reflect your brand . Its pretty easy to install and set up , as it uses the WooFramework for all settings : <p> WooFramework <p> Your homepage can be set up using the business template , or with the Homepage Control plugin . Using Homepage Control , you can enable or disable sections and re-order them , then customize messages and button text under the theme settings : <p> Homepage Control <p> The blog , standard page , and WooCommerce stylings are all consistent so that your shop is seamlessly integrated into your site . One thing to note is that your single posts will not have a sidebar , which has pros / cons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post content , but you lose the ability to display categories , etc , in your sidebar for increased engagement : <p> Single Post <p> I liked that the shop pages do a good job of showcasing images and blending in with the rest of the theme . Shop pages can contain a sidebar with your site and WooCommerce-specific widgets : <p> Shop Page <p> Or you can enable a full-width template on the shop page , which will make your product images even bigger and more noticeable . You can do the same thing with single product pages to determine whether or not you 'd like a sidebar . Product pages also do a good job showcasing images , and I liked that product tabs fit in with the rest of the theme ( it seems like a lot of themes ignore these ) : <p> Single Product Page <p> Another thing I like about Hub is the checkout page and the great big call to action for the " Place Order " button : <p> Checkout Submit <h> Cons <p> While Hub has a lot of upsides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hub does n't  automatically adjust number of products per page for the shop archive : products are displayed in 3 columns , but 10 products are shows per page . This always leaves just one product in your last row . There 's no setting to change this , so you need something like the WooCommerce Customizer to adjust this to something more appropriate , such as 12 or 15 products per page . <p> I also would have liked a notice that the Homepage Control plugin should be used ( or possibly a link under the " Homepage " settings ) for users that are n't  familiar with WooThemes themes . This is noted in the documentation , but may be confusing for new users . <p> There are also a couple of small styling changes to note . First , WooThemes themes have a " WooThemes " link in the footer of each theme . You can remove this by enabling the option under Layout that says , " Enable Custom Footer ( Bottom ) " . <p> You 'll also want to pay attention to your cart page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll probably end up with typography that 's too big for the cart table , and looks a bit weird . <p> With Sidebar <p> However , enabling a full-width template on the cart page fixes this and the cart looks great : <p> Full-width <h> Code Review <p> As WooThemes is the company behind WooCommerce , you can be assured that WooCommerce themes are done correctly and will appropriately style WooCommerce without overriding tons of templates ( which will cause issues as you update ) . <p> Hub is no different than the other WooCommerce themes from WooCommerce its done well and there are no issues in terms of styling WooCommerce pages or notices . <p> Sensei support may not be needed by many WooCommerce shops , but this does n't  add very much to the codebase and is n't a source for concern . <h> Overall <p> Hub is a solid choice for WooCommerce shops that want bold images and colors . Setup is fairly straight forward ( despite not knowing about Homepage control at first , which added a bit of time for my setup ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test shop . <h> Pop Up Shop RichWP <p> Pop Up Shop is a new WooCommerce theme from RichWP , who develops several types of WordPress themes . Its a minimal , sidebar-less theme that puts the focus on two things : your shop and your content . You wo n't get tons of different options and homepage templates here the goal is to keep the theme simple and focused . <p> Pop Up Shop is available for $69.95 for an unlimited license . You 'll probably also want a slider plugin , such as Soliloquy ( starts at $19 ) , as you can use the slider widget to add an image slider to your homepage . <h> Pros <p> There 's not really a learning curve to using Pop Up Shop , as it does n't  have tons of options , templates , and page builders to worry about . You can customize basic theme settings , such as the logo , colors , and menus . <p> Options : Using the Customizer <p> From there , you 'll probably want to check out the theme documentation , which does a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customized my colors , I set the shop as my front page under Settings &gt; Reading . Whatever page you set as your homepage will be displayed , and using the slider frontpage widget area will simply bump this content down to add the slider area . <p> This way , you can set up your own homepage or use something like your shop , then easily add the slider area above this if desired . <p> There are also some cool menu options with Pop Up Shop . I liked that I could create an icon menu , but make sure you have CSS classes turned on under the menus " Screen Options " . <p> Create icon menu <p> This icon menu will be displayed as part of the " Fly Out Menu " that can be accessed from the left side of the screen . <p> Flyout + Icon menus <p> You can also set menus for a main navigation menu at the top-right of the page , a footer menu , and a shop sorting menu . Filtering menus for the blog template are included as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but these are not customizable . <p> The sorting menu is very handy , and is added next to the product search bar . You can add custom links to sort your products instead of using the default WooCommerce sorting options . These can be links to product categories , tags , or orderby links . <p> Shop Page <p> Want to add some of the default sorting options back into this menu ( i.e. , " Sort by popularity " ) ? You can do that by manually adding links to the menu with this structure : /shop/ ? orderby=option . If your " Shop " page is n't using /shop/ , make sure you change that . Here are the acceptable values you can use for the orderby option value : <p> Option <p> Sorts by <p> menuorder <p> default / custom sorting <p> popularity <p> popularity <p> rating <p> average rating ( highest first ) <p> date <p> newness ( newest products first ) <p> price <p> price lowest to highest <p> price-desc <p> price highest to lowest <p> For example , sorting based on popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looks like this : /shop/ ? orderby=popularity . <p> Once you 've got your sorting menu set up , you 'll want to check out your shop page to confirm that everything works as expected . I liked that the images on the shop page stand out , and that there are no distractions in the middle of the shopping process . However , in order to gain this streamlined process , you do lose the ability to add price filtering and category widgets to your shop , which may not make this a great option for shops with hundreds of products . <p> Product pages are clean and minimal , as are Cart and Checkout pages . <p> Product Page <p> Overall , I liked that the theme was distraction-free , and that the focus is placed entirely on the shopping experience . <h> Cons <p> There are a few drawbacks and quirks to using Pop Up shop just as there are with any theme . There are no widget areas for customization nor are there homepage templates , so you 'll have to create your own homepage ( or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when using this theme , so this should n't be unexpected . <p> Note : Please see Felixs comment below there are are some updates to adjust some of the points Ive made here . <p> One thing I disliked is that the shop page button reads " Load More Articles " to load another page of products . I changed this to " Load More Products " using the Say What plugin ( the text domain is richwp ) , though you can change this to whatever you like . <p> " Load More " button <p> You also may want to change the number of products on shop pages , as this defaults to 10 , which leads to rows that are half-filled with products ( as there are four columns ) . I used the WooCommerce Customizer to change this to 12 products instead . Update : While this is tied into the WordPress number of posts per page , you still may want to change the number of products independent of the number of blog posts per page . <p> I also changed the number of related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products seems to be the ideal output . <p> Finally , while the docs were useful , there were a couple of issues . When I created my icon menu , I realized that the CSS class for the email icon was not icon-email , but should be icon-mail instead . The same thing can be said for the My Account page : icon-account should be icon-user . <p> However , I did see that these icons can be used in the main navigation ( top right ) as well , which was pretty cool . <h> Code Review <p> Pop Up Shop has good structure and is pretty lightweight for the most part . I did n't  like that there 's some in-line CSS on every page , which should be enqueued in a stylesheet rather than in-line for maximized performance . However , the fact that it leverages the theme customizer to remain lightweight and easy to set up was a bonus that balances this out . <p> ( This paragraph edited from original for clarity . ) The functions.php is a bit messy as well , as there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as customizer styling , which could be in a separate file ) . The functions.php should be more of a spinal cord loading pieces of the rest of the theme while the other options are like muscles and skin rather than vertebrae = . The CSS styling can also be organized a bit better within a new file , as its tough to follow . <p> However , there are no big structural issues , and the theme hooks into WooCommerce actions / filters to customize the shop layout rather than overriding templates , which is a good sign for compatibility and upgrades . <h> Overall <p> I liked that Pop Up Shop is a minimal theme that really puts the focus on a distraction-free shopping experience and on the sites product catalog . If you do n't  have a lot of other content to worry about , such as portfolio or informative pages , then this can be a contender for you . <h> Uno ( Canvas Child ) WooThemes <p> Uno is the first child theme for Canvas released by WooThemes . You 'll need Canvas ( $99 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $39 ) . This makes the total package more expensive than most WooCommerce themes at $138 . You benefit from a flexible structure that supports WooThemes plugins ( such as Features ) , fully supports WooCommerce , and provides a few different layout options for your site . <p> Canvas has several templates and layouts available for use , and these are inherited by Uno . However , Uno adds its own styles and a homepage template that makes setup very easy and far more user-friendly than its parent theme . <h> Pros <p> Youll be using the WooFramework to set up Canvas / Uno options , which is straight-forward and just like any other WooThemes product ( if you 've used them before ) . Canvas creates a solid structure for your site , but is basically a blank slate . Uno fills that in with its styling , and comes with a pre-built homepage template that 's meant to focus on your shop . You wont have to worry about adding widgets to a homepage widget area or creating a homepage from scratch . <p> WooFramework <p> The Uno homepage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme settings . You can upload a hero image , which will be displayed right below your navigation bar , and add a title , message , and call to action button . <p> Homepage Hero Section <p> The homepage will also automatically include sections for featured products , recent products , and recent posts / comments . You simply decide which page will be your homepage and use the " Homepage " template for this page . Make sure you set this static page as your homepage under Settings &gt; Reading . <p> You can also use the " Widgets " template for your homepage if you do n't  want to use the pre-built homepage , and can instead use content widgets and widgets for plugins such as Features or Testimonials . <p> Once the homepage is built , there are a couple of Canvas/Uno options I 'd adjust before you 're ready to go ( under Uno &gt; Settings ) . There 's also some documentation to help with this . <p> I 'd definitely change the " WooCommerce " part of the settings . I recommend that your WooCommerce pages use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary sidebar anyway . They look far better with a full width template ( for shop and product pages ) , as product images are larger and clearer . <p> For optional changes , I adjusted my site width under " Styling &amp; Layout " , and enabled full-width headers and footers . I also enable custom footers to remove unwanted credits . <p> That 's about it for settings ! Now you can check your shop out . Shop pages will contain 12 product per page in a 4-column layout , which means that you wont have to fool with the number of products per page . <p> Shop Page <p> Product pages feature large product images , as well as buttons and product tabs that look consistent with the rest of the site . <p> Product Page <p> All shop pages and notices look great with the rest of your shop , and Uno provides a great pre-made theme . <h> Cons <p> The biggest con to using Uno at the moment is that its a child theme . This means that you cant create a child theme ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any code customizations you make will be overridden when you update the theme . WooThemes is close to releasing a plugin that let 's you make these changes in an upgrade-safe way , but its something to keep in mind for now . <p> Even though most options are easy to use , Canvas adds a lot of options ( which are included with Uno ) , and can be overwhelming for users . For example , there are tons of Styling &amp; Layout options that most users wo n't need to change . While Uno makes a lot of these options unnecessary , they may still confuse some users . <p> You 'll also want to make sure that you set full-width templates for cart and checkout pages , as theyll otherwise include your default sidebar layout . You can do so while editing cart and checkout pages in the Uno meta box : <p> Change page layout <p> There are very few other downsides to Uno , as its a theme that you can use with only a few customization options , but that you can change as needed because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uno is a child theme for Canvas , there 's not a lot of code being added to your site . Most of the functionality is housed in the Canvas parent theme , as Uno is pretty much purely for styling . <p> However , Canvas is a great theme to work from , and has been the flagship theme for WooThemes for over five years ( which means a mature , stable code base ) . The bloat that was previously in the codebase has mostly moved to external plugins ( such as Projects for portfolios ) for even better performance . <h> Overall <p> Canvas is n't a theme I recommend for users , but lots of theme developers are familiar with it and customize it for client sites . Its a good starting point as a theme , and provides the necessary theme structure without styling . <p> However , Uno is designed to circumvent the need to style Canvas , and makes it a far realistic option for users . Using both Canvas and Uno , the Canvas " framework " becomes a theme that end-users can install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All three of the themes we 've looked at in this edition of our best WooCommerce themes series are solid choices for your WooCommerce site . They add great styling options that provide a shopping experience consistent with the rest of your theme while maintaining good structure and usability. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Hi Beka , thanx for introducing my Pop Up Shop Theme and providing us with constructive criticism . Reading theme previews of this format are rare and always welcome from customers as well as developers . They help us making our themes better . <p> I was probably lost in translation when creating the wording for the " more button " . I have changed it into " Load More Products " button . <p> You also do not need the WooCommerce customizer plugin to change the number of products . I have tight it to the Number of Posts under Settings -+ Reading in your WordPress Admin , since it made sense to use 8 or 12 buttons for the blog section as well . <p> I do not agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created and read out via functions.php are limited to CSS classes that are dependent on the theme customizer ( color settings ) plus the icon font files . This is actually best practice and can be found in the WordPress standard themes as well . If you are using a good caching plugin with a minifier , this should n't have any negative influence on the performance of your site . Besides that every section in the function.php is commented out so I would n't say that it is a " bit messy " = <p> Hey Felix , thanks so much for stopping by &amp; chiming in . RE products per page : Shops with large catalogs tend to show 24-36+ products per page , so I think theyd want to change this independent of the number of posts ( since the blog template uses a list format ) , which is why I recommend the Customizer ( or similar ) . <p> I see your point about my comment on the functions.php , so let me clarify as its a bit poorly worded ( editing now ) . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for example , putting the customizer functions into an /inc/customizer.php file rather than in the main file to make it a bit easier to follow ( i.e. , the way TwentyFourteen does ) . The CSS classes should definitely be there , but may be better served within its own function to create the styles , then using wpaddinlinestyle to add the CSS its cleaner and a bit easier to follow ( which is what I meant by messy ) . The way Marketify does this in its customizer.php is a great example . <p> Ive editing this paragraph for clarity since it was n't reflecting what I was trying to say = .

Depending on what you sell , this may be integral to your business model . For example , florist shops typically need to accept a delivery date ( and maybe even time ) to be able to fulfill orders . <p> add delivery / pickup fees for certain days of the week or specific dates <p> and manage holidays or other pickup schedules . <p> We 've previously published a detailed review of the plugin , but there are several improvements that have been made since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order Delivery Date Pro Updated : Overview <p> While the basic functionality that was included in our original review remains , there are some substantial changes to the plugin . First , the entire codebase has been rewritten to improve structure and organization . Order management has become easier with the addition of order filtering and a delivery calendar . <p> Delivery dates can be managed by shipping method and by product category to give you the granular control over delivery times and availability that you need . <p> Time slots , flexibility in setting times by day or specific date , and integration with other plugins have all been improved for a much more complete experience in managing order deliveries . This is a vastly improved plugin over our original review = <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Date Settings <p> The first change that becomes quickly apparent when WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro 3.0 is installed is how much easier the settings are to navigate . The settings now use the WordPress settings API , which makes them look more native to your site . <p> Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have some of the features I love , such as the ability to set fees for certain delivery days ( such as Saturday delivery charges ) , enable delivery information in order emails , and enabling which days are available for delivery . In addition , you can still lock out delivery for a date after a certain number of deliveries to ensure you can meet the delivery schedule . <p> The only thing I think this screen is missing is the ability to set a label for a fee to control how its shown to the customer ( instead of just " Delivery charges " ) . <p> There are some useful additions , too . First , you can now set a Minimum Delivery Time , rather than a minimum number of days . This makes it far more feasible to provide same-day delivery ( if you choose to ) , as you do n't  have to set a minimum of one-day . Instead , you can require at least 3 hours for delivery , or whatever number of hours you need . <p> You can opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quickly see delivery details ( this was possible before , but could not be disabled ) . <p> Orders List <p> And you can filter orders by delivery to view todays deliveries , or deliveries by month . <p> Filter Orders <p> Finally , there are several new integrations available with other WooCommerce extensions , which well take a closer look at shortly . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Time Settings <p> Time settings will still allow you to enable time capture and the time range available for delivery , with one major addition : you can now set a fee for same day delivery . Previously , next day delivery fees could be set , but same day delivery fees were not available ( most likely due to the fact that you could n't set a minimum number of hours for delivery , so many shops required at least one day ) . <p> Old Time Settings <p> New Time Settings <p> As we said in our previous review , I 'd recommend using time capture or time slots , but not both , to schedule deliveries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input is a time capture , while the bottom is a time slot : <p> Choose a time selector <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Time Slots <p> Time slot settings have had some serious updates to add two major features . First , time slots can be set per day to allow you to use different time slots for different days of the week . <p> Old time slot settings <p> Time Slots <p> Time Slots per day <p> This allows to offer times on Mondays , Wednesdays , or Fridays , while offering different slots on Tuesdays and Thursdays , or offering fewer slots on Saturdays . I 'd love to see a bit of improvement in adding these slots per day ( currently you have to add all slots for Monday , then all slots for Tuesday , etc , instead of " sharing " slots across days ) , but this is an excellent change for shops that offer limited delivery schedules on certain days . <p> You can also set up time slots per date instead of per day if you have specific delivery dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally , time slots can be created without an end time so that they 're open-ended . You can set a delivery timeslot for " 3pm onward " to signify " delivery after 3p " instead of setting a specific end time for the slot . To do so , you can leave the delivery end time as 00:00 . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Holidays <p> Holidays are a great feature of WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro , as they allow you to avoid deliveries on those dates . While you could always add holidays , you can now easily add date ranges for a holiday instead of adding every single day individually , making holiday set up much faster . <p> Old Holiday Settings <p> New Holiday Settings <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Delivery Dates <p> Setting up specific delivery dates has always been possible with Order Delivery Date Pro , but you can now set up dates and fees for those dates . This can let you enable certain weekend deliveries you would n't normally use , or add surcharges for deliveries around holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a day-before-Christmas fee . <p> Old Date Settings <p> Specific Dates <p> Since you can now use both recurring weekdays and specific dates for timeslots , using specific dates becomes far more compelling for additional delivery dates or dates with surcharges . <p> With the ability to use weekdays and dates with time slots , you can now set up a scenario like this : <p> Monday-Thursday deliveries are regular with set time slots <p> Friday deliveries have a more limited schedule <p> Holiday deliveries , such as Halloween , have time slots that stop at 3pm and add additional delivery charges <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Appearance <p> Appearance settings have not been left behind in the recent changes either . There are a few new settings of note : <p> you can determine what day the week should start on <p> you can determine if delivery date fields should be shown with billing or shipping fields <p> you can add a label / note with the field , such as " time slots are not guaranteed " or " Saturday charges apply " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of all virtual products ( which do n't  require shipping or delivery ) <p> Old Appearance settings <p> New Appearance Settings <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Shipping Methods <p> Now were getting to some of my favorite changes = One new tab has been added to the settings area for additional functionality : Settings by Shipping Method . <p> This will allow you to enable or disable delivery based on a particular shipping method in your shop . <p> Settings Per Shipping Method <p> For example , you can disable delivery dates for flat rate shipping , free shipping , and international shipping , and this will prevent delivery date fields from showing at checkout if these methods are selected . <p> You can then enable delivery date fields for other methods , such as local delivery or local pickup . If you add settings for the shipping method , these will override the general / global settings so that the shipping method <p> Set delivery per shipping method 1 <p> Set delivery per shipping method 2 <p> Set delivery per shipping method 3 <p> Set delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per method , your checkout will respect them and any fees associated with them . If delivery dates are not available for the method , they wont be shown . Otherwise , delivery dates and times can be chosen : <p> Delivery / Date unavailable <p> Delivery / Date available <p> ( Note that checkout fields have been simplified in these screenshots to be able to show all data . ) <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Categories <p> You can also now enable delivery per categories , which is a huge bonus for flexibility . When you edit a category , you can enable or disable delivery for the product . <p> Category setting <p> While viewing your product categories , you 'll be able to see if delivery dates are enabled or not . <p> Category List <p> If an order consists entirely of products in a delivery-disabled category , delivery dates will not be available . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Managing Deliveries <p> A new delivery calendar is available under the " Order Delivery Date " menu , which will show all scheduled item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased . This makes managing delivery orders much easier , as you can see all scheduled deliveries in one view . <p> Delivery calendar <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Integrations <p> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro is now integrated with several other extensions and plugins to improve how it fits into your stores workflow . <p> You can also use the plugin with WPML to translate your site ; the plugin now includes . pot file so that all strings are translation-ready . <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro : Other Notes <p> The customer experience while using the plugin at checkout is fairly unchanged from previous versions , but the shipping methods integration makes this selecting delivery dates easier for customers to understand , as you can hide them for virtual products or only show them for certain shipping methods . <p> Order management is mostly unchanged as well , as viewing delivery dates or manually adding orders can still be done . The addition of the delivery calendar is very helpful for managing orders as well . <p> While the code quality can still be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure is broken up appropriately and prefixing is now used to avoid conflicts . The plugin has also added several hooks ( along with a developer reference ) to make it easier to customize . <p> There are some downsides to using the plugin still : <p> The ability to add a label for fees to control how they 're displayed to customers would be nice <p> Time slots per day are great , but the ability to share settings across days ( i.e. , a multiselect for days ) would make setup easier <p> Since both global settings and settings per shipping method can be set , this can make set up a bit confusing if you do n't  realize that per-shipping settings will override your global / standard settings , so some UI refinements would help with this <h> WooCommerce Order Delivery Date Pro Updates <p> Shops can now enable delivery settings based on shipping method and enable / disable delivery dates for product categories , making it far easier to have granular control over when delivery is available . You can also disable the delivery date field for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Management is much easier with the delivery calendar , as you can get a view of all delivery dates in your shop to schedule deliveries . Filtering orders by delivery date also helps with this . <p> Time slots are far improved , as they can be set for both recurring weekdays as well as specific dates , and integrations with other plugins help Order Delivery Date to integrate with the rest of your site and workflow . <p> I 've asked about changes that are on the way , and the roadmap for the plugin looks to provide more control based on the geography of the customer . For example , the " settings by shipping method " will allow you to set delivery fees based on product categories , post code , or state / city . The recent changes and upcoming features make Order Delivery Date Pro a great solution for stores that need to gather date or time-related information for their orders . <p> Note : This post . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138255 @2338255/ <h> WordPress eCommerce Themes <p> When you look at a theme demo , pay attention to how shop and product pages are styled . Do they blend in with the rest of the theme , or do they just use default styles ? Add some products to the cart , change the cart , go to checkout do all notices get styled ? Is everything aligned ? Youd be amazed at how many themes overlook these details when you start to notice them . <p> WooCommerce <p> Theming WooCommerce can be a pain , and many themes say they fully support WooCommerce when they do n't  actually touch template styling . This causes the " shop " pages to look out of place with your theme ( since they use default styling ) and is something to pay attention to . <p> WooCommerce parent company WooThemes always has themes that are fully WooCommerce-compatible , and Ive also got a series of articles on WooCommerce themes .

@@98138256 @2338256/ <h> Email Case Study Survey Email from The Den <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Last month in our email case study , we looked at the receipt email from Michael Kors . In this months edition , were looking at another lifecycle email the survey email . These emails are typically sent after a customer makes a purchase . These can also be sent after other interactions , like after the customer attends an event , or after a support call , etc . <p> Feedback emails can help you gather information about pain points in the customer journey , and key metrics that you 're trying to improve . Surveys can be customized to things in your business that you want to focus on . <p> In this post , we wo n't look at the actual survey , but at the email requesting feedback from The Den . Well look at what was done well in the email , what was lacking , and what got us to click . <h> Survey Emails : What was good about The Den email ? <p> The Den provides DIY jewelry-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you email which included a request to fill out their survey . <p> Reward customers for providing feedback <h> 1 . Thank you <p> Saying thank you makes customers feel appreciated for giving you business . The email highlights this in the heading , as well as the first paragraph of the body . A simple thank you can go a long way in improving a customers experience and opinion of your brand . <h> 2 . Photos <p> The next major part of this email is giving a link to photos taken during the workshop . Photos are great reminders of the experience , especially if they feature your customers . The link in this email went to The Dens Facebook page where they featured albums from different events . This also helps grow their social presence , and makes the photos easy to share . <p> But , photos do n't  have to be from a workshop or an event . You can link to your Instagram or other social platforms where people share photos of your products . For example , your Instagram can highlight different ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use your products . <h> 3 . Reward for completing survey <p> The best part of the request for survey is the offer of a reward for providing feedback . In this email , customers get a $20 credit for future workshops with The Den . Instead of just thanking people for their feedback , this gives them something tangible as a reward . <p> Store credit works great because you 're locking in the reward to your own store . In addition , it builds incentive for customers to come back to shop more . A typical workshop at The Den costs upwards of $200 , so the $20 is a small hit to the margins , but is a big enough reward for customers to come back . You can adjust the reward based your margins and average order value . <h> Survey Emails : What was bad about The Den email ? <h> 1 . Layout <p> Although the email contains a lot of good content link to photos , reward for survey , big thank you , etc. , the layout is not broken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartmentalize different things within the email , and makes the email easy to navigate through . <p> The generic image helps to remind customers of the workshop experience , but in this email , the image is too large and creates extra scroll space to the main content . Images can make good banners , but make sure the images are relevant and do n't  take up too much space in the email if they 're not personalized. <h> 2 . No contact information <p> Jewelry made during the workshop may need future adjustments . The email does not include an email address or a phone number where customers can call for support or follow-up appointments for adjustments . This creates extra work for customers as they have to navigate to the website to find this information . <h> 3 . No next steps <p> The thank you or survey email can be a great opportunity to highlight other products , or workshops in this case . These can be up-selling or cross-selling opportunities , or simply showcase other products that customers may be interested in . This is especially useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop for completing the survey . <p> The Den has workshops for more advanced DIY projects . Including these workshops in the email gives customers an idea of what they can do next within the series . <h> 4 . No signer <p> The email is not signed by anybody , which makes it feel impersonal . Including the name of an individual is probably one of the best ways to sign an email , even better if the name is of the founder / co-founder / owner along with their title . <p> Emails signed by owners make customers feel more important . They signal the fact that the owner takes an interest in each transaction , and that somebody of authority will receive the feedback . <h> Survey Emails : What gets you to click ? <p> The two big ones are the link to the event photos , and the reward for completing the survey . The reward not only gives an incentive to customer to complete the survey , but since it is a store credit , it also helps build repeat business . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to the customers in return for their time and comments . Since most merchants do n't  do this yet , it can help differentiate you , and create an image that your brand is generous . <h> Survey Emails : Takeaways <p> The thank you and survey email is an important part of lifecycle emails . It not only gives you feedback about things you can improve , but also signals to your customers that your business wants to improve . <p> You can give customers a reward for completing your survey . You can provide discounts or credits on your WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads stores using extensions : <p> For WooCommerce , you can use the Points and Rewards extension to manage points for your store . For example , 1 store point can mean $1 value towards a purchase . For customers who complete your survey , you can assign points to their account so that they can use these points for future purchases . <p> For Easy Digital Downloads , you can use their version of the Points and Rewards extension to assign and manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers . <p> Do you use survey emails ? What do you do to incentivize survey completion ? Please tell us in the comments below .

Weve written in depth reviews of the core plugin and the EDD 1.9 update if you 're looking for a comprehensive view of what the plugin can do . <p> EDD 2.0 will be released later this week , so we 've previewed the plugin to bring you an Easy Digital Downloads 2.0 review . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.0 Review <p> The EDD v2.0 release is more of an evolution for the plugin than a revolution , but I think users will love some of the changes . There are n't  a ton of new features , but there are some UI changes and cleanup done to make the plugin even more user-friendly . Well go through some of the most significant changes here , but I 'd recommend reading the overview at EDD as well ( there 's a great video of changes ) . <p> Keep an eye out for the full release at the end of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my favorite part about the EDD v2.0 release ( though the export changes are handy , too ) . Creating discount codes has been tweaked to be simpler . Previously , setting rules and requirements for discounts took a bit of effort to understand . Rules for setting restrictions and exclusions for discounts have been re-worded and clarified : <p> EDD 1.9 Discounts <p> EDD 2.0 Discounts <p> You can still restrict coupons to certain downloads , and allow the discount for only those items , or for the entire cart its now just easier to do so . <p> You could previously add downloads to the cart automatically by adding LONG ... to your stores URL and substituting in your products post I 'd ( you could also use the checkout page URL to display this immediately ) . However , you can now pass in discount codes via URL as well using ? discount=DISCOUNTCODE , which can let you automatically add downloads and a discount to the cart . <p> For example , let 's say I want to add a product along with my 20OFF coupon when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addtocart action and discount code to my checkout URL : LONG ... This is great for newsletter promotions or coupons to reduce friction to purchasing ! All customers have to do is press " submit " . <p> Finally , discount code handling has been improved on the frontend . Users now see a button to " Apply " the discount so they have some feedback as to when the discount code has been added . Error message for discounts are also now more descriptive , and will tell users if the discount does n't  apply , is expired , and more : <p> Invalid Discount <p> Expired Discount <h> Tools and Exports <p> The Tools page has been reworked and some additions have been made . First , System Info is now located under Tools rather than as its own menu item . A tool to ban email address from purchase has also been added , as many users previously needed a free plugin to do this . The settings import/export is located under Tools as well . A tab for API keys has also been added so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the iOS earnings app . <p> EDD 2.0 Tools <p> Exports have gotten some love in v2.0 , which is a really cool improvement to see . You can now export earnings and sales stats for a specific date range from the Exports tab under Downloads &gt; Reports . <p> Earnings Export <p> Payment History exports now include customer billing addresses if collected , and Customer Exports have also been upgraded . Previously customer CSV exports could be done for customers that purchased a specific product . You can now narrow down these exports even further to only export customers that have purchased a particular price option for a product ( i.e. , the unlimited version of your plugin vs. other versions ) . <p> Customer Exports <h> Misc Settings <p> Some settings have been tweaked or added for the v2.0 release as well . First , you can now force SSL on checkout to ensure that customers always hit the https : // checkout page . <p> Force SSL <p> Registration options are more detailed , and will allow you to determine what forms should be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but certainly not least , the ability to force order numbers to be sequential has been added , which will be helpful for some EU shops that require this . You can set optionally set a prefix and/or suffix for your order numbers , and select where order numbers should start . <p> Order Numbers <p> You can also apply the new order number settings to previous orders by running an upgrade routine , which will change all old order numbers : <p> Order Numbers Update <h> Payment History and Orders <p> The Payment History and Order Details screens have been tweaked to improve search and clean up details . Previously , you could only search for customer emails , names , and purchase keys . You can now also search for PayPal transactions using txn:transactionnumber , users based on I 'd , purchase IDs , and downloads in an order . <p> EDD 1.9 Payments Search <p> EDD 2.0 Payments Search <p> On the Order Details screen , you can now flag payments as unlimited downloads and view file download logs easily within order screen : <p> Order Screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also made checkout slightly easier for users . If you allow quantity changes in the cart or checkout , this has also been updated . Users no longer have to click " Update Cart " to apply these changes , which had previously led to issues . Updates will now automatically be applied to the cart and total when quantities are changed . <p> EDD also now enables revision history for products ( just like posts and pages ) so you can view and restore changes if this is not disabled by your host . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.0 Review Conclusions <p> There are a few other small changes and tweaks , but this covers the bulk of the changes in EDD 2.0 . My favorite changes are the discount code creation tweaks , as I found it a bit easier to create coupons , and the additional export options .

@@98138259 @2338259/ <p> Next up in our WordPress eCommerce guide , we review a plugin that somehow manages to fly under most peoples radar , despite having almost 500,000 downloads and a 4.7 star rating on WordPress.org . Ready ! Shopping Cart is one of the newest WordPress eCommerce platforms to jump on the scene , as its been around for about 20 months . Bonus points for a free core plugin and a decent paid extension offering , but it seems that this is a plugin that needs some time to mature and work out some bugs before it can be a truly viable eCommerce solution . <p> Ready ! Shopping Cart is another free eCommerce plugin option , and is available from WordPress.org to download . Installation is easy , and taking some time to get used to product addition and options will prove valuable before committing to using it for your store . I would also check out the features list to see if it will address everything you need it to . <p> Ready ! is advertised to work with any theme , and it did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it had some display issues with themes from other developers that you 'll need to iron out before launching . There are some official themes available if you 'd prefer to use them over one of the standard WordPress themes . Some are free , and others can be purchased for $39 . There are also official extensions available for purchase for $29 each , or you can get a license bundle for $49 to $199 , which can include free extensions and/or multi-site licenses . For a payment processor and a couple helpful add-ons , you 'll probably need $60-$120 to get up and running . <h> Cost summary : <p> Free core plugin , which is always great , and an estimated $130 for themes and extensions . <p> Installation for Ready ! Shopping Cart is easy and needed pages are automatically generated . Settings are extensive , and you have the ability to configure useful items such as forcing SSL upon checkout , setting terms and conditions , or allowing/disallowing backorders . However , the menu is a little bit strange to use at first since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backend : General Settings <p> One setting I would change right away is under " currencies " . US dollars should be set up already , but you 'll want to change the way its displayed , since its displayed like a European currency . Change the dollar position to before the value , and change your decimal point to a period instead of a comma . This was a bit of a nuisance , since if US dollars is set by default , at least it should be set correctly . <p> There are some other settings you should play with , such as the ability to allow guest checkout , skip checkout confirmation if you want a one-page checkout , and the image sizing options . You 'll also want to look at product settings to determine how product data will be entered . <p> Backend : Product Settings <p> You can also change how product information is displayed , and include social buttons on product pages : <p> Settings : Product View <h> Tax Options <p> Tax options will meet the needs of most stores and are comparable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on region , or in bands ( such as standard and reduced rates ) . One bonus is the ability to apply tax only to certain categories , which is really helpful for stores selling both physical and digital goods ( check out our Easy Digital Downloads Review for more on taxation of digital products ) . Make sure you label the name with " tax " , since this is what 's displayed to the customer . <p> Backend : Tax Options <h> Products <p> Product addition for simple products is pretty easy , and products are created as WordPress custom post types . You can add simple , configurable/variable , and downloadable products . You can add a short description , which will be displayed on the shopping pages , and a full description . You can set the length of the short description display in settings , and I would recommend no more than 2 lines ; otherwise , some of your buttons may become misaligned . You also have to ability to set categories , tags , and brands for each product . Brands were pretty helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated , which you can use in your navigation ( along with a similar page for categories , which also makes browsing easier ) . <p> Backend : Product Editor <p> You can manually set related products in the product editor , but they did n't  display anywhere on the product page , nor did it display in the related products widget . I also found that my related products occasionally reset themselves , so while I was happy about this being included , I would n't call it a victory just yet . Creating a media gallery was also a bit of a pain , as you ca n't select files you 've uploaded to your WP media folder , and instead must add them from your computer or a URL . <p> Basic product data is also included so that you can set pricing , manage stock , and adjust weight or dimensions for shipping purposes . The ability to set products as featured or new is meant for use with the Featured Products or New Products widgets . <p> Backend : Product Data in Editor <p> Variable Product addition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems there are two elements to the plugin meant to help with product variations ; there are product parameters and a variation manager in the top right of the product editor page . I think parameters are meant more as product attributes , as they do n't  change price ( or , in a couple circumstances , did change it , but never to the correct amount despite playing with all settings ) , nor are they reflected when adding products to the cart ( or again , were wrong ) . I also experience some parameters being overridden and being named as " array " with a price of $0 rather than the name and value I set . The documentation on parameters is n't very helpful either , so these were a bust . <p> Settings : Product Parameters <p> Since parameters are a bit unwieldy , I tried to use the variations manager instead . This was more in line with what I expected , as I was able to set variations for my tee shirt product , including stock and prices . However , there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to set all variations manually : for example , you ca n't set attributes for size ( Mens Small , Mens Medium , etc ) and color ( Gray , Black ) , then link them to produce all variation combinations ( Mens Small in Gray , Mens Small in Black , etc ) . Instead , I had to set each variation individually , such as " Mens Small , Gray " and " Mens Small , Black " . Doing this manually just takes a bit more time , so it was n't a deal breaker . <p> Backend : Adding Variations <p> However , pricing was a big issue . I wanted to set a higher price for a XXL tee shirt , so I set it in the variation manager . This price was never used or displayed , as only the default price for the product was used ( the new pricing was never able to override the parent pricing ) . Stock for variations also did n't  matter , as only the stock set in the product data was referenced . When adding different variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default product . Essentially , this made setting variations for products useless for my store . <p> Frontend : Variable Product Page <p> Note : Keep in mind that I test all plugins on a localhost with a new WordPress install using the TwentyTwelve theme , and I do n't  have other plugins activated while testing . I only check for compatibility with a few other themes after I 've put the plugin through its paces , so I have no idea how the issues with variations would arise other than issues within the plugin itself . <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Ready ! Shopping Cart includes several shortcodes to insert products into pages , display categories , and more . However , shortcodes are not terribly easy to use , and the built-in shortcode button ( in the visual editor ) does n't  help for categories or individual products , as none of my categories or products appeared for me to select . <p> Backend : Insert Shortcode Button <p> I had a few issues with shortcodes overall that I 'd love to see corrected : <p> You cant set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , so I ended up having only two products in each row , which really does n't  make the grid display that much more useful than a list . <p> There 's no way to display featured or new products , even though you can label these in the product editor . <p> Widgets were a bit more useful than shortcodes , and there are a lot of built-in widgets . This is the only way to display featured or new products , and you can also include a search widget to narrow down items by price . I did n't  like that the widgets werent " smart " product widgets were displayed on all pages instead of just product pages . For example , the related products widget ( which did n't  actually work ) , was displayed on my home page , which is kind of useless . <p> The browsing experience is overall positive for the customer , as they can display all products , or sort by brand / category very easily . Products are laid out in a grid view by default ( which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a list view if you want to . However , one downside to the customer experience is that Ready ! Shopping cart does not include coupons or discount codes ( discounts can be added with an extension ) . <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> Product pages are in need of some styling changes , so be prepared to take that on if you use Ready ! Shopping Cart ( or do n't  , but the layout is a bit all over the place and space can be used more effectively ) . While you 're at it , you will probably want to remove post information , such as the date and author , which probably shouldnt be on product pages and is included by default . You also have to set default image sizes before you upload any products to ensure the images are consistent . The large product image is displayed with a title , then the information in the screenshot below . If you want to add reviews to your product pages , you can use the Product Ratings extension . <p> Frontend : Simple Product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after product addition , or you can display an " added to cart " notification . The cart page is well-done and you can adjust product quantities before going to checkout . <p> Frontend : Cart Page <p> Ready ! Shopping Cart uses a multi-step checkout out of the box ( a confirmation step is required before order submission ) . You can turn Ready ! Shopping Cart into a one-page checkout by disabling the confirmation step , but be aware that you 'll want to change the button text if you do . The checkout page uses a " Next Step " button at the bottom of the page ( to go to confirmation ) , which is n't updated if you disable the confirmation step , and it actually submits the order . To avoid upsetting or confusing customers , youll want to update this button text if you change to a one-page checkout ( such as " submit " or " place order " instead ) . <p> Basic shipping options work pretty well with Ready ! Shopping Cart , but payment options are very limited in the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding these payment and shipping options . <h> Shipping Options <p> Basic flat rate shipping will allow you to set multiple rates for regions , essentially allowing you to create your own zones . The quantity discounts took a little bit of tweaking to make them work , but could be helpful . You can also set table rate shipping , using weight tiers for different zones . If you need exactly shipping rates , there are several integrations available , such as the USPS Shipping extension , FedEx Shipping extension , or the UPS Shipping extension ( along with others ) . <h> Inventory <p> You can enable inventory tracking , but there are no low or out-of-stock notifications . You can allow backorders using Ready ! Shopping Cart , which is a big plus in my book . The customer will be notified that the item is not in stock when adding it to the cart , and then checkout proceeds as normal . The order is generated as a normal order , so you 'll have to keep track of backorders yourself , but the ability to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to allow backorders , you can set products with no stock as " Coming Soon ! " instead . <p> Ready ! Shopping Cart provides documentation for the core plugin , but they do n't  necessarily contain explanations for the average user , and in some cases just restate the hints from the plugin itself . The docs are also incomplete for some topics and look as if they 're still in development . As the plugin developers are Russian , there are times where explanations ( and spelling ) are a bit choppy ( Russian does n't  use as many linking verbs/articles as English so its tough to translate ) , which makes understanding docs difficult in some cases . Responses to reviews at WordPress.org are prompt , but that does n't  seem to carry over to the support forum , as there are several open threads . I brought up the issues I had with product variations in the support forum , but was unable to get a response . <p> However , this could be an issue with scaling as more people download the plugin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased extensions over free support for the free plugin ) . It seems that the plugin authors are committed to improving the core offering and soliciting as much feedback as possible based on responses to reviews . They 're also trying to provide resources such as the links to the FAQ within the plugin dashboard : <p> Ready ! Shopping Cart is not very extensible at the moment , as it seems this is a young marketplace . A couple of promising extensions are the Invoice and Packing Printing extension , which allows customers to access/print invoices and packing slips from their accounts , and the Special Products , Gifts , and Coupons pack , which allows you to create discounts . <p> Overall , Ready ! Shopping Cart is a plugin that appears to need some time to mature before it becomes a serious eCommerce solution . The fact that its a free core plugin and that the developers seem serious about improvements and growth are upsides , but there are too many issues to actually depend on it to run a full-fledged store . Simple product addition works well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many five star reviews on WordPress.org with the major issues in adding product variations it appears as though many five-star reviews are from users who have only ever used or reviewed this product and have no other activity . Other downsides include the need for some style/design updates , especially if using something other than a Ready ! Cart or standard WordPress theme , and improvements to shortcodes and widgets . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article ; If I did n't  test it , I 'm basing my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 3 Comments <p> Thanks for this detailed review , Beka . A woman in a Berlin WP group that I participate in had asked about a simple ecommerce plugin for someone she knew . I recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you test for translation-readiness ? It would be great if localization / translation options were on every developers radar but its often not . <p> Hi Tammi , thanks for the comment . While doing a general review , translation-readiness is n't something I usually dive into in favor of covering usability , etc . However , I agree that translation options can sometimes get overlooked , especially in earlier versions of the plugin , in favor of other features . <p> Unfortunately , I have n't had experience with translations in any plugin except WooCommerce + WPML , but that setup has worked well . I know several extensions are translation-ready also , but cant speak to other plugins . Sorry I ca n't be of more help !

It is similar to the EDDDownload and EDDCustomer classes we have introduced in other recent releases . Beta 1 announcement <p> The EDDPayment class is backwards compatible so that all original payment update methods will continue to work , but its much easier to work with going forward . The team has an overview on the development blog with examples on instantiating the new payment class and using its methods to create or modify payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changes <p> There are also some small " quality of life " improvements you may be interested in . <p> First , if you frequently give out discounts , you may want to know who has used them . Payments can now be searched by discount code by entering discount : code in the orders search like this : discount : 5off <p> If you allow product quantities to be changed , you could n't previously get that date in payments exports . Quantities are now included in the payment history export . <h> Easy Digital Downloads 2.5 Review : Summary <p> Easy Digital Downloads version 2.5 makes some nice incremental improvements to the core plugin to help admins manage site stats , settings , exports , and download files . Developers also get some help with a payments class that makes it much easier to interact with payment records programmatically , and they can also leverage the more organized settings pages for extensions to make it clearer where extension settings are . <p> While there are no ground-breaking changes from the user perspective in this release , EDD 2.5 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools to make their day-to-day management quicker and easier , improving the overall experience with EDD. 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

With many years in the industry , Paul is now the community manager for Digital Exits , who helped create the infographic below . He likes to help people get results and also provides as much information as needed to help those around him . <p> We put a lot of focus on setting up an eCommerce business using WordPress , but rarely ask the question , " How much is my WordPress eCommerce site worth ? " The value of your WordPress eCommerce site is an important fact to know in case you 'd like to sell your business one day . Interestingly , the platform on which you build your site does n't  have a huge influence on value . However , I 'm willing to bet that there would be some negative impact if you 're using a platform that 's not consistently maintained ( as most major platforms like Bigcommerce , Shopify , or WooCommerce are ) . <p> Also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for these multiples , but those selling digital products typically demand a lower multiple different type of product , different multiple . Software companies , for example , typically demand multiples closer to 0.75x to 1.5x . Maybe its because products change quickly , but its a trend to consider depending on your business type . <p> Our friends over at Digital Exits created a helpful infographic about an easy way to evaluate your business . A lot of you may have wondered at some point about selling your eCommerce business or tried figuring out how much it is worth . Well , the good news is that it is n't that hard ; you just need to know what to look at and how to calculate the proper figures to find out what your business is worth . <p> While looking at this infographic , you may notice the term " multiple " being used a lot . The way this term should be interpreted is that it means the multiple of earnings that your business may be able to sell for . For instance , if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , that business would be able to sell at a multiple of 2 or 3which approximately puts your businesss value at about $200,000 to $300,000 . <p> Digital Exits will also provide free valuations for any business owner who is willing to contact them about it . Although this infographic is really helpful in trying to figure out the value of your eCommerce business by yourself , it is always best to get a professional third party to evaluate it when looking to put it up for sale . The last thing you want to do is to get an incorrect amount and sell the business for less than it is actually worth . <p> Thanks so much to Paul and Digital Exits for sharing this research . While many business owners launch a site expecting to stay with the site as it continues to grow , there are sometimes circumstances that will necessitate a sale . Its valuable to have an idea of how much your WordPress eCommerce site is worth before getting to this point . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based mainly on a multiple as a point of review , or are they doing a more in-depth analysis into discounted cash-flow , present value , etc ? <p> Hey Craig , I think it depends on the buyer some simply do n't  do their due diligence , while others do this , but still use multiples of annual revenue as a measuring stick . <p> For acquisitions that I 've been a part of , we do an analysis on net present value , our costs to maintain / increase revenue , user growth &amp; churn rates , etc . Of course , these have been acquisitions for companies that sell digital products , so multiples are far lower . Regardless , buyers and sellers still seem to compare the acquisition price to a revenue multiplier even if other factors are considered ( we do this as well when making offers ) . While due diligence is still necessary to ensure that revenue is n't the only factor considered , I think it just makes a handy measuring stick , which is why its used as a reference . 11393 @qwx871393

@@98138264 @2338264/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> This is our first store owner interview and were thrilled to have Steven Sashen on . Steven is the founder and CEO of Xero Shoes makers of barefoot running footwear where you can purchase pre-made sandals or kits to make your own sandals . Steven is also a big proponent of the barefoot running movement , is a competitive sprinter , and has refused an offer from Kevin OLeary on ABCs Shark Tank . <p> Below is the summary of the discussion . <h> Did I miss anything in terms of what you do ? <p> In terms of Xero Shoes , people use our products for much more than running . Also , starting in or around October 2016 , we will have more than just sandals as were launching our line of shoes . Instead of focusing on barefoot , the way I like to describe what we do is that we are to footwear what natural and organic are to food . So were about letting your feet bend , flex , move , and function naturally . <h> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the beginning like ? <p> The idea came from watching people running in slow motion to see what they really did or did n't  need in terms of support . We started the company in November 2009 . Prior to that , I had been making sandals just as a hobby . Then Michael Sandler , who was writing a book about barefoot running , said that if I had a website then hell put me in his book . <p> So I rushed home , pitched the idea to my wife who told me its a really stupid idea , and so after she went to bed around 9pm , I had the website up by around 10pm . The way I convinced her the next day was by saying that this can be an SEO experiment as I was confident I could own the keyword space and well see what it does maybe itll be a car payment . Two months later , it was a full-time job . <p> Another thing was that at the time , there was one other guy doing this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ordered from him , it would take three weeks to get something delivered , and I did n't  like the materials he was using and that he was n't treating it as a business . So I had my own take on the idea . <p> One of the first things I did was make videos and PDFs about how to make sandals and just put those out there . Then it was just a matter of selling the pieces and kits to make your own sandals . <p> I built the website on WordPress . The first eCommerce platform I used was Ecwid because it was one of the quickest ways to start selling at that time . After that , I moved over to Interspire , the self-hosted version of BigCommerce , because I wanted more control over the UI and experience . <h> How did you end up picking WooCommerce ? <p> Eventually , I needed a solution that did inventory management for product bundles really well because we had individual pieces and also kitted products . WooCommerce had the Product Bundles extension ( built by Manos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that made me shift over in late 2012 . <h> What were some marketing tactics that you used to build traction ? <p> I found the places where people were talking about the things that I was doing , and just got in on the conversations . I started doing some SEO by creating some content , putting videos on YouTube , and set up a Facebook page , a Twitter account , and everything-else account . <p> Videos are a very important part of what were doing . For example , on the footer of every page on our site are videos featuring me and my wife explaining what were doing , why were doing it , and why you should be part of it . Those videos get a lot of views . Part of the reason for those videos is to give people information , but a big part is also to let people relate to us instead of dealing with a faceless company . Were real people and we relate to other real people . <p> One of the videos I wish people watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product page . We explain how to get the correct-sized footwear from our site in that video , and I 'm surprised how many people do n't  want to watch it because they think they already know their size . If they say they 're size 9 , chances are that they have some 9.5s and some 8.5s in their collection as well . So its extremely important to measure your size before purchasing . <h> Let 's talk about Shark Tank . How did you get to be on the show ? <p> Like many small business whose friends tell them they should be on Shark Tank , our friends said that we should be on Shark Tank . So we started watching the show and said we should be on Shark Tank . What I found out was that typically when they 're airing the episodes , they 're not usually casting . So when the casting opened , I applied with an email and a video with me and my wife . <p> Somebody called back and asked us to fill out an application and submit another video . Then we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot on the show . And even then , they only air about 70% of those filmed . So you never really know for certain if you 're going to be aired or when you 're going to be aired . They did select our segment to air on Shark Tank and we were in Ecuador at the time . So I was doing PR calls from Ecuador with a crappy internet connection . <h> What was something that surprised you on the show ? <p> here 's a Shark Tank secret , when you walk on to the stage and hit your mark where you stand , they tell you to just stand there . What they try to do is get you anxious and see how you react in that situation . It did n't  work on us as I was prepared for it and my wife and I just kept smiling . <p> One of the surprising things was that its not the same kind of conversational thing that you see on TV . Everyone is talking all the time and you 're just trying to answer everyones questions without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about your Shark Tank pitch , what would it be ? <p> I would wait for two years before going on the show . We could have maximized the value of the show if we were further along in our business . <h> Can you talk about some numbers around your business ? <p> We had 220,000 concurrent sessions on our website when we were airing . When we aired , we were on a run rate of $1 million revenue for the year . Were around six times bigger than what we were on the show . <h> Back to WordPress and WooCommerce , what 's your most useful plugin ? <p> I think any of the caching plugins . Having a very aggressive caching plans is a good idea . Another thing is any of the optimization plugins to speed things up . <h> What 's a WooCommerce plugin you wish you had ? <p> We have a relatively shallow product line . What I 'd like to have is when we do free shipping over X amount , customers to be able to easily add a product to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are relevant to them and which are discounted . So you create a number of layers of value for people to make that decision to purchase . <p> The other part would be , one-click post-sale upsell . So after they 've placed the order , the platform holds the order information before processing so that customers can add something to the same order . <h> What 's your advice for people starting a business or an eCommerce business ? <p> My advice would be to , as a start , list your product on Amazon and see if you can make a sale . I want someone that you do n't  know reach into their wallet , give you money , and leave you a good review . You have to face the facts that if it does n't  sell , then perhaps its not a good idea . <p> If it does n't  sell on its own merits , then you 'll be putting way too much effort into trying to get it to sell . <h> Steven Sashen , what 's your advice for people pitching their business for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be investors who pretend they 're way smarter than they are . You want someone who is on the same page as you , and someone you can live with . <p> Equity is valuable , its a real thing , so treat that seriously . You do n't  want to give away part of your company to someone who does n't  do anything for you or hold up their side of the bargain . <p> Look into equity crowd-funding after you have a lot of fans . <p> Biggest thing is that you have to figure out what the investor is interested in and pitch that . It may not necessarily your product . It may be a business model , or plan , or the entrepreneur values , etc . <p> Deals generally take way longer than you think . So if you 're in a jam , keep that in mind knowing that you probably will stay in a jam for some time . <h> What 's next for Xero Shoes ? Where do you want to take the business ? <p> The footwear for the last 45 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of research shows that shoes are no better or worse than being barefoot . In fact , shoes limit your foots ability to bend and flex by putting " foot casts " on them . Research shoes that when you have padding in your shoes , you end up stepping in ways that negatively affects your joints . <p> Our goal is to make footwear that 's demonstrably awesome and compete against these giant companies whose whole business is built around selling shoes that people do n't  necessarily need . <p> I do n't  like it when people get lied to or taken advantage of . I like having the truth on my side and I like that fight . I like getting emails everyday from people saying that our products have changed their life , so I want to continue doing more of that . <p> My goal is to have enough cash to do the things we need to do to let people feel the freedom , feel the fun , and feel the world . <p> What did you think of the interview ? Were there questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell us and ask further questions in the comments below . 11394 @qwx871394

We reviewed Easy Digital Downloads 1.9 , which was released late yesterday , to take a look at some of the significant updates to the core plugin . If you 're interested in a full review , you can view our Easy Digital Downloads review for more information about the plugin itself . <p> Some under-the-hood work has been done to improve site performance , especially for stores with large product quantities . Some developer-friendly tools have also been added to EDD 1.9 , such as an EDDgraph class that will allow add-ons to generate their own custom graphs and reports . However , there are a lot of changes that have improved the UI as well in order to provide a better experience while editing products and orders . <p> The first addition is the ability to display product-specific earnings graphs and reports . While viewing earnings graphs or sales reports , you can select " Downloads " , then display a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earnings for Download Products <p> These reports can also be accessed from the product editor instead , which is where some users may expect to find them , as " Download Stats " are included in the product page . Detailed reports are now included as part of a products " Download Stats " : <p> Product Detailed Reports <p> EDD 1.9 also adds a new product details widget for your store . You can use this to optionally display some or all of your products details , and can use the product currently being viewed or a specific product . Being able to display a specific products details could make this widget an interesting way to display a Featured Product or Product of the Month to users while they 're already shopping . <p> Editing and creating products has become much easier thanks to grouped and redesigned product data menus . In the version 1.8.6 of the plugin , all product data is configured in one massive menu : <p> EDD 1.8.5 Product Editor <p> This menu was a bit messy and difficult to navigate , as everything seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition and editing is much easier due to grouped menus for product details , and users can rearrange menus to customize and streamline their workflow . <p> EDD 1.9 Product Editing <p> Some of these options have also been bumped to a " Downloads Settings " menu , which displays settings that are easily adjusted . The reorganization of product data makes the process of creating and editing products faster and easier to understand : <p> EDD 1.9 Product Settings <p> Discounts have also been upgraded in Easy Digital Downloads 1.9 , as you can now set excluded products for each discount code that 's created . Users could previously require specific downloads for a discount to be applied , but this was n't a great solution for people that wanted to only omit a couple of products from a discount code . Now users can both set products needed for a discount and set products that should be excluded from discount codes . <p> Discounts Improved <p> Finally , editing and viewing order details have been combined into one screen , which makes this process much easier to understand , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Previously , users could view order details , but would have to go to a different screen to edit them in a menu that looked completely different from the " View Order " page : <p> Old Order Edit Screen <p> Now viewing and editing orders is simultaneous and far easier to understand : <p> The old tax API has been thrown out and redone in order to improve stability and performance , and some new options have been added as part of this rewrite . Products can now be exempted from tax individually ( see the Product Settings image above ) , which will be quite handy for people using the Simple Shipping Extension , as tax can be applied to physical products ( like shirts or other swag ) but disabled for digital products . <p> Overall , this is a large release and as such users should update on a staging site and backup all data before going live to ensure that site performance will be unaffected ( this is just good practice regardless ) . On a personal note , I found product creation far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu was difficult to read and to find what I wanted to edit . With the new menus , I can simply collapse anything I do n't  need and move it to the bottom of the page to focus on the information I need to change . <p> I also found the updated order admin far easier to use , as the old Order Edit screen was a bit clumsy . In addition , the welcome screen now features some help with getting started for new users , such as some hints on how to set up product pages and links to documentation and support , which greatly improves the on-boarding process . The new updates give the core plugin some more polish and improve site performance overall , and will be welcome for users . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

Use Free Shipping Thresholds <p> Free shipping thresholds are very possible with Shopp , and they can automatically be applied when a customers cart meets a certain threshold , and if they 're in a particular country , which is a huge bonus . This way you 're not on the hook for free shipping internationally , unless you 'd like to have a separate discount with a higher threshold for international orders . <p> Free shipping discounts can be created under Catalog &gt; Discounts : <p> When this discount applies to the order , it will automatically be applied to the cart to remove the shipping totals , regardless of which method is selected . <p> If free shipping should be a specific method ( i.e. , it takes longer than regular shipping ) , you can also set up free shipping as an " Order Amount Tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose free shipping from the available methods if their order is eligible instead of automatically applying a discount for it . <p> This let 's you use a dedicated method rather than giving an expedited shipping method for free . <p> Now you can focus on making sure customers know about this offer . Hello Bar can be used here ( as we 've recommended with other plugins ) . You can create a promotion bar to show a notice throughout the top of your site . <p> This should let customers know about the free shipping threshold to encourage them to meet it . <h> 2 . Use Discount Thresholds <p> Creating discount thresholds with Shopp is where it really shines in comparison to other plugins . You can create automatic discounts , coupon discounts , or tiered discounts to encourage your customers to meet order minimums . <p> One thing you 'll need to pay attention to is your settings while using discount thresholds . If you want to allow free shipping discounts or coupon codes to be used with discounts to encourage higher order values , you 'll need to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed under Shopp &gt; Setup &gt; Checkout with the " Discount Limit " setting . <p> Automatic Discounts are very simple to set up , and will work the same was as free shipping promotions . Rather than grant free shipping with a minimum cart subtotal , you can instead grant a discount ( percentage or amount ) . <p> When the customers order meets this minimum , the discount is automatically applied without any additional effort on the customers part no coupon codes or other actions required . You can advertise this discount easily with just a notice to meet the threshold . <p> Coupon Discounts : If you do n't  want to automatically apply the discount , or it should n't be available to all customers , you can also use a coupon code instead of an automatic discount . Youll set up the discount the same way , but require it to match a coupon code in addition to the cart minimum : <p> This will require customers to enter the code to get this discount instead of applying it automatically . <p> Tiered discounts : You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy more , save more " strategy . For example : <p> spend at least $75 , get 5% off <p> spend at least $100 , get 10% off <p> spend over $150 , get 15% off <p> To create a tiered system , I can set minimum and maximum discount thresholds . Setting the maximum value for the discount is important , otherwise you can end up stacking them : <p> Instead , add a condition for both your minimum and maximum values : <p> You can then repeat this process for higher discount tiers . <p> Do n't  forget to promote this ! You can add a top bar or footer notice to your site some themes have widgets for this , or you could use Hello Bar as referenced above . <h> 3 . Provide Volume Discounts <p> You could also look at the overall cart quantity of items purchased , or the quantity of a particular product , and provide a bulk discount based on this quantity . <p> Shopp has some fantastic quantity discount rules built into the core plugin . You can set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when the cart quantity reaches an amount ( though you cant restrict this to certain products only without custom code ) : <p> You can also combine these rules to offer advanced volume discounts . For example , you can provide a discount when 3 of a particular item are purchased or when 5 total items are purchased . <p> Advertising these kind of sales or promotions on a dedicated " Deals " page is a great way to increase average order value and encourage buying larger quantities . <h> 4 . Bundle Related Products <p> Shopp does n't  have any built in way for bundling products , nor are there any add-ons to help out here . <p> However , you can create a bundle by adding products individually to your store , then adding a new product that represents a bundle instead . For example , I could have SKUs for Product 1 , Product 2 , and Product 3 . I 'd then create a new product for a bundle of all three products , and set my pricing as desired for the bundled version . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundle is purchased , but will let leverage bundles to encourage higher order amounts . <h> 5 . Upsell and Cross-sell <p> This is another area that you 'll need to address manually . Shopp does n't  have any built in upselling or cross-selling , and there are no add-ons for it . You could manually add upsells to your product pages by adding them to the bottom of a products description : <p> You could also cross-sell in this way if you wanted to , but there 's no automated way of generating these or adding relevant cross-sells to the cart pages . <h> 6 . Create a Loyalty Program <p> There are n't  any loyalty program plugins available for Shopp , but you can do some manual tracking and tweaking to give loyal customers automatic discounts , then advertise this policy to encourage customer loyalty . <p> Customer lifetime value for your store is tracked by going to Shopp &gt; Customers , so you could manually give out rewards for a certain amount of purchases . For example , you can review or export these each month to track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , $1000 spent ) , send a coupon code or discount . <p> You can also set customer types to automate discounts instead . When a customer meets a spending threshold , you can change them to a wholesale customer or another type . <p> Set Customer Type <p> You can then create automatic discounts for this customer type to reward their loyalty when continuing to shop in your store . <p> This is n't exactly a strategy to increase average order value , but can be used for overall lifetime customer value like a loyalty program . If you wanted to increase order value , you could advertise discounts or customer type changes for orders over a certain value , i.e. , $300. <h> 7 . Sell Add-ons or Services <p> You can sell certain kinds of add-ons or upsells with Shopp while creating your products to increase AOV . Products can have dropdown options to select add-ons . Youd need to manually allow other kinds of add-ons , such as personalization / text fields , via custom code if desired . <p> Add-ons can have options in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When these add-ons are created , each add-on will show a new dropdown on the product page so the customer can select the respective add-on . <h> 8 . Raise Prices <p> Unfortunately there 's no way to bulk edit your product prices with Shopp , so youd have to implement this strategy on a per-product basis as you edit them . <p> The advanced discounting rules available are the best tool for increasing average order value with Shopp . You can offer free shipping discounts , discounts for meeting thresholds , coupons for minimum order amounts , and tiered discounts to encourage increased spending per order . You can also offer bulk and volume-based discounts for products or the cart as a whole to encourage customers to spend more . <p> While other strategies can be implemented , theyll require more manual administration , such as creating bundles or upsells for each product . However , Shopp offers ample tools built directly into the plugin for increasing revenue per order . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> For cross-selling purposes you could use tags . Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can show products with whatever tag you want . <p> If you want it to be more specific to what is already in the cart you could write a function ( I know this is not for novice merchants but it is not impossible ) that will examine the tags of the products and use that to list related ( tagged ) products . <p> Another option is to use the shortcode system to add products to your blog , articles , posts , pages . 
@@98138269 @2338269/ <h> Sell with WP Interviews : Tyche Softwares with Vishal Kothari <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> In this interview , we hear from Vishal Kothari from Tyche Softwares . They are the developers of the Booking &amp; Appointment , Abandoned Cart Pro and Order Delivery Date Plugins for WooCommerce the pro and the lite versions . <p> Below is the summary of the video discussion . If you have any questions or comments , please share in the comment section of this post . <h> What 's your day-to-day like at Tyche ? <p> My background is mainly in PHP development and I am a developer at heart . That 's what I typically try to focus on . However , my day-to-day duties also involve non-programming tasks like writing blog posts for our own blog and guest posts for other blogs , helping my team out with programming and support tickets as needed , and planning for the updates and release roadmap . <p> So that 's what a typical day looks like . <h> Can you talk a bit about the beginning of Tyche ? <p> I worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build an ERP solution for the diamond and jewellery industry after that to build a modular framework like WordPress . But I noticed that we werent making as much progress as I had wanted . So in February 2012 I started Tyche . I started to look for plugins that might be in demand . Alongside that , I took on service projects so that there was some cash flow coming in . The first plugin I built was Order Delivery Date for WP eCommerce and started getting a few downloads . <p> Then I learned about WooCommerce from some friends and I developed a version of the plugin for WooCommerce , which got more traction from the get-go . I put the lite version on the WordPress repository , and added a pro version for $9.99 . <p> I initially started selling the plugins on CodeCanyon , who put up the plugin for $13 and had a 50% fee . The problem I had with them was that they do n't  share customer data , which put me off . That 's when I put it up on my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from then to where Tyche is today ? <p> In the first month of selling plugins on my own store , we had about 10 sales , which I was very happy with . It was almost a dream come true that I go to sleep at night and wake up to a sale . It was in June 2012 that sales started picking up which got me more interested . <p> I saw some plugins in the WooCommerce ideas board and picked those which people were up-voting but not getting too much attention . I hired someone in October who used to come to my house to work since I only had 2 computers at the time . What I would do is look at the WooCommerce ideas board for plugins getting up-voted , and check on Elance if someone needed the same plugin . <p> Someone needed the booking solution for WooCommerce so the development was funded from the client project , and then I released the plugin on my store . I took a similar process for the Abandoned Cart plugin . <h> What 's the main driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key factor for sales of the pro versions . One thing I regret is not focusing on marketing too much until 2015 . There was a point before that when one of the customers asked me whether our site was a scam . That hurt me a bit , but was a clear sign that I needed to do something about it . We hired a marketing partner from Bulgaria who created the brand properties that we have today . <p> Another big part was investing in Google search optimization which gives us a lot of traffic . Recently , we 've started doing social marketing and also focusing on content marketing through blog posts . <h> Can you tell us about the scale of your extensions ? <p> The free plugins have about 16,000+ active installs . On the pro side , they 've been purchased for about 3,000+ active sites . <h> What are the biggest drains of time and resources ? <p> Keeping updates aligned with WooCommerce release dates can be a challenge . For example , when the WooCommerce release dates get postponed or shifted , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> And equally time-consuming are the support tickets that we get especially when customers find a bug . <h> What 's some advice for new developers ? <p> Try to solve a real problem . There are a number of ways to find out what people want and are asking for . Do n't  be afraid to take on a plugin that may someday be developed within the WooCommerce core . <p> The second is to maintain the code quality . Get code reviews done by third-party developers to make sure you 're following the right things . <p> Lastly , try to be social and do some marketing so that people know who you are . <h> What 's your advice for store owners ? <p> Focus on abandoned carts because that 's a huge untapped revenue . Secondly , do spend time focusing on your blog writing about your own products and about your industry . <h> Where do you see the future of eCommerce ? <p> The market for eCommerce is growing and getting complex . So perhaps one thing in the future would be plugins that are specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term goals ? <p> The goal was never to have lots of plugins , but have a few plugins that we do really well . In 2017 , were trying to improve the user interface for our plugins to gain some competitive advantage . We are also looking to do a booking solution for WordPress . In addition , expanding the abandoned cart plugin to other platforms as well . <h> Any other comments before we finish ? <p> For all the plugin developers , do put some time and money towards marketing as thatll help accelerate your growth . <p> What did you think of the interview ? Were there questions you wanted to ask that werent in the interview ? Tell us and ask further questions in the comments below . 11394 @qwx871394 
@@98138270 @2338270/ <p> Cart66 has made several changes since then , including a massive change to their pricing structure . Theyve added support for photo galleries , product pages , and catalogs , which were some of the biggest things missing in earlier versions . As a result , were doing an updated Cart66 Cloud Review for 2015 . <p> Note that this updated review does n't  do an in-depth dive into every single Cart66 Cloud feature . Our original review is still a good source of comprehensive information , and well be going over some new things in this updated review . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Overview &amp; Costs <p> Cart66 Cloud is a fairly unique WordPress eCommerce solution since its hosted instead of being a downloadable WordPress plugin . This has both pros and cons that well get to later , but this is something you should know up front . You 'll need a Cart66 Cloud account , and then you can tie this account to your website to manage your store . <p> Cart66 Cloud offers a 14-day free trial , and costs $95 per year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this is a steep discount . You no longer have to enter a credit card to start the trial either , so you 're free to give it a go to see how you like it . <p> The new $95 price point makes this a more compelling option for sites looking for an all-in-one solution . You do n't  have to purchase payment gateway integrations , shipping integration , or add-ons to create site memberships ; Cart66 Cloud offers tons of functionality in the core platform , and now offers this at a very low yearly price . <p> With Cart66 , you can sell simple , variable/configurable , downloadable , membership , and subscription products , and use one of over 80 payment methods to sell them , so there 's lots of flexibility to be had . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Setup &amp; Configuration <p> I started with the Cart66 Cloud quick-start guide , which is a bit outdated , but a good place to see what you 'll need to do to get set up . First , you 'll register for a Cart66 Cloud account . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configure your basic settings . <p> Cart66 Settings <p> Your Cart66 Cloud dashboard is also where you 'll manage products , orders , payments , and shipping methods , so you may want to poke around . <p> To integrate Cart66 Cloud with your website , you 'll need to install the free Cart66 Cloud WordPress plugin . This will let you sync your site with your Cart66 Cloud account , and gives you the secret key to enter in the plugin settings . <p> One new feature that I like is the embedded Cart66 Cloud dashboard . One complaint I have of using a hosted shopping cart solution with WordPress is that you have to manage your shop and website in different places , but by iframing the dashboard in your site , you can manage Cart66 at the same time you manage your website . <p> Embedded Dashboard <p> Once you 've configured both your Cart66 Cloud account and the integration plugin , you 're ready to create products and set up your shop . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Creating Products <p> Lots of the improvements to Cart66 Cloud as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your website . When you create products , you do so in your Cart66 Cloud dashboard . You can create several types of products , including : <p> simple products like coffee mugs <p> virtual products that do n't  require shipping ( like services ) <p> variable products like tee shirts with different sizes or color ( and different prices ) <p> customer-defined pricing products ( like donations ) <p> subscription products that use recurring billing <p> membership products that grant access to content and expire <p> digital products that grant access to downloads <p> Create Products <p> The ability to create tons of product types ( especially memberships and subscriptions ) can make Cart66 Cloud worth its price tag alone . One of the biggest issues I 'd had with Cart66 originally was that products had to be created in your dashboard , then you had to manually create sales pages on your site for every product , then use a shortcode for a " buy now " / add to cart button . <p> If you had lots of products , this was super tedious to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product listings on your site ( a " product " custom post type ) . A new product will be added to your site automatically when its created in your Cart66 dashboard , which generates a sales page for that product so you do n't  necessarily have to manually create pages . You can then add your own description and any images to the product sales page . <p> here 's a video which shows this process : <p> This can save you a lot of time while creating a product catalog , as sales pages automatically display product information . You can also add categories for your products ( but no tags ) . I really loved this feature addition , as it makes Cart66 Cloud a more realistic choice for sites with a large product catalog . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Customer Experience <p> Along with the addition of product pages , you can also display a pre-made catalog , which organizes a grid of your products . A product catalog shortcode can be used to create a " store " page : <p> ccproductcatalog max= " 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store shortcode <p> When customers browse your store , theyll see your shiny new product catalog , and can click through to the automatically generated sales page . <p> Product Page <p> Finally , if they add a product to the cart , theyll be taken to the Cart66 Cloud cart and checkout pages . These pages are not hosted on your site . Theyre hosted by Cart66 so that they 're secure and PCI compliant , and so that you do n't  have to worry about your own payment integration . As a result , the customer will be taken from http : //yoursite.com/ to http : //yoursite.cart66.com/ to purchase . <p> This is what most hosted eCommerce platforms ( such as Shopify ) do so that checkout can remain secure . However , since Cart66 does n't  get involved with the rest of your site , you 'll need to use the " page slurp " function under Customize &gt; Checkout Page so it can copy your themes styles . Once it does , you 'll have a cart and checkout page that looks just like the rest of your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Payment Options <p> Integrating your payment method with your site can be a pain , as you 'll typically need to purchase an integration plugin , SSL certificate , and ensure that your site is secure . <p> The biggest benefit to using Cart66 Cloud is that you do n't  have to worry about this . Cart66 let 's you use one of 89 payment gateways that serve a total of 94 countries ( not every gateway is available in every country ) . All you need to do is enter your API credentials , and you 're ready to accept payments . Best of all , you can accept recurring payments with almost any gateway that Cart66 Cloud offers . <p> Payment Methods <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Shipping &amp; Inventory <p> Setting up shipping methods with Cart66 Cloud was a bit confusing to me at first ( and was the same way the first time I 'd used it ) . However , once you see how they 're set up , you understand that they 're fairly flexible to use . <p> You can set up weight-based shipping , price-based shipping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is great ) . <p> Create shipping methods <p> I opted to use weight-based shipping , which can serve as a simple flat-rate shipping method , or can let you create weight tiers for your shipping rates . You can enter a maximum weight for each rate to create a tiered system , or you can leave that max weight blank to use that rate as a flat rate . <h> Inventory <p> As for inventory management , I was disappointed the first time around that this does n't  exist , and it still does n't  . You can mark products as " available " or " not available " for basic in stock / out of stock management , but you cant manage inventory quantities . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Orders &amp; Reporting <p> Order management with Cart66 is still pretty good , but not amazing . It has n't  changed much , but we did n't  talk about it a lot in the initial review . <p> You can view orders , and edit customer details for the order . You can also mark orders as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shipped " . Personally , I love that shipping status and payment status are separated . However , you cant add items or edit them to substitute items , add free gifts , or cancel parts of an order . <p> View Order <p> There 's also no way to manually create an order for your shop , which makes it impossible to take phone orders or create gift orders . <p> I do like that orders will link to associated memberships , subscriptions , and customer accounts , which makes it easy to switch views . <h> Reporting <p> Cart66 Cloud still has n't  added much in the way of reporting , as you can view basic sales data and " live " carts on your site , but no aggregated reports on sales , subscriptions , or other product types . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Support &amp; Extensibility <p> Cart66 Cloud has a fairly new knowledge base / documentation site , and they still offer ticketed support . As the platform is pretty easy to use , chances are you wo n't need much in terms of set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and access to someone who can make sure your site is running as expected . <p> As far as extensibility goes , you wont be able to customize much of the Cart66 Cloud experience . You can adjust how products look on your site , but as the platform is hosted , you wont be able to customize or alter the way it works like you can with a downloadable plugin . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Other Comments <p> There are some built-in integrations for Cart66 Cloud that you do n't  typically see in downloadable plugins , which helps to make it a more well-rounded solution out of the box . For example , the MailChimp integration let 's customers opt to join the mailing list of your choice at checkout , making it easy for you to build your email list . <h> Memberships <p> One feature that deserves special attention are memberships with Cart66 Cloud . Most eCommerce plugins do n't  include membership capabilities in the core plugin , which definitely sets Cart66 cloud apart . You can sell a membership-type product , and then the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To sell content access on your site with recurring payments , youd create a subscription product . To sell access for a set length of time , youd create a membership product . <p> Both of these product types can be used to restrict categories , individual posts , or pages on your site . <p> Restrict Categories <p> Restrict Post / Page <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Pros and Cons <p> First , let 's talk about some things I did n't  like in the original review that have changed : <p> Product catalogs and pages : integrating products into your site is now far easier . You can use the automatically generated sales pages , which is a huge help for shops with several products <p> Managing 2 dashboards : If you want to manage your store from your site , you can . The embedded ( iframed ) Cart66 dashboard can let you work solely from your WordPress site . <p> Cost : You do n't  have to worry about paying $25 monthly or $199 per year now you pay $95 per year for tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some negatives to consider while using Cart66 . First , you wont be able to manage inventory , or integrate directly with shipping providers like UPS . You 'll also be stuck with core features , as you cant customize Cart66 the way you can customize a plugin . For example , you ca n't change how order management works , add your own shipping method , or add a new product type . <p> However , there are some great upsides to using the platform . First , you get a lot of features for a low yearly cost . You can manage tax rates , create several shipping methods , use almost any payment gateway , and integrate easily with MailChimp . You can also create several customized notifications , such as emails before a membership expires , and easily switch payment methods without messing up recurring billing . <p> You 'll also benefit from using a hosted solution , as Cart66 hosts the checkout process for you , ensuring that payments are secure and seamless . As a result , you do n't  need to worry about PCI compliance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log in credentials anyway ) . <h> Cart66 Cloud Review : Summary <p> Cart66 Cloud had made some great improvements in terms of managing your store and product catalog . While there are n't  massive changes to the platform over the past couple of years , these are some really nice evolutionary changes that make it easier for you to manage your site and to support shops with several products . <p> If you want add-ons or the ability to customize your site , this may not be the solution for you . Cart66 wont let you create custom plugins , sell complex products or bundles , manually create orders , manage inventory , or integrate with other services . What you sign up for is what you 'll get , which can work for many stores . Cart66 Cloud is not short on features , but you do n't  have the flexibility to extend or customize it . <p> Cart66 Cloud may be a good fit for you if you want an easy to use and set up eCommerce platform , youre okay using the payment and shipping methods offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way the platform works . The ability to sell memberships and recurring subscriptions is a huge bonus as well , especially at a low price point . Its a great choice to get up and running quickly with an eCommerce site and with minimal effort . It also handles payment security for you , which let 's you stop worry about PCI compliance . <p> Overall , the changes over the past couple of years are solid , and I found managing my test store a lot easier when I did n't  have to manually create my catalog . Kudos to the Cart66 Cloud team for these changes = . <p> If you want to give it a try , you can register for a 14-day free trial with no credit card to see if it works for you . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Thanks Beka ! This is a great review ! Thank you . You 're right that there is a challenge trying to blend a hosted PCI compliant secure environment with open extensibility . Were continuing to work on that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be releasing other integrations that make use of those hooks and filters starting with this Aweber integration : LONG ... <p> This is an example of a plugin anyone could create to extend the features of Cart66 Cloud .

@@98138271 @2338271/ <p> Helpful tips on increasing average order value in your shop , as well as plugins and tools to implement these tips . <p> Increasing your sites traffic can be expensive you may have to invest in advertising , partnerships , or content marketing . Likewise , optimizing your current traffic to improve conversion rates may not be cheap either . It requires time and money invested in A/B testing and may not improve revenue overall . <p> Increasing order values can be a great initial strategy to drive more revenue , and we wrote about 8 strategies to increase average order value last week that makes a great place to start ( and should probably be read first ) . <p> Were looking into tools and extensions that can help you implement those strategies to drive revenue and create more valuable orders . Today were looking at how to increase average order value with WP eCommerce. <h> 1 . Use Free Shipping Thresholds <p> WP eCommerce has the ability to set a free shipping threshold built into the plugin . You can enable this under Settings &gt; Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then entering your amount : <p> If the cart subtotal is below your threshold , your other shipping methods will be shown . If the subtotal is above the threshold , the shipping cost will automatically be $0 . The downside here is that free shipping is available to all customers , even international customers , so be aware of this when setting your threshold . <p> If you want to restrict free shipping to certain countries , you can do so with the WP eCommerce Premium Shipping ( $35 ) plugin . While this plugin gives you tons of flexibility in shipping rates ( such as amount-based , weight-based , and other shipping methods ) , you can improve the free shipping you offer by restricting it to country . <p> A free shipping override will work similarly to the core override , but you can also set up tiered flat rates . <p> If you set up a new rate , you can set your rate for orders from $0 to $60 , then set free shipping for orders over $60 , and this rate can be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers know about your free shipping offer . Hello Bar is a good choice for this , and it this will add a notice to the top of your site . You can create a bar for your shipping promotion : <p> And then use the content of this bar to show your free shipping message : <p> This can be shown throughout your site on every page so customers know about this order minimum and are encouraged to meet it . <h> 2 . Use Discount Thresholds <p> If free shipping is n't for you ( or you offer it already ) , you can use a discount threshold instead to drive orders this let 's you offer a coupon only for minimum order amounts , i.e. , " Get 5% off any order over $60 with the code : 5foryou " . <p> WP eCommerce allows you to do this via a subtotal amount required to use a coupon code . You can set this as a condition when you create the coupon : <p> If the cart subtotal does not meet this threshold , the coupon can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let customers know about this discount . Hello Bar could help out with advertising this coupon code just as it did in our free shipping example above . You can also look into using the available widget areas in your theme to include this in your footer or sidebar. <h> 3 . Provide Volume Discounts <p> You can also encourage purchasing larger quantities of an item to increase order value rather than encouraging a minimum order subtotal . <p> WP eCommerce has quantity discounts for products built directly into the plugin , which is a huge win for store owners . You can set them up with the product pricing by clicking " Add Quantity Discount " . <p> This can let you create several " tiers " of discounts to incentivize larger purchases . You can use your product short description or regular description to let customers know of these quantity discounts . <h> 4 . Bundle Related Products <p> Bundling will be something WP eCommerce store owners will have to set up manually , as there 's no feature or extension to help out with this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your store , then adding a new product that represents a bundle instead . For example , I could have SKUs for Product 1 , Product 2 , and Product 3 . I 'd then create a new product / SKU for a bundle of all three products , and set my pricing as desired for the bundled version . <p> This will force you to track inventory manually if the bundle is purchased , but will let leverage bundles to encourage higher order amounts . <h> 5 . Upsell and Cross-sell <p> WP eCommerce does n't  strictly have upsell or cross-sell capabilities available , but there are a couple of ways you can cross sell your products . <p> First , the plugin has a setting under Settings &gt; Store &gt; Marketing that should be useful . You can enable " Users who bought this also bought " to display related products on your single product pages . <p> Similarly , you could use a free related products plugin to show products from the same category on the product page , but this plugin will require update for some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can use it , but you 'd be better off by having a developer upgrade it for you . <p> If you 'd like a supported / upgraded version , you can also take a look at the Related Products add-on ( $53.90 ) from Visser Labs . <p> Each of these options can help you show upsells or cross-sells automatically . However , there 's nothing stopping you from manually displaying upsells or cross-sells for your products . If you 'd like to , you can add upsells and cross-sells to product pages manually instead . Add the cross sell or upsell to the bottom of your product description , with your own image and text , and it will be displayed before the " Add to cart " buttons for the product : <h> 6 . Create a Loyalty Program <p> Offering loyalty points in exchange for purchases can be a very useful way to incentivize customers to purchase more , as they feel like they 're getting something in return for completing the purchase on your site . <p> While you ca n't offer bonus points for individual products , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points overall . For example , " double-point weekends " can drive sales for a limited time , while offering loyalty points in general can boost overall sales since customers gain something in return for repeat purchases . <h> 7 . Sell Add-ons or Services <p> There 's no built-in way to charge product or checkout fees , nor are there extensions available to do so . However , we can do a bit of a workaround to be able to charge product fees , which will work for simple products ( with no variations ) . <p> This will allow you to set shipping fees for your simple products , which is multiplied by the quantity purchased and added to the order shipping rate . <p> Set a product fee <p> Now I can use this as a charge for personalization or another upsell . This fee is n't optional and ca n't be selected by the customer , so its added for every purchase something to be aware of when you set this up . <p> I 'm going to use this for personalization , as WPeC includes the ability to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason I called this fee setup a workaround is that the fee is shown throughout your shop as a shipping cost rather than a personalization fee ( or other kind of fee ) . <p> We can use the Say What plugin to help us out here by " translating " that " Shipping : " text to something else , such as " Personalization Fee : " <p> Replace the shipping label <p> When we do so , this will be used on our product page instead of " Shipping : " with our fee . <p> Now let 's talk about the cart . Unfortunately this will be lumped in with your shipping , as mine currently shows my $3.99 personalization fee plus my $4.99 order shipping as one shipping line item total . <p> While you could tinker with this yourself , a quick fix is to label this " Shipping and fees " rather than just a shipping cost : <p> Change cart shipping label <p> If you want to charge other fees for upsells or other services , youd need custom code to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our final strategy to increase average order value with WP eCommerce : raising prices . <p> WP eCommerce has a bulk edit action to update product prices . However , this let 's you enter an amount for the price , but does n't  let you set an increase amount or percentage , so it probably ca n't be used for all of your products at once . For example , you could bulk-update all prices in your shop to $20 , but you cant increase them all by $2 or 3% at once . <p> You can still update prices manually , so this strategy can be implemented , but requires more time invested . <p> There are some helpful tools for increasing average order value for WP eCommerce stores . Our 8 strategies can all be implemented , though some require manual set up or cant leverage advanced techniques without custom code . The manual time required for many of these strategies , however , is minimal enough to be worthwhile in an attempt to drive increased revenue from your existing orders . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138272 @2338272/ <p> This series details tips and points to remember while creating an eCommerce site . <p> So let 's say you 've got your eCommerce store set up with solid foundations in hosting and a good platform , and now you want to determine how you can sell more . Many times , your gut response might be to set up an ad campaign to find new customers . However , I 'd argue that one of the most effective things you can do is work on your email marketing with previous customers . Not only have these people ( most likely ) already purchased , but theyve agreed to hear more from you , so chances are they want to purchase more and will convert at much higher rates . <p> Getting customers to your website is great , but email marketing can be one of the most effective tools in your selling arsenal ( check out this WP Beginner article on why email can be so important ) . First , giving out an email address is usually a much lower barrier for customers ( or prospective customers ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage this person . Building an email list should be important to your business , as it allows you to create a relationship with your customers to build repeat sales ( which are cheap , since we all know customer acquisition costs money ) . Why do you think companies are willing to pay so much money to acquire email lists ? They know that email is a powerful marketing tool , and that when used correctly , can drastically improve sales . Email marketing turns purchasers into customers and helps you grow your business . <h> Effective Email <p> Many of you know from your own habits that emails ( 1 ) reach your target audience , and ( 2 ) if written effectively , are very likely to be read ( especially compared to a print mail offer ) . Email marketing improves overall customer satisfaction and reduces the risk of returns or negative reviews since customers feel a connection to the business or product . If done well , your customers will feel like they 're part of a community or ecosystem , and it allows you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so . <p> You 'll still have to write quality emails to make sure they 're read by customers ( and not instantly deleted ) , but having some tools to help you understand and test which emails increase conversions will also be really valuable . <h> Email Marketing Tools <p> If you want to manage a list of customer emails , youve probably already looked into some of the management systems available , like Constant Contact , MailChimp , or AWeber . These are only a few popular solutions , and selecting one will really depend on how you see the needs of your store and communication evolving . One thing I would consider would be whether you want the ability to split test ( A/B test ) different emails to see if you encounter a performance difference , or the ability to segment email lists so that you avoid sending customers irrelevant emails ( for example , if customers tell you what kind of products they 're interested in , you can send them related information rather than info on all products ) . I 've used MailChimp for both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are also a couple of other options you should consider . Mail Poet ( formerly Wysija ) has an integration with EDD for checkouts , but is a free plugin that integrates tightly with WordPress . If you want to launch a newsletter with an easy-to-use interface , this may be something you want to try . However , it does n't  allow you to split test different emails or segment users , so whether you use it or not depends on how to plan to approach your email marketing . It also lacks a lot of integrations with other cart systems at the moment , but has a growing user base and I think more integrations will come . The other option I would look at is Follow-Up emailsfor WooCommerce , WPeC ( coming soon ) , or Jigoshop if you those platforms . Follow-up Emails has some useful auto-responder and coupon capabilities that you may have trouble finding with other email marketing platforms , and is built-in to your eCommerce plugin so that you do n't  have to manage emails from a different dashboard . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how each of these integrations fits into your store . Many of them already have generic integrations with WordPress , which is awesome . Usually , they allow you to use a shortcode or widget to provide a signup form . While this is useful , its also not as effective as it could be . Integrations with eCommerce platforms usually allow you to embed sign up checkboxes or forms within the checkout process so that you target your best audience : people that are willing to buy your product . Here are some of the most popular systems and which platforms have integrations for them : <p> Note that there are huge differences in price for some of these ; that 's because each integration does different things , and some are official vs third party plugins . Some just add opt-ins at checkout , while others provide more management options and shortcodes/widgets so that you do n't  have to use two different plugins . Do n't  forget to consider support if you 'll need it . Regardless , if you have n't decided on an email marketing system yet , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform and get started improving conversions from customers youve already paid for ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

If you want the list of what 's been updated , you can check out this list on the Shopp site or the announcement post . <h> Shopp 1.3 Changes <p> Let 's start with changes to the plugin itself . First , the entire admin backend was rethought in Shopp 1.3 , and the result is a far smoother user experience . Admin menus have been simplified , so that three main menus have been condensed into two . System and Setup options have been moved under the Shopp menu , and navigation for these options is now tabbed at the top of the page instead of along the side as submenu items , which provides a more intuitive navigation structure . Menus have also been reworked and relabeled ; for example , " Preferences " is now split up into relevant tabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admin Menus <p> Help Menus have also been updated to provide as much help and documentation as possible . <p> Shopp 1.3 Help menus <p> Order management has been improved as part of the effort to improve the Shopp admin , and customer details can now be changed and orders can be reassigned ( but not manually created ) . Compound taxes have also been added to the setup options to provide more flexibility and support for various store types . Promotions has also been renamed Discounts to clarify navigation for users , and Shopp now allows backorders for out-of-stock items instead of just displaying an " Out of Stock " message . This is huge , as WooCommerce and Jigoshop are the only serious competitors that offer this functionality ( check out our comparison spreadsheet from our eCommerce platforms series ) . <p> One cool feature addition is the ability to " drill-down " categories with faceted menus to help customers find what they 're looking for . When creating a category , you can create some template details and optionally include them in a faceted menu ( which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product details that would be helpful , such as mens and womens apparel ( by including gender ) rather than creating subcategories for " mens " and " womens " under apparel . As catalog customization was one of Shopps previous strengths , this update helps distinguish it even more . <p> Building Drill-down Menus <p> Faceted menus can be automatically created as you update product details while editing and creating products , or you can create these faceted menus for a category manually . When you create a shopping page for that product category , the faceted menu widget will display the menu that 's been created to help customers narrow their product search : <p> Faceted Drill-down Menu <p> The customer experience has also been improved in Shopp 1.3 . While you can set the default catalog view , customers can now optionally select a list or grid view themselves to override the default view for a customized browsing experience . Shopp 1.3 has also been optimized for retina displays , and the result is a cleaner frontend experience . <p> Catalog / Shopping Page <p> Now on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . Several reports are included , such as earnings reports , taxes , shipping , discounts , purchase locations , inventory levels , and more . You can view reports for various date ranges , including custom ranges , and can display the report by hour , day , week , or month . Even better , you can export reports in several formats , including CSV exports . Despite a couple kinks that need to be worked out , this upgrade is pretty great and will help small business owners that do n't  use a comprehensive accounting and reporting system , and will provide valuable insights into store status . On a personal note , I think the location heat map for purchases is just pretty cool . <p> New Reporting Features <p> There are also some other under-the-hood improvements that users wont see , such as API improvements to make Shopp easier to work with and more extensible , as well as stability and performance improvements . <h> Revenue Model Changes <p> Now on to arguably the largest change from these release : Shopp is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plugin will be monetized from official add-ons and support . Purchasing the plugin previously included ticketed support , and premium / expedited support could be purchased as well . Now , the core offering is free , but ticketed support is offered for the previous purchase price of the plugin . Users that had previously purchased the plugin will automatically be transferred to a support plan . <p> This move is definitely an interesting one , as it aligns Shopps business model with other eCommerce solutions for WordPress and follows along with the same model as Paid Memberships Pro . Moving to a " freemium " model will allow users to try to the product out and invest themselves in the ecosystem rather than passing on the core product since it required an initial purchase . I 'm betting that this move results in increased adoption , which will then provide more opportunity for extending the plugin and offering paid support as the user base grows . <h> Upgrading to Shopp 1.3 <p> As a reminder , do n't  forget to update to Shopp 1.3 on a staging site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a checklist / advice for upgrading that I 'd take a look at , as this upgrade is a pretty major one . There 's also a guide to template changes in Shopp 1.3 available to make the transition easier . However , I 'd do it soon so you can start playing with all of the new features ! <h> In Conclusion <p> The upgrades in Shopp 1.3 are pretty substantial , and I think they move Shopp into a much stronger position to compete with other WordPress eCommerce platforms moving forward . The plugin is much improved in this release , some impressive features have been added , and performance is improved . Shopp has quickly moved from a premium offering , which limited user adoption , to one of the more robust free offerings available on the WordPress.org repo . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

However , a lot of times companies leave money on the table ; they get caught up in running the business and driving traffic to the site rather than making the site most efficient and effective for the people that are already visiting . <p> Instead of letting prospective clients float away , there are some points to consider when tweaking your site or making minor changes that are proven to increase conversion rates and help you create more value from the site traffic you already have . <h> Improving eCommerce Conversions <p> Answer " Why ? " before " How ? " If I sold you a pair of headphones by showing you what each button does and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headphones are the best headphones , I 'd probably lose the sale . Yet many times , we write about all of the features of our product and how to use it because that is what 's easiest for us . We use the product , so we can show you how to use it . However , that 's not what customers care about at first . Remember the first rule of selling : How can you solve the customers pain , problem , or predicament ? They have a headache , so give them some aspirin . Tell them why they need what you have . <p> Stress Benefits over Features When a customer buys your product , what they really want is a better " them " or a better life , not necessarily a product . Use your " customer glasses " to view your website their values and needs should come before your products features . Then use those values , needs , and the better lifestyle that will result from purchase to direct your product page copy and images . <p> Will those headphones block out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone looking peaceful while wearing them amid chaos . Sell me the benefits I 'll get from the super-duper noise-cancelling features . Tell me about how I can sleep on a plane while children go nuts around me and the guy in seat 13D snores like he has sleep apnea on level 87 . Sell me the life I want , not your product . <p> Sell me a longer drive or more control over my golf shots , not a titanium driver with a carbon fiber shaft . I want to brag about a reduced handicap , not the specs on my driver . <p> Images are Important If possible , limit text / copy less is more . When you 've written your product descriptions , go back and change every feature to a phrase about how it makes the customers life awesome . Then cut out the 30% of your copy that 's irrelevant or fluff . There 's always something you can cut . In the wise words of Mark Twain , " I did n't have time to write a short letter , so I wrote a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effective . If you want customers to read , then do n't  waste their time . <p> If you 're selling physical products , have great images and several of them if possible . Check out your own browsing behavior : I will almost always look at all pictures for a product . Even when Amazon sometimes glitches on my phone and one image is replicated ten times over , I still look through all of the images for a product . Use images to sell along with your descriptions . <p> Note that there are some times you should break this rule . If you 're selling high-end products like some TVs or good speaker systems , more copy and features are necessary so that people can geek out over the refresh rate of their TVs . Products that will look similar usually require more focus on features . Always know your audience so you know which rules to break . If you 're not sure , test long versus short copy to see which converts better , but only change one aspect of the product page at a time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Important Not only should you use images of the product itself , you should also try to demonstrate the product in action or use images to sell the life customers want . Your images should elicit emotions just like your copy or descriptions do . For example , go back to my headphones scenario . Yes , I 'd like to see pictures of the headphones I 'm buying , but if you show me a picture of someone keeping calm and carrying on in a maelstrom of craziness and din , I 'll identify with that photo and really want to have that calmness . Mirror your customers and users in your photos so that they can slip into the photo and see themselves using the product . <p> Update : KISSmetrics just posted an article on effective images for eCommerce that seconds this idea . <p> If your eCommerce platform allows for it , always allow guest checkout and/or easy registration in the checkout process . If you can reduce barriers to purchase , conversions will increase . Keep only whats absolutely needed in your checkout . Channel Amazon if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the only thing you can do ? Put the blinders on and guide people towards completing the checkout process as swiftly and easily as possible . <p> Simplify Browsing Many eCommerce platforms provide product search functions or widgets . Use them . If you have the ability to drill-down product using categories or tags , make sure customers can see this . It helps the ones that are just browsing , and the first time they cant find a product or get frustrated by using your site , theyll probably leave and never come back . Youve already done the hard part by getting them to your site , so make sure that they stay there and find something to buy . Include categories in navigation or have category breadcrumbs at the top of the page . <p> Hide and Rename Coupon Fields on Cart Pages This one is a bit counter-intuitive for people , but imagine you 're the customer for a minute . Youd want discounts , right ? Discounts are great . However , you probably do n't  have a coupon code . If you see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you do ? RetailMeNot , here I come ! Guess what ? I just left your cart sitting there while I look at cat gifs or something equally as distracting . Let 's not let customers leave us so easily . <p> There are a couple of ways to handle this one . First , you can usually do a little bit of editing to your cart page template to hide the coupon code fields . If this appears at checkout , customers are less likely to leave the page sitting around with payment information already typed in . You can also decrease the tendency for customers to leave by renaming this field . " Coupon " sounds like something they want to go digging around for , but if you rename this field " Promotional Offers " , " Discount Codes " , or something similar , customers that already have coupon codes named the same way will know where to put the information , but less people go abandoning carts to browse for discounts who do n't  have them already . <p> Leverage Fear People hate to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip their grasps . Use this to your advantage . If you can display low stock messages , do it . This creates a sense of urgency and can push people that are on the fence into buying so they do n't  miss out on a deal or an item they want . Check out Gustin Jeans to see what I mean they only make a certain quantity of jeans based on fabric they have , so people hop on board to reserve a pair since they know theyll miss out if they wait . Theyve sold out a campaign within 3 minutes because of this model . <p> This also works well with timed promotions , such as offering free shipping for a few days in a month . Make people feel like they need to buy now to take advantage of the human tendency towards loss aversion . <p> Demand Action The last thing you should be conscious of are your calls to action . If you do n't  ask for a sale , you 're not going to get it . Ask the customer to do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want some help with design ? Check out this infographic from KISSmetrics on how colors affect purchases . <p> Want me to add something to my cart or check out ? Make sure I know that 's what I 'm supposed to do next . Adjust whatever CSS is necessary to make sure I see exactly what I should see . <p> When in doubt , always test site changes one at a time , and bear in mind that simpler sites tend to convert better than more complex sites . Always keep your customers experience and viewpoint in mind even though its harder to slip into that mindset than one of a store owner . Your wallet will tell you its worth it = . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138277 @2338277/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> Welcome to our last overview of the best WooCommerce themes for 2014 ! We 've got three new quality-tested themes specifically designed for WooCommerce to take a look at today . <p> In this series , we bring you the best WooCommerce themes because we actually test and review them . Several articles like this will simply lists themes that theyve found and link to the page or demo for you to check out . We install each theme , test the setup , and take a peek under the hood at the code that powers it so that you have real recommendations , not just a list of premium themes to look at that you cant try out yourself without purchasing . <h> Crux theme review Codestag <p> The Crux theme from Codestag is devoted to showcasing your store , and even won an award for best new WooCommerce theme as a result . Product photography is put at the center of your theme , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homepage and custom pages that will show off your products . <p> I 've used several themes from Codestag , and been very satisfied with each one . They make great themes and provide quality support along with each theme purchase . <h> Pros <p> A good WooCommerce theme should ensure that all shop elements are styled properly , and Crux takes this to heart . Shop and product pages feature the same color scheme and design as the rest of your site , rather than simply adding color to the default WooCommerce elements . <p> Shop pages will show off products with an overlay on hover so that you can view more details or simply add a product to the cart . WooCommerce widgets also look great , and you can set the products per page in the theme settings . <p> Shop page <p> Single product pages show off bold product images , as they theme will set the correct dimensions for your images when installed . I adjusted my product thumbnail sizes to be smaller so that I could fit 2-3 per row under the featured image , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shop styling . <p> Product page <p> Your cart is always visible in the header so that customers are reminded to complete purchase , and the mini-cart here will show cart contents and lead customers to checkout . <p> Menu mini-cart <p> The cart and checkout pages feature prominent calls to action and automatically are set in a full-width layout so you do n't  have to worry about adjusting page templates . <p> Cart page <p> The theme is designed to integrate with the Stag Custom Sidebars plugin so that you can create sidebars and other custom widget areas to craft your theme setup . <p> Custom Sidebars <p> For example , I used a custom widget area to create my homepage , and used the several WooCommerce-specific widgets that are built into the theme . These allowed me to create homepage sections that showcased my products , such as featured or new products , along with any content I chose to include . <p> You can also adjust the sidebars used for a particular page while editing it if you 'd like to create sidebars for different types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout werent ignored . The blog archives feature a custom header background , and each post will display a wide featured image that will adjust height as needed to display both in the archive page and on the single-post page . <p> Blog archive <h> Cons <p> Crux bundles the LayerSlider plugin , which can be used to create slider sections within your theme ( they can be added via widget or shortcode ) . This is a practice I 'm not a big fan of , as support for the plugin then has to go through the theme author , then to the plugin author . However , the changelog does indicate that this bundled plugin is kept up-to-date so that users are n't  affected by issues that can arise from releases being outdated , such as security issues . <p> A few WooCommerce templates are overridden in the theme , which is typically something to avoid , as updates to the WooCommerce core templates could then affect your theme . This is n't a pervasive issue as there are only a few templates overridden , but its something to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While the documentation and support around the theme is great , I did have to reference the docs to setup my homepage , as I wanted to create a widgetized layout to feature the WooCommerce sections . I did n't  realize that I 'd have to create a widget area , then embed it via shortcode onto my static homepage , so setting up your homepage and playing with the widgets may take you a bit of time . However , I did like that this allowed me to create a unique setup rather than a homepage that will look the same as everyone else that uses the theme . <h> Code Review <p> Other than the aforementioned template overrides , the code behind Crux is a solid base for your WooCommerce site . The template overrides do appear to keep all the needed WooCommerce hooks so that there are no plugin incompatibilities . <h> Best WooCommerce Themes : Crux Overall <p> Crux is a great WooCommerce theme that focuses on showcasing product photography throughout your shop and the available WooCommerce widgets , which can be used on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a great value for a quality WooCommerce theme from a good author . I like that the homepage setup can be unique depending on which widgets and setup you choose to use , and that you can create customized sidebars for different areas of your site ( such as your shop , blog , and pages ) . <h> Upstart theme review WooThemes <p> Upstart is a flat theme with a full-width , sidebar-less layout . Your blog and shop archives will features a responsive grid layout , and content will be at the focus of your site display . While this means that you cant take advantage of WooCommerce widgets ( and others ) , the grid layout provides a very neat display for your blog posts and products . <p> Upstart also integrates with the free plugins from WooThemes so that you can create a team section , testimonials , features , and more for complete site creation . <h> Pros <p> Upstart puts your product images front and center , though you cant filter them as there 's no sidebar available for your shop page . Products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products per row depending on the screensize . Images and sales flashes will be displayed with the option to view more details on hover . <p> Shop page <p> Product pages wo n't showcase featured images as large as possible , but they will put all product and purchasing information immediately in view for the customer to take action . Notices , color scheme , and style are consistent with the rest of your site . <p> Product Page <p> Upstart also focuses on conversions in your shopping funnel . The cart total and number of items is kept in view within the menu , and cart pages make upsells and proceeding to checkout easy to see . <p> Menu cart <p> Cart <p> Upstart also features a distraction free checkout : footer widgets and header / navigation links are removed so that the entire focus is on helping the customer to complete checkout rather than distracting them with new widgets , featured products , etc . <p> Checkout <p> Upstart also ensures that you have a complete website to show off your company and brand . Blog archives feature a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of posts per row will adjust with screen size and display more information on mouse-over . <p> Blog archive <p> Single posts can also display the featured image , and will prominently feature author information and put your content front and center . <p> Blog post <h> Cons <p> While Upstart supports all of the free plugins from WooThemes , you may need to get all of these set up to launch a great website using this theme , as these plugin integrations tend to provide all of your homepage content . While this can make it easy to create the homepage , as it just uses the " most recent posts " setting and adds the relevant content sections if enabled , it means that your setup will probably involve these plugins as described in the documentation . <p> You may also need some CSS to adjust some of the theme colors , such as the navigation background and accent color ( the orange seen in my screenshots ) , as these are n't  included in the theme settings . <h> Code Review <p> As with most themes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered by the WooFramework , which means that settings will be consistent if you 've previously used a WooThemes theme . <p> WooFramework <p> All WooCommerce integration is properly themed without overriding templates , and best practices are generally used . <h> Best WooCommerce Themes : Upstart Overall <p> Upstart is fairly easy to set up if you 're already using WooThemes plugins , but will require some setup if you do n't  use plugins such as WooThemes Features or Testimonials . While the integration with these is tight and provides a really seamless setup and they look great , this means that you may have to switch from another plugin . <p> If you want to focus on your shop and content without sidebars or distractions at checkout , and you 're okay with the need to change main colors manually ( if desired ) , then Upstart can be a good choice for your WooCommerce store . <h> Listify theme review Astoundify <p> Astoundify is known for developing niche themes that address every need of a particular kind of website , and Listify is no different . Its designed to integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that displays and adds specific styles for both directory listings and products . <p> If you use listings , such as jobs , classes , or businesses on your site , you can use Listify to display them beautifully and WooCommerce to sell them ( if needed the two do n't  have to be working together ! ) . <h> Pros <p> Listify offers tight integration with lots of software , including WooCommerce , WP Job Manager , and Booking services . It also includes specific styling for other plugins , such as WooCommerce Social Login , to ensure that your site has a polished feel from top to bottom . <p> As there 's a lot to set up , you 'll be greeted with a setup guide . I 'd recommend installing the demo content so that you can get a feel for what each part of the theme does , which will make it easier and faster for you to adjust this content yourself . <p> Setup guide <p> Youll be able to do a lot of setup from the theme customizer , such as selecting a color scheme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed . <p> Setup <p> Once you have basic theme options set up , you 'll want to complete your WooCommerce and WP Job Manager setup so that you 're sure of how you want to assign the theme widgets . These will give you fine-grained control over the display of your WP Job Manager components on listing pages . The widgets are labeled to help make setup easy , and you can add widgets for regular sidebars , product sidebars , shop sidebars , listings and listing sidebars , and your homepage . <p> Widget setup <p> Once your widget and customizer changes are complete , you 'll have a complete site with an integrated shop and directory . Shop pages will show products in a two-column , boxed layout , and more product details are displayed on mouse-over . <p> Shop <p> Product pages are fairly standard as far as WooCommerce product pages go , but will blend in completely with your site . <p> Product page <p> WP Job Manager pages will look entirely consist with your site and shop pages , and this is where a lot of Listifys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as you 'll add widgets to determine what 's displayed in the main content section vs the sidebar . <p> Single listing <p> Listing archives also feature the same clean layout , and <p> Listings archive <h> Cons <p> Since Listify styles and supports several plugins , you 'll probably want to read up on the theme documentation , as there can be a lot of setup involved . For example , you can add icons , tertiary menus , and lots of other site features and styles that I did n't  go very far in depth with . <p> As a warning , you 'll have to set the WooCommerce checkout and cart pages to the " No sidebar " template manually , as these do not default to a full-width layout . <p> I also was n't crazy about the buttons on the cart page , as the " Apply Coupon " draws all of the attention rather than the " Checkout " button : <p> Cart <p> Overall , the biggest con is the setup time involved with the theme and reading documentation , but I do n't  think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the themes capabilities . With that being said , the demo content install expedites this process a lot , and I 'd recommend taking this route if you 're okay with adding this content then changing it around to suit your needs . <h> Code Review <p> Listify is another well-built theme from Astoundify . It does override a few WooCommerce templates , but they 're templates that are less likely to change than others , such as the **38;2179;TOOLONG , so it was n't a huge cause of concern . <p> The rest of the theme is rock-solid and provides a great foundation for your site . <h> Best WooCommerce Themes : Listify Overall <p> If your site contains both a shop and directory component , whether for paid listings , internal job listings , classifieds , or any of the other tons of possible uses for WP Job Manager , Listify is a theme you should seriously consider . It makes it easy to integrate your shop and directly completely , and will also include styling for a number of plugins and bookings systems . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling this is WP Job Manager , which Listify is providing pretty extensive styles for . I could see this being useful for entertainment acts because you could use the geolocation for the job and hours to show act details , but you may need some custom code to disable the application process . I have n't used WP Job Manager extensively so I 'm not quite sure what would be involved , but I think its probably a suitable starting point for this . <p> Hi : I enjoyed your review of WooThemes directory products and would like your thoughts on a " simple " responsive , claim-your-listing , front end listing submission and editing product . I have been researching ( i.e. beating my head against the wall ) for several months now with no success in finding a vendor meeting my specs . Theme or plugin ( e.g. for U-Design by Andon ) would be acceptable . Not making good progress in my trial of BePro Listings ; difficulty in getting past negative support reviews for Templatics SpotFinder , and on and on . Woo has a great rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their current " listings " product . Any thoughts appreciated . <p> Hey JP , " simple " is going to be a relative term here , since you 're describing a fairly complex setup = <p> I think the Listify theme could be a fit , as it integrates with WP Job Manager for the listings ( does n't  have to be job listings , can be any listing ) , and Astoundify ( who builds that theme ) has a " claim your listing " add-on . Job Manager does allow for frontend submissions of listings . <p> Hey Will , I might check into using WooCommerce Pre-Orders + using Product Vendors for this kind of marketplace ( and perhaps WooCommerce Bookings ) . However , releasing payment to the owners directly instead of you would probably require customization , as I do n't  think PayPal Adaptive Payments ( which could split payments between you / vendors ) is compatible with Pre-Orders . Youd also need customization to tie the pre-order date to the booked date . All around this is definitely not easy to do AirBNBs billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will go for a cheaper alternative to WooCommerce Bookings , that allows people to view the listing , select the date , choose hourly and make the payment through the site . The payment will go to me directly . Top of my head is Pinpoint booking system . <p> I will figure a way to manually pay the owners later , minus the admin fee . <p> I came across Directory WordPress Theme Point Finder that has a lot of features , and can give Listify a fight . <p> As of now , I 'm not sure if Listify + PinPoint Booking System can accommodate my requirements for such website . Any good recommendation for booking system ? Thanks in advance ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138278 @2338278/ <h> WooCommerce 2.1 Preview <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> After nearly 9 months of development , WooCommerce hit beta 1 last week . During that time , the 2.0 version went through 20 point releases for minor bug fixes and features . WooCommerce 2.0 had an impressive feature list when it launched and 2.1 continues that trend . This article will highlight some of the more popular new features , as well as some nice tweaks and fixes that you might not know about . Remember that 2.1 is currently in beta so some of the features discussed could change between now and the official release in January . <p> Winter is Coming too . <h> Shiny New Design <p> WooCommerce 2.1 will require WordPress 3.8 ( which is in beta right now and slated to be released sometime in December ; WPExplorer has a great overview ) . WordPress 3.8 has a brand-new admin theme that is a bold design and WooCommerce has updated their design to match . <p> WordPress 3.7 Dashboard <p> WordPress 3.8 Dashboard <p> Adding and editing coupons has been completely updated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tab menu : <p> Add Coupon in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> Add Coupon in WooCommerce 2.1 <p> The product data icons have been updated as well : <p> The dashboard widget has been completely rewritten to be nicer and faster . Its a great example of the new design trend with both WordPress and WooCommerce , which matches the overall trend towards " flat " design . Each section of the widget links directly to the relevant area in the admin . <h> Massive Reporting Improvements <p> WooCommerce has always excelled in reporting tools and 2.1 puts them even further ahead of their competitors . Aside from overall improvements in the speed and responsiveness , a new tab for customer reports has been added . You can now see information on guest vs. customer sales , new signups , and even a simple list of customers with their total number of orders and sales listed . Report data can now easily be exported to CSV as well . <h> Improved Order Administration <p> Managing orders is a daily task for store owners and its been improved again in 2.1 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the billing address as a tooltip when hovering over the customers name instead of showing in the list : <p> View Orders in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> View Orders in WooCommerce 2.1 <p> Manually adding and editing individual orders is a feature somewhat unique to WooCommerce and this has been simplified in 2.1 : <p> Edit Order in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> Edit Order in WooCommerce 2.1 <h> Core Integrations are now plugins <p> In the continued drive to make the core WooCommerce plugin as lean as possible , the core integrations ( ShareThis , Google Analytics , ShareDaddy , ShareYourCart , and Piwik ) are now separate plugins . This is a great move for two reasons : 1 ) integrations can now be developed and improved faster than the core WooCommerce plugin , which tends to release updates less frequently than smaller plugins and 2 ) the core plugin is now faster and more secure without needing to support features that are only used by a minority of users . This also means the " Integration " tab on the settings page is now hidden by default and only appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> New Account Creation Process <p> Usernames and passwords can now be auto-created for customers at checkout . WooCommerce 2.0 had the ability to create accounts at checkout , but the customer was still required to enter a password . Now the customer can simply check a box and the account is created for them with a temporary password . This will certainly improve checkout conversion rates by simplifying the process for the customer . <h> Fewer Pages and Settings <p> Most software has a nasty habit of adding more and more features over time without any consideration of whether features are still needed , can be combined with other features , or simply removed completely . This naturally leads to more settings to customize those features , which can be very confusing for new users . WooCommerce 2.1 is very aggressive in removing settings that are no longer needed or are better suited as developer-friendly filters , as well as reorganizing existing settings into more logical groupings . <p> Checkout-related settings like Checkout pages and Forcing SSL , along with Payment Gateways , have been moved to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone and the related settings moved to a sub-menu under " Products " . Finally , a new tab for " Accounts " houses all the necessary settings for handling customer accounts . The end result is that the settings pages feel far more lightweight and easy-to-understand compared to previous versions . <p> Finally , the number of pages installed by default has been reduced from 11 to only 4 ! The pages installed are : Shop , My Account , Checkout , and Cart . Sub-pages ( like Checkout &gt; Order Received and My Account &gt; Edit Address ) are now endpoints , which makes them more reliable . <p> Settings in WooCommerce 2.0 <p> Settings in WooCommerce 2.1 <h> New REST API <p> For you developers , WooCommerce 2.1 will ship with a brand-new REST API , supporting both JSON and XML output . This will make it significantly easier to integrate WooCommerce with backend systems and other services . It is read-only , with the exception of a single endpoint for changing order statuses . Even more exciting is that the new API makes mobile apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make full use of the API when its released in February . <p> WooCommerce iPhone app Coming February 2014 <h> Dozens of Other Tweaks <p> There have been dozens of other small tweaks and improvements made , including but not limited to : <p> Coupon usage can now be limited per customer , hooray ! <p> Improvements to the core PayPal gateway , which can now use IDT as an alternative to IPN <p> Frontend styling is now split up into separate files for easier customization and improved viewing on mobile devices <p> With a supported payment gateway , customers can now add new saved payment methods ( a credit card or bank account ) directly from the My Account page , without needing to go through the checkout process . <p> Separate options for countries that you want to ship and sell to <p> Payment Gateways can now use a default credit card form instead of creating their own . <p> Store admins can now link past orders to customers before they registered . <p> General improvements to reviews , especially for limiting reviews to customers who have purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <h> What 's next ? <p> We can expect a few beta releases of WooCommerce 2.1 , followed by a release candidate in early January , and a public release close to the end of January . There was a long gap between WooCommerce 2.0 ( released in March 2013 ) and the planned release of 2.1 , and the core developers have stated that theyd like to have a more consistent release schedule going forward . I think we can expect to see a new major release every 3-4 months . This should mean more focused , smaller releases with just a handful of key features . I think this is a good strategy as WooCommerce continues to grow and mature into the most popular eCommerce plugin for WordPress . <h> Posted by Max Rice <p> Max Rice is a frequent Sell with WP contributor and cofounder of SkyVerge .

In each episode of the interview series , we will feature a guest who is involved in eCommerce on WordPress . This includes companies , developers , merchants , and others who can share their knowledge . <p> Our first featured guest is Beka Rice from SkyVerge . SkyVerge is the largest third-party extension developer for WooCommerce . Beka shares with us the SkyVerge journey and growth over the last few years , and provides tips for WooCommerce developers and merchants . <p> Below is a summary of the discussion in the video . If you have any other questions , please share in the comments section of this post . <h> What is your role at SkyVerge ? <p> I manage the WooCommerce team at SkyVerge including product management , working to make sure SkyVerges 60+ official WooCommerce extensions stay on track for development and updates . In addition , I manage SkyVerges online properties , marketing copy , and documentation , and stay involved in support . Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of writing and lots of WooCommerce-ing . <h> How did SkyVerge start ? <p> Justin Stern and Max Rice , the co-founders of SkyVerge , were involved in eCommerce development before starting the company , and had worked together on a number of client projects . They had a common vision and agreed on business goals , and incorporated SkyVerge in early 2013 . <p> The inspiration for the name " SkyVerge " was a combination of things . Justin and Max wanted something that embodied what they wanted to do which was connecting WooCommerce to other services , and connecting eCommerce entrepreneurs visions with WooCommerce . That was were the " verge " part came from . They also wanted a two-syllable name , and for the other part to represent something they both liked . The " sky " theme came from there it reminded them both of the " Skyfall " theme song ( stuck in their heads at the time ) , and " Skynet " from the Terminator movie series . <h> What were some of the initial SkyVerge plugins ? <p> Both Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company . One of the first plugins they worked on together was the Local Pickup Plus extension . <p> All these were included in the WooThemes extension marketplace . For both Max and Justin , they worked on a few free plugins before moving to premium plugins as they learned what merchants were looking for . <h> How do you find out what merchants are looking for ? <p> There are a number of ways to find out what merchants were looking for : <p> At the beginning , Max managed a very successful eCommerce store and there was a lot of learning from that . <p> Both Max and Justin did a lot of freelance client work to understand different clients businesses priorities and how software can support those . <h> What 's been the biggest driver for the companys growth ? <p> After the two founders , I was the first person to join the team . We were very cautious of hiring before the business was very viable . It was almost a year before we hired the next person after me . <p> We werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure revenues could sustain long-term growth . We also did a number of acquisitions . <p> A lot of developers built WooCommerce products and extensions , and sometimes realized that there 's a lot more work in terms of support and maintenance that happens after the initial development is completed . In many such cases , we acquired plugins from these developers and took over the work of updates , maintenance , and support . <p> Making those acquisitions helped grow revenues so that we could afford growing and expanding the team , while still keeping the company bootstrapped and not taking any investments . <h> What is the companys ethos ? <p> We want to build software that businesses can depend on . So that means a few things for eCommerce stores : <p> You need things to work so quality and dependability is very important to us . <p> You cant invest your stores foundation and platform on software with a short lifespan . <p> We understand that other businesses are depending on us to build their business . So we always try to be a good partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long one . <p> My biggest takeaway from WooConf 2016 was seeing how many people are now interested in WooCommerce , especially larger and enterprise-level businesses . <p> I think that 's because people now see that WooCommerce is a long-term solution and is a dependable eCommerce platform . <p> My talk at the conference was about value metrics that small and new businesses should be measuring and optimizing . Majority of businesses are small businesses . This is especially true for eCommerce businesses . There are many metrics that these stores can choose to focus on , however a lot of metrics need to have a large scale to give any **25;2219;TOOLONG understanding . <p> My talk focused on metrics that small and new stores can start looking at right away and optimize for those . <h> Tell us a bit about the scale of SkyVerge ? <p> Outside of developing extensions , our team has also contributed to WooCommerce core . So every instance of WooCommerce has code that was written by SkyVerge . <p> We have upwards of 100,000 customers who have used our plugins over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a year old . <h> What 's some advice for developers ? <p> There 's a constant level of work required to maintain a plugin and making sure it is compatible with each WooCommerce release . So that 's time and effort that gets taken away from thinking about new features or new products . Its certainly something to be conscious about . <p> Make sure you 're building something people want . If you 're building a niche plugin , you have to understand that it is not going to be a mass-market plugin , and therefore may not get the same amount of attention other plugins may get . <p> Keep customers in the loop and apprised of developments of your products . If you 're a freelance developers , you have to make sure your clients know what you 're doing . So many times we hear from customers who say that their developers have just stopped responding . <h> What 's some advice for store owners ? <p> Many times people look at WordPress and WooCommerce , and think that because it is free , therefore it means do-it-yourself . However , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in to use these platforms to their full potential . So its important for store owners to prioritize between developing their store sites , and actually running and building their business . Sometimes it can be easier to outsource the development and store management . <h> What 's next for eCommerce and SkyVerge ? <p> Social selling on platforms like Pinterest and Twitter would be something interesting to see where people purchase your products on those sites without ever coming to your website . <p> For SkyVerge , Jilt , our abandoned cart recovery service , is beta testing over the next few weeks for WooCommerce . The platform has already recovered over $14 million for Shopify store owners , and were excited to launch the new and improved version for WooCommerce store merchants . <p> Other things include WooCommerce 2.6 compatibility over the next few weeks , feature additions for Memberships , and feature releases for a number of different integration plugins . <p> Long term , we have ideas for more cross-platform applications like Jilt that we want to develop in the eCommerce space . <p> What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to ask that werent in the interview ?

@@98138280 @2338280/ <h> Why You Should A/B Test Your WordPress eCommerce Site <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> While the term " A/B testing " has become popular in the last couple of years , the discipline as a whole remains largely underutilized . If you manage an eCommerce store you understand the importance of optimizing your conversion rate , and A/B testing is one of the best strategies to help you generate more revenue . This post aims to give you a bit of information about A/B testing , its importance , and how you can effectively utilize A/B testing with your WordPress eCommerce store . <h> Quick A/B Testing Overview <p> A/B testing , for those unfamiliar with the term , is a process in which multiple versions of the same webpage are simultaneously displayed to visitors . For instance , in an A/B test with two versions ( A &amp; B ) , 50% of the traffic would see A and the other 50% would see B. The A/B testing platform then records the users interaction with the page . You can monitor the results and use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why you should A/B Test <p> When considering whether you should A/B test , its extremely helpful to understand the Why . Ive been A/B testing websites for about 3 years and would like to offer you the top three reasons I choose to A/B test . <h> 1 . I want to know if it works <p> I sell ( mostly ) WooCommerce plugins at wpovernight.com . During the spring of 2014 , we ran a test to see if redirecting the user to checkout immediately after adding an item to their cart would boost conversion rate and revenue . The belief was that easier access to checkout would encourage more people to purchase . <p> Since most people only purchased one plugin at a time , this seemed like a reasonable hypothesis . At the same time , we had 5 products , so we wanted to be sure to test because we honestly had no idea what kind of impact this would have . We gave it a try and here 's what we found . <p> First Goal : The Checkout Page <p> 20% more visitors made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , as we were automatically redirecting anyone to checkout who had just added an item to their cart . So far , everything looked good . <p> Second Goal : Making a Purchase <p> here 's where things got a little more interesting . When I looked at the results for our " Made a Purchase " goal , I found that users who were automatically directed to checkout had a conversion rate 8.3% lower than users who clicked the checkout button . This result was surprising to me . At the very least I thought that the conversion rate would at least be the same as before . I certainly did not expect it to be lower . <p> Third Goal : Revenue per Visitor <p> The real moment of truth was when I saw the impact on revenue . Redirecting the user to checkout after add to cart had a significant negative impact on revenue , to the tune of an 18% loss . For me , this was evidence enough that we needed to keep the user on the page after adding to cart and let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to know how well it works <p> I recently ran a test that I was almost certain would have a positive impact , but I wanted to know how big the impact would be . Our website uses Easy Digital Downloads , so I built a simple lightbox that showed the user plugins that were not already in their cart after they added an item to their cart . I was so excited about this test that I stayed up late one night to put it all together and launched it with great expectation . <p> To my surprise , the whole experiment was basically a wash . I had a slight increase in users adding an item to their cart , a slight increase in people visiting their cart , and a slight decrease in people making a purchase . There certainly may have been other intangible benefits ( i.e. exposing customers to other plugins they later came back to purchase ) , but there was no measurable impact . Even when you 're certain a change is going to make a positive difference , its always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm how awesome you are . <h> 3 . I want to know how I can make it better <p> Even if your A/B test does n't  give you the results you 're looking for , it typically gives you helpful information that can point you toward another iteration of the same test , or give you completely different ideas to test . <p> I recently started a test to display the number of downloads we 've delivered in the banner at the top of our site . The question was , will showing people our 130,000+ downloads make them trust us more ? I created the banner seen in the image below and ran it against our standard message ( same message shown just without the download number portion ) . <p> It performed exceptionally well , showing a 10% increase in purchases . See the image below for all the details . <p> I was excited at the possibilities of the test so I updated the number to 150,000 , since wed recently passed that milestone , and kept testing . As I watched over the next couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked closer I found that the 150,000 actually had a negative impact instead of a positive one . <p> There are a variety of reasons why these results could occur . Perhaps 150,000 may seem like a fake number to some people , while 130,000 seems more real . Either way , this discovery was huge and has led to another round of tests to try to determine how to best display the download number . <h> A/B Testing Keys and Resources <p> Pick the Right Tool <p> The two most popular A/B testing platforms are Optimizely and Visual Website Optimizer . I personally use Optimizely and have done so for the last three years , so I cant speak to the quality of VWO . Optimizely has two plans Free ( sufficient for most small eCommerce sites ) and Enterprise . VWO has several more pricing options and may be better for a medium to large eCommerce site . VWOs pricing starts at $9/month . <p> Understand Your Traffic <p> When A/B testing you need to make sure you understand your traffic . If you only get a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a significant impact . You really need 100+ conversions on any single variation to be able to determine a winner , so think about how long it would take you to get there at your baseline conversion rate and determine if you want to wait that long for a result . <p> Understanding your traffic also means that you need to know who is shopping at your store and run tests accordingly . Are your customers typically stay at home moms ? Then maybe you need to test a Pinterest button . Are they teenage boys ? Then maybe Snapchat or Instagram is more appropriate . <p> Make Your Tests Count <p> If you 're just starting out with A/B testing , then test things like button colors until you get the hang of it . The real value comes in testing things like , social icon placement , related product placement , coupons at checkout , etc . Go for the tests that make a big difference first , and if you have extra time consider testing things like copy change and colors . <h> Summary <p> A/B testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hopefully this post will give you something to get started . If you have any questions please feel free to comment below . <h> Posted by Jeremiah Prummer <p> Jeremiah is the founder and manager of wpovernight.com - a small but rapidly growing WordPress plugin marketplace that specializes in eCommerce . He works with several small to medium sized eCommerce sites to optimize their sales process . When he 's not working , he 's typically spending time with his wife and friends in his beautiful hometown . <p> Hi Dan ! I 'm happy you asked how this one can A/B test a WooCommerce setup . I 'm one of the co-founders of Nelio Software , a company that is currently working on a native A/B testing service for WordPress . Right now , our tool is able to test almost all standard WordPress elements : that is , pages , headlines , widgets , or themes ( menus will be available soon ) . As such , there are a few tests you may be able to run in WooCommerce with Nelio . Please , feel free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works ! <p> During 2015 , well start integrating WooCommerce-specific tests . If you 'd like to work with us and help us to define the set of e-commerce tests you 'd be interested in , well be more than glad to help ( just contact us ) ! <p> Ive run a number of A/B tests over different platforms ( never on WP though ) and something I struggle with is letting go of the test once it has run its course and a statistically significant winner is selected . <p> For example with your test about forwarding the user to checkout once an item has been added , I would spend days afterwards trying to work out ( without an additional test ) what exactly it was that put a customer off when they got pushed straight onto cart . Evidently its not feasible asking them , and also if it were , the data would be qualitative rather than quantitative . <p> I guess it comes down to a personal flaw of wanting to know EVERYTHING . <p> No questions , just a passing comment . <p> Cheers , Matt 11393 @qwx871393

As my wife became a stay-at-home-mom , I realized how much fun they were having and that I was missing out on a lot of family time because of my job . <p> In 2008 , I quit the bank , and started doing development full time . <h> What was the timeline of your projects ? <p> After I quit my job , I started with building eCommerce sites using Cart Keeper . I then moved on to working with Magento . But , one of the things neither of those platforms did very well was a blog . My projects would usually include a blog component . I had to install WordPress in a subdirectory , and then do design-work to make the blog look like the rest of the site . <p> In 2011 , WooCommerce started coming on to the scene , and it seemed interesting as both the eCommerce platform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a call for development of the Authorize.Net extension which I took on and it ended up being the first commercial plugin for WooCommerce . <p> In 2012 , part of the push was to get WooCommerce compatible with a lot of payment gateways to encourage adoption . So that 's what I worked on an additional 8 gateways after the Authorize.Net extension . <p> WooThemes came after that where I built my support experience . <h> What are some challenges as a developer that you faced ? <p> From a business perspective , charging higher prices and realizing the value of my time . I had the technical skills , but I had to learn a lot of freelancing skills to be an effective small business owner . <p> On the development side , a big learning process was knowing the " WordPress way " , that is , the coding standards for WordPress . I think I 'm still evolving in building better design practices for my own code . <h> What is your advice for developers in or starting in WordPress development ? <p> Go read a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you read through more code and try to apply that to your own , you 'll develop better habits . <p> A big learning for me was to continually add hooks and filters to my code to make it more extensible , which is something I still need to do for my own code . <h> What is your advice for store owners using WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads ? <p> Go market ! Get the word out to build your business . Do n't  worry about small things like the shape or color of a button on your store . I would have clients where clients would spend 6 to 8 months just building the site , but when they opened the doors , nobody came . <p> Do n't  focus so much on the mechanics of your site and do more customer development . <h> Where do you see the future of eCommerce ? <p> I think virtual reality ( VR ) is going to hit a stride , and I really want to see a VR store where somebody can do a full tour of their boutique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 've also seen a lot of subscription platforms , and I would like to see more of those survive multiple years as businesses . <p> And see how stores can differentiate themselves from the behemoths like Amazon . <h> Daniel Espinoza , can you tell us about some short-term and long-term goals ? <p> Short term , I am doing more work on the Sugar Event Calendar to revamp the plugin and develop more add ons for it . <p> Long term , I want to take a step out of eCommerce and be involved in products not related to eCommerce . So getting those up and running will be the goal . <p> The vision for the agency is to support my " why " . My " why " is to spend quality time with my family . Spending time with my family and travelling around the world with them is very important to me . <p> Right now I spend 70% of time on client-work and 30% on plugins , and I 'd love to flip that over time . <p> What did you think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent in the interview ? Tell us and ask further questions in the comments below . 11394 @qwx871394 
@@98138282 @2338282/ <p> Here is a brief summary of the interview with Brent Shepherd about Prospress . <h> What other extensions do you guys develop ? <p> Weve been experimenting over the last year and a bit with feature extensions for Subscriptions . People have been asking for these features for a while now but it does n't  make sense to include these features in core if only 20-30% of the users want them . So we 've been experimenting with extensions for the Subscriptions extension , which itself is an extension for a plugin . So it gets a bit crazy which is why were working through the idea and how best to deliver them . <p> We have a few now on Github and well be moving them over to WordPress.org over the next few months . Thatll give us better version control . For most of these , since they 're in their initial experimental phase and some of them were collaborations , we wanted to release them for free for now . <h> What was the beginning like for the company ? <p> The beginning is probably around 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things online . I had looked at WordPress and what it was doing for publishing , and had wondered why nothing like that exists for selling online . So one of the first things I had worked on was Prospress the plugin , which as an auctions plugin for WordPress . At its core , it was about marketplaces where you could also do crowdfunding . <p> When I saw WooCommerce , I thought that these guys have done it in terms of making selling easier on WordPress and I wanted to develop something for WooCommerce . After building a payment gateway , I developed the Subscriptions plugin because a lot of people wanted to sell subscription products . <h> Prospress has done a publication . Can you talk about that ? <p> The publication is smallwoorld.com which is a book and a blog . Initially we wanted to attract good talent by showing on our site the types of people we affect . So early on , these were interviews with businesses that used our extensions . <p> Last year , we decided to put it all together into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large coffee table book but cost and time factor just was n't feasible . We ended up building a smaller book and then built a separate blog around the idea . Its easier to get interviews if were telling people its for a publication rather than our company blog . <h> How has the company grown ? <p> When we first started , we had a team of about three and a half when you account for freelancers . Today were a company of six people and were looking to add one more person . So far we 've had engineers rotating between development and support , but are now looking to add a dedicated support person . <p> For growing , I started writing a lot of documentation . Turns out by writing tons of documentation , it really improves your ranking . So that has been a big factor for attention when people are searching for subscriptions . <h> What are some challenges running a company like that ? <p> Hiring is a big challenge for sure . I waited too long before hiring to start . If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dots and anticipate when I needed to hire people . Finding good people takes a lot of work . Initially , you do n't  really know what its going to take to get the right candidate . <p> Another problem was product-market fit . Basically , Subscriptions 2.0 was the first time we had product-market fit and there was a lot of effort into getting rid of old code to fundamentally change what people wanted our product to be . The fundamental change was treating a subscription as its own entity , rather than another product . <p> People get a lot more information and a lot more control by having the subscription as a separate entity . <h> What 's your advice for developers starting in WooCommerce ? <p> The best thing you can do to be a developer is to get people to review your code . I know its natural to be conscious of your code , but the more you can get feedback , the better you 'll become . The other thing is to write as much code as you can . <h> What 's your advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find out through articles on reputable publications . <p> Ideally , only purchase themes and plugins from official and reputable vendors . <p> Be deliberate in the choices for the plugins you keep on your site . <p> Treat managing the software as a journey that includes updates , rather than a one off where you install it once and do n't  update for a long time . <h> What 's the future like for Prospress ? <p> Subscriptions is a really good foundation for the company that I 'm really happy with . So the mini-extension ideas is something well be working on over the next little while . 11394 @qwx871394

@@98138285 @2338285/ <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WooCommerce 2.2 is being released today , and we have all of the details on the new release ! Well go over the major changes to WooCommerce Core that have been made in this version , as well as all of the cool stuff that 's been added in this WooCommerce 2.2 Review . <p> Remember , as a best practice you should always upgrade on a staging or testing site first , then upgrade your live site once you 've confirmed that there are no issues . It also helps to update extensions first , then WooCommerce core . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : Overview <p> There are fewer structural changes to WooCommerce than there were in WooCommerce 2.1 , which should make upgrading smoother . Version 2.1 added the REST API as well as endpoints , which changed the WooCommerce pages that were installed . While this made setup less intensive and made it far harder to break or delete core pages , it required updates to several core templates . As a result , themes that improperly override @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in WooCommerce 2.2 are related to orders and payments , but are far smaller changes and should not affect the frontend of the site . However , some nifty features were added because of the order status structure changes . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : Orders <p> The Edit / Add order screen has been tweaked in WooCommerce 2.2 to provide a bit more information and to pave the way for refund support . <p> As a minor change , the payment method used has been added below the order title : <p> 2.1 Edit Order <p> 2.2 Edit Order <p> The " Order Details " table has also been updated . All costs are now included in the order details table so that they can be refunded if needed . <p> 2.1 Order Details <p> 2.2 Order Details <p> Note that admins can no longer edit paid orders with WooCommerce 2.2 . If you need to add something to an order , such as a gifted product , you 'll have to change the order status to on-hold or pending , then back to processing or completed . Unpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.2 Review : Payments &amp; Refunds <p> The most significant change in WooCommerce 2.2 is now possible because of the changes to the order structure and orders page : refunds directly from WooCommerce and automatic refunds for gateway extensions that support refunds . To issue a refund , youd previously have to log into your merchant account and issue a refund , then update the order status to " refunded " in WooCommerce . However , there was no way to note partial refunds if one item out of a multi-item order was refunded . This has now been added to WooCommerce core . <p> While only a small number of gateways support refunds at the moment ( mostly just the core payment gateway methods ) , developers are now starting to add refund support to their gateways . For example ( since I have insider info here = ) , weve already begun working on this for several gateways at SkyVerge . <p> Want to start using refunds immediately ? The core PayPal Standard gateway can process automatic refunds from WooCommerce , as well as the brand new Simplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a core payment processing option , and the Mijireh integration is now available as a free Mijireh extension . If you previously used Mijireh , the Mijireh installation will be available with one click when you upgrade WooCommerce . <h> Manual Refunds <p> Manual Refunds can be executed for any WooCommerce payment gateway . A manual refund will allow you to mark certain order items as refunded , and will include tax fees as well as optionally allowing you to refund shipping or other fees . This will not automatically send a refund to your payment gateway , but can be done for any payment method in WooCommerce . <p> Clicking the " Refund " button will bring up a refund screen where a shop admin can select which items or enter an amount to refund , then optionally add refund notes for reference . <p> Refund manually <p> Refunded items will now have refund details shown , and the order total will also include a " Refunded " total for reference . <p> Partial Refund <p> Manual refunds will not change order status or add order notes , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " manually if you process a manual refund for an entire order . <h> Gateway Refunds <p> Gateway refunds will provide automatic refunds from WooCommerce for payment gateways that build-in support for refunds . When you set up a gateway , you may now see more settings needed to process refunds . For example , PayPal Standard has extra settings to complete if you 'd like to automatically process refunds : <p> When you process a gateway refund , a " Refund $$ via GATEWAY " button will be added if the gateway supports automatic refunds . <p> Gateway refunds ( PayPal ) <p> If you do a gateway refund , the refund details will automatically be sent to your payment gateway so that you do n't  have to log into your merchant account to complete a refund , then mark or note this within WooCommerce . This will save huge amounts of time for merchants that process hundreds or thousands of orders each month . <p> Order notes will also be added to signify that a refund has been processed . If you refund the total amount for the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " refunded " . <p> Refund Order Notes <p> Order statuses will not change for partial refunds , as part of the order has still been processed and completed . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : Other Changes <p> There are a few other significant changes in WooCommerce 2.2 to be aware of . <p> Language packs have been removed from WooCommerce core , as they add a lot of code that may not be necessary for your site . Instead , the appropriate language packs will automatically download if your WordPress language is set as something other than English . <p> Inventory management has also gotten some refinement . Backorders and stock can now be configured on a per-variation level rather than simply for the parent product . In WooCommerce 2.1 , " In stock " vs " Out of Stock " had to be managed for a parent product : <p> 2.1 Inventory <p> In WooCommerce 2.2 , the " Stock Status " has been moved to the variation level , but the ability to set a parent stock level and allow backorders remains . <p> 2.2 Inventory <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a per-variation basis , but backorders and stock status could not be managed . <p> 2.1 Variations <p> A " Manage Stock " option for variations has been added , which allows for backorder and stock status management on a variation level if enabled . <p> 2.2 Variation <p> The new error logs tool is also really handy for troubleshooting . This gives you access to error logs right within your WooCommerce admin so you do n't  have to retrieve them via FTP . A new " Logs " tab has been added under System Status : <p> The final small change has to deal with shortcodes . WooCommerce core has an add-to-cart shortcode that allows you to simply output a price and " Add to cart " button for a product anywhere on your site . This is handy for stores that sell products on landing pages , via blog posts , or anywhere outside of the WooCommerce product page . However , these shortcodes had no way of adding a quantity of greater than one . <p> The shortcode previously looked like this : addtocart id= " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an i 'd or a SKU to identify the product , then optionally add styles to the button . Now the addtocart shortcode accepts a custom quantity attribute as well : addtocart id= " " style= " " sku= " " quantity= " " . <p> When the " Add to Cart " button is clicked with a quantity set , the specified quantity of the item is added to the cart . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : For Developers <p> The other major changes to WooCommerce 2.2 are great from a development perspective . The WooCommerce REST API functionality is now well-rounded with the addition of PUT / POST / DELETE methods for products , orders , and coupons with v2 of the API . This means that external systems , such as the WooCommerce iOS app , will now have the capability to read , create , update , and delete products , coupons , and orders from your store if you 're running WooCommerce 2.2+ . <p> This really opens the API up for further external integrations , so I 'll be curious to see what springs up over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . <p> Webhooks were also added in WooCommerce 2.2 . Webhooks will allow notifications to be created for core WooCommerce actions , such as adding items to the cart , creating orders , new customers , updating inventory , and more . This opens up easy integrations for push notifications or other external services , which can use these webhooks to trigger actions of their own . <p> For example , webhooks for inventory updates could be used by external inventory services ( such as TradeGecko ) to update inventory for your store . Webhooks also open up some exciting development opportunities with WooCommerce . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : Conclusions <p> The refund support in WooCommerce 2.2 is a really awesome addition . Not only does this greatly improve record keeping an order management within WooCommerce , but the ability for gateways to tie into this functionality to automatically process orders is a great benefit for shop owners . Refunding orders was a big hurdle for larger shops , so its great to see some support for this . <p> The " For Developers " changes should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up some really great opportunities for WooCommerce integrations outside of WordPress . With the REST API and webhooks , external systems can interact directly with WooCommerce rather than requiring an integration plugin to do so . I 'm definitely looking forward to seeing what projects implement these new changes . <h> WooCommerce 2.2 Review : Read More <p> Want to read more about this release ?

Automatic refunds are a very impressive feature as well . Is there an overview on what payment gateways currently/will support refunds ? I would have assumed Stripe would be among the first . <p> Hey Joshua , thanks for the kind words ! I 'm pretty sure Stripe 2.1+ supports refunds already along with the core gateways . I do n't  think there 's a list available yet as a lot of gateways are working on adding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But just one question , transitioning from Woocommerce 2.1 is tricky , one problem that i am having trouble with is that i added custom fields in the variable product , and they can be retrieved previously from the shopping cart data in 2.1 , but after upgrading to 2.2 , it does n't  let me to retrieve custom field values anymore in the Cart page , as the data that stores this disappeared , would you by any chance know how to fix this ? <p> I 'm trying to find the answer to my problem but i cant do it , i hope someone here does : ) , here we go : <p> i 'm a designer and i sell exclusive designs for each client , woocommerce product is standard price to purchase but after i need to upload exclusive files to each customer account , how can this be done ? is possible ? <p> I want to upload a exclusive file downloadable for my clients to their account in " my downloads " section so they can click download when i finish the job and i uploaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to do in the " My Downloads " section , as you 'd have to create a new product with an associated download for this . I 'd recommend using a note on the order instead you can set up a customer note and include a link to download from your site , Dropbox , Amazon S3 , etc . When you add a customer note , the customer is emailed the note content : They can also view this note as part of the order from their account . 
@@98138286 @2338286/ <p> I had the rare opportunity to conduct an in-person interview ( out in the real world and everything take that internet ! ) for Sell with WP . I met up with Jason Coleman and we discussed everything from Paid Memberships Pro to how the GPL license affects business models . I really appreciated the chance to get some background on the development of PMPro and the unique business model that Jason and Kim use to monetize the plugin . <h> Building Paid Memberships Pro <p> First , for some background . Paid Memberships Pro started as a marriage between client needs for a content-restriction solution and a custom eCommerce plugin built by Stranger Studios . At the time ( in 2008 ) , there were a few membership solutions available , but S2Member was the only plugin available in the WordPress.org repository and the available paid membership solutions were difficult to customize . <p> So what ultimately spurred on the development of PMPro ? Jason said : <p> We had an eCommerce plugin for WordPress that at the time was even with or ahead of WP eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugin for our own clients . Meanwhile , WP eCommerce was distributed through the WordPress plugin repository and was being used by thousands of sites . We had built a decent consulting business partially based on our internal eCommerce plugin , but we recognized the potential for a product-focused business like WP eCommerce had built . <p> At first , memberships seemed like a natural fit as a new type of product in Stranger Studios internal eCommerce plugin . However , they quickly realized that membership sites require an entirely different approach when compared to a typical eCommerce site the checkout process is fundamentally different , as shipping information or checkout for multiple products generally is n't necessary . Even though some parts of the eCommerce plugin setup applied , the experience could definitely be streamlined for a membership setup . <p> Once they came to this realization , it took about 4-6 months to build the membership plugin for their clients . " The next big step was to get the plugin working on multiple site configurations and with user-friendly settings , " Jason said . " It took about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using PMPro to when we released it in the WordPress repository for general use . " <p> PMPro has also evolved along with major changes in WordPress , such as the addition of custom post types and improvements in their usage in versions 2.9 and 3.0 . How did this affect development ? <p> Because of changes in WordPress since we started building , there 's some technical debt to be paid off . Pieces of the plugin are always being rewritten and updated so that it evolves with WordPress . <p> Add-ons are also constantly developed . Keeping the core plugin lean has helped most sites get what they need through add-ons or customizations without bloating the plugin or sacrificing stability . <h> Using Paid Memberships Pro <p> When should Paid Memberships Pro be the plugin of choice for you ? For many sites , the flexibility of the plugin makes it a top contender . As most serious membership sites will require a developers involvement or support for the membership side of the site anyway , keeping the core plugin lead , extensible , and customizable makes it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself : while WordPress wont necessarily do everything that users need , its a starting point for almost any kind of website since it can be extended and customized . He sees PMPro acting the same way for membership sites the core plugin handles all of the basics , while add-ons and customizations get clients the rest of the way when building the site . <p> So when is PMPro not the right choice ? Jason thinks that most of the plugin is unnecessary for sites that want free memberships or just content restriction without the checkout . <p> If you 're not using the checkout process and accepting payments , you 're not using half of the plugin so it may not be necessary . There are also a couple other cases that it does n't  handle , such as integrations with shipping systems or or including shipping rates . There 's an add-on that adds a shipping address to the checkout , but probably wont work for sites that have more complex shipping needs theyd be better off with an eCommerce cart . <p> There are also solutions that work better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content ( such as Easy Digital Downloads ) . However , the extensibility of the plugin makes it a flexible solution . <h> Business Model <p> One of the things I find most interesting about Paid Memberships Pro is the revenue model for the plugin . Many membership plugins involve an initial purchase , which includes support and updates for an amount of time ( usually one year ) . PMPro takes an entirely different route : the plugin and add-ons are entirely free , while support is monetized . While there are arguments to be made for either approach , I 've always found this interesting and wanted to know more about the process that led to that decision . <p> First , I asked Jason about why the core plugin was released for free on WordPress.org : <p> When PMPro was being developed , there was a lot of stir in the community over the GPL license and the legality of different licenses for WP plugins was a bit of a gray area . Because of this , I asked Matt Mullenweg what he recommended for PMPro and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to align ourselves with WordPress leadership since were doing business in the WordPress community , so we decided to take his advice . Companies that reluctantly release their code as GPL and then try to hide the fact that the code is GPL or shut down groups who are distributing free versions of their plugin are in many ways fighting against the GPL . I wanted to embrace it and avoid those kinds of issues . <p> Once we decided to make the code entirely GPL , people could technically get the plugin for free via redistribution . We decided to then preempt that process and make it free ourselves , and that way we ensured customers got the code directly from us and we at least get to touch each customer , i.e. , getting their email addresses . We could then monetize other parts of the experience and upsell services . <p> Releasing the plugin for free also helped a lot with marketing , because we did n't  have to compete with advertising and affiliate networks that a lot of other membership plugins already had in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gave us a lot more exposure than we could have generated otherwise . <p> Taking a different tact certainly seemed like a great play in the long run , as PMPro went from a new plugin to one of the top contenders for many sites because of the ability to try the plugin and extend or customize it . I know that it was one of the first membership plugins I 'd played with simply because I could just download and install it rather than sign up for a trial . <p> My next question was along the same vein keeping the core plugin free makes a lot of sense in that context , but what about add-ons ? Why not use a " freemium " or extension model to monetize the plugin rather than releasing add-ons for free as well ? <p> First , Jason said that it was in the same spirit of embracing the GPL license as releasing the core plugin for free : users could redistribute that code as well . It also ensures that users are n't  getting your products from other sites that undercut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . <p> He also brought up some interesting points about how add-ons relate to the core plugin : <p> Keeping add-ons free avoids the decision on what should be added to core and what should be left out . If you 're making a lot of money on an add-on that almost all of your users need , would you really cannibalize your own revenue stream even though that feature should be in core ? Keeping add-ons free eliminates that decision . <p> However , there are trade-offs to this approach . One of Jasons goals is to make Paid Memberships Pro a starting platform for membership sites . Since these sites require so much customization , the core plugin and add-ons provide a great way to start tweaking a site until it matches the clients needs . However , without a financial incentive to extend the platform , its difficult to build an ecosystem and get other developers involved with Paid Memberships Pro and building add-ons . <p> To monetize the system , users can sign up for a one-year , $97 support plan , or have the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultation call ) for $697 . The support plan includes access to a members forum where support questions and tips for customization are shared and answered . <p> The membership plans fund add-on developments in a way , as the customizations and tutorials usually lead to some code that can be released as an add-on once some settings and a UI is added . However , this model can also be a double-edged sword . <p> One of my reservations about monetizing support is that I feel that it encourages developers to drive users towards support rather than making the plugin and corresponding documentation as easy to use or read as possible . On the developer side , I think it adds unnecessary judgment calls when you have to decide which questions you 'll answer , and which require users to purchase support , which can sour the experience for some users . So does this affect Paid Memberships Pro ? <p> " Definitely , " Jason says . " You 're not going to please everybody . We cant provide great support on WordPress.org if that 's where we actually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . Some people accuse us of not making the plugin as easy as possible , but we think most sites will require a developer or our help anyway . " <p> So how about the other side of that coin ? Jason says : <p> Since support is what 's monetized , we try to make sure that its as comprehensive as possible . Many plugins that include support will tell you , " Oh , you 'll need to hire a developer to do that , " if the question would take too much time to answer . We wont do that because people are paying us specifically to help them with these problems . We often spend a lot of time answering specific questions and writing tutorials on how to customize PMPro . If a bit of code is too specific to one customers site or will take too long for us to code up , we will ask them to upgrade to a " do it for me " plan . <h> Growth of PMPro <p> Wheres Paid Memberships Pro going from here ? There are some exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Version 2.0 is currently in development and should be released within the next couple of months . The biggest feature addition will be the ability to allow multiple memberships per user . This would be a great addition for e-courseware or other topic-based membership sites . Members could pay for access to a specific course or channel , and can purchase access to as many memberships as needed . <p> The next version also includes a framework for adding payment gateway integrations , which will make adding gateway integrations far easier and will hopefully generate involvement from other developers . <p> Stranger Studios also plans to build a larger ecosystem around Paid Memberships Pro . This will start with some membership-driven , PMPro-specific themes so that certain types of membership sites can purchase an all-in-one solution . Improvements in multisite support are also in mind , as well as more " do it for me " installation / setup services , which many freelancers tend to avoid due to the back-and-forth involved with the client . <p> Thanks so much to Jason for taking the time to sit down and chat with us ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392

@@98138290 @2338290/ <p> You need a reliable , easy-to-use tool to manage your marketing emails and keep in touch with your customers . Today were taking a look at one of these tools : SendinBlue . <p> SendinBlue makes a fantastic MailChimp or AWeber alternative for your shops marketing emails . SendinBlue even has an AWeber comparison chart available if you 'd like to see how it stacks up against other major services . However , there 's one unique thing about SendinBlue that makes it a great solution : you can manage both your marketing emails and transactional email ( such as automated order confirmations ) all in the same service . <h> SendinBlue Review : Overview <p> You can set started with SendinBlue with a free account if you 'd like to test it out and see how you like using it for marketing campaigns as well as tracking your transactional mail . The free account allows you to : <p> use the newsletter template builder to create responsive designs for 60 days <p> Dashboard View <p> If you outgrow the free plan , you can upgrade to a paid plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send emails , you may want a subscription plan ( such as the $34 per month Bronze plan ) , which gives you unlimited access to all features and 60,000 emails per month . <p> If you have a large list ( over the free plan cap ) but do n't  frequently send emails , you can also buy " credits " to use as you need to send emails rather that using a monthly subscription . The pricing options are flexible enough to let you choose the best fit for your email list size and mailing frequency . <h> SendinBlue Review : Transactional Emails &amp; SMS <p> One of the things I really like about SendinBlue is the ability to send transactional emails . This is one of the main reasons why I think SendinBlue a great MailChimp or AWeber alternative , as these do n't  touch transactional emails in your store ( you 'd have to use Mandrill from MailChimp , which is a separate integration , while there 's nothing from AWeber ) . <p> When we wrote about about using transactional email services , we described why they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's one of the major reasons we recommend using a transactional email service ( from that article ) : <p> Customers have come to expect immediate email confirmations for their orders and are likely to call or email if they do n't  receive one . Even worse , if a customer needs to resets their password before logging in to make a purchase and does n't  receive the reset email , they may decide not to follow through with the purchase . Transactional Email services solve this problem and more by offloading the responsibility to deliver emails from WordPress to another service . <p> Transactional email services ensure that you 're not affected by your hosting environment , as sending an email via WordPress from a shared server could impact you and mark you as spam if one of your server-mates is a spammer . They also work with email providers to ensure maximum deliverability so your shops emails are safe and reliable . <p> The SendinBlue integration for WordPress includes transactional email services so that any emails sent from your shop are served from their servers , improving the email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also benefit from detailed analytics on emails sent from your store , including what was delivered , opened , and clicked . This allows you to both keep an eye on emails delivered and test subject lines to influence open rates . <p> Transactional Email Analytics <p> You can manage transactional SMS messages as well , but this would require a customized integration . For example , if you 'd like to automatically send SMS messages when an order is shipped , youd first need a plugin to trigger these messages using SendinBlues API . SendinBlue can then send these messages and provide analytics on your transactional SMS messages so you can see what 's been sent , delivered , etc . <h> SendinBlue Review : Managing Lists &amp; Contacts <p> SendinBlue will also allow you to manage email and SMS campaigns , combining both your transactional and marketing emails into one service . <p> There are a couple of levels to managing your lists and subscribers so you can target emails to the correct recipients . First , you have a folder of lists . I used this to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; lists <p> You can then subdivide this folder into several different lists . I created lists for marketing and customer emails , so you could have different lists to group subscribers together ( for example , this is handy to send different campaigns to paid customers vs blog readers ) . <p> Each new list will require at least one subscriber , which I did n't  particularly like , but this was n't a big deal as I just added my own email to each list to get it up and running . You can manually add your first contact and the list is created . <p> Add a list <p> All subscribers are present in your contact list , regardless of which list(s) they 're subscribed to . This let 's you easily add a new contact to multiple lists when created . This is typically a pain point to other email providers , as contacts have to be added on a per-list basis , making SendinBlue an easier alternative . <p> Contact List <p> The one thing I disliked about contacts is the inability to delete a contact if desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from all emails ( or edit the contacts to remove them from a list ) , but this does n't  remove the account from your contacts list . <p> The goal behind this is to , " avoid sending an email to an unwanted contact or re-adding a contact who had already asked to unsubscribe from your emails . " Its also geared towards ensuring that you do n't  send emails to invalid addresses , as bounces can be automatically blacklisted . These are definitely great considerations , but I 'd prefer to perhaps see only active clients , and have to view a " blacklist " separately so I do n't  see blacklisted subscribers mixed in with active ones . <h> SendinBlue Review : Managing Campaigns &amp; Analytics <p> Once you have folders and lists configured and populated with contacts , you can send email and SMS campaigns . Each campaign will be tracked so that you can view detailed metrics on open rates , click rates , and deliverability . <p> New campaigns will allow you to set up " sent from " information , and SMS campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns will prompt you to choose a template / email type and draft your email . <p> Create Campaigns <p> SendinBlue provides a template editor that will allow you to drag and drop your own sections into the email , or you can get started quickly by dropping in a pre-made template and modifying it . Editing this template was very easy , as each section has settings you can change in terms of alignment and colors , and clicking on any text makes that text editable . I started with a pre-made template and added my first email in about 5 minutes . <p> Email template editor <p> Once you 've drafted your email , you 'll determine which lists it should be sent to ( or the entire folder ) , and can segment your email based on subscriber information ( such as name ) or behavior as well ( such as whether or not they 've read another campaign ) . <p> Email campaign options <p> Once your email or SMS campaign has been sent , you 'll be able to view detailed reports on its performance right within your dashboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkout pages in your shop to allow customers to subscribe to the list of your choice . You can define this in the settings while entering your API keys , and also set the label / opt in text : <p> EDD Integration : Settings <p> When a customer opts in at checkout , he or she will be added to the selected list in your SendinBlue account . <p> EDD Checkout integration <h> SendinBlue Review : Summary <p> SendinBlue is a great MailChimp or AWeber alternative for sending marketing emails , but I love that it goes beyond this and delivers the transactional emails for your shop as well . You can keep all emails within the same service , making it easy to analyze any sent email via the built-in analytics . <p> You also get the added benefit of sending SMS campaigns , which are great for sharing immediate information like flash sales . As SMS integrations typically require another service alongside of your email service , its cool to have all of these marketing tools within the same app . <p> The pre-built integrations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can opt paying customers into a particular list to receive cross promotions or other product info . These typically require paid add-ons for other email services . <p> You can get started with SendinBlue for free for up to 9,000 emails a month , and your email service can then grow as your store does . <p> Note : This . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 7 Comments <p> My WP/Woocomm site will be launching very soon so ( based on your review ) I have jumped on the SendinBlue free plan to try out there integrated WP emails . <p> As well as the marketing side of things , I am keen to jazz up my transactional emails a bit . I have already made them my own via Woocomm HTML editor but was hoping with SendinBlue i could add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been up all night trying to figure it out ) is a straight copy and paste of the HTML does n't  register in Sendins template builder well . <p> As a newbie to all of this i am obviously missing something here .

@@98138291 @2338291/ <h> All About Shopp : Interview with Jonathan Davis <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> From the editor : This post is based on an interview with Jonathan Davis , founder of Ingenesis Ltd , developers of the Shopp eCommerce plugin for WordPress . Shopp is one of the most mature eCommerce plugins for WordPress ( see our full review here ) , and has been in development since 2008 . <p> In this interview , we 've covered some of the recent changes to the plugin , changes to the revenue model , and what the future holds for Shopp . My questions are bolded , with Jonathans answers following them . <p> Beka : Shopp 1.3 was recently released , and was also added to the WordPress.org repo as a free plugin . What made you decide to release the core plugin for free with the update when Shopp was historically a paid plugin ? <p> Jonathan : I 've always wanted Shopp to be free , really from the very beginning . I did n't  want to have to charge for it , but early on it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring into it . <p> Ive been working on a pathway to releasing for free for a long time and the pieces finally fell into place when we shifted the support key model to an annual term last January . <p> So really , youd already shifted to a renewal model anyway ; however , now renewals will be for support and services , not use of the plugin . <p> Yeah , that was announced on our site last January on the 2nd , right after the new year . It went into effect on December 31st last year . We gave all existing key owners an extra year before needing to be renewed , so the timing was right to now release the core plugin for free and charge for support . <p> So how does this change your business model moving forward ? <p> I had originally approached the release of Shopp as delivering a product . I think a lot of developers would see their projects as a " product " , but especially in 2011 and 2012 I came to a realization that software development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a service model , not a product model . <p> That gave me the direction to go to shift the project away from the direct access revenue to a much more sustainable service model . I think the success of that is seen in almost every corner of the WordPress ecosystem . We held out for a really long time too , a last remnant of the old way and a lot of our customers appreciated us for that . <p> Interesting . What 's the transition to annual service plans like ? Weve seen a few companies , namely WooThemes , make this transition recently as well . <p> Definitely not easy . I think the perception is that customers paid for what was originally billed as an unlimited term ( although I had made some qualifications that it would change in the future ) . I think they would be more upset if the services they rely on for us vanished because we could n't survive since this practice is unsustainable . I can see that , if you have a simple plugin that only does one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in an environment where there the competition uses an annual term . It would have to be a challenging problem that 's solved very elegantly with some calculated risk . I think eCommerce is too complex a beast to fit that model for very long . <p> eCommerce reveals the biggest flaw in that approach , a consideration I was too blind to see at the beginning : that the technology would change so radically . We 've basically had to re-invent Shopp 3 times over already . In 2008 , mobile had n't  taken off . Custom Post Types werent in WordPress . PHP 4 was the predominant install available . <p> Yeah , its certainly difficult to take a calculated risk when you do n't  even know half of the variables , and the ones that you do know are always changing . <p> Absolutely . <p> How do you think having a free core plugin has changed adoption of Shopp ? <p> I think releasing Shopp for free changes the game for us in many ways . Adoption of Shopp appears to be growing certainly , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . <p> Anything you 'd cut from the core plugin now that its free ? <p> No . Most separate plugins will address niches which might be feature niches or third-party system integrations . I cant imagine stripping anything out of Shopp today . Part of what stands apart is that we give a lot in the core . Six different shipping calculators are built-in , along with payment processors , two different storage engines , faceted menu systems , and search . Not to mention the 13 or so smart collections and seven reports ; there 's a gallery , a carousel , and a slideshow component all built-in . <p> It definitely covers the bases without needing to buy anything extra , but the extras that are available are definitely filling in those specific needs or encapsulating things that are in flux . For example , Stripe may be popular today , and you could call it a de-facto modern payment standard , but we deliver it as an add-on because that may change in the future . PayPal has long been dominant , and is built-in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable decisions on what is fair to make an add-on and what is excessive . <p> Aside from the points above , what features make Shopp the top choice as an eCommerce plugin , and what kinds of stores would be best served by using Shopp over other platforms ? <p> Shopp is really retail focused . It works for downloads and subscriptions too , but it really shines with the retail fulfillment workflow . Order event history gives you full details on all changes in an order ( payments , shipping dates , downloads , etc ) . You can process refunds within Shopp rather than going to your payment processor , and Shopp permits authorizations rather than immediate charges , which is actually what Visa and Mastercard require for shipped orders . <p> The specs and faceted filters are also pretty amazing . Shopp also has its own search engine built into it , separate from the WordPress search . Its also got the best support team , and not one , but 4 different documentation sites . ( You can check out the full feature list here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace set up on the Shopp plugin site that makes it far easier to find official plugins and themes . Is that going to be a focus in the future ? <p> Were getting our market up and running . The free plugin is a distribution model that provides a platform for the ecosystem . Putting up a paywall to that limits adoption and , unless you 're Apple , does n't  allow the market to flourish . <p> Now people can join the ecosystem , then buy what they need . Were working on some " official " themes to release soon as well . <p> What plans do you have for that marketplace in the future ? How will we see it expand third-party add-ons , internal offerings , or both ? <p> Both , definitely . We have already begun adding some third-party additions to the store . As we get better management tools in place , well be expanding that . <p> How will the 3rd party integrations work ? Will you be doing all support in-house , or more of a Theme Forest-style where each developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will support their offering . The challenge there is making it clear to the buyer who they are getting support from how to get support and who is providing that support . You have to step very carefully there lest it really spoil the parent brand . <p> What common misunderstandings or misconceptions do you think people have about Shopp ? <p> Good question . Probably the biggest is that it is designed to be purely turn-key . You plug it in and that 's it , you have an eCommerce store . Shopp is designed first and foremost to be an eCommerce development platform . It has to be easy for a merchant to manage , but without boxing-in developers . That means we leave a lot of last-mile problems for developers to fill in . That makes it a great system for developers that need a platform that wont tell them how eCommerce is supposed to be done . You do n't  have to " un-wire " a bunch of code you do n't  need in order to implement a custom component for your client . <p> What 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and account-payments in the next point-release . Then well finally get to overhaul the product editor to fix a lot of the ills that confound people with our current product editor . There is a lot of innovation in the product editor now , but we just need to bring it fully up to speed with where the direction of WP has gone and our own UI design direction . We definitely have a lot of plans we want to implement in the core . Well always be adding value to it . <p> Thanks so much to Jonathan for taking the time to talk with us ! We think the release of Shopp as a free plugin is an interesting move , especially since the core plugin has a lot of functionality built in ( for me , the shipping methods stand out as bonuses ) and definitely indicates a trend in the WordPress premium ecosystem as a whole .

@@98138292 @2338292/ <p> Note : WooCommerce has been updated since publishing this review . More details on the latest version can be found in this article . <p> If you 're searching for a WordPress eCommerce solution , WooCommerce has definitely entered the conversation . There 's a reason why : WooCommerce currently has the most active installs out of any WordPress eCommerce plugin . The ease of use and reporting are huge bonuses , and the light core codebase gives you a highly functional , extremely extensible , and customizable product . However , gearing up to full functionality is going to require some paid extensions and probably a good WooCommerce-compatible theme . <p> WooCommerce is a freeWordPress plugin , which means there are absolutely no barriers to you downloading it and playing around to see if it fits your eCommerce needs . Out of the box , its very functional and will probably be able to handle the needs of small stores with minimal additions . However , for stores that are going to require more features other than basic shopping and product pages and checkout , you 'll need to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme . Since WooThemes owns WooCommerce , you should take a look at their themes , which range from free to $100 , to ensure compatibility with all WooCommerce features . Some other WordPress theme sites , such as Theme Forest , also make WooCommerce compatible themes . Prices on ThemeForest are usually somewhere from $40 to $60 . However , you 're not guaranteed compatibility with all features or extensions when buying a third party theme ; be prepared to see a couple features or extensions not work perfectly with your site . <p> Same goes for premium extensions . Your best bet is to get them from the WooCommerce Store to ensure maximum compatibility , future-proofing , and in-house support . You 'll end up needing basic things like payment gateways , CSV product/customer importers , or the importers available for WPEC or Jigoshop . However , official extensions get be pricey ( depending on how many you 're using ) . Prices range from $29 to $199 for single site licenses , which include updates and support for 1 year . Renewal prices for support and updates are about 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , such as Code Canyon , offer third party WooCommerce extensions from $5 to $31 . Quality is varied ; there are some gems ( few and far between in my experience ) , but typical quality is worse than official WooCommerce extensions ( sometimes to the point where its a waste ) . Developers are not required to provide support or updates for Code Canyon plugins , so its really a hit or miss market . <h> Cost summary : <p> Free core plugin ( thumbs up ! ) , but up to $100 for a good theme , plus an estimated $600 in basic extensions , and another 50% annually ( about $300 ) for updates/support . Its a premium product , but its actually a competitive monthly price ( our estimate breaks down to $50 per month for the first year , $25 per month after that ) . Obviously , the extent of customization you need will dictate your price . <p> One of the strongest selling points for WooCommerce is the ease of installation and use . WooCommerce is not a hosted shopping cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means you 'll have to download it and install into your WordPress dashboard , and you 'll be responsible for PCI compliance . Once the plugin has been installed , you 'll be able to go through some basic settings : <p> Backend : Admin Settings <p> You can configure user options such as the ability to checkout as a guest , as well as some management options , like forcing a secure checkout . However , some of the best setup options in WooCommerce are the tax options . With WooCommerce , you can allow local taxes based on postcodes , or set standard and reduced tax rates manually . You can also apply tax based on your store location or the customers shipping address . <p> Backend : Tax Settings <h> Products <p> Products are really easy to add and update as well . New products are created as WordPress custom post types , so you have an individual product page with a short and extended description , as well as some tabs for product information . You can add simple , configurable/variable , downloadable , virtual , affiliate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for to stores of almost any type , and is great for stores that have a variety of products theyd like to list . <h> Shortcodes <p> You can also add individual products or groups of products to other pages or posts ( or anywhere you can use shortcodes on your site sidebar widget for best sellers , anyone ? ) . From the visual page/post editor , just click the " Woo " button for some help and to get ideas on what attributes are accepted . For an example , here 's me adding an individual product by SKU and some newly added products to a page : <p> Backend : Using shortcodes to add products to other pages / posts <p> Heres what it looks like for the customer : <p> Frontend : Products displayed using shortcodes <h> Variable Products <p> Adding variable products takes a little bit more effort , but was easy enough to figure out with a little bit of tinkering . First , you have to add the " attribute " that will be variable ( such as size or color ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Backend : Creating Variable Product Attributes <p> Once you 've added the attributes you need to add , you can then edit the variations of that attribute , such as changing price ( maybe you want to charge more for a 2XL shirt or a different color ) and quantity in stock to display on the front-end : <p> Backend : Adding Product Variations <p> Aaaanndheres the finished product : <p> Frontend : Displaying Product Variations <p> There are some useful default options for product display , such as a short and extended description , as well as some stock tabs for other product information ( dimensions , weight , etc ) . Related products can also be displayed based on linked products , category , or tags . WooCommerce also includes cross-sells and upsells for products in the core plugin . However , many aspects of the product page , such as product information or pricing , can be altered with extensions to display products in any way you could need . Some favorites are : <p> WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing : creates bulk discounts and product discounts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really difficult functionality to find ! I do n't  think any other platform we reviewed supports this much pricing customization . <p> WooCommerce uses a one-page checkout process , which is geared towards improving sales conversions more steps means more opportunities for customers to abandon your checkout . How important is simplifying checkout ? So important that Amazon patented the one-click checkout , which is worth billions . Browsing your product catalog is also simple , and all product information is displayed prominently for customers . The shopping interface is intuitive and easy to figure out so customers do n't  get frustrated while browsing and leave your site . <p> Basic product information is always displayed , and if you 're selling a physical product , a stock " Additional Information " product tab can also be displayed with dimensions , weight , and customized attributes . <p> Customer Experience : General Product Page <p> " Add to Cart " buttons are prominently displayed as a call to action , and you have the option of sending customers right to the cart page after they 've added an item to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a click away , and is as simple as possible for the customer to complete . Overall , the customer experience is straight-forward , and works just as you 'd expect it to . <p> Customer Experience : Cart Page <p> Want to be able to make more changes to the customer experience ? Try the freeWooCommerce Customizer plugin , which allows you to change the number of products per row , button text , and more . <p> WooCommerce offers good stock shipping options , and of course , there are plenty of shipping extensions to add other options . Stock payments options are okay , but you 'll probably need a payment gateway if you 're planning on selling more than a few items a day ( my personal favorite is Stripe ) . <h> Payment Options <p> Out of the box , WooCommerce can accept Bank payments , PayPal Standard ( which can be used in over 190 countries and takes customers directly to PayPal for purchases ) , Checks , Cash on pickup/delivery , or Mijireh for credit cards ( which is a bit expensive per transaction ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available from popular processors , such as Braintree , Stripe , First Data , and Authorize.net . <p> Backend : Standard Payment Options Settings <h> Shipping Options <p> WooCommerce offers several stock shipping options ( more than most other platforms ) . Flat rate and free shipping are available as stock options , but the addition of international flat rate shipping , local delivery , and local pickup provide shipping solutions that many stores will need . Flat rate shipping can be set up by country , and additional costs , shipping classes , and handling fees can be customized . However , you may want an integration with a shipping service , or something like the WooCommerce Table Rate Shipping Extension , which can provide shipping zones within a country to calculate costs more precisely ( among many other cool features ) . <p> One of the areas that WooCommerce can really blow the competition away on is reporting . It has easy-to-read , detailed graphs for sales , top sellers , and more in the dashboard . Graphs are beautiful and provide good insight into your sales metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great for small business that do n't  integrate with a larger accounting service so that stores can keep track of , and gain insight into , sales data . <p> Backend : Built-in Sales Reporting <p> You can also get insight into product sales , such as information on top sellers or worst sellers : <p> Backend : Product Sales Report ( very pretty , we might add ! ) <p> A really helpful reporting extension is the WooCommerce Cost of Goods extension , which gives you insight into costs and profit in addition to revenue . This can also show you data for your most profitable sellers , which could be helpful to determine advertising focus on high-margin goods . <h> Inventory <p> WooCommerce provides inventory management options , which can be activated from the product page . Low and Out-of-stock items can be viewed from the " Reporting " tab . Backorders are allowable with WooCommerce ( rare for most platforms ) , which can be helpful for merchants who keep small stock volumes on hand . Backorders can be allowed for a specific product by changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature as well in your stock management options under " Product Data " . You can also enable alerts for low inventory , and provide stock information to customers . <p> WooThemes offers pretty high-quality support for their themes and extensions . They will work with you to make sure that your issue gets resolved , and have an 88% satisfaction rating on all tickets . However , they are n't  always timely about it . Their recent stats showed that only 68% of support tickets receive responses within 24 hours ( which is up 14% from the previous month ) , and the average first response time is 24.50 hours ( down from the previous months 33.4 hours ) . Support has been an area causing growing pains for WooThemes , as it seems they have insufficient support staff , but the fact that they 're up-front with support statistics and share them openly is a good sign for the future . Since WooThemes has publicly committed to improving support , hopefully new statistics will show further decreased wait times , but some patience will be required in the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make displaying your products easy and professional , such as a price filter , featured products widget , and more . This could be useful for widgetized homepages ( especially if you 're not using a WooCommerce-specific theme ) or to help customers navigate large catalogs easily . <p> Built-in WooCommerce widgets <p> Although this is not a built-in option , WooCommerce does allow for recurring purchases or subscriptions with the very flexible WooCommerce Subscriptions Extension . Set up is very easy , and this extension is constantly updated . This functionality has tons of potential uses , and helps widen the circle of potential businesses that can easily use WooCommerce to meet all of their needs . <p> Currently , WooCommerce has over 1.3 million downloads and a four-star rating on WordPress.org , a volume which is second only to the WP e-Commerce Plugin . However , WooCommerce is just shy of two years old , while WPEC has been around for almost 8 years . The fact that WooThemes also builds beautiful official themes with guaranteed WooCommerce compatibility is a plus in my book . <p> WooCommerce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of online business models . In addition , WooCommerce 2.1 is expected to drop by the end of this year , which could possibly include an API to integrate with external systems along with some other requested functionality . Current pros include the flexible tax and stock shipping options , awesome reporting , and an incredible number of opportunities to extend its functionality . We think people love the intuitive admin and customer interfaces , which are both easy-to-use and look great , as well as the ability to add just about any kind of product or functionality . Some cons are sluggish support , and recurring annual billing for updates and support ( which is by no means unreasonable , just different from some platforms and something to be aware of ) . Pricing is slightly higher than some options , but value is still high even at current prices and quality should factor into that equation . Overall , WooCommerce is a great general eCommerce solution that supports many types of businesses right out of the box , and we expect it to be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions and owns some ( but not all ) of the extensions referenced in the article . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Thanks so much ! I agree that what started as a good product has just gotten better , and the growth indicates that it can be a large competitor ( maybe even before 3.0 is developed ) . Currently , WooCommerce powers 5.6% of the top million eCommerce sites , while Magento is used on 13% ( see this : http : **27;2246;TOOLONG ) . Not bad for two years , and its closing the gap . Ill be curious to see if growth can be sustained at the current rate . <p> Just doing some research for a potential client into WooCommmerce ( which Ive used once before , and like because of its WordPress connection ) . Just wanted to say this is easily one of the best blog posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbiased , useful . Just great . <p> Great series of articles here . My company is about to start building online shops , and have been looking hard at WooCommerce . BUt it seems to be very poorly documented , from a theme builders point of view . What 's your experience with that side of WooCommerce ? <p> Hi Drew , thanks for your comment ! I think WooCommerce is a bit more complicated than other platforms to learn at first from a theming standpoint , but you do gain a lot of flexibility once you 've learned what hook / filter does what . This is something we plan to cover at some point , as I do think more resources would be helpful since it does take a time-investment to learn . Downloading some of the free WooThemes themes with WooCommerce compatibility has proven useful in the past and a great way to learn about WooCommerce actions . 
@@98138293 @2338293/ <h> Getting Help with Your eCommerce Site <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> You 're a store administrator or a business owner . You know how to use WordPress you 're most likely considered a power user . You may have tested a few eCommerce platforms ( or you 've just read our reviews = ) , and your online business runs smoothly . <p> But maybe it could run more smoothly . Maybe you need a new design , you 're ready for a customized theme , or you know that a customized plugin will make your workflow far more streamlined . But the problem is that you 're not sure where to turn or what youre looking for , and you do n't  want to dive into this project yourself . I get contact requests like this frequently , as site administrators simply are n't  sure what to look for or what questions to ask . If this is you , I 've tried to put together this guide to help you narrow down what you 're looking for , as well as give you some recommendations on how to customize your eCommerce site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some appropriate expectations : WordPress is free . Lots of awesome plugins are free . Sometimes good advice is free ( like this advice on finding WordPress help ) . Peoples time is not free . Support typically includes fixes , general questions , and help with basic issues I do n't  know of any plugin or theme that includes individual customizations in the purchase price or as part of support . Sometimes they may help you with tweaks or snippets , but this is usually above typical support . Customizing your site is not going to be free . <p> Second , the functionality you want probably does n't  work for most users , even if you think its essential . You can request that the developer add it , but there 's a good chance theyll say no . Carrie Dils wrote a great post on add-ons and customizations and costs associated with them people assume that since plugins or premium themes are cheap that the work on them is cheap . However , you 're not paying for a general , easily marketable product now you 're paying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already builds on a $49 plugin , so its going to cost more . Maybe even a lot more . Be aware of this when planning . <h> What To Do <p> This is where having a spec and a budget comes into play . One thing Ive found is that many people reach out for quotes , but they do n't  have a budget because they know nothing about the work involved or how much it should cost . <p> What I recommend instead is submit a short but explicit list of requirements with a needed turnaround time and ask for an estimate . Five page proposals are not short one or two pages of requirements is optimal to clarify what you need the plugin or theme to do , and what you 'll expect from a freelancer or agency . Be as clear as possible on all needed functionality . Provide when you 'd like this completed , and when the absolute deadline is , then ask for a quote from 2-3 freelancers to get an idea of cost . I 'd also ask for testimonials if they do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more functionality or you forgot something , your estimate is going to be adjusted . This is called " scope creep " and most developers will ask you for this list to ensure they do n't  end up doing a lot of work they did n't  include in an estimate . Many developers will also ask for your budget if you do n't  indicate it before providing a quote . Be honest and say you 're not sure what the work will cost , and get quotes from a few sources to determine an appropriate cost . <p> If you do have a budget and a good idea of cost , then tell the developer what you can spend . A good developer will tell you if they can deliver , if your budget is more than needed , or if you 'll have to cut details from the project scope . You 're going to start off on the wrong foot by saying your budget is something like , " As little as possible ! Ha ha ha . " Youre check on the budget / price will be getting multiple quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs Freelancers <p> You 'll also need to determine whether to go with an agency / company or a freelancer there are tradeoffs to each . Agencies will typically be more expensive , but there are benefits to working with one . First , you sometimes have to manage a relationship with a freelancer and check in on work ( though good ones should be doing this and keeping in contact tell them you expect updates weekly , etc ) . Agencies typically manage customer relationships with more hand-holding . <p> Another benefit to using an agency is that you 're not depending on one person . What if your freelancer gets the flu for a week , but you needed the work now ? Agencies typically have a few people that can complete a project , so you wont be set back by this . <p> Freelancers will usually be less expensive and can typically provide the same level of quality that youd get from an agency . You may also develop a more personal relationship with your freelancer than you would with a company . <p> I do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of consideration based on your needs , preferences , and budget . <h> What am I looking for ? <p> So what kind of person or company are you looking for ? What 's this frontend / backend developer nonsense ? All great questions some store admins are n't  sure what they need , so they 're not sure what to look for or how to ask for it . <h> Custom Themes <p> You 're looking for a frontend developer if you 're going this route . Some people offer just design services and will provide you with a PSD of a design . In my experience , this is a pain to deal with , as you then have to find someone to slice that design up and turn it into usable code . Some designers also do n't  understand the way websites work , so they do n't  always consider what 's possible or easy to do using WordPress when they design a template . You could end up spending a hefty chunk of change to convert a custom design . <p> Instead , I 'd recommend finding a developer that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then designing on top of that framework . This is probably going to be more cost effective , and a good frontend developer will still ensure that your site looks great more importantly , it will function the way its supposed to , which is n't always a designers first consideration . <p> While you may not understand what 's possible using different themes , your developer can explain to you how frameworks or simple themes ( such as the Genesis Framework or the Canvas theme ) can be adapted to your design needs . Your child theme can look entirely customized and different from a framework or parent theme think of them more as the steel beams and concrete to your skyscraper . They provide structure and a starting point . <p> This is one instance where I 'd be very upfront about my budget you may not know how much a great website will cost , but I guarantee you the ones you love cost more than you think . Chris Lema has some great advice on this here , and I 'm a fan of this approach : ask your developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy , 100% of your budget , and 150% of your budget . This way you can get an idea of what 's possible and a rough idea of what different site components cost . <p> Do n't  have a budget for a custom theme ? Get one , or at least have an ideal price point in mind . <h> Theme Changes <p> If you 're looking for changes or tweaks to an existing theme , you 're probably still wanting a frontend developer . However , design may not be as important here since you 're only changing a theme and not building from the ground up , so most PHP / WordPress developers will be able to get this work done . You 'll also typically save money by using a theme as a starting point . <p> The quality of your theme is going to influence how easy it is to change , so be aware of this . I 've seen themes with no filters / hooks built around components that should be easy to tweak , so you may have to buy a new theme . Paying for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes is a worthwhile investment if you know you might be tweaking or changing things . <p> Here are some authors who make quality themes that are easy to customize : <p> That list is by no means comprehensive , but that 's a good place to start . <h> Themes and eCommerce <p> Before we talk about plugins , there 's one thing to which you should pay attention . Ask your frontend developer if they 've worked with your eCommerce platform and if they can show you work samples . Some plugins , such as WooCommerce , can be difficult to theme correctly , and you 'll want to be sure that your site blends in with the rest of your theme . Take these two examples : <p> Using Default WooCommerce Styles <p> Styling WooCommerce Components <p> The first uses default WooCommerce styling in the theme , and it does n't  look at all like the rest of the site . When a shop looks different from the site , people notice and the shop looks less legitimate . The second theme hooks into WooCommerce to use its own styles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about this when we listed good free WooCommerce themes . <h> Custom Plugins <p> This is another case where I 'd provide a spec and ask for a few quotes . Be brief but explicit when describing what the plugin should do . Almost any kind of functionality is possible , but costs will change in proportion to how difficult it is to implement . Ask for work samples and see if the developer has other plugins that you can test . Check to see if their plugins are easy to use and bug-free ( or if you find bugs , see how fast they 're fixed ) . <p> Finding someone to build a custom plugin can be a difficult process , but work samples and other plugins can help you determine what the developer is capable of . <h> Plugin Tweaks or Changes <p> Finding an existing plugin to customize can be more cost-effective than building a customized plugin as you 'll have an existing codebase to work from . You should ensure that you get a companion plugin that will be upgrade-safe if possible rather than simply forking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent plugin and modify existing functionality so that the parent plugin can be updated , but the custom plugin will still continue to work . If no hooks or filters exist where you need them , ask the original author to add one . <h> Recommendations <p> If you 're not sure where to find freelancers , you can check out a couple of directories and apply the criteria and strategies we 've discussed . I 've had success using Elance and oDesk , but I 've also found some people poor to work with from these talent pools . Envato Studio ( formerly Microlancer ) has been promising , but I do n't  have as much experience with this . Codeable is also a solid choice for WordPress tasks . <p> I 'd treat this the same way as I 'd treat hiring make sure you 're explicit and include directions that the candidates should follow ( i.e. , send your favorite quote or meme ) so you can be sure that you have someone that reads directions and pays attention to detail , and not someone who simply applies to every job . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can request customizations or custom themes / plugins from their team for pretty much any theme or platform . We 've also got a follow-up post on another agency that works with several WordPress plugins and themes . <p> Note that I may not have worked directly with everyone on the list that follows . However , if I 'm including them , its because they 've been recommended to me with positive feedback by several other parties . <p> Looking for WooCommerce support ? Arts Digital helped add WooCommerce support to a theme for me recently . Red Giant Design also creates WooCommerce themes ( they did a case study on WooThemess blog not long ago ) . WerkPress does theme customizations that include WooCommerce as well . <h> Plugin recommendations <p> Here are some recommendations specific to each eCommerce plugin . A few of these developers work with a couple different eCommerce plugins , so it never hurts to ask them about what theyve done . <h> Shopp <h> Jigoshop <p> We already mentioned Chris Christoff to help with Jigoshop customizations , but you may want to check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also works with WooCommerce ) . <h> WP eCommerce Plugin <p> Customizing WPeC ? Go with Lee , Curtis , or Justin Sainton , who is one of the lead developers . Justin has also contributed to several eCommerce plugins and can work with them all ( such as EDD and WooCommerce ) . There 's a list of WPeC consultants you can check out as well . <p> Did I miss freelancers or agencies that you 've enjoyed working with ? I 'd love more recommendations to add to this guide share em below ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138294 @2338294/ <h> iThemes Exchange Pro Pack Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> We 've already reviewed Exchange , which is the easy-to-use eCommerce plugin offered by iThemes ( and told you how to use it for a membership site ) , but there 's been a ton of new development for the platform . As a result , we wanted to revisit the plugin and do a new iThemes Exchange review , but time with a twist . <p> In this review , well take a look at what you can do with Exchange , as well as the Exchange Pro Pack , in order to give you a complete view of what you can do with your Exchange-powered eCommerce site . <h> Core Exchange Capabilities <p> Let 's start with some of our favorite things about the core Exchange plugin as well as some of the downsides , then well expand to some of our favorite add-ons in the Exchange Pro Pack . <h> Upsides <p> First of all , I like the simplicity of setting up an eCommerce site with Exchange . If you 're a developer looking for an easy-to-use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should consider . Setting up a shop and managing products has a very small learning curve in comparison to some other plugins . There are also lots of basic features that can be enabled on an as-needed basis so that shop managers do n't  have lots of options available that they do n't  need . They can also duplicate products to make product addition easier ( if enabled ) . <p> The frontend will look good even with out an Exchange theme , and the Exchange superwidget does some pretty cool stuff . If you have n't assigned it to a widget area , it will simply be displayed on your product pages : <p> If you have assigned it to a widget area , then it will display it that area , and the content will adjust based on which page is viewed . For example , most times it will display a shopping cart . However , it will display " Buy Now " and " Add to Cart " buttons on product pages , but will also allow for a complete AJAX cart and checkout process so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase . <p> Superwidget Checkout <p> Simple shipping is included , as you can set up per-product flat rate shipping ( the cost can be overridden for products as needed ) . Free shipping can also be offered , but will default to " enabled " for products rather than off . Be aware of this if you do n't  want to offer it for most products it will have to be overridden as needed . Support for multiple shipping options is also included if " free shipping " for some products is enabled but not others . <p> Support for simple , downloadable , and physical products is included in the core plugin . Downloadable products have some handy options , such as the ability to set a download expiration time as well as the ability to limit the number of downloads for a product . <p> Regardless of product type , you can also add purchase messages to provide more information at purchase , as well as set product availability dates in case products are available on a limited basis ( such as courses ) . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entered or randomly generated and offer a few simple options : <p> Discounts can be for a flat amount or percentage . <p> Start and end dates can be set . <p> You can limit the number of coupon uses ( overall ) . <p> You can limit the coupon to one product . <p> You can set a usage limit use per customer ( maximum of once per year ) . <p> Coupons can not be limited to more than one product , so there 's no way to create a coupon that applies to a group of products or a category . <p> Finally , there are a few payment options available with the core plugin or as free add-ons . Shop managers can use offline payments ( such as cash or check ) , PayPal Standard , and Stripe ( no SSL certificate required uses the Stripe pop up ) . As Stripe is our favorite processor , this is a huge bonus for us . <h> Downsides <p> With the simplicity of Exchanges comes the sacrifice of some features and the ability to scale well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no way to bulk edit pricing ( for example , to adjust all prices by a percentage ) , add sale prices , or adjust inventory . <p> This is also a problem for order management , which needs improvement . There 's no way to bulk update orders statuses ( moving orders from " pending " to " paid " ) , and there 's no status for a completed or shipped order , which will make it difficult to know what 's waiting to be shipped or what 's already been shipped as you get more orders . There 's also no way to set a status as cancelled or refunded for orders paid for using external methods ( like Stripe ) , which creates a need for very good external accounting and makes payment management within the plugin far less useful . <p> Shipping also needs to grow with your store , which does n't  happen currently . Flat rate shipping is set per product rather than on a per-order basis , which is not an issue for shops that only sell a few items , but can be problematic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mixing free and paid shipping also creates a slight inconvenience , as shop customers must select multiple shipping methods ( which introduces a point of friction ) , then select free shipping manually if a paid option is also offered . For example , if you offer free and expedited shipping , the customer must select which theyd like instead of defaulting to the cheapest option and allowing customers to change shipping methods from there . A shipping plugin that works on a per-order basis can help to solve some of these issues ( there are none available yet ) . <p> The last cons I see have to do with the customer experience ( aside from shipping ) . There are no " Add to Cart " buttons from the store page , which requires customers to click through to the product page rather than be able to add items to the cart as they view all items . <p> No " Add to Cart " <p> There 's no way to enter a coupon at checkout , and customers can only do this from the cart page or using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cart Page has coupon field <p> Checkout no coupon field <p> There also some other small downsides , but these are covered by what you can do with the Exchange Pro Pack . <h> iThemes Exchange Pro Pack Add-ons <p> Okay , now that we 've gone through a bit of what you can do with the core plugin , let 's take a look at some of my favorite add-ons from the Exchange Pro Pack , which will allow you to add more capabilities to your store . <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Product Variants <p> This is hands-down my favorite add-on for Exchange . I really disliked that you could n't do variable products with the core plugin , but I 'm really happy with the way this add-on works . <p> When you enable this add-on , you 'll see some new menu options under the Product Advanced settings . You can add variants and display them using a dropdown , radio buttons , swatches ( color ) , or images ( thumbnails ) . You can mix and match these variant groups to create all of the options needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , you can set the variant title ( e.g. , color or size ) , but you 'll need to delete the default options as you cant override the names . <p> You can also manage inventory based on variant , change price based on which variant is selected ( which I found really easy ) , and also create groups of images for a variant . You can determine which variants will display which groups of images to change the photos based on what a customer selects . <p> This resulted in a really smooth process for variant addition , and a smooth experience for customers . Scroll through the gallery to see examples of variant addition and options : <p> Add Variant Type <p> Add Options <p> Add Variant Image Groups <p> Manage Variant Inventory <p> Add Price Changes <p> Frontend : Product Page <p> The only issue I experienced was with the swatches , as it could sometimes be a bit janky to use but I 've always been able to set the colors I wanted for each swatch . The images swatches work the same way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack : Customer Pricing <p> This add-on let 's customers choose what to pay for products . You can create pricing options for customers to select , or allow them to enter the price they wish to pay . You can even optionally set minimum and maximim prices : <p> Setup Customer Pricing <p> How it looks <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Custom URL Tracking <p> This add-on let 's you create and track up to 3 custom URLs for products . This can be handy for tracking ads or promotions without using a redirect plugin . You can set custom URLs for the product , which will display the product page , and track views to that URL ( these can be in addition to the products permalink URL ) . <p> You can also choose to redirect your custom links to the permalink instead of desired . This will be helpful so that your custom links are less likely to be used or shared on other sites , as this way people will be redirected to the permalink and more likely to share that . <h> Exchange Pro Pack : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video to your product pages that will be displayed before any details , such a images or pricing . Accepted sources are YouTube , Vimeo , Viddler , and Flickr . While this is a cool perk , you could also embed videos via shortcode if you 're using Jetpack or a video embed plugin ( or using an iframe ) , though they wont be featured at the top of your product page . I liked that it was part of the Pro Pack , but its not something I would have purchased separately . <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Invoices <p> The Invoices add-on allows you to create Invoice-type products , then send these products to customers via email to collect payment ( customers will have a unique URL to click to view the invoice ) . You can select existing customers or create new clients to invoice . These products will not show up in your store . Youll be able to leverage your current payment options and keep track of payments right in Exchange . <p> Creating Invoices <p> Viewing Invoices <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new or existing customer . While viewing payments , you 'll be able to click " Add New " to create a new order . You 'll also be able to create an order while viewing purchase details for an existing customer : <p> Before <p> After <p> These new orders will simply be labeled " manual payment " as the payment method and will automatically be marked as " Paid " . One downside to using this is that product variants are not supported , so you 'll only be able to add a manual order for a parent product , not one of the variations of that product . <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Modify Default Redirects <p> This add-on is pretty nifty for those of you that want to customize " Welcome " pages for your users . You can determine where users should be sent when registering or logging it choose from the default location , WordPress pages or posts , or other Exchange pages . This could be a great way to reward customers for registering at checkout send them to a Welcome page with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack : Membership bbPress <p> This add-on let 's you do some pretty cool things with your membership site . You 'll need to have the Membership add-on enabled and have bbPress installed on your site to use this . <p> bbPress let 's you create forums on your site , and this add-ons let 's you to tie forums to membership purchases . You can restrict forums , topics , and replies to certain membership levels so that users have to purchase a membership before they can view forums . When you create a membership , you can add forums to the access rules to only allow those members to view a forum , or you can select the appropriate levels that should have access as you edit or create forums . <p> This is super useful for sites that want to create a " club " or discussion area , but only allow members to access these areas and restrict others from viewing them . <h> Exchange Pro Pack : Other <p> There are some other add-ons in the Exchange Pro Pack that we have n't covered here .

You 'll also have access to several other tools with the Pro Pack for a relatively low price . <p> With that said , Easy Digital Downloads is a more robust platform , and EDD has more detailed order management capabilities ( as well as reporting ) , which you may need with that many orders . There are also more integrations and extensions available if you find that you need more functionality , such as a PDF stamping extension . The marketplace around Exchange is still very young , so there are n't  as many add-ons available if you find you need something else . <p> I 'd also consider Gumroad if you have n't look at it yet Ive written a detailed comparison to EDD , and it can be a good option for WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hey Amanda , I did notice that the mini cart replaces the " add to cart " buttons if a variant is already in the cart ( meaning you cant purchase another variant at the same time ) after I wrote up this review , and have seen that this is a requested feature . I 'd recommend adding a vote for it here . 11393 @qwx871393

@@98138302 @2338302/ <h> Growing WordPress eCommerce : Interview with Justin Sainton <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Editors Note : This post was written based on an interview with Justin Sainton . <p> Justin is the founder of Zao , a WordPress Agency , and Lead Developer of the WP eCommerce Plugin , which was the first eCommerce solution for WordPress . He s also a WordPress core contributor , proud husband and father , and founder of BeachPress . <p> Beka : Thanks so much for chatting with us ! Let 's start with the WP eCommerce plugin . As the lead developer for WPeC , can you give us an overview of what you do ? <p> Justin : Yeah , absolutely ! So for WP eCommerce , my role can be split in three main areas : Development , Strategy , and Community . First and foremost , I am a developer . I 'm in my element when I am crafting APIs , solving interesting backwards compatibility issues or paying off technical debt in our codebase . I 'm lucky enough to work closely with dozens of other incredibly talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beyond that , I spend a lot of time thinking about the eCommerce landscape in general . Not just within the WordPress ecosystem , but as an entire industry and way of transacting in general . Keeping my mind on the big picture helps me shape a better vision of where I 'd like to see us end up within that overall picture . <p> Finally community is what most people find so attractive about open-source software . I run an event called BeachPress this year , well have 30 developers from all across the continent in a beach house for a week . Our only common bond is WordPress . Its going to be a smashing success because we all have found something of a community within WordPress that we place an incredibly high value on . Within the context of WP eCommerce , I do my best to ensure that we have a thriving , welcoming community of customers , developers and contributors . <p> When should WPeC be the top choice as an eCommerce plugin ? What kind of stores is it best for ? <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around since 2006 ( Back when WordPress was still in diapers ! ) , so Ive seen literally every kind of store you can imagine using WP eCommerce . From stores that sell subscriptions to razors for men to stores that sell digital icons for designers to your standard brick and morter T-Shirt stores and everything in between . Weve seen stores that only ever do a few hundred dollars per month in revenue to stores that do millions of dollars per year and tens of thousands of orders . So the sky really is the limit . <p> That said I 've really enjoyed a personal and professional friendship with Pippin Williamson of Easy Digital Downloads . Whenever I find a client that is looking to do only digital its fair to say that WP eCommerce is a bit more than is needed . EDD does a phenomenal job for that . <p> WPeC has been around longer than custom post types and other WordPress features that make it easier to create an eCommerce plugin . What challenges have you faced in keeping the plugin updated and on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I mentioned earlier , WP eCommerce has been around since 2006 . If I recall correctly , it was probably first released around WordPress 1.5 . I 'm not sure if anyone really remembers what that looked like , let alone what it was like to build a plugin for WordPress in those days needless to say , the effort was herculean . <p> Back when I first got involved in the project , it was roughly the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010 . At the time , we were pretty much the only platform doing a solid job of a general eCommerce plugin for WordPress . One of my very first initiatives in the project was to be a part of the efforts of moving from custom architecture for everything ( at the time , I believe we had 31 custom tables ) to utilizing custom post types and taxonomies for everything . I believe by the time we were done , we had nearly complete backwards compatibility and had cut the custom tables created down to less than half of what it was previously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To speak to the challenge of it the most significant challenge for us has been backwards compatibility . We would consider our firm commitment to backwards compatibility to be one of our distinctives as a project . We will never intentionally break backwards compatibility . That does n't  mean it has never happened but never intentionally = . The commitment to backwards compatibility requires some less than desirable approaches to some edge cases , but for us , its worth it . Also , our committing developers have more " props " , or code contributions to WordPress , than any other eCommerce project I 'm aware of . What that means for our users is that when WordPress changes or evolves , so do we . <p> Wow , the changes in architecture are massive . I know a lot of developers like to gut their code and start over , which is probably a lot easier , but props to you guys for maintaining compatibility . <p> Aside from the massive changes the plugin has undergone as it has grown , what 's the number-one thing people should know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That its getting better all the time = . Naturally , a plugin that has a history as long as ours has a TON of technical debt . Were paying that down all the time . As of a few releases ago , we had 90,000 lines of code ! Ive been working on it for 4 years now and there are still times where I find code I have n't seen before . I was lucky enough to make a single commit earlier this year that brought us down closer to 70K lines of code or so , which felt great = . <p> But given the legacy we have , there are a number of folks who gave the plugin a try a few years ago and possibly had a less than stellar experience . Through the hard work and diligence of so many contributors , WP eCommerce is a very different plugin ( and a different project ) than it was a few years ago . <p> Great to hear that you guys are addressing some of the performance issues and streamlining the plugin . <p> Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There are several integrations in the core plugin already do you plan on building more features / integrations into the core plugin , or are you going to take the add-on route for new additions ? <p> To piggy-back on the last question , another thing people are n't  often aware of is that WP eCommerce was one of the first commercial plugins that actually did the Freemium or " Add-On " model . If you look at the codebase circa 2007 , you 'll find custom actions and filters scattered throughout from all the way back then . So to speak to this question yes = . <p> I do n't  actually see it as an either/or proposition . We choose to align ourselves as closely as possible with the same philosophies as WordPress . When it comes to adding something to core , it has to be something thatn 80%+ of our users will benefit from . We favor decisions over options while we have a history of TONS of options , were working at paring those away in favor of more strategic decisions that help people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes well absolutely integrate more features into the plugin when it makes sense to and continue releasing add-ons for features that do n't  make sense for core . <p> There are a couple of big releases coming up . Can you tell us what 's on the roadmap ? What are you excited about building ? <p> Yeah , we 've got a minor release and a major release coming up pretty quickly that were really excited about . The minor release , 3.8.14 , introduces a lot of great enhancements and fixes . Weve streamlined a lot of the product editing UI , resolved a ton of edge case shipping issues for external shipping rates , improved our customer meta data architecture and a TON more ! Itll will be quite the effort to even write the change log. = <p> For 3.9 its actually going to be quite the revolutionary release for us . One of the oldest , most frustrating areas of our codebase has been our entire theming process and all the code surrounding it . We 've invested a TON of effort , energy and resources into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were as excited about this as we have been about anything . The entire theme engine has been crafted around the latest research in usability so on a default theme , right out the door , you 'll have one of the most usable eCommerce workflows of any eCommerce site out there . From a development perspective , crafting themes for the new theme engine will be a night and day experience when compared to the current theme engine . There is a load of other stuff going into ( and coming out of ) core for 3.9 so were incredibly excited about what that will all look like . <p> How about Zao what kinds of projects do you specialize in ? <p> Naturally , we do a ton of eCommerce development and consulting . Not just with WP eCommerce , either we 've worked on fantastic projects with nearly every platform ( in the WordPress ecosystem and outside ) . Beyond that , we do some WordPress VIP work , some sub-contracting with different agencies in the WordPress world . Anytime we can solve an interesting problem with WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> What are the most common mistakes designers and developers make when creating an eCommerce site ? <p> That 's a great question ! I would n't consider myself as someone qualified to speak on design of any kind = . That said , most eCommerce designs or themes Ive seen tend to be severely lacking in what I would consider important hallmarks for eCommerce . It should be beautiful and work beautifully . Its as simple as that , but so many miss the mark . <p> As far as developers creating eCommerce sites probably the most common mistake I see is developers not being quite as paranoid about security as they should be . I can not tell you how many times we 've been brought in to audit a project or help finish up a half-completed project and found severe and exploitable vulnerabilities in the code . Security is such an important perspective to be developing from on any project but eCommerce projects up the ante considerably . <p> Any favorite plugins / frameworks you use in your projects ? <p> Aside from WP eCommerce ? = <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many of the projects I work on require custom development . So I cant say I have too many plugins or frameworks that I use on every project . That said , one plugin that has become absolutely indispensible for my plugin development is Query Monitor . Lest the name mislead you , it does far more than monitor slow SQL queries , though it does do that beautifully . Many of your readers who are developers may already use it , but if any are not using it start now ! <p> Thanks so much to Justin for taking the time to talk with us ! Were definitely curious to see the growth of WPeC , as we 've noticed that its gotten better and better . Were excited to see what the 3.9 release brings and will have a review ready for our readers ! 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138303 @2338303/ <h> Exchange Table Rate Shipping Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> If you 've read my iThemes Exchange Pro Pack Review , you know that I love the ease-of-use you get with Exchange , but there are some tradeoffs to using it versus other eCommerce plugins . Order management and import / export functionality does n't  scale as well as other plugins ( yet ) , and shipping was previously an issue for me . <p> However , iThemes has released a beta of Exchange Table Rate Shipping that I 've tried out , which addresses the issues I had with shipping methods in Exchange . I 've written up an overview of the add-on , as I think it makes Exchange a far more viable competitor for shops that sell physical goods . <h> Overview <p> Previously Exchange could only create per-item shipping charges using the " Simple Shipping " add-on . While this works well if your typical order only consists of a couple items or you mostly sell digital goods , it does n't  work well for shops that sell several shippable items , as customers are essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sell physical goods can create several types of shipping rates and promotions to address almost any shipping need . <p> If you have the Exchange Pro Pack , you can download this as well to check it out . If not , you 'll have to wait until its officially released = . In the mean time , you can get an idea for how it works from the documentation as well as this review . <h> Creating Rates <p> So let 's start with what this does n't  do : you do n't  get live rates integrated with a shipping provider . That 's not how Table Rate Shipping works . Instead , you can set up rates based on several criteria and make them effective for a particular shipping zone . <p> When you activate Table Rate Shipping , a default rate will be provided and can not be deleted . This rate will only be used if none of your shipping rules meet the criteria set forth in your rates . For example , if all rates are US-based , this default will be used for international orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . You can edit the fees for this if desired , then move on to creating your new rates . <p> When you create a new rate , you can enable the rate per order , per item , or per line . Per order rates will apply one rate to the order , per item rates will add a fee for every item ordered , and per line rates will only add a rate for each line item ( so ordering higher quantities of an item will not increase shipping ) . Each new rate can have a base cost , per item cost , and handling cost associated with the rate . <p> Each type of rate can also contain associated conditions based on price , weight , number of items , or number of products . You can set minimum and maximum thresholds for each of these conditions to apply . <p> Create a rate <p> I started with a " USA Ground " rate for my orders . I want to charge this only on a per-order basis , so I can set it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what conditions can trigger this ( if any ) . As my shipping costs are based on weight , I usually add a weight condition with a maximum , then add a " heavy " or " freight " rate for orders above this weight maximum . <p> Ground Rate <p> Once I 've created my conditions and pricing , I can then add zones . I only want this to apply to the contiguous US states , so I can create a zone solely used for these states by clicking " Edit Zones " . I can add as many zones as needed . <p> Create US Rate <p> Once I 've saved that rate , I 've successfully completed my first rate addition = . I 'm also going to set a similar rate , but enable it for Alaska and Hawaii only so I can sell to the rest of the US . You can do the same thing , but add new zones for the rate so that you cover both Alaska and Hawaii . <p> Add Zones <p> I continued by setting up several rates to test out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a price condition to create a free shipping promotion for any order over $75 , and applied this only to orders for the contiguous US . <p> Free shipping promo <p> Once you 've created your entire rate schedule , you can view it under Settings &gt; Shipping &gt; Table Rate , and can edit rates or enable / disable them as needed . <p> All Rates <h> Product Overrides <p> By default , these rates will apply to all physical / shippable products in your store . You can set up weight or disable shipping for these products completely while editing a product . <p> Product Shipping Options <p> Here you can also override the available rates if needed . This can be great if you want to exclude certain items from a shipping promotion , or you do n't  want to ship those items internationally . <p> Override Shipping Methods <h> Customer Experience <p> When a customer goes through your checkout process , theyll submit their address and receive all available rates . If there are no table rate methods that apply to their location , the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then that rate will be forced for the order . For example , my " Alaska / Hawaii " rate is forced for any customer with an address in Alasak or Hawaii : <p> One method available <p> If customers meet criteria for a rate , it will be shown within the shipping dropdown . For example , customers that meet my $75 threshold for free shipping will be able to select this for their orders : <p> Free Shipping Activated <p> If you 've overridden some settings on a per-product level , more than one shipping method may be required . For example , if you 've disabled free shipping for some products , customers will need to select an alternative method for the product . Exchange takes care of this for you by using a multiple methods selection . When customers are forced to choose multiple shipping methods , theyll be able to select the method for each product . <p> Use Multiple Methods <p> I also really liked the ability to drill zones down to the postcode level . This is super-useful if you over local pickup or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they have an eligible zip or postal code . <p> Local Pickup <p> The customer-facing side of the plugin is just as easy to use as the rate setup , as customers will only see eligible rates , and will be guided in rate selection if multiple rates are required . <h> Managing Orders <p> Administrators will be able to view the selected shipping methods when they view an order to fulfill it . However , these will not be shown on the " Payments " screen : <p> Payments Screen <p> Instead , shop employees will have to view the order , then will see which shipping method has been selected for each shippable item in the order . <p> Shipping in Order <h> Pros and Cons <p> I liked that Exchange Table Rate Shipping is easy to set up , and rules creation is simple for the shop admin to understand , yet flexible enough to meet most needs . You can enable and disable rates so that you have a complete schedule of typical rates and promotions to run as needed . <p> The rate conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on your shop needs ; the ability to use a combination of price , weight , or item / product counts allows you to have standard rates and promotions while still protecting against edge cases ( like orders that end up weighing 30 pounds that you need to ship ) . <p> As for cons , I would have loved to see a way to enable shipping instructions when particular rates are available . This would be really helpful when rates like " Local Pickup " or similar are available so that customers know if they should select this rate and what 's required . <p> There 's also no quick way to view shipping from the " Payments " screen , which would be helpful if you offer something like " expedited " shipping so you know the order needs to go out now and can prioritize it first . Finally , the ability to set multiple conditions for a rate could provide a pretty advanced usage ( i.e. , a rate if available if a price is met and the weight is low ) . <h> Summary <p> Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It vastly expands what Exchange shops that sell physical products can do in terms of shipping , and provides several shipping types and conditions to work with . While I did list some cons above , the plugin is brand new and will need time to mature and see which features are needed by the user base no version 1 will include everything that the plugin could possibly do . <p> If you 're using Exchange to sell shippable products , this is a must-have for your store . I recommend checking it out as part of the Exchange Pro Pack so you can try out the beta version , or snapping it up at the official release . It will be part of the Exchange Pro Pack , so you can even get it for 40% off during December with the HOLIDAYS40 coupon code ! 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138304 @2338304/ <h> Optimized Social Media : WPSSO Plugin Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <h> Why Social Media ? <p> We 've got a WPSSO plugin review ( WordPress Social Sharing Optimization ) lined up for you today , which is a really nifty social sharing tool . However , before we go into some detail about the plugin and what it does , I 'd like to take a step back and talk about why social media is important to your marketing efforts ( which well be discussing in depth in a later post ) . <p> First , I 'd like to tell you a story . Ever heard of Willie Sutton ? Probably not . Anyway , Willies one of the most prolific criminals of the past century ( he puts John Dillinger to shame ) , and stole more than $2 million from banks throughout the early to mid 1900s ( and escaped prison a few times ) . Willie was once asked why he robbed banks , to which he replied , " Because that 's where the money is . " <p> So if you were to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How do you drive revenue ? " People buy things and guess what ? To market effectively , we need to go where the people are and interact with our customers ( which is also why email marketing works well ) . That 's where social media marketing comes into play , and how its become one of the most powerful forms of marketing available ( here 's a study on conversion rates for likes , shares , pins , etc if you want stats ) . <p> There are a lot of awesome social sharing tools already ( Buffer is one my favorites ) that help you share content , but do n't  change the content itself or structure of what you 're sharing . That 's where plugins like WPSSO come in WPSSO makes sure that your content is optimized for sharing on any platform so that not only do you interact with customers , but you and your fans share content in the most effective way by including images , product information , and more . <p> When shared content includes media ( which WPSSO helps to do ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images ) , and can increase CTR and conversions for your eCommerce store . <h> WPSSO Plugin Review TOC <h> WPSSO Overview <p> WPSSO is designed to optimize your social sharing , and offers both free and paid versions . Both versions will add relevant information to the &lt;head&gt; part of your site that social media networks can reference to optimize the display of your shared content . If you 're familiar with the way Facebook does this , then youve probably heard of Open Graph meta tags WPSSO adds these to your site ( and more ) to make sure each network has the information it needs to display your content ( KISSmetrics has a good explanation of what Open Graph tags are used for if you want to read more ) . <p> For example , let 's say you spend a lot of time interacting with customers on Twitter did you know that you can make your tweets far more effective for sharing and selling ? Twitter cards allow you to add media information to your tweets , such as larger images , summaries , and product information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some tweets , this is what they 're doing . As a store admin , this can allow you to add product images , information , and pricing when tweeting about your products , so that customers can begin thinking about purchases before they even hit your site and improve your usage of social media for conversions , not just communication . <p> This is what WPSSO offers optimized social sharing . Not only can you optimize your content for sharing on Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , and other social networks , but it also adds information that helps for Google search results ( by adding Google / SEO description meta tag if no SEO plugin is present ) . Yes , SEO plugins can add some of the information that social networks need , but WPSSO is designed to either provide or augment your current SEO efforts so that your content is optimized for both search and sharing . <p> here 's a description from the plugin codex on how WPSSO adds to the capabilities of your site beyond what SEO plugins allow you to do : <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for search keywords , adding official ( canonical ) URLs , and creating meta descriptions . Some SEO plugins provide basic information to social networks , but their main focus is to help with search traffic . WPSSO then steps in to do the rest it assumes your content is the way you want it to be , and adds all of the relevant data to your content so that it can be shared effectively . The plugin combs your site for information to create meta tags that it can then feed to social networks , molding your social media communications into a better avenue for selling . <h> Setup and Configuration <p> While going through setup , I 'll point out some of the features of both the free and pro versions of the plugin . However , at $39.95 ( single site license ) , I 'd highly recommend the pro version , as the support for Twitter cards and integrations for eCommerce plugins ( such as WooCommerce , WPeC , and MarketPress ) makes it worth the price for eCommerce sites . <p> WPSSO Menu <p> Installing either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's a " Where do I start ? " guide to point out some important settings . The default settings will probably work just fine for most installs , but there are several options to review so that all of the behind-the-scenes work is configured for your site , and exploring make take you some time . <p> The first thing I did was head over to the general settings . Most of these options are exactly the same for both versions ; however , the Pro version enables the Twitter card settings on this page . You can also rearrange or hide the settings on this page by viewing " Screen Options " . <p> WPSSO General Settings <p> Note the image settings these allow you to set sizing for the best fit for each platform . For general images , 800x800 px is a good option , but 1200x1200 px is ideal if your site and product images are large enough to do this . For example , Facebook prefers images with widths above 1200px , and will display these posts more prominently . You can default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sharing . This is handy for Facebook shares as well , as users who want to share your site , products , or content can cycle through images and choose their favorite to use in the post . <p> WPSSO will also auto-regenerate any inaccurate or missing WordPress image sizes , and you can set a default or placeholder image for content that lacks its own image ( i.e. , your logo ) . Default videos can also be set , which may be useful for podcasts or similar sites , but should probably be disabled so you do n't  add this to every piece of shared content . <p> The Twitter card settings for the pro version add more image options you can set image sizes for each card type if you 'd like to override the default sizes so that every share is optimized . <p> You can also set up Google+ Authorship and a publisher link in these settings if necessary . If you 're already using an SEO plugin , such as WordPress SEO , the Pro version will detect this and make sure that information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once I 'd gone through my general settings , I checked out the User profiles . New fields are added for each user with both versions of the plugin : <p> WPSSO User Profile Changes <p> The free version of the plugin adds contact fields for Google+ , Twitter , and Facebook for your users , while upgrading to WPSSO Pro provides the ability to add more fields , such as fields for Skype , Pinterest , Tumblr , and more . This contact information allows author information to appear with shared content along with the website information . From the " getting started " guide : <p> Have your authors enter their Facebook , Google+ , and Twitter contact information on their WordPress user profile page . The SSO General settings allow you to enter contact information for the website ( Facebook Page , website Twitter account , etc. ) , but each authors contact information can also appear in the meta tags " if they complete their user profile . <p> The final stage in setup was for me to view the advanced settings , which are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust which meta tags are generated , add more contact fields , enable checking for embedded media ( which I highly recommend ) , and more : <p> WPSSO Advanced Settings <p> These advanced settings allow WPSSO to access embedded content such as images or videos from shortcodes that otherwise would not be acknowledged and included in your shared content . For example , WPSSO is integrated with Wistia so that your videos can be shared via social media as well as on your site . here 's a sample of this in action that embeds videos in a Twitter card . <h> Usage <p> Once the plugin is configured , you 'll want to check that everything is working properly in case of theme or plugin conflicts ( as some themes try to add meta tags or information that they do n't  need to , so you may have to adjust settings ) . This will require you to check out shared content on the platforms that you 'll be using , such as Facebook or Twitter , and authenticating Twitter cards or Rich Pins on Pinterest . Once you have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of your content ( whether shared by you or customers ) will include more details . <p> The first thing I 'd recommend doing would be checking out how you 'll appear in search results ( in case you have n't previously set up an SEO plugin ) using Googles Rich Snippets tool . This should show authorship for your blog posts ( do n't  forget to add the link back to your site in your Google+ profile ! ) , and detailed information with products from your schema tags ( which improve click-through rates and conversions ) . Take the product example below note that my reviews are pulled in , as well as pricing and availability : <p> WPSSO Google Search Preview <p> All this with minimal effort on my part = . You could set all of this up manually , but WPSSO automates this process , helps you avoid the hassle of getting rich snippets set up yourself , and streamlines your store management . <p> *Note : WooCommerce ( which I 'm using in this example ) adds some schema tags for reviews and pricing , and themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . If you 're not seeing this information in search results for your products , you 'll probably want to look into what your theme is doing Im using TwentyTwelve and its working fine . This information will not necessarily be provided to Google if you 're only using an SEO plugin , which is one reason I liked WPSSO . <p> After checking out my search settings , I tested out how I 'll appear on Twitter via Twitter cards . Instead of simply sharing product links , now any time I 've tweeted out product information ( or blog posts , etc ) , more information will be included in my tweets . Make sure Twitter cards are enabled and that images settings are adjusted if needed : <p> Twitter Card Settings <p> Now you 'll need to make sure that your Twitter cards are validated and approved . The plugin codex has some instructions for Twitter Cards that I 'd recommend reading to help with this . I set up a couple of card types for my site within a few minutes following these guidelines . Even though Twitter tells you it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved , I was able to get Twitter cards approved within a day ( though apparently player cards can require more time ) . Heres what they looked like on my preview ( which accurately reflects what my live tweets looked like ) : <p> WPSSO Twitter Product Cart <p> Twitter Image Card Sample <p> Looking good ! The product cards are especially useful for eCommerce sites , as product information ( such as pricing ) is pulled into the card , and another field can be pulled in or set by you ( my " ships from " field in the above examples ) . Product Cards even helped some eCommerce sites triple click-through rates . <p> Validating your sharing data with other social networks is just as simple , and the " getting started " guide helps a lot with this . For example , I was able to set up rich pins for Pinterest within a couple of minutes as well . <p> That 's all there is to usage most of what the plugin does is in the background for your site , as you 'll notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Rather then spending days setting up rich snippets , cards , and more , I was able to spend an hour or two setting up the plugin on my test site , reading through some documentation , and sharing products and content that now have rich descriptions and media . <h> Performance <p> Even though WPSSO adds a lot of information to your site to make it available to social networks , it does n't  increase page load time appreciably , which was one of my concerns at first . Speed is better than with most plugins , so site performance is not adversely affected . If you 've ever had this experience with a plugin ( which I unfortunately experienced with a shortcodes plugin ) , you know that the slow-down of site page loads can be very frustrating , and you 'll spend too much time with your web hosting support team trying to track down an issue that shouldnt exist . <p> I also found the performance in relationship to shortcodes pretty handy ( see more about video integrations below ) . WPSSO will read through any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details that it can use in content that 's shared from your site . As shortcodes are typically ignored or are not expanded by many plugins , this was a great feature . <h> Integrations <p> Some of the real benefit for me was in the integrations built into WPSSO . Lots of social media and SEO plugins step on each others toes by creating all of their own meta data or descriptions . However , WPSSO Pro detects when other plugins are installed to make sure that it works with them , not in addition to them . Ill single out a couple that I used on my own test site . <h> WordPress SEO <p> WordPress SEO is our SEO plugin of choice , and WPSSO integrates with this and the All in One SEO Pack . If you have an SEO plugin installed , WPSSO will detect this and drop some of the tags ( such as the description meta tag ) that it generates in favor of using the ones created by your SEO plugin . This allows you to add on to the functionality of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieve some of the settings from your SEO plugin as well , such as the canonical URL and post or page custom descriptions , to make sure they work together seamlessly . <h> Video ( Wistia , etc ) <p> As we mentioned before , WPSSO Pro includes advanced settings that allow WPSSO to access embedded content such as images or videos . This is a really cool feature , as most plugins stay away from expanding shortcodes , and the content embedded by those shortcodes is ignored . For example , Facebook will share video directly in the timeline ( though you can disable this if you 'd like ) . <p> If you run a membership site that uses secured videos from Wistia , or you provide setup / installation tutorials on YouTube , you 're probably embedding these videos via shortcode or HTML . If you share this content via social media without WPSSO , users will not see videos or other content because these shortcodes are n't  expanded and this media will not be acknowledged . <p> WPSSO expands these shortcodes and uses the APIs for these services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be included in your shares meta information about vides , such as resolution , will also be fetched . For example , you can use WPSSO to embed videos in your Twitter cards or on Google+ , which increases the likelihood that your content will be shared ( and including YouTube videos in Google+ posts allows comments to be shared between the two platforms ) . Any private media will not be available ( i.e. , protected videos for members ) , as the public APIs are used . <h> WooCommerce <p> Optimizing social media marketing was my ultimate goal in using this plugin , so the eCommerce integration was of the most interest to me and worth the price tag for the pro version . WPSSO Pro supports WooCommerce ( versions 1. x and 2. x ) , WPeC , and MarketPress , and adds the relevant meta data to your stores products , and will pull in all product information , such as gallery images , categories , and tags . This document has a good overview of what product information is included . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your product pages for the social meta data associated with the products : <p> WooCommerce Product Settings <p> This allows you to adjust information on a per-product basis if needed . You can customize which image should be used for sharing , override product titles or descriptions , and change the " topic " for the product . For example , your site may be focused on Internet / Software ( which will be under your general settings ) , but your product might be a swag tee-shirt , so you can adjust the topic to reflect that this product is " Apparel " instead of " Internet / Software " . <p> You can also validate your product pages directly from this new menu to see what your shared content will look like on different social networks . <p> You could add the same information manually or with another plugin if needed , but the inclusion of all popular social networks is why I liked WPSSO . For example , to get the Twitter card capabilities for WooCommerce ( along with a few other XML improvements ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , this extension is comparably priced to WPSSO Pro at just under $30 , but WPSSO also supports formatting for Pinterest , Facebook , and other networks for $10 more . <h> Customization <p> One of my concerns with plugins is the ability to extend and customize their functionality on a case-by-case basis . WPSSO includes over 100 filters to help you or a developer customize the plugin for your site if you require additional tweaking that is n't opened up in the settings . Any meta tag value or information about the webpage and its media can be modified based on any criteria you choose . <p> For example , you could change the Open Graph webpage URL to respond to where the share is coming from ( i.e. , to recognize if the share is from Facebook or Pinterest ) , which will allow you to track traffic and conversions from each network . <p> These filters allow you to customize the information that 's given to social media networks in shared content , letting you can track or modify any information that 's shared from your site . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can request quotes for customization instead . <h> Support <p> Support for the free version of the plugin is provided via the WordPress.org forums , and typically has fast resolution times . Support is listed as one of the selling points for the plugin , so checking out responses for the free version can give you some insight into what to expect . <p> WPSSO Pro has other dedicated support resources , such as a knowledge base , forum , and ticketing system so that you can get personalized help if needed . There 's also plenty of documentation available to help with setup ( I read up on the Installation Guide , FAQ , and Notes to start ) . In addition , there are some helpful resources on setting up your social networks ( such as the documentation on getting Twitter cards validated and approved ) . All support resources are included in a WPSSO Pro purchase . <h> Other Comments <p> Though I did n't  test this myself , WPSSO Pro does allow you to use the plugin on a multisite install . This could be a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your shop so that you do n't  have to set the plugin up for different domains , or run a membership site network . <p> Support for Easy Digital Downloads products is coming very soon as well ( within a week or two ) . WPSSO will add support for download product details in the same way as the WooCommerce examples above . That will bring support for eCommerce to four different plugins : WooCommerce , EDD , WPeC , and Marketpress . <h> WPSSO Plugin Review Conclusions <p> At $40 for a single site license , WPSSO Pro provides a handy tool for your marketing team , and improves your content whenever its shared by you or your fans . The free version has a lot of great features and makes a good trial version , but I think that eCommerce sites really benefit from the eCommerce plugin and video integrations ( as well as the inclusion of Twitter card support ) that the Pro version offers . <p> Providing detailed content and media is not only a good strategy for communication , but also optimizes your social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This helps to generate and improve leads any time a customer shares your content or products , and WPSSO makes the setup of social media marketing tools easy . <p> Note : This post was sponsored by Surnia based on experiences using the plugin . For more information , please see our editorial policy . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 11 Comments <p> Hey Sunit , great question . WPSSO replaces some of the features of an SEO plugin , but not all . It optimizes your content for sharing , and adds relevant data about products ( such as pricing , rating , etc ) , which free SEO plugins do not do ( there 's a bit of detail here that I 'd read ) . It also replaces the social part of some SEO plugins ( such as Google+ or Twitter card setup ) . <p> Its actually best used in conjunction with either WordPress SEO or All in One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as basic site details , open graph tags , or product schema.org information like rating and price ) that can be used by search , its not meant to replace your SEO plugin . SEO plugins add in the extremely valuable information on key word density and suggest ways to improve your content . WPSSO assumes that you 've done this already , then adds in additional formatting to optimize content and products for search and sharing . I use it alongside of WordPress SEO rather than as a replacement ( unless you 're talking about the WooCommerce SEO plugin that extends WordPress SEO then yes , it can replace it ) . Hope this clarifies a bit how I 've used it ! <p> " WPSSO Pro provides a handy tool for your marketing team , and improves your content whenever it 's shared by you or your fans . The free version has a lot of great features and makes a good trial version , but I think that eCommerce sites really benefit from the eCommerce plugin and video integrations ( as well as the inclusion of Twitter card support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A good feature review , but I feel that you really gloss over the single biggest issue with WPSSO . Pricing . <p> I understand this is a sponsored review , but even in that context , pretending that $40 per install for a plugin that basically automates adding a few head tags is good buy is a touch on the silly side . Combine that outrageous price with things likeif you have a single site on a multisite install running WPSSO , you have to buy 2 licenses to use the plugin fully . <p> One major point of buying a plugin is saving money instead of reinventing the wheel . When you 're a developer having to pay $80 just to develop this on one site , well that 's not smart business . <p> Instead , developers are better served to use any of the literally hundreds of pages out there that give you every piece of information you could ever need to compose the same head tags in conjunction with something like ACF ( dev license for UNLIMITED sites $100 ) or any other custom fields plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just becuase a plugin has some nice features is not good business . <p> I do not expect you to publish this comment , but perhaps someone here might read it and realize that all a review that ignores the very significant price implications of plugins license structure does is call into question the authors and by extension this sites competency . <p> When you 're a developer having to pay $80 just to develop this on one site , well that 's not smart business . <p> Most people are not developers . Could you or I add open graph tags to our sites without a plugin ? Yes it might even be cheaper for us to write the code we need manually ( though I have no desire to look through all the dev docs for each platform to make sure I get it right , not to mention following updates to each of these platforms in case they change ) . Could we use a different plugin than this to do it ? Of course . <p> Can most WordPress users do this ? No . Why would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add open graph tags , or learn how to use a complex plugin like ACF to add this ( not to mention theyd have to ensure that they 've hit all of the relevant meta data for all networks ) when they can pay $40 or $80 to have something do it for them ? Not only that , they get support if something does n't  work as it should . <p> Its like the argument of , " Why would someone pay the outrageous price of $40 to change their own oil ? " Because I do n't  want to , and I do n't  want to learn how to , even if its supposed to be easy . Heck , I can even change my own oil and I still pay for it . I 'd rather pay the money and its done without me doing it ; I did n't  have to spend a lot of time learning how to do it , and I know it will be done the way its supposed to be done . And if it goes wrong , I have someone other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ignoring price its knowing that the majority of readers are not developers , nor do they want to learn to be developers . They want to focus their time on building their businesses . They want something that does exactly what it says it does without them needing to learn to the point where they could just write the code themselves . <p> I admit I sit surprised that my comment made it past moderation . I did not expect that , kudos to the site/moderators/author for that . <p> You raise a fair counter argument and state it well . I do n't  have insight into your readers and I approached the issue of the plugin from my perspective as a developer without giving much time/thought to other angles . <p> I do , however , stand by my now qualified contention that if you are a developer ( or even a non-developer with multiple sites ) that this plugin is priced in a fashion that is incredibly out of line and that this problem bears mention in any discussion of this plugin . <p> Excellent comment Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main purpose of WPSSO . As the plugin author , I 'm hopeful that I can explain what that is. = If you 're looking to implement static meta tags in your templates , or entering them manually with custom fields , then yes , WPSSO has many more features than you need for this . WPSSO gathers information about your content from a variety of sources , then formats it for each social website ( image size , description length , author / publisher attributions , media / content type , etc. ) in most cases , you do n't  have to enter anything manually , though you can certainly fine-tune what it finds . = Having this ability to gather information on images , videos , products , and text from a variety of sources ( and 3rd party plugins ) , with support for posts , pages , categories , tags , attachment pages , custom taxonomies , and much more , is valued by many developers . About a quarter of our Pro version customers are developers and I receive the most praise from them . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it saves them a ton of development time . = At $40 for all the features offered in the Pro version , not to mention the unlimited updates and support , most developers think its quite a bargain . = <p> Your information on multisite licensing is a bit off the only requirement is that the default site is licensed ( since WordPress uses the default site to manage updates ) . If you need to license additional sites , then yes , you need additional licenses ( though one license is fine it depends on your needs ) . The cost goes down as you buy 2 or more licenses ( 2 licenses for $33 each , 5 for $25 each , etc. ) the cost of licensing is mostly to cover support , which is why you get a discount when one person purchases several licenses ( the cost of support goes down as well ) . <p> I 'd recommend you try the Free or Pro version to see for yourself as a developer , I 'm sure you 'll appreciate the features offered . And you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . = <p> js. 11393 @qwx871393

@@98138309 @2338309/ <h> SiteGround Hosting Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I 've written a bit about hosting before , and have recommended WP Engine to a lot of people . However , just as I 've told you about eCommerce platforms , what you select will depend on what you need . While scalability is extremely important , using WP Engine can be like bringing a tank to a knife-fight for some sites , and is more locked-down in terms of server configuration than other hosting providers since its an entirely managed service . I 've looked for other hosting companies to recommend , and SiteGround has emerged as another crowd favorite . <p> A lot of people I follow and respect have recommended SiteGround hosting , so I decided to give it a try . For example , WP Site Care has recommended SiteGround and uses them as their hosting partner ( in short , because of fast , quality support and flexibility ) . Brian Krogsgard of Post Status has also been consistently pleased with his experience using them : <p> My experience with @SiteGround keeps getting better . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #WCSF since , has been great <p> SiteGround also has several customer testimonials available . After reading enough positive tidbits about SiteGround , I decided to give them a test drive myself and write this SiteGround Hosting Review . <h> SiteGround Review <p> I had a positive experience using SiteGrounds services , and will be promoting their services along with WP Engine . <p> I 've read extensively on hosting speed comparisons and did n't  feel it would be beneficial to rehash them myself , so Ive omitted a " Performance " section from this review . Here are speed comparisons I 'd recommend checking out , or you could test your own hosting with Load Impact or Blitz.io and compare it to these results : <p> This comparison of hosting services from Review Signal is one of the most thorough comparisons I 've ever seen , and it includes lots of performance data for you to geek out over . Really , this is the main reason I feel like my own speed tests would be redundant . <p> My review will focus on the user experience in setting up an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts above do a good job of establishing that SiteGrounds performance is top-notch and makes it worth recommending . <h> Pricing and Features <p> Pricing for SiteGround hosting plans begins at $3.95 per month for your first billing term , which is super cheap . After your first billing term , the lowest pricing goes up to $9.95 per month ( which is still reasonably priced ) . For comparison , an SSL-compatible plan with most providers requires a $50+ per month plan , while at SiteGround you 'll be paying $14.95+ per month ( $29.95 after your first term ) . While price is the last criteria for comparison for me when investing in a business , this is a nice perk for using SiteGround since performance in terms of speed is n't sacrificed . <p> So why is SiteGround less expensive ? Even though the hosting is managed ( WordPress core is updated for you , daily backups are created , etc ) , you 'll be on a shared server . I 've written about Shared vs VPS vs Dedicated hosting if you want to learn more , but one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the server with you could affect your performance ( which is n't the case with a more expensive VPS or dedicated service ) . <p> This is another reason that hosting will depend on your needs with lower traffic , your livelihood probably wont be blown to bits with small interruptions in service or on the off-chance that one of your server-mates nukes your server , so the decision in what you need depends on what 's important to your business . <p> Each SiteGround plan comes with a free WordPress install and domain name . However , as I 've noted in our article on Domain Name Registrars , I would n't recommend tying your domain name to your hosting service so that you 're free to take it with you if you switch hosting providers . Purchase your own for the nominal fee per year ( $10-$15 ) so that you own it and it goes with you everywhere . <p> SiteGround Pricing <p> I recommend the GoGeek plan for eCommerce sites , as it includes SSL-compatibility . The " Grow Big " plan includes this as well , but lacks the staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need to role back site changes . The GoGeek plan also provides some handy features for WordPress sites : <p> unlimited number of sites <p> 100,000 visits / month <p> unlimited emails <p> 30GB storage <p> daily backup ( 30 copies / day ) <p> SuperCacher installed <p> PCI compliance <p> SSH / FTP access <p> free WordPress install <p> WP core autoupdates <p> staging site area <p> Git access <p> SSL compatibility ( w/free certificate for 1 yr ) <h> Getting Started with SiteGround <p> Signing up for SiteGround was simple I chose the plan I wanted to sign up for and went through the checkout process using a domain name that I already had . <p> The only snag I ran into while getting started with SiteGround was a billing confirmation issue . I 'd signed up for the GoGeek plan and got to this screen : <p> I clicked the confirmation button to speak with a Live Chat representative , but was disconnected in the process after about 1 minute , and had n't  copied my order number for reference . I initiated another live chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . The new representative was able to find the registration information , and gave me a quick call to confirm the billing details , and I was good to go about 8 minutes later . <p> After I 'd selected the hosting plan I wanted to use and confirmed by billing details , I got the DNS transfer information I needed via email ( this was available in my user account as well ) . SiteGround has a tutorial available for help with transferring the DNS for your domain name to their hosting if you 've never done this before . <p> Once my DNS had been transferred , I waited a bit for it to resolve , and logged back into my account . I was then taken through a setup wizard that asked me what technology I wanted to use , so I chose WordPress and was able to easily get my new WordPress site set up in a few minutes ( you could select this from your cPanel later if you do n't  want to go through setup immediately ) . <p> After completing the setup process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the credentials I 'd selected . In total , setup took just a couple of minutes . <p> Free WordPress install <p> Now that my site was set up and I was logged into my WordPress admin , I took a quick tour . One thing you may want to check out are the pre-installed themes from SiteGround : <p> Included Themes <p> I had opted not to install any free themes , so I was a bit irritated that I then had to go through and delete these , but some of you may enjoy having a few other free options to choose from . The only other thing that 's different than a typical WordPress install is the first sample blog post SiteGround fills this with their own promotional content , so you may want to delete the sample post as you get your site setup . <h> Usage <p> So Ive signed up for the GoGeek account , I 've got my fresh new WordPress site ready to go , and now Ive got to check out some of the other features offered by SiteGround . <p> I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SiteGround resources , which is where I found my account area and support resources . There are also several tutorials available for different platforms to get you started if you 're not familiar with WordPress ( or other platforms , such as Joomla ) . The " My Accounts " tab is how you 'll access your cPanel , which is where most of your tools are located . <p> SiteGround Accounts <p> Note that the " Information &amp; Settings " under " My Account " has lots of useful information , such as DNS information , FTP details ( which , for me , is essential for the inevitable site breakage ) , and access to your free CloudFlare CDN plan . <p> Clicking the " Go to cPanel " button will bring you to your SiteGround cPanel , where you can access all of the tools for your account , including : <p> auto-install WordPress if you have n't done so already <p> create staging sites <p> create a git repository for site changes <p> set up email accounts <p> set up SSH access <p> and more <p> cPanel <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I then decided to create a staging site . This is one of my favorite features of the GoGeek plan , and staging areas take less than a minute to create ( this will depend on your site if you have lots of products , posts , or pages , this will take longer ) . Staging Areas are extremely useful to test out site changes , plugin updates , and more so that you do n't  break your live site . SiteGround also let 's you create multiple staging areas . <p> Once you 've started to create a staging site , you can optionally password protect your staging site so that its not publicly accessible . When you visit this staging site , you 'll be required to enter these credentials before viewing either the frontend or backend of your staging site . <p> Setting Staging Password <p> Staging sites will be created as subdomains , such as http : **26;2275;TOOLONG . Once you 've created your staging site , you 'll be able to replicate staging sites , create a new git repo for your staging site changes , or push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staging areas , which is very helpful . This is one thing I do n't  like about some staging areas , as posts that have been copied to a staging area but I 've deleted afterwards on my live site will be published on the staging site and send me emails about pingbacks on internal links , etc . <p> I also checked out the SiteGround SuperCacher from my cPanel and my new site . The SuperCacher plugin allows you to use a dynamic cache that 's powered by Varnish and Memcached . This optimizes site performance by saving some of your site HTML to serve directly to visitors rather than generating it from PHP for each visit , speeding up performance . SiteGround has full details on how their SuperCacher operates that I 'd recommend reading . <p> SiteGround SuperCacher <h> Support <p> Support is one aspect of a service on which I rarely like to compromise . The first time you 're in a bind and need help that wont come through , you 'll understand why support is so important to me this is made even worse if you 're losing money at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thankfully , this is one place that SiteGround sticks out . SiteGround offers 24/7 phone support , live chat , and email ticketing . They state that over 90% of new customers come from customer referrals , which would be unlikely with poor support services . <p> Live Chat is what I had the most experience with , as this is my preferred support channel ( I like being able to do other things at the same time , and being on the phone distracts me too much ) . Each time I 'd spoken with someone via chat , I 'd been connected in less than two minutes . Every issue I contacted live support with was also resolved via the same chat ( except for the disconnection blip I mentioned earlier ) . Typical time for a resolution was less than 10 minutes , which is outstanding . <p> To create an opportunity for an email support ticket , I created an issue that required permalinks to be flushed ( which a super-annoying issue but not always obvious ) so that I could test out the response time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation given for simple , obvious issues tells you a lot about a support service and how they treat their customers . Do they make you feel stupid for the issue ? Do they tell you how it could be solved in the future to help educate you ? Do they just solve it without telling you what 's wrong ? This also technically was n't their problem I should have contacted the author of the plugin I used to create the issue , but wanted to see if theyd just give me the simple fix . <p> After submitting my email ticket , I received my first response in just under 6 minutes , which asked me to double-check the URL of the page and to send over login credentials if I wanted them to troubleshoot further . That was pretty fast sure , it was an easy question and we did n't  solve the ticket in the first reply , but that 's still a great response time . It also let me know that they were looking into the issue . <p> Total time to resolution was about 30 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm and fix the issue . The support tech told me how to fix the issue for future reference , and linked me to another tutorial in case I had the problem in the future . <p> Finally , SiteGround also offers toll-free phone support all day , every day . When I called phone support , my call was taken after less than a minute on hold , and my issue was resolved within a few minutes . What I liked about the phone support was that the technician took the time to explain my question and to make sure that I had no other issues before closing the call . Sometimes phone support seems as if they 're rushing to get to the next call , but that was n't the case in my experience . <h> SiteGround Hosting Review Conclusions <p> Overall , my experience using SiteGround was very positive I really liked the access to multiple staging sites with just a few clicks , as well as quality support and performance . Pricing is also very compelling ; for $15 per month , you have everything you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your first term of 1-3 three years , paid in advance ) . This is really helpful for sites that are just starting out and need to control costs or do n't  have traffic that demands more resources . <p> As your site grows , you 'll probably need to change from a shared service to a VPS or dedicated host so that you 're not competing for resources with other sites on your server ( or being negatively affected by them ) . Performance and load times make a huge difference for eCommerce sites , so do n't  wait too long to make a hosting change if you 're site performance is affected . SiteGround offers Cloud ( VPS ) and dedicated hosting as well from $70+ per month that you could consider upgrading to as your site grows . <p> here 's a survey on hosting from WP Shout that includes SiteGround , WP Engine , and several other hosts . <p> Note : This post contains affiliate links .

I began using SiteGround almost a year ago , with the GoGeek plan , and have moved several sites there . Ill echo that the support team has been fabulous in my experiences . One issue Ive run into however , which I do n't  think is publicly documented by SiteGround , is that the staging sites are limited to databases of 100 MB or less . I have a site that runs WPML and has a database about that size . I 've had to clean up database space ( good to do anyway ) to create a staging copy of that site . I cant recall for certain , but I believe it was suggested by support that I upgrade to Cloud Hosting or a Dedicated Server in order to create a staging site with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WP Engine has a 100 MB limitation for staging sites with their Personal Plan , so that 's where the site could be moving as the database grows in size . If I 'm wrong , and staging sites can now be created on SiteGrounds GoGeek plan with databases over 100 MB , then that will be great news for me . And I 'll be sorry for any possible confusion ! Thanks again ! <p> Thanks so much for the kind words Bradley ! Interesting issue about databases with staging I only have a few pages / plugins running on testing sites so there are some issues that do n't  get discovered . I contacted the live chat but was n't able to get a consistent answer on staging site limits , so I 'm not sure of the staging database limit for the GoGeek plan . <p> Its always great to hear from people that have used the service extensively , as I 've always encountered little issues here or there like this with almost every service / plugin I 've used , but it always takes time to realize these things . Really appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thank you for the great review and the time you took to research and test our services . We are very happy with the good assessment you give us . Bradley , there is indeed a limit for the data base size in our staging tool which is necessary in order to prevent server overload and negative consequences for the performance of other websites on the server . If having a staging copy is crucial for the user and their data base is bigger than 100MB , they will still be able to create a staging copy by upgrading to our cloud solution for example . We will make sure to include this info in our staging tool tutorial to make it more transparent for new users . Thank you very much for pointing this out ! <p> Hi Marina , thanks so much for stopping that by and clearing up the question = <p> To provide a reference point for other readers , 100MB will be enough for a staging site database unless you run into a specific issue as Bradley did ; WPML has to duplicate posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . If you need more space for a different reason ( huge numbers of orders , forum members , etc ) , you 'll probably already require an upgrade to cloud / VPS hosting anyway . <p> I love SiteGround , however , the one gripe I have with them is that unsuspecting new clients see the offer of $3.95 per month for their Startup hosting , not realising this is only for the first year and that the regular price is applied for all following years . <p> i.e. $47.40 for first year , $119.40 for each year thereafter and this is at 30% of normal cost of $9.95/month . <p> Hey Louise , this is a good point I think you can choose to pay for 1-3 years at that price , but it could be confusing for new signups . It looks like they 've added a note about this on the signup page , though its not quite as obvious as it could be : " Note : Promo price applicable for the first invoice . Once your initial term is over regular renewal prices apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps people that are finding out about SiteGround through this post = <p> Hey Chris , unfortunately every host will have outages from time to time . I 've hosted sites at both WP Engine and SiteGround recently and been happy with my experiences at both in terms of performance and uptime , so I would n't anticipate the issues it sounds like you 're having at Pressable . Outages or issues with each have been very rare in my experience . I 've always had prompt and very helpful support from each company as well , especially on high priority tickets ( such as outages , for which I receive responses within minutes ) , so I 'd definitely consider SiteGround a legitimate WordPress hosting company . <p> Have you tried a full fledged WooCommerce store with multiple extensions ? Am running one with 115 plugins ( mostly extensions of WooCommerce , OptinMonster , WP Rich Snippets and the likes ) . And I kept getting 502 time out with WP Engine , so much so that I moved to ASO ( A Small Orange ) with the 2X RAM and 2X Bandwidth plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were customers of ASO , which makes it really worth while . I mean , where can you find 4GB for VPS with 2 Cores for only $30/mo ? <p> However , just wondering about SiteGround . Does the GoGeek work well with 115 plugins ? Currently using about 1GB for apps ( on Munin ) and another 1.5GB for cache . <p> Hey Leo , I have n't had a super popular store running on it , though I do know that they allow 6x fewer sites on a GoGeek server versus a typical shared server . However , the number of plugins does n't  really matter , provided that they 're from quality authors . It honestly depends on what the plugins are doing a single poorly-coded or resource-intensive plugin is more dangerous for site performance than 150 plugins that are properly built , so it would depend on what your plugins are doing . <p> Our store is n't super popular yet . In fact you guys get more traffic than us = But reading on , I realise why we cant . <p> 1 ) Our DB size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well coded . Most are official WooCommerce plugins , while the rest comes from very reputable developers . All have been tested for speed and resource with New Relic and P3 Performance Profiler . Just that WP Engine had a short time out , which they wo n't budge on . 3 ) Though the plugins are optimised and from good developers , every bit actually adds up to RAM usage , which would make SiteGrounds GoGeek plan to be bad for us 4 ) I 'm only paying A Small Orange , $30/month for 4GB of RAM , 2X Core , 2 TB bandwidth and 30 GB SSD . If I were to upgrade to the Cloud VPS on Siteground , it would be at least $90/month to get the same specs . <p> Hey there , in my own experience you 're given a notification first if you go over allocated resources within a month before anything happens to your account . If this repeats , then you 're required to upgrade , as SiteGround does n't  have a system for charging overages ( like a cell phone company would for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources you 'll have available are noted when you sign up anyway , so I do n't  think I 'd call this sneaky you do know what 's available for use for your account in terms of resource limits . <p> Thanks so much for this review . I found it very helpful . I 'm looking for a new host , and had several long chats with SiteGround . I still havent decided if I feel comfortable switching to them . My biggest issue is that they do n't  offer a month-to-month plan only plans where you have to pre-pay 12 to 36 months upfront . If you want to leave them during that time period , you will lose your unused monthly fees . <p> I 've also had pre-sales reps tell me inaccurate information . I asked what the SSL would cost after the 1st free year . I was initially told $30 ( which was n't what I found on their site ) . A different rep confirmed that it was really $82 . <p> I 've also had them try to tell me that their caching software would work fine with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configure their caching software . You have to either accept their default settings ( which often wont work with ecommerce or membership plugins ) , or you have to turn it off and use your own caching plugin that you can configure . <p> The other thing I found out was that the CloudFlare that comes with their shared hosting plan wont work with an SSL site . In this case , you 'd have to pay an extra $15/month for a CloudFlare Plus plan that will work with SSL , or choose not to use CloudFlare on your site . <p> I love their fast response time for support , but I wish I felt I could believe everything they tell me . I 'd love to have affordable access to a staging platform ( though I do n't  know if my site fits within their 100Mb limit ) , but I do n't  like having to prepay for a full year with a relatively unknown ( to me ) company . <p> Hey Debra , glad you found it useful ! My personal experiences with SiteGround have continued to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concerns with an annual plan , but I think there 's an option where you can do a trial month for a setup fee . This may be worth it to see if you want to invest for longer . <p> So the SSL certificate is free for the first year if you use their SSL cert , then $82 per year after that . However , if you use a 3rd party SSL certificate , its $30 for a dedicated IP + $30 for installation ( to total $60 ) . I do n't  believe they allow self installs I wrote about this a bit more in this comparison article . <p> RE : Caching , I can say this is actually pretty standard . Most managed hosts will configure caching for you without the ability to change it ( theyll take exclusions , but that 's usually it ) . However , not all will allow you to disable it , which is handy if you have fairly specific requirements . From what I understand , they account for eCommerce / membership sites with their default set up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . <p> I 'm not sure about the CloudFlare setup myself , but I do n't  think the staging DB size would be a concern unless you 're running something like WPML ( which can make the database massive since you 're essentially duplicating all content ) . It sounds like the trial period might be a good option to give it a go rather than committing to the full year , which is actually what I did myself . They also have a 30 day guarantee , though you may want to ask about terms to see what they mean by " services meeting expectations " . <p> Thanks for the reply , Beka . Now I understand that both of the sales reps were right about the cost of the SSL one was quoting for a 3rd party SSL and the other in-house . They just did n't  clarify that difference . <p> As for the caching , I do n't  know how their default system could be set up to handle all kinds of membership and ecommerce software but , then , I 'm very new to this and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when I asked SiteGround if I could have some pages cached and others not , they said no . Its all or none with their system . <p> I have to say , after spending 50 minutes waiting to chat with my current host , I love being able to reach someone in just a minute or so with SiteGround . And having access to a staging platform will be increasingly critical to my business . Thanks for linking to your comparison article . I found that very helpful , too . <p> This is a very informative article . I 'd never heard of siteground before . They 're prices are very reasonable . I had a nightmare with Bluehost . My site was down more than it was up . I now use KWW Host and am very happy to enjoy hassle free service . <p> Sitegrounds support is just amazing .

They are fantastic and I highly recommend them ! <p> Just wanted to add my two cents worth too and this from someone who almost never writes reviews ! ! I chose Siteground because all the reviews that I read were positive . So many reviews commented on their excellent support which I thought I probably would n't use that much not because I 'm an expert far from it but more because its hosting what do you need support for ? Well , I have needed help because I 'm trying to do new things I 've not done before and their support is truly excellent ! I 've needed them a couple of times now not because of problems at their end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat and both times had incredibly quick responses and the customer support team are very knowledgeable and very patient and understanding of those still on a steep learning curve ! = <p> This is a clear case of " SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY " = Like always , support is amazingly helpful and courteous . Already have 2 sites in there , and this was my third one = Will keep coming back to SiteGround , no question about it ! <p> Hi , I have been using SiteGround from January this year . I have been using many hosting companies world wide . My last hosting before going to SiteGround was Google Cloud . This is also a very good hosting solution but for me , not having support is in the long run to time consuming . So I started looking for a different solution and I found SiteGround . I tested it and I liked the service the quality and the de affiliate program . I have since then moved to SiteGround my self and moved more than 100 Magento shops to SiteGround . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cool thing is that all my customers and contacts that use SiteGround are very enthusiastic . This in return helps bust my own sales on Pagayo.com . So overall , very good hosting and service . One last thing . I would love to get SiteGround in Dutch and German . I have asked SiteGround to manage this for them , but they have other priorities . So that 's why I give SiteGround 99,9% out of 100% = <p> I really can not say enough about the support staff . I have honestly never seen anything like it . I took on the responsibility to help out the daycare my boys attend by getting them away from the hosting service they were using that was costing $49.95 / month . I was worried about moving the domain and building a new site as I have never used wordpress before . With my technical abilities and help from siteground support , I was able to get the website up and working in no time . Every single person I worked with whether it was on chat or email was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix some of my errors , but they also took the time to make sure I understood what the issues were . I will be referring this hosting website to all of my friends that work on sites daily . A huge thank you to everybody that has helped out ! <p> Ive been using several VPS servers at SIteGround now for about 18 months , started with one and kept adding . Support is super fast , even if the ticket is not resolved in the first reply the support is so fast it does not really matter to me that it may take two tries on a more difficult question . Sometimes I submit a support ticket and by time I close the browser window my email inbox is blinking that I have a reply from support . <p> One thing I love about this company , besides the servers always being up , is that they continue to improve their offerings at no additional cost . Sometimes even reducing fees for some services they used to charge extra for . Seems like every-time I turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of the server I 'm using offering more customization in caching , and other speed improvements . <p> An example is I have a site that is way to large of a Joomla home page in size and amount of files to load . It was taking about 4 seconds to load a year ago and now it is down to 1.8 seconds using tools.pingdom.com for tracking . <p> Great hosting for WordPress and Joomla . They really understand those CMSs not just how to host them , but how the frameworks actually function . This is a huge benefit for Joomla in particular since that is what we build all of our sites with . <p> I moved to siteground after bad experiences with my previous hosting company . I read positive reviews about their support , tools and technical performance , prior to switching . <p> I was not disappointed . Support is fast to respond , friendlly and always treat my queries seriously . This is a very different experience compared to what I 've had to endure previously . The few problems I have had , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to blame my ISP , PC , brain , etc , they always investigate my issues with professionalism and a friendly attitude . <p> As well as this , the cpanel they offer is great and a clone of the same site loads faster and scores higher with AdWords and pagespeed compared to my former hosting provider . <p> Granted , they cost slightly more but this is more than worth it for the reliability and ease of being able to talk to someone knowledgable who is able to provide assistance swiftly and diligently . <p> I have had no regrets with switching to siteground and am happy to recommend them to anyone who wants a quality hosting company . For disclosure , I have no affiliation to this company , just a v. positive experience in my 1+ years with them . <p> Been on their service for over a year without any problem . Recently wrecked my wp site by doing something stupid . I could not access the site anymore and was panicking . Their customer support was patient and helped me resolved the issue within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SiteGround customer for 18 months now two GoGeek accounts so far and I 'm writing now because of how SiteGround just keep on improving things for us . The latest is moving our sites to the new London datacentre for us , because its better for our clients . I 'm also writing now because we use another UK based hosting company for our older sites , and their service has been getting worse and worse , with major downtime issues . <p> Its when you get bad service from another provider that you really appreciate the fantastic service we get from SiteGround , whether its features , the hosting itself ( very fast ! ) or the technical support . <p> I moved to Siteground after nothing but issues with a previous provider . Siteground transferred my sites for free and everything went very smoothly with no downtime ! I can not recommend them enough , I have four sites which load super fast and support has always been so quick to resolve any issues . <p> Its rare to find such a good company nowadays . Good prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> I have always used BlueHost in the past and never really had anything to complain about , but an opportunity came up that gave me the option to switch hosting providers so I decided to do some research . <p> I had never heard of SiteGround prior to this , but it seemed to have good reviews and was mentioned a lot in my Google searches so I decided to give it a try . In switching my sites over I came a across a few hick-ups ( some my fault , some weird issues ) , I hopped on the chat line and my problem was solved in 15 min each time . <p> My favorite part of this so far is the one-click staging site setup . Especially as I work with sites that want to do a design change , I find this feature extremely helpful as I can test and try out different things , show them to clients and then decide to push my changes or destroy them , All with out touching the live site . <p> While I have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a very promising future . I recommend this to anyone looking to tryout a new provider , its cheap enough that its worth the time , and no harm done if you find it does n't  fit what you 're looking for . Their staff is very helpful and does a fantastic job of getting you the assistance you need . <p> SiteGround is nothing short of spectacular . I host multiple sites with them and if there is ever an issue I just click on the live chat and it is resolved quickly and efficiently . I have transferred almost all of my sites and will be transferring the remainder within the next month . I recommend them to everyone ! 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138310 @2338310/ <h> Allowing Only New Content Access for Members <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> I have a news site that my members should get access to my new posts and videos , not the posts and videos I have already created . They only get access to new things that are published during the membership . Is there a way or some plugins I can use to do this ? <p> I 've never had a great answer for Tobys question until recently . Most membership plugins are geared towards sites with evergreen membership content , such as courses or tutorials , and thus members get access to set collections of content as soon as they sign up , or on a delayed / dripped schedule . <p> The Restrict Past Content add-on was released recently to let you create a new-content-only membership set up . A Professional License or higher ( $199 ) is required to use this add-on . <p> When a member signs up for a subscription level , the member will have access only to content published after the signup date , and can not view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a per-subscription level basis , so you could use this model for some memberships , then have an " unlimited " membership that can access past content as well . One of the cool things about this set up is the " Exception period " setting . You can enable " past content " restrictions for members in this subscription , but you can give them a " grace period " with the exception period . <p> For example , if I want to give new members access to content from 3 days prior to their signup date along with future content , I can enter an exception period of 3 ( the documentation has some additional details ) . This helps you engage new members immediately by giving them access to some content to start the membership until new content access kicks in and they see some freshly published articles , videos , tutorials , or other membership posts . <p> You can also make some posts available to all members , regardless of signup date . This is great for content that goes over membership community rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all members should see . You can enable overrides from the page or post while editing it : <p> The Restrict Past Content add-on for Restrict Content Pro gives you a simple way to allow new content access for members , while keeping previous or past content locked down . Members can only see content published after their start date , or content published in their exception period . This should provide a great solution to your problem Toby ! 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138311 @2338311/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> Were writing a series of WooCommerce theme reviews as it can be difficult to find quality themes . Its not the easiest plugin to theme , but because of its popularity there are tons of WooCommerce themes available . As a result , you sometimes get themes that are n't  high-quality , do some crazy things that can affect your site performance , or will be difficult to update . <p> Due to the difficulty in theming WooCommerce , there are n't  many great free WooCommerce themes . We 've already written about the only 5 quality free WooCommerce themes that we 've found . As such , most of the themes we write about are premium WooCommerce themes , so you 'll probably have to spend some money to get a great-looking WooCommerce site . <p> How are our theme reviews better than everyone else ? We quality-test the WooCommerce themes that we write about . We do n't  simply look at the demo we actually install the theme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code that powers the theme so that you know what you 're purchasing . Here are the three themes were reviewing in this article : <h> Capital Review Obox themes <p> Capital is an eCommerce theme from Obox Themes . It fully supports WooCommerce and allows you to choose from standard blog layouts , a quick-start homepage , or to create your own widgetized home page . You can also use a " Widgetized Page " template to create widgetized landing pages in the same way as a widgetized home page . <p> Capital requires a one-time $79 purchase for use on as many domains as you want with one year of support and updates . You can pay $139 instead to upgrade to two years of priority support , or take a look at Obox Instant , which is a very cool new service offered by Obox . Instant allows you to pay $49 per month to get a complete website , including domain , hosting , some plugins , and theme installation + configuration . Obox will set up the theme just like the demo , and this centralizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugins all in one place . <p> Once Capital is installed , you 'll want to check out all settings . Color options are available by using the theme customizer ( Appearance &gt; Customize ) , and layout settings are under " Theme Options " : <h> Pros <p> All Obox themes give you control over lots of site features , such as advertisements , typography , and layouts . You can change homepage layouts and shop layouts , and have several page templates available . Widgets are color-coded to help show you the best place to use each . <p> Widgetized pages make it easy to add portfolios , team members , advertisements , and more to various site pages . This can also be handy for landing pages that promote your services or a particular product / group of products . <p> There are other templates available that support specific Obox widgets , such as team page templates . This can help you leverage the Obox custom post types for Teams , Testimonials , etc. for optimal display on your site . <p> As for shop pages , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  used ( which is a good thing ) , so the shop and product pages blend in with the rest of the theme rather than sticking out like a sore thumb . <h> Cons <p> All of the Obox custom post types are baked into the theme , which may sound great , but its not . This means that you 'll lose all of these post types ( such as testimonials ) if you 'd like to switch themes , which limits your flexibility in changing your site in the future . It also adds a lot of unnecessary code if you do n't  need to use each of these post types for your site . I 'd rather see these as individual companion plugins instead so that they can be enabled as needed . <p> There are a few minor issues with the WooCommerce shop page display . If you use the Obox theme demo , you 'll notice that products do n't  have any ratings , and I 'm not sure if these were neglected , or if they 're just themed poorly . If your products have reviews , the ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " Sale ! " badge on smaller screens . They may also be hard to see with some product images . <p> Weird Ratings Display <p> To fix this easily , I simply hid the star ratings on the shop page by using this bit of CSS in my child themes style.css ( you can use this anywhere you have custom CSS there 's space for this under theme options as well ) : <p> . products . product . star-rating display : none ; <p> You may also notice that the " Add to Cart " buttons are uneven , which drove me nuts . I added a tiny bit more CSS to fix this by shrinking the buttons slightly and the margin around them : <p> These two tweaks fixed both of the issues to make my shop page a bit cleaner : <p> There were some other minor issues like this , such as compatibility with different browsers . For example , here 's my cart page with some strange display in Chrome and Firefox : <p> Cart Page : Firefox <p> Cart Page : Chrome <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  quite give your shop the polish that youd like it to have when you 're purchasing a premium theme . <h> Code Review <p> We wrote about another Obox theme when in Part 1 of our WooCommerce themes series , and were concerned at some of the code we found as there were a few things theme developers shouldnt do . However , there are very few quality concerns with Capital . <p> Structure is a bit hard to follow , so changes may be difficult if you 'd like to customize the theme . However , Capital is pretty well done and shouldnt cause any issues with your site . <h> Overall <p> While Capital provides a pretty clean WooCommerce design , I did n't  like that I had to fix things immediately in the shop layout . I did like that I had a lot of control over the homepage and the ability to create widgetized landing pages , but setting up these pages does take some time to learn . Ive used Obox themes before , but it still required more time to set up my demo shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With that being said , there 's a lot you can do with your site layout , and your WooCommerce store probably wont look the same as someone using the same theme because of these options . <p> I think Capital is best used if you 'd like to sign up for Obox Instant , as theyll do the theme setup for you , and this makes for a great turnkey solution for a website and takes the hassle off of your shoulders for setup . If you 've never modified your own WordPress site before but want a fast setup for a WooCommerce shop along with great support , this becomes a far more attractive option for you . The fact that support for hosting and your theme are under one roof makes your site management a bit easier , and you 'll also get discounts on some WooCommerce extensions . <h> Maximize Review WooThemes <p> Maximize comes from WooThemes , whove also made WooCommerce . As a result , you can be assured that WooCommerce is themed correctly and that support for both your theme and plugins will come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For $79 , you 'll get the ability to install Maximize on as many sites as you want , and will get support and updates for one year . <p> Maximize uses the WooFramework to power settings and setup , so your theme options will be located under one small menu in the admin . From here , you can adjust the site color scheme , layout options , and other styling necessities . <p> The only other thing you 'll want to check out is the new " slides " menu to add slides for your homepage if you 'd like to make use of the ability to show off some full page images with Maximize . You can use a static homepage instead , but I wanted to leverage this image slider homepage , so I uploaded some slides and was able to be up and running with Maximize pretty shortly . <h> Pros <p> Maximize does an excellent job of showing off high-resolution photography throughout your entire website . The entire theme is keeps your images in mind , including the homepage , shop , product pages , and blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image slider for the homepage , you can use the Business template for a static homepage instead , which fully supports the WooThemes Features and Testimonials plugins . This will let you create a more traditional homepage and include company features and customer testimonials , though it takes more effort than uploading a couple of slides . You could also create your own homepage template . Even if you do n't  want to use the image slider for your homepage , you 'll still benefit from great photos throughout the rest of site . <p> You can adjust the image settings under the Theme settings if needed , but I was fine with the default sizes for my site . If you 're not using large images ( i.e. , 800px + ) , you may want to tweak these settings ( though that defeats the purpose of this theme , does n't  it ? ) . <p> Your shop pages will show off featured images in a clean , flat layout . The number of columns will respond to browser window size , which ensures that you do n't  shrink down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 3 columns to 2 . <p> Product pages are difficult to show , so I recommend viewing the demo . The featured image and thumbnails will take up most of the screen when a customer views a product , which is awesome for showing off your products . Customers can then scroll down to view all product details and purchasing options . <p> I 'd also recommend checking out the blog layout on the demo , as posts are displayed in a nifty masonry layout , but individual post pages also show off featured images in a full-width format . <h> Cons <p> In order to get the navigation out of the way of your images , its located off to the right side of the screen and is visible by clicking the " hamburger " icon . While customers may be familiar with this because of its prevalence on mobile devices , they may find it a bit strange for site navigation . <p> Clicking the icon slides out the navigation and the navigation sidebar ( where you can display widgets and social icons ) . There 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart , and will slide out when hovered to show the cart total as well : <p> The good news is that this is consistent throughout the site , so once customers use it one time , theyll get the hang of the navigation menu . However , it does always take an extra click to bring up . <p> There 's also a credit link to WooThemes in the footer that you may want to remove . Under Theme Settings &gt; Layout you 'll want to check " Enable Custom Footer ( Right ) " . This gets rid of the " Powered by WordPress . Designed by WooThemes " text , and you can optionally enter your own text here instead . If you enable the Left Custom Footer , this will override the automatic copyright notice , so be aware of this if you change both . <h> Code Review <p> Maximize was predominantly written by the same guy that originally wrote a lot of WooCommerce core , so code quality is high . The theme is easy-to-change and well-structured . Support for WooThemess Sensei is also included , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  add too much to the code base and is n't cause for concern . <h> Overall <p> Maximize is one of my favorite WooCommerce themes because I love how the product pages show off images . As product images are super important for many types of products , this is a huge win for your eCommerce store . <p> The image slider for the homepage may not be useful for every kind of store , so using the business template provides a good workaround . If I were to use Maximize for a business site , I may actually go this route and use a static page with the business page template for a homepage , or create my own homepage from scratch ( which may not be a viable option for everyone ) . <p> For $79 , Maximize provides a high-quality , easy-to-use , fairly awesome theme . Setup was very easy for me , but make take a bit longer if you use a different homepage and want to leverage the support for the Features or Testimonials plugins . <h> Zeon Review Tesla Themes <p> Zeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For $39 , you 'll have access to the theme and can install it on an unlimited number of domains . Support and updates are included for one year with each purchase , or you can instead purchase a membership for $49 . If you choose the membership , you 'll have access to all themes rather than just one ( with the same support / license terms ) . <p> When you install Zeon , you 'll probably want to start with the TeslaThemes settings under the new " Zeon " menu , which will let you configure some color options and upload logos , favicons , and the usual setup information . <h> Pros <p> There are n't  too many options to slog through , which should make setup fairly quick . Youll be able to move on to widgets once you 've gone through the general settings . There are unique widget areas for pages , posts , and products , which is pretty handy . This helps so that you do n't  have to use Jetpack to hide certain widgets from certain pages : <p> Once you 've set up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontend . Shop pages blend in with the theme and will use the color settings you 've selected under the general theme options . <p> Product pages will do a great job of showcasing images , and your image gallery is automatically turned into a slider to scroll through images for customers while viewing the product page . <p> The only thing I did n't  like was the " Add to cart " notice that 's displayed on product pages , as the " View Cart " appears to run into the rest of the text . <h> Cons <p> Zeon is another theme that installs about a million custom post types with the theme , which leads to a lot of code running on your site that you may not need ( known as " bloat " ) . Instead , these should be part of a companion plugin ( or several ) so they can be used as needed . This also makes it difficult to switch themes , as these custom post types will disappear if you change themes . <p> Again , this may seem cool because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that its a lot harder to keep that information if you change the way your site looks , and you ca n't pick and choose only the needed functionality by installing plugins . <p> Despite all of these new custom post types , you 'll still have to invest some time into building a home page if you want to use something other than your blog . These post types are n't  included in widgets , nor is there a widgetized home page . Instead , you 'll have to read through the documentation for the theme to see which shortcodes you can use , then put them into a home page template . <p> This is also something you never want to see when installing a new theme : <p> This is because Zeon overrides every single WooCommerce template , which is not something themes should be doing . You can see this if you view WooCommerce &gt; System Status and look at " Templates Overridden " . Most themes will override a few templates , but overriding every one is a good way to ensure that your theme will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes when WooCommerce 2.1 was released ) . This is a lazy way of theming , as it avoids using actions / filters in order to make theming easier . <p> As a result , you 'll have some janky things going on in the theme , and updates are far more likely to break your theme and alter the way the site looks . For example , here 's a weird display on the cart page when the cart is updated : <p> Notice that the shipping method display also looks a bit weird . The same thing happens on the checkout page : <p> Conversions and the checkout flow are also neglected , as the payment options and " Checkout " buttons should be emphasized the most on these pages to make it obvious to customers what they should click or do to proceed . Instead , payment options and the " Place Order " button are tiny and harder to find . <p> Zeon is a theme that hardcodes the theme credit in the themes footer.php . You can view this file and see this code : <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and &lt;/a&gt; to look like this : <p> &lt;div class= " col-md-6 " &gt; &lt; ? php eo ( 'copyrightmessage ' ) ? &gt; &lt;/div&gt; <p> Now you 'll only have the site copyright message shown instead . <h> Code Review <p> The fact that Zeon overrides every WooCommerce template is the biggest cause for concern . Some users do n't  update WooCommerce , but this should n't be an excuse to do something that makes updates way harder and far more likely to break something . As we saw , this affects the frontend even though the theme is fairly new ( I downloaded it while WooCommerce was on version 2.1.9 ) . <p> The functions.php is also pretty stuffed , which is n't great , but is n't a huge deal . This file is supposed to be the " brains " or " skeleton " of the theme it should be a guide to tell WordPress what files to load rather than having a lot of functions built into it , but then again some of the default themes have a lot stuffed in here as well . <h> Overall <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ override a bunch of templates because its imperative that you can update WooCommerce and your extensions for security and WordPress compatibility . I also was n't crazy about all of the custom post types that are built into the theme . There does n't  seem to be a reason for this , as there 's no widgetized homepage or page template that could leverage these CPTs as widgets to make building pages faster . If customers already need to read through documentation and use shortcodes to build a page with these CPTs , they wont mind taking an extra second to install a companion plugin to do so . <h> Conclusions <p> Of this bunch of WooCommerce themes , Maximize is my hands-down winner . I 'd also consider using Capital from Obox if I were going for Obox Instant , though if you 're okay with tweaking the CSS a bit yourself or going back and forth with their support on this , it also works pretty well for self-hosted sites and wo n't look generic by the time you 've set it up . <p> Note : This post may contain affiliate links , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you choose to purchase .

@@98138314 @2338314/ <p> However , using a good managed hosting provider does n't  cover all of the issues that can arise while running an eCommerce business . Backups can fail or get corrupted , plugins or themes can break , custom code needs to be maintained , or sites can be hacked . This issues are the ones that you need to protect against as your site becomes more valuable that are n't  covered elsewhere , and there are some premium services or plugins that can help you do so . <p> Does creating these insurance policies for yourself make sense if you only have a few orders per day ? Probably not . However , these are some things you should definitely think about as your site grows . For example , if you lose 6 hours of data on your site , how much is that worth to you ? $100 ? $1000 ? $5000 ? <p> As your potential losses grow , protecting your site against a host of poor scenarios , such as data loss , bugs or conflicts that can take your site down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . <p> Here are three " insurance policies " for eCommerce sites that you should be thinking about or investigating as your site becomes more valuable . <h> eCommerce Insurance Policy 1 : Automated Backups <p> I absolutely do . I typically only recommend hosting companies that take automatic backups of your site , and these are usually done each day . Its imperative that you have a backup on hand if something drastic happens to your site so you do n't  lose lots of data . There 's absolutely no question that you should have backups available for your customer accounts , orders , and other vital information . <p> However , these backups may not be enough , and should n't be your only copy ; they cover about 80% of what you need in terms of backups . You still need a backup insurance plan . <p> Do n't  think you need a second set of backups ? This is a real situation in which my companys backup plan made a huge save for a former client , even though the client was with a top-notch hosting provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients eCommerce site , and the site is constantly active in terms of new orders , blog comments , etc . The clients managed WordPress host took daily backups of the site , and included backups prior to performing maintenance . The site would then be disabled directly after the backup was taken so that the backup was accurate and could be used if / when needed while bringing the site back up . <p> However , in one situation , the backup was taken and maintenance was delayed . When the maintenance was done 6 hours later , a new backup was overlooked , and the old backup was used following the maintenance . In the interim 6 hours between the backup and maintenance , several orders had been placed , blog comments left , and customer accounts created . When the old backup was used while bringing the site back up , all of these were lost . Gone . Evaporated . <p> Was this a problem that should never have occurred ? Of course . The hosting company should have redone the backup before performing maintenance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fault does n't  bring back the lost information , so that mistake would have caused major issues for the client had we not had another system in place . <p> Fortunately , the real-time backups we had from a different service were able to correct the data without a loss in orders , and we were able to merge this backup version with the new site data ( orders , customers , etc ) that had been created after the maintenance was performed . <p> We saved the client thousands of dollars and countless hours of headaches and angry customers because we had an insurance policy . <p> To insure your backups , I recommend an automated system such as VaultPress or BackupBuddy . I like that VaultPress let 's you do realtime backups so your backup is always up-to-date , but it requires a monthly subscription ( though at a pretty nominal price point ) . In the situation above , we used VaultPresss realtime backups in the Basic plan to save the clients data . <p> BackupBuddy requires a yearly license purchase and will allow you to schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BackupBuddy stash " or your own offsite storage ( Dropbox , Amazon S3 , etc ) . <p> Redundancy in backups is your insurance policy . If you cant afford to lose your data , then you cant afford to put all of your eggs in one basket and rely on only daily backups from your hosting provider alone . I typically recommend the basic plan from VaultPress for $15 per month ( $165 per year ) , or the BackupBuddy 2-site license at $80 ( valid for a year ) . <h> eCommerce Insurance Policy 2 : Proactive Security <p> Site security is typically a focus for managed hosting companies , and many of them will take steps to ensure that your site is secure or help you fix security issues . However , their main business is hosting websites , not security . <p> While the security focus your hosting company provides is great to start , improving your sites security as it becomes more valuable is your responsibility . Again , the important question is : how much can you afford to have go wrong ? Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose control of your site ( and could you get it back ) ? <p> If you 'd like to start off with security monitoring , you can check into the annual AntiVirus plans offered by Sucuri , who 's one of the leaders in website security , which start at $100 per year . <p> You should also follow some general best practices on your own ( and check out these tips from WooThemes ) : <p> Use an SSL certificate , even if your payment gateway integration does n't  require one . This protects your login credentials as well as customer data and credentials . Without one , your login / pass is sent in plain text each time you log into your site and could be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack . A fringe benefit is that the increased trust from an SSL certificate can lead to higher conversions . <p> Try to use plugins and themes from reputable , veteran authors to avoid introducing vulnerabilities to your site ( though this is n't a guarantee that vulnerabilities will never exist ) <p> Delete plugins and themes you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your server and could contain a vulnerability <p> Keep WordPress core , themes , and plugins up-to-date <p> Do n't  use " admin " as your username , as this is frequently used in brute-force attacks . You should change this username , or better yet : <p> Delete your first WordPress user ( especially if the username is " admin " ) . As the first user created by WordPress is always an administrator , this gives would-be hackers valuable information about your site : a user with id=1 is an administrator . Change this to a subscriber or just delete it after making yourself a new administrator account . <p> There are also some helpful free plugins to secure your site . For example , BruteProtect ( soon to be a part of Jetpack ) is designed to protect against brute force attacks . You can also check out Sucuri Scanner or Wordfence for more complete security solutions . <h> eCommerce Insurance Policy 3 : Professional Maintenance <p> What do you do if you upgrade a plugin or theme and it looks different or stops working ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white screen or cant access anything ? What if you 've added custom code to your site but now need to make changes or upgrade ? How do you update a plugin or theme via FTP instead of via the WordPress admin ? <p> If you already know how to handle these situations , that is spectacular . If you do n't  , then you may need some help managing your site . While WordPress can be easy to manage for many industrious eCommerce entrepreneurs , this management may become more difficult as your site grows , and you may have to treat it with more care since breaks will cost more money . <p> How long can you afford to be down if there 's an issue ? Can you afford 1 hour ? 6 hours ? 12 hours ? You 'll need to determine , based on how active your site is and how much revenue it generates , what kind of support and maintenance policy your site needs . For example , if you can afford to wait some time , you could use the support included with your site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort out potential issues , but you may have to go between several services . <p> The downside to this is that the ultimate responsibility for your site lies with you . Your host does n't  have to fix issues related to plugins or themes . Theme and plugin developers do n't  have to fix or support customizations you 've made or had done . Support from these services is not instantaneous , and you may need to have someone that answers a panic button , or worries about maintenance and issues so you do n't  have to . <p> Someone needs to be responsible for your sites well-being , and its either going to be you or someone you hire to worry for you . <p> If your site generates significant revenue , you may have a site administrator ( or want to hire one ) . If not , then you should think about outsourcing your site maintenance to a developer or maintenance company . This ensure that , if issues ever arise , someone perfectly equipped to handle them is ready to do so . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time each month to devote to checking in on your site , performing updates or maintenance , and answering any questions you have . Chances are that you wo n't need someone on staff to maintain your site at first , so a retainer for a developer can cover a lot of scenarios . <p> You can also choose to subscribe to a maintenance service . Each service covers different things , so I 'd recommend checking out these tips and questions from Post Status on what to look for with a support and maintenance service . You 'll want to know things like : if the service includes eCommerce sites , what kind of support and development questions are answered , or if regular updates and major plugin / theme upgrades are included . <p> This takes the worry about site maintenance off your mind and ensures that someone is responsible for your site . You can typically subscribe to maintenance services from about $40 per month to custom pricing for enterprise plans . Here are some reputable services to check out : <p> The best part about a maintenance service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues weve already discussed , such as security and backups . For example , all Maintainn plans include a Sucuri subscription and daily backups . While I 'd still use something like VaultPress for real-time backups , having someone else to worry about and maintain your site can greatly simplify your life as an entrepreneur . <h> In Summary <p> If you do n't  plan for the worst-case scenarios with your site , you 're essentially self-insuring it . While the costs of doing so may be low and you can afford them while your site is small , these costs grow as your revenue does . <p> If the cost of your site going down or losing data is greater than you can ( or want ) to pay , investing in insurance policies for eCommerce can be a wise use of cash each month . Backups , investments in security , and routine maintenance can help to guarantee that you wo n't suffer catastrophic losses when issues arise with your site . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138315 @2338315/ <h> Saving Lost Sales with WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Many eCommerce store owners know that 7 of every 10 orders on your site will be abandoned by the customer without completing the purchase . This represents a loss in revenue over twice as large as what your store makes each year . <p> Would all of these customers have purchased from your store ? Probably not . Sometimes people add items to their carts just to check pricing , shipping options , or other costs . However , you can take steps to save these abandoned carts to drive additional revenue , and there are plugins available to help . <p> The WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro plugin can help WooCommerce stores save their lost carts by emailing customers whove abandoned their carts to try to complete the sale . You can include a link to the checkout with the cart items saved , and optionally send coupons with the email to incentivize purchase . <p> We 've published a full Abandoned Cart Pro review before , so well be going through some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new features have been added . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Settings <p> The plugin setup has been improved to make it easier for store owners to get up and running with their abandoned cart campaigns . Settings now use the WordPress settings API so they look more like the rest of your site , and plugin licensing can be entered here as well . <p> Old Settings <p> New Settings <p> There 's a new setting to disable guest carts for abandoned cart emails . When a guest user reaches the checkout page and enters an email address , this is saved and used to send abandoned cart campaigns . If you disable guest emails , abandoned cart emails will only be sent to logged in users instead . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Emails <p> Email template installation and setup is now easier and features improved coupon support . First , three default templates are installed with the plugin to expedite your setup so you have pre-made campaigns that are ready to go . <p> You can edit these default campaigns or duplicate them to get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkout links and products in the abandoned cart , so they 're very easy to update . The second and third email campaigns even include coupon codes for 5% off and 10% off ( respectively ) to incentivize purchase if the first recovery email is n't successful . <p> The emails list also now displays the percent recovery for each campaign this shows you the number of recoveries for that specific campaign so you can get a sense of where in the recovery cycle you 've recovered the sale , giving you some insight into how emails are working . For example , if you include a coupon code in your second email and this converts the most recoveries , you can consider including this in other campaigns . <p> Old email list <p> New email list <p> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro now let 's you generate unique coupon codes to add to email templates , which will be single-use for the customer . You can create a template coupon that provides a discount , and then this will be duplicated for a one-time use coupon code . The coupon type ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new unique coupon code . However , other fields , such as " provides free shipping " or a minimum spend , are not copied . <p> If you do n't  want to generate unique codes ( as this can make a lot of coupons ) or you want to provide coupons without a discount ( like free shipping ) , you can insert a standard coupon code for the customer , which I 'd recommend making one-time use per customer . This will insert the coupon code without generating a new , unique code . <p> Old coupon settings <p> Generate Coupon Codes <p> There are also some new email merge tags that can be used for specific product details ( such as the product name ) , or cart information ( such as the carts total ) . <p> Old Merge Tags <p> New Merge Tags <p> Finally , the email merge tag to show " Product Information / Cart Content " can automatically create a table of items in the abandoned cart . Instead of using the products.cart merge tag ( as it did previously ) , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the table ( you could n't modify the table contents in previous versions ) . <p> This table will add a new row for each item in the abandoned cart automatically . <p> New email sample <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Reporting <p> WooCommerce Abandon Cart Pro will still show you lists of all abandoned orders , recovered orders , and sent emails for your shop . Abandoned Orders will display the list of all orders that have been abandoned and their status ( i.e. , if a new cart was created or not ) for as many days as you 've opted to keep . <p> Abandoned orders list <p> Sent Emails will show any recovery emails sent by your store , the campaign sent , whether it was opened or not , and if any links in the email were clicked . <p> Sent Emails <p> The Recovered orders view is similar to abandoned orders , and lists out any orders that have been recovered after they were abandoned . <p> Recovered carts <p> A new report has been added as well : Product Report . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in an abandoned cart on your site , along with how many times that product has been abandoned and recovered . <p> Product Report <p> This way , you can get some insight into why carts are abandoned for example , if certain products are frequently abandoned and not recovered , you can determine if this is just due to the products popularity , or if there 's something else going on ( such as product pricing ) . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Other Improvements <p> There are several other small improvements and refinements in version 2.4+ of WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro . For example , failed orders are now treated as abandoned and will trigger your email campaigns . <p> There are also several " under-the-hood " improvements to the codebase , which improve security and performance overall . <p> Support for the WooCommerce Product Bundles extension has been added to list out any products in the bundle in abandoned cart recovery emails , but still show the bundle price . <p> You can also personalize recovery email subject lines by using the customer.firstname or product.name merge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey customer.firstname , your cart is ready for you = " . Personalized subject lines can increase open rates for emails to improve your abandoned cart campaigns . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Downsides <p> While there are tons of improvements to be had , there are still a few minor downsides : <p> As of WooCommerce 2.3 , all plugins can use the wcmail() function to send emails , which let 's third party plugins use the default WooCommerce templates . I 'd love to see abandoned cart emails do this so they use the same templates as other emails . <p> Unique , generated coupons do not copy other fields ( such as " provides free shipping " ) , which means your coupon has to provide a discount ( it ca n't only provide free shipping ) . <p> This is a tiny thing for me , but I 'd love to be able to activate and deactivate campaigns without having to edit them . <h> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro : Summary <p> the installation process is smoother due to improved settings and the installation of default emails <p> email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one-time use ( not a generic code ) <p> emails now let you customize the cart table and personalize subject lines <p> reporting is improved to give you insight on which products are abandoned and recovered most <p> you can now view conversion rates for email campaigns to see which are most successful <p> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro is a still great tool to drive additional revenue via converting abandoned orders , and the changes made to it in the months since we last reviewed it have been very useful improvements . Default templates make it easier to use the plugin and improve email campaign set up and management . Improved compatibility for other plugins like Product Bundles improves support for several kinds of stores . <p> WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Pro is definitely helpful to get insight into when or why customers leave carts on your site , and is great for converting sales you might have otherwise lost to recover additional revenue . <p> Note : This post . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 
@@98138316 @2338316/ <p> This series of posts recommends both free and paid WooCommerce themes that have been tested by our staff . <p> When I 'd given SellwithWP.com a facelift last year , I had a tough time finding a theme I liked that was lightweight , content-focused , had a great reading experience , and had a " magazine " feel without being too busy . Right in the nick of time , one of my favorite theme developers Array Themes released the theme that Sell with WP uses today ( albeit a slightly modified version ) , and I had the new design up and running within a few hours . <p> When Array released a new theme that works with WooCommerce , I was really interested in having a look at it , as its tough to find both well-designed and well-built themes for WooCommerce ( without loads of bloat , overridden templates , or other issues ) . Today were going to look at the Lenscap theme for WooCommerce stores . <h> The Lenscap Theme for WooCommerce <p> There 's one thing you may immediately notice about Lenscap : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . That 's fine , so long as you know that its intended purpose may not fit your stores goals , so you 'll need to determine if its the right fit for you . <p> After giving Lenscap a try , I think its a great fit for membership sites or other content-heavy eCommerce stores , as it does a lovely job of featuring your content while also providing a great , simple shop layout . If your marketing strategy focuses on your blog or other content marketing , then Lenscap should be on your radar , as it gives you both a great blog layout and a streamlined shop design that fits in with the rest of the themes aesthetic . <h> Lenscap Review : General Theme Setup <p> Setting up Lenscap will be quick , and is handled primarily through the theme customizer . Here you 'll be able to set up a logo , general theme configuration options , and menus or widget areas . <p> There are not many options to set up , so once youve determined which features youd like to use and your accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One thing I did take note of during set up was that Lenscap gives you multiple WooCommerce widget areas to work with , which is really helpful in enabling different widgets for your shop and blog . You can configure widgets for your regular blog sidebar , different ones for shop or archive pages , and use a new set of widgets on single product pages . <p> Widget Setup <p> This helps you ensure that your sidebar remains relevant to the content your customers or readers are viewing . <p> Once you 've configured your theme options , you probably want to determine what kind of homepage your site should have : a content-focused or product-focused homepage . <h> Lenscap Review : Blog Homepage Example <p> As Lenscap does a great job of showcasing your content , you may want to have a homepage geared towards displaying this content . If you want your homepage to highlight your blog , then I 'd also recommend using Jetpack , as many of you probably do already . Lenscap can use Jetpacks " Featured content " module to create a blog homepage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan of carousels , but I like the way Lenscap highlights a few featured posts while making navigation easy and obvious . <p> To set up this featured content , you 'll ensure that module is enabled in Jetpack , and then you can adjust the featured content settings in the theme customizer . <p> Featured Content set up <p> Once you 've enabled featured content , this content will be shown immediately on your homepage using your featured tag , and then your blog posts will be shown in a list after this featured content . <p> Blog Home Example <p> While you can keep this featured blog content slider up no matter what homepage layout you choose , you can also put the spotlight on your products instead if desired . <h> Lenscap Review : Product Homepage Example <p> WooCommerce can help you create a shop-based homepage via the several shortcodes included in WooCommerce core . This can let you show off your best sellers , sale products , featured products , highest-rated products , or certain categories . <p> You 'll need to set a static page as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add your desired shortcodes to this static page . <p> Set up Product Homepage <p> This can let you show off your products instead of content to your visitors . <p> Product Homepage <p> If desired , you could still include the featured content carousel on this homepage to showcase some recent content as well , and this will be displayed above the content of your static page . <h> Lenscap Review : WooCommerce Browsing <p> Once customers get into your stores browsing experience , theyll see the shop archive and , if you have widgets added to the shop pages , a sidebar with these widgets to help them find relevant products . <p> Shop Page <p> From the shop page , your customers can hover over a product image , and theyll be able to add items to the cart from the shop page . If a product has been added to the cart , a " View Cart " button will appear so the customer can proceed to the cart if desired . <p> On single product pages , your product photography is featured , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-width layout at the top of the product page . As images and your short description tend to be some of the most important information to customers , I liked that these are shown taking up the full width of the page . <p> Product Page 1 <p> The rest of the product information is displayed below this section of the product page in the product tabs , and the product page sidebar will be shown next to these tabs ( rather than taking up the entire page height ) . <p> Product Page 2 <p> Styling of the shop and product pages are pretty minimal , but I was happy to see that they fit in with the rest of the theme design rather than using the default WooCommerce styles . <h> Lenscap Review : WooCommerce Purchasing <p> Once customers get into the purchasing flow of the store , theyll be directed to the cart page . Your cart and product pages will use the accent color your theme option specifies for call-to-action buttons like " Proceed to Checkout " . <p> Cart Page <p> Notices during the purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some minor style tweaks done for consistency . <p> WooCommerce notices <p> When customers reach checkout , the checkout field display will use the standard two-column layout for the billing and shipping information . <p> Checkout Fields <p> The checkout review will use the standard table and payment form layout , while payment form inputs are large and readable . <p> The only thing I 'd love to see here would be a different style for the " active " item in the account navigation , such as bolding the active " Orders " link my screenshot above . <h> Lenscap Review : Blog &amp; Content <p> When customers get into the content side of your site , they can visit your blog or other custom content and see posts in a list layout . Your default sidebar and widgets will be used on these pages , letting you provide tools for site search , blog categories , or other relevant widgets . <p> Blog Archive <p> Where I really love Lenscap is in the reading experience , as this is lacking for many eCommerce themes . The blog archive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and read . <p> Blog Post <p> This makes Lenscap a great candidate for sites using plugins like WooCommerce Memberships to sell content access , as the store design is simple and functional , but content still looks great . <p> Memberships + Lenscap <h> Lenscap Review : Code &amp; Support <p> One of the major reasons I like themes from Array is the quality of the theme code and support . Lenscap includes some unique WooCommerce styles without overriding tons of WooCommerce templates or causing issues with popular plugins . Code is readable , clean , and well-structured , and Lenscap includes hooks and pluggable functions where you need them . <p> The best part , however , is that support is fast and responsive , and updates are frequent and useful no buying a theme and never getting another update ; Lenscap has had several patches and small refinements already , as is typical of themes built by Array . <h> Lenscap Review : a Content-Focused WooCommerce Theme <p> Im excited to see Array building more eCommerce-focused themes , and while Lenscap is still more geared towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , I think it makes it a great option for certain kinds of WooCommerce merchants . <p> The WooCommerce-specific widget areas , consistency between WooCommerce pages and the rest of the theme , and small improvements to the product page layout ensure that its useful for WooCommerce stores , while providing a great blog focus and reading experience for merchants who want to highlight their content . Membership sites or stores with an active blog should give it a look , and keep an eye out for more eCommerce themes from Array in the future . The inside scoop is that there are more store-focused themes in the works = <p> If you 're interested in picking up Lenscap , nows a great time !

@@98138317 @2338317/ <h> WP Tao Review : Built-in Analytics for WordPress eCommerce Sites <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> The data you can get via online analytics forms a marketers paradise . You can determine which items are added most often to a customers cart , how often customers add items to the cart , track pageviews , customer logins , and all sorts of data . <p> While many merchants use external analytics tools , such as Google Analytics , Kissmetrics , or Mixpanel to track events and user behaviors on their sites , there are also tools that you can use to track this data from within WordPress . <p> WP Tao is a free plugin that helps eCommerce merchants using WordPress track site events and user behavior to gain insight into purchasing decisions and the browsing experience in their stores . <p> This will give you insights into customer browsing and shopping behavior , as you can see events like page visits or adding an item to a cart , while also tracking these events on a per-user basis so you can see customer data and effectively sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Set Up <p> You should n't need to do much settings configuration once WP Tao is installed and activated , but you can make some tweaks under WP Tao &gt; Settings . I 'd recommend first preventing tracking for some of your users , such as administrators and shop managers , who you wont be marketing to and thus probably do n't  need to track . <p> Under the " Maintenance " settings tab , you can also determine which data is stored long term vs only temporarily . As WP Tao stores all data on your site , for some events that happen most frequently , you may want to keep them only for a set period of time . I 'd recommend limiting events like " Visited page " and " User identified " to a set time period ( e.g. , 90 days , depending on your average visits ) . <p> These are all optional settings , however ; if you want to use the plugin as-is for testing , you can certainly do so , and you 'll be up and running without any configuration needed . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WP Tao is event tracking . This will give you insights into user actions on your site so you can track most popular pages , add to cart events , comments , or other interactions with your site . <p> Once you 've set up the plugin , you can begin to view all of your site events under WP Tao &gt; Events . This will show you all tracked events , along with the event type and user information for the event . <p> Over time , you 'll see your tracked events grow , and both registered and guest users will be tracked . While a guest user ca n't always be authenticated , WP Tao will do its best to track unique users based on either a cookie or a " fingerprint " ( distinctive user details such as the IP address , browser , etc ) so that your reporting is accurate , and guest users are n't  tracked as multiple distinctive users . <p> You 'll see this with guest users who are unidentified , as theyll still have a " pseudo " I 'd assigned ( note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if that guest returns at a different time , their browsing data can still be associated with this pseudo I 'd rather than simply being tracked as " yet another guest " . While guest data can be typically unreliable , this pseudo-identifier ensures you come as close as possible to tracking unidentified guests as unique people . <p> When events are related to order or payment data , the order record will be linked to from the event message so you can quickly see what items were purchased . This will work for both WooCommerce order and EDD payment records so you can easily view order information . <p> All of the following events are tracked on your store so that you can gain insights into your sales funnel and customer browsing behavior : <p> page visits <p> user login <p> user registration <p> adding comments <p> submitting a contact form <p> item added to cart / removed from cart <p> order placed <p> payment submitted <p> As your tracked events build , you 'll get a really nice global view of all of your site occurrences for your guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from , which pages are visited , which items are added to the cart , and who reaches out with contact requests . This gives you a detailed look at the lifecycle of each browsing session . <p> You can also view events on a per-user basis to examine a particular customers behavior further . If you either click on a user name in your event timeline , or go to WP Tao &gt; Identified , you 'll be able to access more detailed information about site visitors . <p> By clicking on a users name ( or the " Show Profile " quick action ) from the event list or " Identified " list , you can see all events that have been tied to this user on your site . <p> If you want to get some additional information about registered users , or add details to the user profile , this is also possible . <h> WP Tao Review : User Information <p> While under WP Tao &gt; Identified , you can edit users or take action for users . <p> If you click the " Edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone numbers to customers , letting you save some details for future customer service or analytics usage . <p> You can also take actions for specific users : clear their event history , clear the user identification , or blacklist the user from tracking ( in case you have test customer accounts you want to exclude from analytics ) . <p> This helps to ensure you 're only tracking the users you want to track real , live customers for the most accurate set of analytics data . <h> WP Tao Review : Analytics Dashboard <p> All of the data WP Tao tracks for your site can be seen in the summary under WP Tao &gt; Dashboard . This allows you to get a quick overview of your sites performance in one view . <p> From here , you can click on the " Report " icon in the bottom right to get a more detailed look into any of the metrics on your dashboard . This can let you see sales over time , pageviews per day , user registrations , and more . <p> While seeing all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only as good as the actions you decide to take with it . Therefore , let 's see what you could do based on the insights gained from WP Tao . <h> WP Tao Review : See Customers Who Abandon Carts <p> While you do n't  have the data needed to reach out to guest users , you can certainly check your reports for customers who have added items to their carts . You can then see if this customer completed an order with the site or not . <p> Youd want to go to your " Events " view , then filter out events for " add to cart " actions as well as " new orders " . You can also scope the events to the last 30 days so you 're not looking for reports over all time . From here , you can see if a cart has been abandoned . <p> If the customer has added an item to the cart , but not completed an order within a day or two , you could email that customer to check into whether or not they intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer in the process ( for example , were shipping costs too high ? waiting for a sale ? etc ) . <p> If you want to take abandoned cart analysis a bit further , you can also look into the " Recover Lost Sales " premium add-on to automate the process . <h> WP Tao Review : Find Frequent Reviewers <p> Word-of-mouth recommendations are often one of the most powerful motivators for a customer to purchase . Its the reason so many of them read product reviews before deciding to buy from your store . <p> Knowing this , you can encourage reviews and solicit them from your most active reviewers and commenters on your site . You can search your site events for " Comments " , then review which customers have recently commented on your site . <p> You can then reach out to these active and engaged customers to solicit reviews , or send them previews of new products in exchange for initial reviews for the product in your store . <h> WP Tao Review : Track Email Campaign Revenue <p> There are several official add-ons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing integrations . These integration plugins serve 2 purposes : <p> You can identify guest users or non-logged-in users based on campaign clicks . Many times , email marketing tools use tracking links to track clicks from users on your list . WP Tao can use these same tracking IDs to identify customers when they get to your site by clicking an email campaign . <p> This let 's you get some insight into how effective emails are for leading into a shopping experience or adding items to the cart . <p> You can also monitor purchasing performance for a campaign based on this user tracking . This allows you to see how much revenue has been generated from the campaign within your WP Tao dashboard . <h> WP Tao Review : Other Notes <p> WP Tao is a free plugin , so basic support is available via the WordPress.org forums . There 's also ample documentation available for help with set up and usage , which also provides a great overview for what kind of events are tracked . I was also impressed by the availability of developer documentation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is well-structured and code quality is good . WP Tao will add several custom tables to your sites database ; however , as its tracking events ( which means there are tons of pieces of data logged ) , this is better served as part of its own table than a core WordPress table anyway . While this may make it more difficult to query or access information ( since developers cant use core WordPress functions ) , it does help with performance and structure overall , and the developer documentation should assist here as well . <h> Using WP Tao for eCommerce Analytics <p> I 'm not typically a fan of storing massive amounts of data like site events within your database , as writing data often to your database has the potential to slow your site down . However , WP Tao is well-structured and should handle a large number of site events with no issues , so its a viable option for many SMB merchants . <p> For users who find off-site analytics tools like Google Analytics or other apps overwhelming or difficult to use , WP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up and running , as little configuration is needed . More importantly , the data on events and reporting is easy to access and understand , helping merchants to learn more about customer shopping behaviors on their site . <p> As WP Tao is free ( with a small selection of premium add-ons ) , this also gives any merchant a chance to try the plugin out to see if theyd like to incorporate analytics on-site within their WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads stores . <p> Note : This post see our editorial policy . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> Hey Gule , it sounds like you 're updating the publish date when you republish the product since sorting wo n't work for you .

@@98138318 @2338318/ <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> WP eCommerce is one of the most mature eCommerce solutions for WordPress , but its growth and core development have slowed in the past couple of years . New users sometimes had difficulty finding the extensions or themes they needed to create the store that they wanted , and the plugin had almost a decade worth of code that made both maintaining backwards compatibility and compatibility with newer versions of WordPress challenging . <p> With the version 3.9 release last week , a new approach , brand , and ecosystem have been launched , and over 70% of the codebase has been rewritten to improve performance and lay better groundwork for future updates . <p> While the WP eCommerce 3.9 release implements some huge changes ( including some changes to the ecosystem we 've covered ) , the previous 3.8.14 release actually contained significant internal changes as well . Well go through some of what 's changed in each release , and what users will see when using the newest version of the plugin . <h> WP eCommerce : Version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about the previous v3.8.14 release . One change from this version that I did like was the updates to the Add / Edit Product page , as the UI was greatly simplified and improved . Prior to this version , there were about a million meta data boxes that you could fill in for products , which could be confusing and time-consuming while creating products . <p> 3.8.13 Product Data <p> In v3.8.14 , this page has been simplified and is far easier to navigate . Most of this information is grouped more appropriately into tabbed boxes instead : <p> 3.8.14 Product Data <p> However , users probably did n't  notice much else going on with the version 3.8.14 plugin release , but the plugin architecture changed massively . The development team is paying off a lot of technical debt that 's built up over the years while still maintaining backwards compatibility to avoid breaking changes . The changes made in this version have improved performance and stability , as hundreds of bugs were fixed and changes made . <p> The customer meta API was entirely re-architected , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes paved the way for the version 3.9 release , which makes even greater strides towards reviving the platforms growth . <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Overview <p> We interviewed the platform head honchos for some information about this version release , which provided some information about how the platform and marketplaces will continue to grow . However , they also gave us some information about plugin-specific changes . <p> Lead Developer Justin Sainton has stated that their goal is to " provide developers with the best , most robust , most extensible platform for building eCommerce sites . " The changes in v3.9 keep this goal in mind . Justin elaborated on these changes : <p> With our new theme engine , were providing one of the most UX-driven theme frameworks for eCommerce that exists today . Its a breeze to work with and to create themes for , and were anticipating significant growth in the premium theme market now that this is part of our core platform . <p> With our new payment gateway API , we 've introduced a modernized API that no longer reeks of the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystem . <p> Finally , tying it all together , weve officially launched our developer marketplace . This marketplace is pretty neat . It allows developers to create premium plugins for WP eCommerce ; host , tag and manage releases through BitBucket or GitHub and sell directly on WPeCommerce.org and right within the WP eCommerce plugin . Its an revolutionary step forward for us and we anticipate that it will be an incredibly invigorating year for our developer community . <p> The theme engine is exciting , as finding WPeC themes can be challenging and I 'm hoping this spurs on more quality theme development . While this is inactive in WP eCommerce 3.9 ( but can be activated ) , refining this and activating it will be a focus for version 4.0 . <p> Including themes and premium plugins in an in-app marketplace will be a huge convenience boost for users , and makes it far easier to find trustworthy add-ons . The Payment Gateway API will also lead to improvements that users will benefit from , as payment gateway development is facilitated . <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re-brand and restructuring around the plugin to create a stronger ecosystem . WP eCommerce officially brings Justin Sainton on as the lead developer with this release as a co-owner ( along with Dan Milward ) invested in the platform and ecosystem growth . Having a leader on the development front will help drive the plugin forward , as this was sometimes missing in recent years . A united brand , renewed leadership , and official ecosystem are all aimed at jumpstarting growth . <p> This official ecosystem is a major part of the change . Previously , the premium plugin marketplace was located at GetShopped.org , which could be confusing for customers that were looking for information about WP eCommerce and expecting to see a brand around the plugin . Now , all premium extensions , support , and information is located at WPeCommerce.org . <p> Purchasing add-ons was also inefficient , as customers could n't access licensing information and API keys upon checkout . Now user accounts are created so that its easy to access downloads , licensing information , and support . This also bring everything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifying shop management for users . <p> WP eCommerce is also partnering more closely with trusted third-party developers for add-ons so that customers have the tools that their stores need . A major benefit to this is the inclusion and expansion of an official marketplace . <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review : Marketplace <p> WP eCommerce has always had premium plugins available , but there was a distinction between " core " add-ons and " community " add-ons . This is now gone in favor of an official marketplace , where both add-ons from the core team and vetted plugins from other developers are available . <p> This provides a great resource for customers so that they can find quality extensions for their stores , and these add-ons will consistently be supported and maintained . Customers no longer have to go to several different developers to get support or information about plugins individually . <p> Using WPeC 3.9 , users will be able to access the plugin marketplace directly from their WordPress dashboards : <p> Extension Marketplace <p> Even better , they can purchase directly from within WordPress using their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamless . <p> Purchasing within WordPress <p> The new WP eCommerce 3.9 add-on marketplace is powered by WPEconomy ( an Instinct creation ) , and allows users to search for add-ons ; view featured , new , and most popular add-ons ; or view add-ons by lowest price . <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review : Features Added <p> Aside from the massive ecosystem changes and code refactor , WP eCommerce 3.9 also adds some new features . Your customers can now checkout with a cart total of $0 , which was an issue for many shops in the past . <p> A new payment gateway API is included in this version , which makes it far easier for developers to add and manage payment gateways . While this is n't something you 'll really see as a shop owner , it lays the foundation for better payment gateway integration . The core payment gateways were also updated with this change . The manual gateway , along with PayPal Digital Goods , have been added as well . <p> Coupons have been improved , as they no longer require expiration dates . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can now simply omit starting and ending dates . <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review : Looking Forward <p> Finally , v3.9 includes the new theme engine , though this is n't active since its being refined for the 4.0 release . This includes frontend improvements that simplify the customer experience and will make it far easier to theme the plugin . While the theme engine components are n't  set in stone , here 's a preview of some coming adjustments that you may see in version 4.0 . <p> The shopping cart features a cleaner layout , and makes adjusting the cart easier for customers along with making it easier to style within themes . <p> Cart Page <p> The checkout process has also been changed . A multi-step checkout is now enabled by default , which will help some international sellers ( for example , German stores are required to have this ) . Breadcrumbs for the process are clearly noticeable so that customers know exactly what will be required to complete checkout : <p> Checkout <h> WP eCommerce 3.9 Review : Conclusions <p> While not every change in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been made for WPeC shops . The in-app marketplace is a big win in my mind , as users will have a centralized , trusted location from which they can easily get themes and plugins . This is also tied into the re-brand that 's meant to revitalize the ecosystem and provide a centralized , trusted source for plugins , themes , and support . <p> Other changes are " under-the-hood " with this release , such as the payment gateway API , huge codebase improvements and rewrites , and the in-progress theme engine . While users may not necessarily see every aspect of these changes in action , theyll benefit from improved shop performance and payment processing capabilities as developers implement these changes . These long-term plays are important investments in the plugins future , and provide a far more stable base on which to build . <p> The WP eCommerce 3.9 release , along with the changes to Instinct and the ecosystem , keep WPEC moving in the right direction and will hopefully spur on more growth in the premium marketplace . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive never needed to do anything with ecommerce until now . So I 'm hoping to find a way to solve both issues . I 've started looking at woocommerce because I know they 've been around for a while and they have themes which I 'm sure tie in with their ecommerce system . I came across this review in my search efforts , but I see the comment above by someone wanting to move away from Woo . Regardless , if price is n't a factor , which system would you recommend ? And , if price is a factor , then which system would you recommend ? If you 've got a good review post of the top options available , I 'd be glad to check that out as well . Thanks . <p> Hey Mike ! In terms of themes , you probably have the largest selection with WooCommerce , but here are all of our articles on themes . As for plugin choices , I 've got an entire series on eCommerce plugins that I 'd recommend starting with , and then you could pick a tag for a particular eCommerce plugin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it needs will dictate which plugin is best for you , as each plugin has its own strengths , weaknesses , and associated costs . 11393 @qwx871393

He also writes at Member Startup , where he writes about eCommerce in general , and covers tips and advice for running a membership site . <p> Ultimately your goal in selling online is to improve sales , right ? Everyone wants more money in the bank and faster growth . When it comes to selling online through your eCommerce platform , presumably WordPress , this is important as ever . <p> Are you reaching all the potential customers out there ? Are there problems with your website that are preventing a large and ever growing viewership from buying something on your site ? <p> Let 's try a quick experiment before we get into the purpose of this article to answer these questions . <p> One of two things just happened . You perhaps saw that your website works well on a number of devices out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you maybe saw that your website does not look good at all on mobile devices , making the website annoying to use with constant scrolling and panning . <h> Why Mobile Matters <p> Without argument , mobile devices are on the rise . We as humans are taking technology with us more and more everywhere we go . <p> Not only are we in what 's called the Post-PC Era , users more than ever are buying things online . No longer is it just about having a mobile phone , mobile texting , mobile email , and a vast number of other users . <p> Now , mobile is our market place . You and I and your customers . We buy on the go . <p> During this weekend , 1 in 4 dollars spent online were on a mobile device . ( Source : Business Insider ) <p> If you were one of those that realized your site is n't mobile ready , then you could be missing out on 25% of your sales . <p> When comparing that to just a few percentage points that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's obvious that mobile is something that eCommerce websites need and they need it yesterday . <h> Mobile Choices <p> There are several different ways to make your website mobile ready . However , not all ways of making your website mobile are desirable . <p> There are essentially two ways of doing mobile today . <p> First , you could create a completely different version of a mobile site . That means that your website would say something like m.yourwebsite.com instead of yourwebsite.com . <p> Second , your website can be what is called responsive , which makes it compatible with any device ( including desktops and mobile ) . <p> Because the first option can cause many issues by not being compatible with all devices , in addition to splitting up traffic and URLs , let 's assume that in today 's world a completely dedicated and separate mobile version of your site is n't the way to go ( because it usually is n't ) . <h> What is Responsive Design ? <p> Responsive Design is simple at it 's core . I define responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automatically adaptable ( responsive ) , and a single website to manage . <p> Essentially , when a customer visits your website , the code detects the size of the screen for that user , and automatically serves them the content at the right size . <p> You can try this on a site you know is responsive ready . Just pull the width of the browser , and you 'll see it automatically adapt . <p> The main advantages of responsive design are : <p> Device Proof Who knows what Apple will come out next ! We have no idea what the size of the screen will be until the day it 's released . With responsive design , it does n't matter . Because it 's liquid , and not a fixed UI , it 'll adapt to any future device- mobile , tablet , PC , or something else being dreamed up . <p> One URL Instead of the m.yourwebsite.com issue , all your traffic will come to one place , with one focus . Your front page at www.yourwebsite.com will look great on a PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart phone . All while still at www.yourwebsite.com . <p> Simple Management It 's really hard to manage a website ! It takes a lot of time to keep up on any design changes , bugs found by customers , designing pages for new products , and so on . Can you imagine doing that for more than one website ? <p> You do n't need to imagine it . Responsive design takes care of all that . One website to manage , one place to put your content / products . <p> A/B Testing As you progress through the building of your eCommerce platform , it 's important to realize that you can squeeze extra conversions and dollars out of your site by optimizing what you have . <p> Moving a button , changing a color , or a different title can mean a major impact on your conversion . <p> When you start doing this , if you have n't already , responsive allows for one location to track this data . That way you wo n't have to manage the A/B testing of different sources . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analytics will be better structured and more complete when coming from single URLs . Otherwise , you 'll find yourself having to compare data from two different sites , adding extra and unnecessary steps to your already busy schedule . <h> Why Should I Care ? <p> Changing to responsive really does matter and it absolutely will improve your sales . If your site is n't already responsive , you 're no doubt missing out on SOME sales . <p> If you care about sales , and money , which I 'm guessing you do , you should care about responsive web design . <p> Thankfully , all of this is provable with some studies that have been done . <h> ONeill Clothing <p> Right now I 'm living in Hawaii . Just for a few months . I 'll need some sweet board shorts to go surfing , swimming , and snorkeling . <p> I bet I could find some great shorts over at O'Neill ! <p> O'Neill proved that responsive matters . They took their original site , let it run for 3 weeks ( collecting non-responsive data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version for another 3 weeks . <p> The results ? Get ready to be blown away . <p> For iPhone/iPod : <p> Conversions increased by 65.71% <p> Transactions increased by 112.50% <p> Revenue increased by 101.25% <p> For Android devices : <p> Conversions increased by 407.32% <p> Transactions went up by 333.33% <p> Revenue increased by totally crazy 591.42% <p> When I saw this data , it was quite mind-blowing to me . Yeah , I know that responsive/mobile matters . It just makes sense . <p> Seeing numbers to back up those claims is completely different . <p> The numbers are quite unbelievable . What about a more moderate example ? <h> Skinny Ties <p> Are you in the market for a skinny tie ? I think I might try one out . I do n't know though . Perhaps too trendy for me . <p> Good thing the guys over at Skinny Ties switched over to responsive ! <p> The results ? <p> Revenue from iPhone grew a staggering 377.6% <p> iPhone conversion rate increased 71.9% <p> Revenue from all devices went up 42.4% <p> Overall Conversion rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these numbers are a bit more reasonable . The O'Neill stats were slightly unbelievable , although true . Is this more what we can expect from our own sites by switching to responsive ? I think so . <p> ( Thanks to Peep over at ConversionXL for his great article on responsive design , and these stats . ) <h> I 'm Convinced . Now What ? <p> You 're now thoroughly convinced it 's time that you take mobile seriously . Now what ? <p> The good news is that responsive design is n't some dark corner of the WordPress theme market right now . All the good themes and frameworks available these days are responsive ready , meaning they 'll work right out of the box with different screen sizes . <p> If you 're in the market for a good theme and you 're just getting your site started up , then that 's great news for you . You can easily find a responsive theme . <p> However , if you 're in the camp that already has another theme that is n't currently responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The trouble is that more than any other type of use for WordPress , eCommerce is one of the most difficult to re-design . You are n't just another blogger . You 're actually selling something , and sometimes hundreds of items , not to mention all of the templates that have to be taken into account . <p> This is going to be difficult , and will take your time and investment . <p> There are several options for getting your theme responsive ready : <p> Get a completely new theme ( This is best for self-doers / low budget ) . <p> Hire a web developer to turn your existing theme into a responsive theme ( This may not be possible ) . <p> Hire a developer to build a custom framework for your site , using responsive design ( expensive , may end up looking the most professional ) . <p> Quick Note : Not all responsive design is created equal . Just because you switched to a responsive theme does n't mean your website is usable or functional . This is where a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , switching to a new design and a new framework for WordPress can be a difficult and time consuming process , especially if you bought a theme that bundled functionality instead of using plugins . Based on the sales numbers and potential up-tick in business for the foreseeable future , however , it 's an endeavor worth considering . <p> Once you 're on a responsive theme or framework , your life will be much easier ! Responsive designed themes are inherently ' light weight ' and load much faster than other types of themes . Apart from that , you gain all of the sales benefits mentioned previously . <h> Conclusion <p> Some would call responsive design a fad . Then again , some have called the internet a fad . Responsive design is the way of the future . <p> Why ? <p> It makes our website adaptable to any device and gives potential customers a visually pleasing and far easier experience that they now expect . That way , they can open their wallets and help you grow and you help them find what they need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you 're willing to leave behind 25% of your business due to a design change , be my guest . My guess is you wo n't do that , however , and responsive design will be in your near future . 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Great insight . The ONeill stats are pretty staggering . I had a guy at a conference the other day tell me sales from iPad had gone up 800% since they switched to a responsive layout . I 'm just about to start work on a new eCommerce site for a client so Ill definitely bear this in mind . Thanks . 
@@98138320 @2338320/ <p> Does reading about SSLs and PCI compliance make you want to curl up in a ball ? How about thinking about the logistics of hiding premium membership content or recurring billing for subscriptions ? That 's what our next WordPress eCommerce Platform is counting on . Cart66 Cloud is an all-in-one eCommerce solution that takes care of security and PCI compliance for your WordPress store so that you can sell products from any WordPress website . Formerly PHPurchase , Cart66 has gone from competing in the premium plugin space to becoming a WordPress solution for hosted shopping carts that specializes in membership and subscription products . Setup is required in your Cart66 account and from your WordPress dashboard , but chances are you wo n't need any extensions or functionality besides the Cart66 Cloud offering . <p> Cart66 Cloud $199 per year . These prices are advertised as discounts of the $49 per month or $499 per year pricing . At current prices , Cart66 Cloud is a very competitive eCommerce option based on the store options and support that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need paid extensions ( like gateway integrations ) or eCommerce themes to start selling ; all checkout experiences take place on Cart66s servers , so you do n't  have to worry about getting an SSL ( anywhere from $10 to thousands per year ) and Cart66 Cloud is compatible with many different themes . Note that only your shopping cart and checkout are hosted on Cart66s servers , so you 'll still need to host your own site . <h> Cost summary : <p> Pricing is easy with this one ; once you have a WordPress site set up , all of the eCommerce costs are bundled up into one $25 per month or $199 per year payment . <p> Once you 've signed up for Cart66 , you 'll have access to both a Cart66 Dashboard and the Cart66 WordPress plugin that will integrate the Cart66 services with your WordPress site . Setup on the Cart66 end was very easy , as the UI is clear and navigation is simple . Youre greeted with a Quick-Start Guide and other helpful documentation when you first log in : <p> Cart66 Backend : Dashboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your home country and store URL . You 'll also want to go to the Setup &gt; Keys menu to get your Secret Key ; you 'll need this to configure the WordPress plugin . <p> Configuring store settings from the WordPress end was n't too bad using the Cart66 Quick Start Guide as a reference , but some settings do n't  include descriptions , which could be confusing for some users . For example , knowing what each input for " Product Loaders " will do , which page template is best to use , or knowing that customers with memberships probably shouldnt be redirected to their order history upon logging in would be helpful . However , I did find most of what I needed in the documentation ; some of the settings help was outdated , but gives you the general idea of what you 're looking for . Hopefully , links to appropriate documentation are included in the plugin settings page in the future to make this a little bit easier . <p> WP Backend : Cart66 Settings <p> Tax options are geared towards allowing you to create regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping . You can configure a general region , then set rates for that region . You 'll need to know the tax information for the areas in which you sell or ship , and this was one of the topics I could n't find much documentation for . <p> Cart66 Backend : Tax Options Setup <p> here 's my interpretation of what you can do with these settings ( if someone can correct me , please feel free to ! ) . I 'm familiar with the Philadelphia region , so Ill use that as an example . Sales tax in Pennsylvania is 6% ; however , taxes in Philadelphia are 7% since the city adds its own tax . Let 's say I have stores/locations both in and outside of Philadelphia . Now , if I have an " add " rate set for the US ( or just Pennsylvania ) , I can either " replace " orders in Philadelphia zip codes with a 7% tax ( this seems to be the option I 'd use if I needed to ) , or I believe I could have a " compounded " 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6% tax ( not sure how this would work since Im unfamiliar with this setup maybe another add tax code would do it ) . If anyone has any other example cases to provide for these options , I 'll be happy to include them : ) . I could n't find solutions in the knowledge base or documentation for this to help me out as to what each option will do . <p> Cart66 Backend : Tax Rates &amp; Regions <h> Physical Products <p> With Cart66 , you can sell simple , variable/configurable , downloadable , membership , and subscription products . All store management has to take place in the Cart66 dashboard , and product addition is included in that idea . The good news is that product addition is very easy , and variable/configurable product addition may use one of the easiest setups Ive seen . Notice you do n't  add any product description or images ; you 'll be doing this from your WordPress pages instead . <p> Cart66 Backend : Adding Products <p> Variable products are very easy to customize ; no attributes to write , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property will vary , set the values for it and how the customer will select it , and that 's it . I would have liked this better if it included a link to documentation or an explanation of different input types for new customers ( just as I suggested for " settings " ) , but its pretty easy to figure out if you 've never done this before . <p> Cart66 Backend : Adding Product Variations <p> Once you 've added this products in your Cart66 dashboard , you 'll add them to your WordPress store via shortcodes . Keep reading under " Shortcodes " to see what this looks like from the WordPress end . <h> Membership and Subscription Products <p> For creating membership products , I did have to refer to the documentation for some help . When members sign in , they 're directed to the " Order History " page from Cart66 by default . When I tried to return to the site with my test membership , I was no longer signed in . I was n't sure why this occurred , and I found the answer in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating sign in/out links . Its necessary to change the default page to which you redirect members when they sign in to something on your site rather than the " Order History " Page , which probably should have been a notice in the WP plugin itself so I knew that was the case . <p> In any case , the actual product creation is very easy . Simply select how long the membership is valid for ( this can only be expressed as " days " ) , then set pricing and naming for the membership in the basic product info . Easy ! <p> Cart66 Backend : Creating Memberships <p> From the WordPress side , you can determine what content is restricted based on category for posts , and/or pages if you 'd like to include them in your premium content . This is the part I really thought was useful in Cart66 . Once you 've selected which post types or pages are restricted , they 're automatically hidden from the blog page , widgets , and anything else unless customers are signed in . Its a really easy way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium articles . If you 're interested in this , I would check out this documentation for more details on restricting content . <p> WP Backend : Membership Settings <p> Want to restrict an article that does n't  fall into one of your designated categories ? No problem . You can do that right from the post or page editor in the WordPress backend on the right-hand side of the page/post editor : <p> WP Backend : Membership Setting while Editing Product <p> Subscriptions were very easy to set up as well , but did n't  have too much flexibility in the terms for the recurring billing . Billing has to be a function of months , not days or weeks . However , the fact that ( 1 ) subscriptions are supported automatically is awesome , ( 2 ) Cart66 Cloud let 's you use any of their payment gateways to process subscription billing ( without purchasing any add-ons ! ) , and ( 3 ) subscriptions are just as easy as memberships to set up , which made me forget all about wanting to bill in terms of weeks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 2-3 paid plugins to get the functionality for subscriptions and memberships that you get with Cart66 Cloud . <p> Cart66 Backend : Adding Subscriptions <h> Shortcodes <p> Since products are created in your Cart66 account , and not within your WordPress dashboard , you 'll need to insert products on your site using shortcodes . You can insert shortcodes using the Cart66 " Add Products " button next to the WP " Add Media " button . <p> WP Backend : Add products via shortcode <p> When you view your product on the frontend , notice that the shortcode only displays the price and " Add to Cart " button to the user . Youll have to add your product information manually . For physical products , this was the big downside for me . Youll have to spend a lot of time setting up your catalog structure manually , and creating shopping or product pages on your own , which is going to take some time in design . <p> Frontend : Product Shortcode Display <p> This setup does offer you a huge amount of flexibility in how products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds or thousands of products ( which is why I really like this platform for **25;2303;TOOLONG , but probably would n't use it for stores with a lot of physical products unless you 're okay with a lot of setup ) . Membership products and subscriptions are displayed using shortcodes in the same exact way : <p> Frontend : Purchasing Subscriptions <p> However , you may not know what each attribute means or what the values for each represent , which left me curious . You can either test every one to see how it displays , or Cart66 has a Shortcode reference available for the possible shortcodes you can use throughout your site . There are shortcodes to add products , add a " buy now " link , and show or hide products based on membership . The shortcode guide provides the attributes accepted in each shortcode as well . <p> Since you 're using whatever theme you want for your WordPress store and setting up your own product catalog , the customer experience is pretty much up to you , which has upsides and downsides . Setting up a catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category pages for browsing and individual product pages , but you 'll have to insert products individually and change the layout of the pages yourself . This will get very tedious if you 're selling a lot of different products , and puts a pretty big set-up burden on you before launch . Upsides are that you 'll still benefit from a simple , one-page checkout to reduce cart abandonment , and Cart66 does offer widgets to display shopping cart and membership information : <p> WP Backend : Widgetized Cart &amp; Member Info <p> Since checkout occurs on Cart66s servers instead of your own , you have to spend exactly 0 minutes worrying about PCI compliance and security , which is an enormous benefit for shop owners that just want to focus on growing their businesses . However , since the checkout process takes the customer away from your site , you 'll probably want to make that process as seamless as possible . That 's where Cart66s Page Slurp tool comes in . You can have Cart66 rip the HTML/CSS from your theme and style your cart and checkout pages so that they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers do n't  notice that theyve gone to a completely different site and get nervous or uncomfortable before purchase . They 're then redirected back to you after purchase , and if they do n't  look at the page URL , theyll probably never know they went anywhere . here 's the cart before using the page slurp : <p> Not quite happy with the styling ? You can further edit the HTML/CSS of the slurped page from your Cart66 account : <p> Customizing your Page Slurp <p> Again , we come back to the idea that you may need some styling and/or design for this platform , especially if you 're selling physical products , but you have loads of flexibility in how you want your store to look and act , so the customer experience is entirely in your hands . <p> Cart66 has a manual payment gateway ( cash or check ) set up by default , but payment gateway integrations are included in the service , which means you do n't  have to purchase premium add-ons to make sure you can use your payment processor with your platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set up from the Cart66 dashboard . <h> Payment Options <p> While the only stock live payment option is a manual payment ( a test gateway is included for convenience ) , Cart66 is already integrated with over 50 payment gateways , and supports recurring billing for all of them , so that you can simply access the integration you need for the payment gateway you already use . There are 52 payment gateway integrations to choose from with heavy hitters like Authorize.net , Braintree , Stripe , CyberSource , First Data , PayPal , SagePay , and TransFirst in the lineup . If you use one of these services , you simply have to select the integration for your store and configure it with your API credentials and that 's it . Payment processing is made as simple as possible . <h> Shipping Options <p> By default , Cart66 Cloud includes options for free shipping , weight-based shipping , and price-based shipping . These are flat-rate shipping approaches that you can set a price or weight break for , so do n't  expect to add the exact shipping costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , I set a weight-based shipping method , and I was able to set a maximum weight to offer two pricing tiers . Notice , however , that I cant delete the higher tier and set more rates to have a few " tiers " . Basically , you 're stuck with two weight tiers , so choose wisely grasshopper . You can also set expedited shipping , etc . I 'm sure you can hide some shipping options from the checkout page if you want to mess with the styling and add more shipping , but that was n't something I wanted to spend the hassle doing : ) . You can go through the same setup with price-based shipping , but obviously you 're not going to get exact USPS rates for your shipping costs . <p> There 's no real reporting built into the Cart66 dashboard ; you can view order information , including failed orders , but get no insight into monthly sales , etc . You can see a " live " cart page to see what customers are doing once theyve added a product to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customer Carts <h> Inventory <p> Cart66 lacks inventory management , so you 'll be on your own in terms of keeping track of stock . Again , another reason that I think its great for digital , subscription , and membership products , but not so much for physical products . <p> Cart66 has a knowledge base for registered users , pretty good documentation , and dedicated premium support for Cart66 Cloud users . The knowledge base and documentation will be great for basic questions , and as a reference before contacting dedicated support . In the experiences I had with the support staff , they were friendly , helpful , and responded in a reasonable time frame ( within a day ) . My experience may be biased since I did state I was writing a review , but they do state that theyll respond within 12-24 hours , which is a major concern for most users . If something is wrong with your Cart66 account , your entire checkout process is probably down , not just one paid extension / plugin ( unless , of course , the plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose a huge problem . I could n't find any negative reviews or complaints about support , so it seems safe for me to say that support for this one wont disappoint ( fingers crossed ! ) . <p> With no ability to set dynamic pricing / quantity discounts for products , Cart66 Cloud falls a bit farther behind for physical products in my book ( which is a shame because variations really are so easy to add ) . However , they did just fix an odd pricing quirk with the fact that price increases or decreases for variations werent reflected in the product price next to the " Add to Cart " button . Hopefully this signals that more improvements are coming . <p> For those of you selling digital products , you 'll also enjoy that Cart66 Cloud uses its own CDN , so you wont have use Amazon CloudFront or another CDN : <p> Also wanted to mention that we offer a built-in CDN for managing your digital files for selling digital products , so that has been a great fit for some of our customers as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to set up on their own , it 's all included . <p> Thanks again ! Joey , Cart66 Team <p> One thing I could n't figure out ( and maybe someone could answer this ! ) , is what this little guy was doing at the top-right of my post editor : <p> WP Backend : Mystery Menu <p> I tried some different settings using that little menu for my posts and got nothing . Maybe its just me , but I gave up after a bit . If you have insight , please let me know in the comments ! <p> If you want to sell memberships , subscriptions , and/or digital products , Cart66 Cloud is definitely one of the top contenders for the job . Content is easily restricted for your membership levels , and restriction settings are flexible and easy to use . Subscriptions are really hit out of the park , as you do n't  even have to enable recurring billing with your payment gateway since Cart66 does it for you . All you have to do is set the products up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , and produce great content for your members . <p> The $25 per month price tag is worth it for these services . The ability to add physical products is a benefit , and could be great for some promotional gear or books , but does n't  make up one of the great benefits of using this platform for me and is more of a sidecar feature . Product pages and the catalog have to be set up manually ( which has the potential to be a huge undertaking ) , shipping options are a little bit limited , there are no quantity discounts , and there 's no inventory management tools . You do have maximum control over design and display , but its going to require work and time . Because of this , I see physical product addition as a benefit , but Cart66 does a great job as a membership , digital , and subscriptions specialist , and should probably be viewed in that light . <p> Full Disclosure : Cart66 provided a trial membership of their Cloud services ( at our request ) to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions . Despite this fact , every effort was made to be impartial and write this review from a neutral perspective . 11395 @qwx871395 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 2 Comments <p> Cart66 just changed their pricing structure to an annual rate of $95 a year . might be worth updating this article . If you do n't have quite such intricate needs and want something easier to setup , Cart66 Cloud is a great way to get started with low cost and peace of mind . 
@@98138321 @2338321/ <p> Shopp is a paid WordPress plugin that is geared towards providing more functionality out of the box than most eCommerce plugins . Its been around for several years , and has had time to mature ( just like the WP eCommerce plugin ) , so you 'll benefit from the opportunities for tweaks and changes the developers have had . However , you 'll still need a few paid official add-ons or unofficial plugins to set up a fully operational store . A full list of features is provided to show you what you 'll get for a one-time payment . <p> Unlike many non-hosted WordPress eCommerce plugins , the core Shopp plugin is not free . However , the core plugin does include some extra features and functionality compared to most core plugins ( like built-in subscriptions capability ) , with the potential for paid add-ons . If you want to check it out before purchasing , Shopp offers a free demo for potential users to try out before purchasing . For the core plugin , costs will be either $55 to download for a single site license or $299 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get support for an unlimited number of sites . Both packages also include automatic updates and User Guides , while the developer version has more perks , such as an API guide . <p> Paid add-ons range $25 to 125 each , so we estimate add-on costs of $200 to 300 to get off the ground for some useful plugins and possibly a payment processor . There are official Shopp add-ons or unofficial plugins available for purchase , but it does n't  seem there are other markets ( like Code Canyon ) for Shopp plugins , so you 'll have to search for others from developers if you 're looking for them . <p> There are some " Shopp-Ready " themes listed on the Shopp website as well ; pricing ranges from free to about $80 , but there are n't  many other themes available . However , compatibility seems good with general WordPress themes . <h> Cost summary : <p> Base plugin cost will be $55 for a single site ( $299 for a developer license ) , plus an estimated $200-$300 in add-ons , and about $50 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the plugin is pretty basic . Page settings are included for the shopping pages , but you can only edit names and slugs for these pages , and are unable to customize any content . Image settings are also included , but are a bit awkward to deal with , as you have to set new image types yourself , then modify them . This probably could have been achieved with some preset image options where you can just enter sizes in a box instead for clarity . <p> You can use the Shopp demo site if you want to play around with these settings ( or anything else in the plugin ) before purchasing . Basic setup simply involves company information and entering your Shopp support key : <p> Admin Settings <p> You 'll want to check out the presentation settings for how products will be displayed ( including whether to display out-of-stock products ) . Shopp creates a catalog page automatically using the endpoint you set under page settings ( so you cant delete it ) ; however , you need to add this page to your navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create your own catalog page with a shortcode if you 'd like to customize the layout . <p> Presentation Settings <p> In order to be able to display products , you 'll have to add structure to your catalog . This will include setting parent and child categories for all products if you want to do anything other that simply display all of your products at once , or display one type at a time . Make sure to have an idea of what categories and subcategories you 'll need , since this will require some time . Its not obvious , but within your category is the only place you can add " template " product details . Since these are very annoying to add , you 'll want to set these default product specs/details up for your categories when possible . More on this under " Products " . <p> Backend : Catalog Setup <p> Tax Options are included and can be added based on regions ( by state in the US ) . Rates are pretty basic and straight-forward , but are n't  going to allow a lot of flexibility if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can upload them as well to apply local tax rates in a region . <p> Tax Options <h> Products <p> With Shopp , you can add simple , variable/configurable , downloadable , virtual , subscription , and donation products . Youll have to set up your catalog with categories first , and will want to know what kind of templates ( such as what details/specs will be included ) you have in mind for each type of product because you ca n't bulk edit product details . This does afford you a lot of flexibility in choosing what product details are included , but will require some time on your part . <p> Once the catalog is fully set up , product addition is fairly easy , and includes a name , description , and details/specifications . You 'll want to select the category for each product , and can add images , tags , variations , and more . You can also check a box on the right to have products included as feature products . <p> Backend : Product Editor <p> If you do n't  have a " template @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add product details and fill in the value for the detail manually . If you have a template set up , you just have to fill in values for each specification . You can also add product images to be displayed as a gallery on the product page . <p> Product Editor : Product Details <h> Variable Products <p> Adding product variations is pretty simple . Check the " Variations " box on the right-hand side , and you 'll have the option to add all product variation in the same way that you add specifications . Pricing will change as you add all variations , and there 's a lot of documentation to help you with this process . <p> Product Variations Pricing Settings <h> Subscriptions <p> One of the greatest benefits to using Shopp is the fact that subscriptions products are built into the core plugin . With many other platforms , 2-3 paid extensions will be necessary to get this functionality . You can elect to have a trial period for your product and can set the recurring billing cycle in terms of days , weeks , months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you should note is that you 'll have to manually include the subscription details on the product page since the subscriptions information , such as trial period and billing cycle , are not automatically displayed on the frontend : <p> Frontend : Displaying Subscriptions <h> Shortcodes and Widgets <p> Product collections and individual products are added to pages using shortcodes . You can use the Shopp button from the visual product editor for help on what shortcodes and attributes you can use : <p> Adding Shortcodes <p> Your shortcodes can display a category or an individual product . However , there are a lot of other shortcodes that you can use , such as those for featured or new products , that the shortcode button does n't  include . If you read our Easy Digital Downloads Review , you know that this drives me nuts , since I feel that a shortcode reference should be linked to somewhere in the plugin so that people know which ones are accepted . Regardless , there is a full shortcode reference in the documentation if you want to explore this further . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping cart and category layout using widgets if desired to help with browsing as well : <p> The frontend leaves some styling to be desired , but at least it allows for a grid product layout . Other than that , you 'll have to do the styling yourself if you want to dive into it , or select a good theme and use the theme styling instead of built-in styling ( though this is a personal preference ) . <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> Individual product pages are bit better , as they give you the opportunity to provide a lot of product information , including an image gallery . Again , some styling may be needed or you should ensure your theme overrides this , as the default CSS is pretty standard . <p> Frontend : Simple Product Page <p> Variable products are easy to understand for the customer , and options are clearly laid out . When you choose a variation , prices are also displayed in the list and updated on the product page once the customer has made a selection . <p> Frontend : Variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the customer to not only change quantities , but also change which variation of a product they 've selected : <p> Frontend : Cart Page <p> Shopp boasts a one-page checkout , as many plugins do , which is proven to increase conversions . Customers have less chances to abandon their carts , so conversions are maximized . Guest checkout is allowed , and the checkout process is straight-forward in order to provide 0% frustration for the customer . <p> Shopp has very good basic shipping and payment options built in to the core plugin . By default , you can process payments using Google Checkout , PayPal Express or Standard , 2Checkout , and Manual/Offline payments . Shipping options are better than most basic shipping settings , as you can flat rate ship items , use free shipping , or use tiered shipping settings by weight , cost , or item quantity . <h> Shipping Options <p> Basic shipping options are pretty extensive , and will probably be able to handle the needs of most stores . You can set up free shipping options , but there are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be based on a per item or order total basis , and can also be based on location . Tiered shipping can be set up based on item quantity , order amount , and order weight . You can also set tiers based on percentage rates . <p> Shipping integrations are also available if you need to determine exact shipping rates . There are add-ons for shipping with FedEx , UPS , USPS , and others . <p> Built-in Shipping Options <p> Setting up rates is simple , and provides a lot of flexibility in setup : <p> One downside to using Shopp is the lack of reporting available . You can view orders , but wont get the detailed reporting you see in Easy Digital Downloads or WooCommerce . Youll have no insight into sales per day/week/month , etc. , and wont find information on best/worst sellers unless you track them manually . <h> Inventory <p> Shopp includes basic inventory tracking for your products , and you can view products that have low stock or are out of stock from your catalog page . I could n't find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Shopp supports these , and you 'll have to manually keep an eye stock levels . Backorders are not supported , so you can hide items until new stock is added . <p> Shopp states in their support policy that customers acknowledge that they should n't use the support desk for issues that could result in a large loss of business if matters are not resolved to the desired effect . Many store owners are basing their livelihoods on their stores working as advertised , so many support issues may fall into this category , so this seemed a little odd to me . <p> I understand that this is basically protecting Shopp against the loss of revenues that could be incurred due to technical issues , but I 'd be curious to see how this played out for complex support issues ( which every plugin has at times ) , and if they have to be escalated to a top-level support ticket at $199 . Anyone have experience with this ? <p> Shopp does support using related products , as well as displaying recently used products for customers . Details are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't  like was that I could n't trash products from the product editor , so if I found a product in my catalog I wanted to remove on the frontend , I cant just click " Edit Product " and delete it . I 'd have to go to the catalog , find it , then move it to the trash . Is this a big deal ? Absolutely not , but I like being able to do it for all other WordPress post types . Or maybe I 'm just crazy = <p> The Shopp plugin for WordPress functions as an all-in-one eCommerce solution . Highlights include detailed standard shipping options , and the ability to set flat rates per item or order provides a lot of flexibility for stores . Tiered shipping options are also a great standard option . Payment options are good , and the ability to add donation or subscription products in the core plugin is great ( though adding donations probably could have been a free extension to lighten the core offering since many businesses wo n't need this ) . <p> Downsides are the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , styling on shopping pages and intensive setup in the product catalog and shopping pages will be required for generic themes . The UI is a bit clunky , though it does afford the ability to customize product details . The lack of reporting also takes down the viability of Shopp as a standalone solution a bit , as you 'll need to integrate with an accounting system ( though larger stores should be doing this regardless ) . <p> I also would have liked to see the ability to add memberships as products since subscriptions are supported , as not having memberships eliminates Shopp as an option for sites that provide premium content . <p> For the estimated $325 or so in set up , Shopp is a mid-level contender in the eCommerce platform arena . There are a lot of standard features ( again , subscription inclusion is great and easy to use ) , but the plugin does n't  have a lot of add-ons yet , and catalog organization and product addition were a bit difficult , though they do provide flexibility . Overall , Shopp seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd love to see more options in terms of ready-made extensibility . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article ; If I did n't  test it , I 'm basing my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

@@98138322 @2338322/ <p> The WP eCommerce Plugin is the next heavy hitter in our lineup of WP eCommerce plugins , and is the grandfather of all WordPress eCommerce . It was launched about 8 years ago , so their crew has the benefit of several years of tweaking and debugging under their belts . It currently has the the most downloads of any WordPress eCommerce plugin ( though its just shy of the top spot based on active installs ) . The core plugin has a lot of functionality packed in , so it does allow for a lot of customization right after installation . It seems to play well with a lot of different themes with a little bit of tweaking , so you 'll probably have a bunch of choices in design , but you may need some paid extensions/plugins to make this a fully functional business solution . <p> The WP eCommerce Plugin is a freeWordPress plugin , so you can easily download it and try it out to see if it works for your store . Spend some time testing features , adding different kinds of products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real store to see if it has the functionality you want . The built-in CSV import/export functions could also be very useful to add some products quickly and play around with functions . WP eCommerce has most of the features stores will need ( including a few versions of PayPal to process payments ) to get up and running , and adding a few premium plugins or some custom developed solutions can get the functionality you want . <p> As far as themes go , you probably wont need to get crazy in purchasing " official " themes it seems that WP eCommerce works with the themes we tested , but some design tweaking may be needed ( well cover this a little later ) . Costs will probably come from the fact that you may need a couple of the premium upgrades offered for your store to be fully functional . <p> Most users will almost certainly need the Gold Cart premium extension for $47 to get the product search capabilities and payment gateway integrations ( major gateways included in the bundle are Authorize.net , SagePay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to a couple of other features ( see our wrap up for the full list ) . However , most documentation says that the Gold Cart includes First Data for payment processing , yet the Gold Cart product page does not include it in the list of bundled gateways . Its not included ; you 'll need to purchase it for $49 if you want it . The developer version of the Gold Cart goes for $197 , and gets you 3 API keys for other integration and a couple extra support tokens . You can get these from the Get Shopped site or within your WP dashboard ( though pricing is incorrect ) : <p> In-App upgrade offers <p> There are n't  a lot of official premium plugins available , but there are many from other developers listed on the WPeC Get Shopped site . Other sites , such as Code Canyon , also offer third party WP eCommerce extensions from $10 to $25 . Just as we stated in our WooCommerce Review , quality is varied ; there are some gems ( few and far between in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes a complete waste ) . Developers are not required to provide support or updates for Code Canyon plugins , so it 's really a hit or miss market . <h> Cost summary : <p> Free core plugin , which is awesome , but will need a few premium upgrades to get rolling . We estimate just under $200 for plugins , and cost of your theme is really up to you . <p> WPeC has a lot of features included in the core plugin ( You can see a full list of features on their site ) . You get a lot of functionality for free , but there are some actions that are a little buggy , which some users have noted in reviews . While playing around with some of the settings , I experienced some weird things a couple of times , such as not being able to insert shortcodes using their built-in button in the visual editor . However , you wont have to worry as much about extending this plugin as you do with some others since you have a lot of possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In terms of setup , the installation and configuration is a bit longer than the advertised 5 minutes , and was a little bit confusing at first ( I 'm not a developer , nor do I play one on TV . I know just enough to get by , so take that for what you will ) . There 's a lot of potential for customization with this plugin , but if you 're not a developer , you may need to keep one on speed dial . General settings are easy enough ; you can allow checkout as a guest ( with the option to register at checkout ) , force a secure checkout , and more : <p> Backend : Admin Settings <p> You also have a lot of presentational settings to play around with . This is where you 're taken after installation , so it was a bit odd to see this in front of me after activating the plugin , but whatever . You can move some files to your theme folder to customize them , so from a design perspective , this is a plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " throughout the experience . However , I would advise leaving the " Display per item shipping " to no this confused me for a bit , since per item shipping will be added to the total shipping by flat rate or weight , which could potentially confuse customers . Maybe if you need a " shipping surcharge " for large items or something , I would include this and name it accordingly rather than just " shipping " . <p> Backend : Admin Presentation Settings <p> One aspect which I found a little odd about usability ( but this is definitely a personal preference ) was that the store settings and information was spread throughout the WordPress backend . Store settings are under the WordPress " Settings " menu , but products are in a different menu , and sales information is in the dashboard . The theory behind this is to integrate your store into WordPress , but I prefer to see my store information in one place . Again , just a preference . I 'm sure many people will like that your store is built-in to WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the dashboard : <p> Backend : Dashboard Integration <p> Tax options are included in store settings , but require some setup , and are not really flexible . You can set up " tax bands " for products and set general " tax rates " , which will probably meet the needs of most stores . Just something to be aware of if you 're selling internationally and may have to worry about complex tax rules . However , I will say that I did n't  spend as much time exploring this as I would have if I were actually setting up an international store . Let me know if you have tips for this ! <p> Built-in Tax Options <h> Products <p> New products are created as WordPress posts , so you have an individual product page with a short description and a " More Details " extended description . You can add simple , configurable/variable , downloadable , and affiliate products . Product pages offer a ton of customization , and you can set up a lot of product options in the product editor . A huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid upgrade . If you want to set this based on user roles , you can check out the Wholesale Pricing plugin . <p> You can edit how products are displayed , or use shortcodes to display them on different pages . There 's no built-in featured products display for shortcodes ( there is , however , a widget you can use for featured products ) , so you could do this using a category , or set a featured products page and use shortcodes to display the products you want to display . <p> Backend : Product Addition <p> Product stock and shipping per product ( this is what I was saying I 'd disable or rename " shipping surcharge " ) can also be displayed from on the shopping and product pages . <p> Frontend : Product Page <p> One cool feature that most other platforms do n't  have built-in is the ability to set free products with a donation instead of a price . While I loved the flexibility and options in product settings , I would consider making some things , like a " donation " setting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , rather than have all options present on every single product page . <h> Shortcodes <p> You can also add individual products ( with a " Buy Now " PayPal button ) or product categories to other pages or posts ( or anywhere you can use shortcodes on your site " feature some products in your sidebar ! ) . From the visual page/post editor , you can click the credit card-looking button for some help and to get ideas on what attributes are accepted . <p> Backend : How to add a Product Shortcode <p> For an example , here 's me adding an individual product by selecting it from a list , and adding some products from a category to a page : <p> Using Shortcodes to Add Products <p> And here 's what it looked like on the frontend . You ca n't display new/recent products using shortcodes ( at least not that I found you can display them using a widget like featured products ) , but I added it as a product category ( which would have to be continuously updated if you really wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Customers will have to browse products in list form unless you have the Gold Cart paid extension , so you may want think about that when setting up shop . Maybe you want to make different pages for product categories rather than have your entire catalog on one very long page . However , you can work around this with the free WP eCommerce Grid View plugin , as grid-style browsing is much easier for customers . I did not test this plugin , but reviews were mostly positive . <p> Frontend : Shopping Page <p> Adding products to the cart is easy , and customers have the option of going right to checkout after adding a product . However , there 's no cart page by default . If you want customers to be able to return to their carts , you 'll have to add the shopping cart widget to the sidebar ( or somewhere else if you 're using a full-width display ) . For a plugin that touts its customizability as a bonus , relegating the shopping cart to a widget as a default ( which limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add this elsewhere if you want to . <p> Frontend : Product Added to Cart <p> The WP eCommerce Plugin uses a one-page checkout process , which is geared towards improving sales conversions . Giving customers more steps in the checkout process means more opportunities for them to abandon their carts . Simplifying check out is so important that Amazon patented the one-click checkout , which is now worth billions . Checkout was pretty painless , but the shipping methods displayed ( and calculating shipping ) were a little bit odd , and I managed to break this once by entering an invalid location . Refreshing the page worked , but adding barriers to buying is n't something I want to do with my store . You may want to style this a bit yourself to simplify or hide some of the shipping information . The abundance of options is great , but I want it to be straight-forward for customers . <p> Frontend : Checkout Experience <p> Overall , the rest of the customer experience is easy to understand and there 's not much else to confuse the customer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could consider the WP eCommerce Related Products plugin , which displays other products from the same category . Another useful plugin to improve the customer experience is the freeWP eCommerce Dynamic Gallery plugin , which creates a sliding image gallery on every product page . <p> Payment and Shipping options are good and will get you off of the ground , but as we noted before , you 'll probably want payment gateway integrations to accept anything other than PayPal , and shipping will require some tinkering , as options are pretty good , but can be confusing at first . <h> Payment Options <p> WP eCommerce comes with PayPal Standard ( which can be used in over 190 countries and takes customers directly to PayPal for purchases ) , PayPal Pro , and PayPal Express as default payment options , as well as Google Checkout , ChronoPay , and the option for a manual payment , such as cash or check on pickup/delivery . There are about 15 other payment gateways available as premium upgrades ( such as Mijireh , TransFirst , FirstData , or Stripe ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagepay , and a few others ) . <p> Built-in Payment Options <h> Shipping Options <p> WP eCommerce offers a lot of stock shipping options , and has a few built-in integrations ready to go . You can ship by flat rate ( with some pre-set international zones ) , by weight , or by order price , and can set a price for free shipping ( however , you cant set this for individual items ) . <p> Backend : Shipping Settings <p> There are also a few integrations for your use . Shipwire , Australia Post , UPS , and USPS are already integrated into the core plugin for you to use . This is something else I would have preferred to see as free extensions/plugins ; its unlikely I 'll be using all of these services together , so they 're in the core plugin taking up space when they do n't  necessarily need to be . However , some people will like the fact that they do n't  have to download and install different plugins for all of their shipping providers , so this is really a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purchase . <p> Built-in Shipping Options <p> If these do n't  work for you , you can download the WP eCommerce Premium Shipping plugin for $29 to set up advanced shipping options , such as pricing bands based on total weight in cart , order value , and more . <p> The WP eCommerce Plugin does n't  come with any built-in reporting features , other than providing basic sales stats in the dashboard . You can download the WP e-Commerce Earnings Graph plugin for $15 , which will show a bar graph for store earnings per month , but that 's about as far as reporting will get . There 's also a Store Reports plugin available , which allows to you generate reports for Count Sheet , Product Sold , and Customer reports on a monthly and all-time basis . <h> Inventory <p> Basic stock management is included , and is accessible from product pages . You can enter stock while creating or editing a product , and get notifications if stock runs out ( I could n't find any notification options for low stock , which would be helpful ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of stock as backorders are not accepted . <p> Support seems to be a hot topic with this plugin ( see this or this ) , but I did n't  request any myself , so I 'm relying on second-hand information here . WP eCommerce offers documentation for their plugins , but does not include any active support ( except for reliance on the WP community ) , so you 'll probably want to be in touch with someone that can help with basic questions . I think some of the support complaints stem from misunderstanding this setup : support is not free or included , but relies on the community ( unless you pay for premium support ) . Premium support is available for $47 per support token ( each issue requires a separate token ) . However , reviews of premium support are varied ; some people find it great , others say that they never received responses despite paying for support tokens . I 'm not going to make a judgment on this one since I did n't  use it , but to be safe , I would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with basic support . <p> While not built-in features , you can set wholesale pricing defined by user roles with the Wholesale Pricing plugin . If you want to sell memberships or subscriptions , youll need the Member Access Plugin for $47 to set content accessible for members or to create recurring subscriptions . <p> WP eCommerce does have a lot of marketing tools built in to the core plugin , such as Google Product Feeds and the ability to display Facebook " Like " buttons with your products so that customers can share with friends . These features are usually paid add-ons with other platforms , so their inclusion for free is a big bonus ! <p> Backend : Built-in Marketing Features <p> While you have a lot of opportunity for customization your design and frontend experience , be aware that some styling may be needed . here 's our product page right after installing the plugin while using the WP TwentyTwelve theme : <p> Frontend : Product Page in Need of Styling <p> Not exactly the display I was looking for , so you 'll want to do some tweaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend in with most themes , but it probably wo n't do it all on its own . <p> Currently , WP eCommerce has over 2.4 million downloads on WordPress.org , and is rated 2.8 stars . Keep in mind that this plugin has been around since , like , WordPress 1.5 , so ratings may be slightly misleading . I 'm sure that you could n't do nearly as much with a store upon the plugins initial release , and its had to evolve with WordPress , so maybe some reviews from its early days are influencing that . <p> The WP eCommerce Plugin is an all-in-one eCommerce store solution that provides extensive functionality and customization options . The Gold Cart paid upgrade is probably something most users will need for the product search function , ability to upload multiple images for a product , create image galleries , display products in grid format , and payment processing options like Authorize.net and Sagepay . <p> Current pros include the built-in marketing tools , usable stock shipping options , extensive built-in functionality , and opportunities to extend the core plugin . We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different products and options with the basic plugin . Some cons are the lack of official support , and potentially slow paid support , as well as the probable need for a designer / developer if you 're not inclined to do some tweaking yourself to get ready to roll . As a matter of preference , the core plugin includes a lot of features , but some of these could be turned into free extensions to the plugin rather that bloating the core base . Overall , WP eCommerce is a solid general eCommerce solution , and we think many businesses will find that it can meet their sales needs and will enjoy the ability to blend in with themes they may already have . <p> Please Note : I did not test all of the paid upgrades/plugins that I reference in this article ; If I did n't  test it , I 'm basing my information on reading user reviews or other articles . <p> Full Disclosure : The author of this article also works for SkyVerge , who develops WooCommerce extensions .

@@98138323 @2338323/ <p> Weve written two overviews in the past on WordPress eCommerce plugin usage in January 2015 and June 2015 , so well revisit these statistics after a little over a year to see how they 've changed . <h> WordPress eCommerce : Plugins Examined <p> There are several eCommerce plugins available for WordPress , so we have n't included every possible plugin or membership solution . I 've tried to include the most popular and / or actively-developed plugins , along with those I can get statistics on . However , not every statistic is created equal , so here are some notes before we get started : <p> WooCommerce : WooCommerce has consistently been the most popular plugin for WordPress eCommerce , and this years look is no different . While WordPress.org data for its usage has n't  changed , seeing the difference in BuiltWiths tracking was really cool . <p> WP eCommerce : The grandfather of all WordPress eCommerce has had some statistics tracked under " GetShopped " ( the old website ) and " WP eCommerce " on BuiltWith , so while it looks like BuiltWith has this tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused any hiccups in tracking . <p> Easy Digital Downloads : While EDD is n't the most-used plugin , its growth over the past 1-2 years has been really amazing , so I 'd recommend taking a look at our previous articles and comparing its usage in January 2015 vs now . Incredible changes . <p> WP eStore : As this is a premium plugin ( no free version available ) , tracking usage is a bit tough since you have to rely only on BuiltWith , there are n't  WordPress.org statistics . Something to bear in mind while you read these stats . <p> MarketPress : This has both a free and a premium version of the plugin , so stats from BuiltWith track both of these versions , which makes accurately tracking usage for this a bit difficult as well . WordPress.org usage will only be tracking the free version of this plugin . <p> Shopp : This one is still included in our tracking , but this has n't  gotten much in the way of active development over the past couple years since founder / lead developer Jonathan Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acquired by Proxar before our first dive into usage statistics , and while its still actively developed , it has n't  gotten major feature updates in a bit , as version 2.0 has been in testing for almost a couple years . <p> Cart66 : This is another tough one to track , as Cart66 uses a hosted platform plus an integration plugin for WordPress to connect it to your store , and data varies widely between what BuiltWith says for the platform , and what WP.org says for the connector plugin . <p> Ecwid : Also a hosted platform , but for this one , the WordPress.org statistics are probably better to reference , as Ecwid can be used on several kinds of sites , not just with WordPress . <p> Exchange : Theres no tracking in BuiltWith for Exchange , so there 's nothing to compare WordPress.org statistics to . <p> WP EasyCart : This lacks tracking on BuiltWith as well , so only WordPress.org stats are available . <p> Dropped from this years list is WP eShop , which is no longer available in the WordPress repository @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , we should also be aware of pros and cons of BuiltWith and WordPress.org statistics as a whole . <h> WordPress eCommerce : BuiltWith vs WordPress.org <p> A good question as we go over this data is , " Which one is better ? " Unfortunately , there 's not a " right " answer there ; each source has some positives and negatives to using it . <p> BuiltWith provides data on almost every eCommerce plugin , as its tracking these by scraping data from the site frontend / page source . This helps for plugins that are n't  available on WordPress.org . However , because its tracking all sites , it may be including duplicate or staging sites in its metrics . It also may be missing some sites that remove the identifying information for a plugin , so its hard to know if the missing vs duplicate sites " balance out " . <p> As for WordPress.org , this tracks active installations , and attempts to remove duplicate or staging sites from this data by paying attention to the site name or IP address . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here or other development sites that are included . <p> Once usage tops 1 million , WordPress.org stops displaying increases , so you do n't  know if there are 1 million or 5 million sites using the plugin . I 'm also not sure if the WordPress statistics track sites with the plugin installed , or installed and activated . <p> Using both can at least give us some insight into relative usage and the percent change in usage over time when we look at our previous data . <h> WordPress eCommerce : Current Plugin Usage <p> So without further ado , let 's take a look at current WordPress eCommerce plugin usage metrics . <p> For plugins listed below the divider in this table , remember we may have some trouble tracking them accurately ( see notes below ) . <p> Plugin <p> BuiltWith Total Sites <p> WP.org Total Sites <p> WooCommerce <p> 1,590,594 <p> over 1 million* <p> WP eCommerce <p> 35,689 <p> 40,000+ <p> Easy Digital Downloads <p> 34,295 <p> 50,000+ <p> WP eStore <p> 11,683 <p> n/a ( paid only ) <p> MarketPress <p> 7,670 <p> 5,000+** <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000+ <p> Cart66 <p> 4,760 <p> 900+ <p> Ecwid <p> 33,752 <p> 20,000+ <p> Exchange <p> not tracked <p> 3,000+ <p> WP EasyCart <p> not tracked <p> 4,000+ <p> *WordPress.org only shows 1 million+ for any plugin with over 1 million installations , regardless of actual installation number . <p> **only includes the free version of the plugin , not the pro version as BuiltWith does <p> The statistics for Cart66 and Ecwid are included , but it should be noted that the BuiltWith statistics and WordPress.org are tracking different values . BuiltWith tracks all installations , and in the case of Ecwid , these could be non-WordPress sites . I 'd trust the WordPress.org statistics more for these , as this number tracks the installs for the WP integration plugins for each , which better shows WordPress sites using these . <p> Well take a look at changes over time in these metrics shortly , but let 's take a look at marketshare first . <h> WordPress eCommerce : Plugin Marketshare <p> Within the data gathered from BuiltWith , there are 1,725,247 total sites being tracked using WordPress with an eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those sites are using WooCommerce , which is making up 92.2% of this count . <p> Again , Cart66 and Ecwid may not be fully accurate here since were not sure about their BuiltWith statistics being accurate for WordPress sites , so that would influence this break down a bit and slant a higher marketshare towards WP eCommerce and EDD . <p> So while its obvious WooCommerce is taking up a large chunk of that pie , let 's see what the breakdown looks like if we remove it from the equation . <h> WordPress eCommerce : Non-WooCommerce Usage <p> We can see that the vast majority of sites use WP eCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads , along with Ecwid . Again , however , this has all Ecwid sites tracked , so its probably a much lower percentage than we see here . <p> To try to remove the overstated influence of hosted platforms in that breakdown , we can also look at the estimated 137,900 sites tracked by WordPress.org instead . This may be a bit more relevant , as its only tracking usage of WordPress plugins themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this light , we see that WP eCommerce and EDD are most likely eating up the large majority of non-WooCommerce sites . <h> WordPress eCommerce : Change over Time <p> Now the fun part : let 's see how WordPress eCommerce plugin usage has changed over the past year to see a percentage increase or decrease . Well take a look at BuiltWith data first , along with percentage change . <p> Plugin <p> June 2015 <p> Oct 2016 <p> Change <p> WooCommerce <p> 663,153 <p> 1,590,594 <p> +140% <p> WP eCommerce <p> 55,686 <p> 35,689 <p> -36% <p> Easy Digital Downloads <p> 20,752 <p> 34,295 <p> +67% <p> WP eStore <p> 13,428 <p> 11,683 <p> -13% <p> MarketPress <p> 10,062 <p> 7,670 <p> -24% <p> Shopp <p> 7,457 <p> 4,838 <p> -35% <p> Jigoshop <p> 4,693 <p> 1,966 <p> -58% <p> Cart66 <p> 8,106 <p> 4,760 <p> -41% <p> Ecwid <p> 25,795 <p> 33,752 <p> +31% <p> Total Sites <p> 788,815 <p> 1,725,247 <p> +119% <p> The growth for both WooCommerce and EDD is pretty tremendous . WooCommerce has more than doubled usage , while EDD has picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the WordPress eCommerce platforms are down in usage ( and Ecwid again is tough to read , as we do n't  know if that growth was within WordPress ) , but the WooCommerce growth has driven an increase in WordPress usage for eCommerce as a whole . <p> This most likely means that merchants who previously used other platforms could be migrating to WooCommerce or EDD instead , as other platforms have declining user bases . <p> We can also take a look at WordPress.org metrics , though these are estimated , and the data for WooCommerce is n't as relevant ( so I 'm not going to add percentage change here ) . <p> Plugin <p> June 2015 <p> Oct 2016 <p> WooCommerce <p> over 1,000,000 <p> over 1,000,000 <p> WP eCommerce <p> 70,000+ <p> 40,000+ <p> Easy Digital Downloads <p> 40,000+ <p> 50,000+ <p> MarketPress <p> 7,000+ <p> 5,000+ <p> Shopp <p> 8,000+ <p> 5,000+ <p> Jigoshop <p> 10,000+ <p> 10,000+ <p> Cart66 <p> 5,800+ <p> 900+ <p> Ecwid <p> 10,000+ <p> 20,000+ <p> Exchange <p> 3,000+ <p> 3,000+ <p> WP EasyCart <p> 3,000+ <p> 4,000+ <h> WordPress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw one final , fun metric into play here . The usage for the Shopify WordPress connector plugin stands at 6,000+ installs according to WordPress.org . This would make Shopify one of the top eCommerce providers for WordPress as well , most likely behind WooCommerce , WP eCommerce , EDD , and Ecwid . <p> While eCommerce with WordPress is growing overall , this growth is definitely driven by WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads , as the usage of many other plugins has declined in the past year . <p> WP eCommerce and Jigoshop havent had much active development within the past year , while Shopp has been inactive for some time , so this may contribute to the decrease were seeing . <p> WooCommerce being acquired by Automattic also most likely has some influence here , as its growth rate seems to have increased after the May 2015 acquisition ( though wed need better data to confirm this ) : <p> In short , its a great time to be involved with using WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads , as they have n't lost a beat in popularity over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx871392 
@@98138324 @2338324/ <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> While features are important , performance should also be an integral part of your WordPress hosting selection . A 1 second delay in page load times can decrease conversions by 7% ( Source ) . Both the performance and the features you 'll get from hosting should be important to you when choosing your webhost . <p> This week brought the annual publishing of a couple of truly great WordPress hosting reviews that wed like to share . <h> Detailed WordPress Hosting Reviews <p> The first of these reviews is from Kevin Ohashi at Review Signal . Kevin just published his performance benchmark comparison for this year , which performance-tests several major hosts . This is the most comprehensive testing Ive seen done across several different hosting providers . <p> He s also got an overview chart with features and pricing for the hosted that were tested . These resources are absolutely worth the read if you 're looking for a new hosting provider . <p> In terms of performance , some of the top hosts were Kinsta , Media Temple , Pantheon , Pagely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and WP Engine was in the middle of the pack in terms of performance . The lower performers included BlueHost , DreamPress , and CloudWays . <p> The other detailed hosting summary that 's done annually is the WP Shouthosting survey ( covered here by WP Tavern ) . This survey includes anonymous user reviews for several hosts , so its feedback-based rather than based on peformance testing . <p> Some of the top hosts here were Kinsta , SiteGround , and WP Engine , while BlueHost , DreamHost , and GoDaddy were towards the bottom . <p> Another great source for hosting information is HostingReviews.io . This gathers customer reviews via Twitter by keeping an eye on keywords in tweets and ranking hosts based on the positive vs negative tweet ratio . Some of their top hosts include Kinsta , SiteGround , and WP Engine . <h> My Interpretation of these Results <p> I like to use the Review Signal benchmarks to gauge performance , while I look at WP Shout and HostingReviews.io for some qualitative feedback from customers . This can help to give you a rounded view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> Its really difficult to get a full view of what a hosting company can do unless you 've been with them for some time ( which is another reason I only recommend a couple of hosts myself ) , so using multiple sources of information like this helps to give a rounded view of what the experience with a particular host will be like . <p> Despite solid performance from some larger hosts , the customer service reviews via social media or surveys may indicate that you do n't  want to host your site there . In a nutshell , I do n't  think you should rely on one source of content to make your hosting decisions . Read several types of WordPress hosting reviews to get a feel for performance , features , and service . <h> Our Thoughts on eCommerce Hosting <p> So first thing first : Why does it seem like we ignore some hosting services like FlyWheel and Pagely at Sell with WP ? Because we sort of do . <p> This is not because of their service or performance . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hosts that we recommend to have some features we think are vital for eCommerce sites . For example , Pagelys performance is top-notch and their team provides excellent support . However , some features , such as staging sites , are n't  available until you get to a $400 per month VPS hosting plan . <p> If you 're already at the point where you could be spending this , then your options for hosting obviously open up tremendously . If this is something you can afford , I 'd make sure that you look at Pagely in addition to our recommendations . You may also want to look at options that are more developer-friendly , such as hosting your own site on Amazon AWS , as chances are you have a developer on staff or on retainer at this level . You may not need staging sites when your developer can spin up a testing site using something like MigrateDB Pro rather than using one-click staging ( though I think I 'll always prefer easy staging setup myself ) . <p> With that being said , there are some features I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try to recommend hosting that includes these features at a lower price point so that they 're more relevant to all stores . <p> First , the ability to create a staging or development site is integral . If you experience an issue on a personal blog , the worst that typically happens when patching the issues is that the site looks a bit weird ( or maybe you get a white screen of death that has to be fixed via FTP ) . However , your livelihood remains unaffected . This changes entirely when you 're making money off of your site . <p> Any site that 's generating revenue should have a staging environment , as they 're extremely helpful when testing updates , new plugins or themes , and when interacting with tech support . Its a godsend to me when a WooCommerce site can send access to a staging site that experiences the same issue as a live site . This let 's you debug without the fear of losing orders and revenue . <p> Automatic backups are also necessary , and they should be frequent . Since an eCommerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have frequent snapshots of your site . This is your insurance plan in case something catastrophic happens you do n't  end up losing all of your orders or customers at one time . You can roll back to a snapshot that is no more than 24 hours old and work from there . <p> While I do n't  think these are necessarily required , free migrations are very helpful . No matter which host you 're moving to / from , migrations are awful . There are so many things that can go wrong that you 'll always want the help of a developer . This is not something you want to do by yourself ; some hosts include migrations , while some will do them for a fee , and others require you to hire a migration service or developer . <h> Our Recommendations <p> Hopefully this clears up why we make certain hosting recommendations were not only accounting for performance and service , but also the features offered at lower price points ( $25 to $100 per month ) . As such , we have a few hosts we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full review here of their service . WP Engine has n't  had the sterling reviews that they 've had in the past , but I continue to have good experiences with them on several high-traffic sites . Security has been a focus , as they proactively disable security vulnerabilities when discovered they recently did so with a Jetpack vulnerability . Yes , I have read some negative reviews of their service , but also notice that those reviews are pushing another hosting service for referral commissions instead . This is n't to say that some criticisms are n't  warranted , but seek out several types of reviews to read . Ill throw my vote in as someone that 's had a continuously positive experience with them since just after they launched . <p> Note that they do not include site migrations , so you 'll need to hire someone if you 're moving an existing site . <p> SiteGround : We have a full review for SiteGround as well . I 've also had a decent amount of experience with SiteGround , and they 're dependable with great features and service . They host popular sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for eCommerce sites , as it includes our required features and has more resources dedicated to your site than the other SiteGround shared plans . Site migrations are included . <p> Media Temple : I 've also hosted several sites at Media Temple throughout the years . While they get fairly high performance scores , they seem to lag behind in terms of customer service on most surveys . Most of the sites I host here are ones that do n't  require a lot of maintenance on my part , so I do n't  interact with support very much . If you want good performance with WordPress features , but will have access to a developer who can help guide you with support , their WordPress plan can be a good fit . I 've compared it to SiteGround and DreamPress here ( note that migrations are $150 ) . <p> Services I have n't tried yet , but am curious to try out : <p> Kinsta : Kinsta consistently ranked highly in both the performance benchmarks and customer WordPress hosting reviews this year . This is a great sign , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale as they gain customers , but they may be worth trying out . I 'd previously eliminated them because I thought they did n't  offer some features I wanted , such as Git / staging sites , but I 've found out that they do offer these : <p> . @markjaquith git and staging yes , wpcli is limited to the things that " we have a button for " in the admin , as there 's no SSH in $27-97plans <p> Pantheon : Heres another one that I did n't  realize had our requisite features . There 's not really an introduction plan that will work well , but Pantheon has great scalability and several developer-friendly features . here 's an overview of their services from Post Status . <p> Have you tried Kinsta or Pantheon ? Have experience with any of the hosts we 've mentioned ? We 'd love to hear more from you about them . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392 @qwx871392 <h> 12 Comments <p> Thanks for the mention Beka ! Just wanted to note Review Signal has the largest database of reviews too . Not only do we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years = All of our review data is available at http : **37;2330;TOOLONG <p> Im surprised to see no mention of Synthesis Web Hosting here . I left WP Engine for them because they were unable to upgrade to anything above PHP v5.3 , werent able to solve the somewhat frequent 500 series errors , slow DNS resolution times , etc . <p> This difference has been night and day for me . I did eventually receive an email two months later that claimed to all customers / people on their mailing list that the several issues ( many of which I 'd been experiencing ) had supposedly been corrected for good . Did I go back ? No . I 'm satisfied with Synthesis Web . WP Engine would still require me to stay on ol PHP v5.3 ( three stable versions behind ) and that 's unacceptable to me . <p> Hey Matt , havent mentioned them simply because I have no experience with them . = I do n't  typically like to recommend things I have n't tried or do n't  have it on the list to try , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they allowed staging sites ( see my point about features offered for hosts I recommend ) . Perhaps something for the future = <p> Out of curiosity , what issues have you run into using PHP 5.3 ? Just a memory usage thing ? Most themes / plugins are 5.2-compatible since WP is , so I have n't typically experienced issues with it , but always interesting to hear what other people are doing ! <p> I have experience with Pantheon ( I work there ) . OOTB you get three environments . Only the dev environment can receive code changes via SFTP or GIT . Its free for developers , and all three environments are available . Check it out and send me an email if you have any questions . 11393 @qwx871393 
@@98138325 @2338325/ <h> WooCommerce Themes : HandyStore Theme Review <h> Share this <h> Partner <p> Many people start their eCommerce journeys by selling handmade crafts and products . As a start , people can showcase their handmade products on social media sites like Pinterest , or start selling them on marketplaces like Etsy . <p> As people transition from selling single products to building a brand with multiple products , a dedicated WordPress eCommerce store can give them more control and flexibility . In this post , we review the HandyStore WooCommerce Theme by Themes Zone which is specifically built with handmade products in mind . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Overview <p> HandyStore is a WooCommerce theme that is marketed as being suitable for handmade shops . The theme has a clean look and style , with a lot of whitespace , similar to craft marketplaces like Etsy . The theme includes a dedicated settings page and a page builder to make the set up and design easy for beginners . <p> Clean styles with a lot of whitespace <p> The theme is available for download on Themeforestfor $59 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the theme zip files , a number of recommended plugin files , documentation , and sample data to populate the site . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Set up <p> When you install HandyStore on your site , you 'll be greeted with an installation notice asking you to install required or recommended plugins . <p> Installation Notice <p> HandyStore uses the standard TGM library for handing these plugins , letting you view , download , and activate recommended or required plugins from this list . <p> Recommended Plugins <p> After you install the theme and activate the recommended plugins , you may only see a blank page on your storefront with none of your existing menu items . The first thing you need to do is to go to the Menus section , check the " Primary Menu " option , and Save Menu . This will restore your menu items on the primary navigation . <p> Most pages will show the theme styling without having to select a template for each page . However , the next thing you should do is go through the " Handy Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the options available to you . <p> Select broad theme settings including default layouts <p> Within settings , you will be able to select default layouts for different page types , add favicon and logos , and fine-tune options for different parts of the site . The layouts have the option of including a sidebar on each page . <p> Sidebar components can be changed within the Widgets area . Here you can select the components you want to add for the blog , header , front page , single page , shop page , single product page , and top footer sidebars . You can also add widgets to different columns of the footer . <p> To get the best experience in setting up the theme , you should follow specific steps which are not necessarily clear without reading the theme documentation . After the basic set up is complete , you can then focus on building individual pages using the theme page builder . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Usage <p> You have the option to use the standard WordPress editor to build your pages . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to add different elements to the main content area ( excluding the sidebar ) of your pages . <p> Different elements within the Page Builder <p> Although the page builder is fairly robust with a lot of options , it is not very intuitive to use from the beginning . As a beginner , you will have to invest considerable time to learn what different elements look like , how they are structured , the options for each , and how you can use different layouts within each content area . <p> The theme documentation has a number of videos on how to use the page builder for different pages . As an example , the demo store About Us page tutorial video is about 10 minutes long , but will give you an idea of steps to add a fair amount of content on a page . <p> Once you know how to use the page builder , you 'll be able to add some fairly complex styles and elements to your pages without having to use any code or shortcodes . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Browsing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products in a grid layout . By default , the price is prominently displayed along with the product image . The theme adds a cart button to each product in the Shop list to make it easy to add to cart . <p> Cart page default style <p> The styles for the cart and checkout pages blend in with your stores default styles giving them a distinctive look compared to the standard WooCommerce styles . <p> Checkout page <p> The theme comes with the Supp mega menu plugin that allows you to stylize your menu and sub-menu items . <p> However , for our store set up , Shop page and menu items seemed squished where the styles selected in settings werent being reflected on the store . The theme author does encourage to reach out to the support if such errors occur . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Extension Support <p> The WC Vendors plugin allows other vendors to have a store on your WooCommerce site . You can create marketplaces like Etsy on your store using the plugin . You can assign a vendor to each product on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plugin . Vendors can set up and customize their store page on your site that displays all their products . <p> If vendors are used , the vendor name is also shown on the product page where product meta ( like category or SKU ) is shown . A product tab with vendor details is also added to the product . The theme also includes styles and templates for vendor-specific content like the vendor dashboard . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Other Site Styles <p> In the Handy Store Theme Settings , you can change and adjust the style and layout for non-store pages like the blog and individual pages . <p> Grid view for blog page <p> You can display the blog in lists , or grids with different columns . This allows you to mix things up compared to the standard WordPress post list . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme : Notes <h> Support Resources <p> There are support resources available to help you set up and use the HandyStore theme . As we 've mentioned previously , the theme documentation was a good place to start , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get going . The theme documentation also walks you through recommended set up , as it can be a bit difficult to get the appearance you want ( or to look similar to the demo store ) without this . <p> If you do run into issues , there 's a theme support area available for any questions , as you can get support from Themes Zone for up to 6 months after purchase ( or longer if you extend your support license ) . <h> Code Review <p> HandyStore provides a pretty workable codebase if you 'd like to extend the theme or make changes . While there are some oddities , such as using the global $woocommerce variable ( which was deprecated in WooCommerce 2.1 ) instead of the WC() global function , and some places where core WordPress functions would be preferred over custom queries , overall the structure is easy to follow . <p> HandyStore does override several WooCommerce core templates . While this is n't the most egregious example of template overrides Ive seen , there are some overrides that only have minor changes , seemingly making some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upgrade-safe way . On the flip side , these overrides are current with WooCommerce core , and youd just want to be sure that they 're kept up-to-date . <h> Bundled Plugins <p> One practice I am not a fan of is bundling plugins within a theme . HandyStore bundles plugins like Revolution Slider within the theme itself , rather than recommending these plugins for purchase and noting that they have built-in styles . The reason that I 'm not a fan of this practice is that you cant get support from the plugin author or access to updates when its bundled in a theme . <p> In some cases , this can be prove to be very problematic , such as security releases . For example , RevSlider had a huge vulnerability that required updates , and without access to updates , users have to wait for the theme to bundle the patch , wasting precious time once an exploit is announced . <p> Aside from security , this also makes it difficult to get support while troubleshooting site issues . <h> HandyStore WooCommerce Theme Review <p> HandyStore is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and craft products . The theme comes with a number of options for styles and layouts for different page types . In addition , each page can be customized using a page builder for the main content area . <p> However , as the theme contains lots of options and leverages a page builder , you will probably need to invest considerable time to learn how to make things work exactly as you want them . The theme comes bundled with a number of plugins that enhance the store experience , like the Supp mega menu plugin . However , there are pitfalls to having bundled plugins while you do n't  need an additional purchase , they the lack of support from authors and direct access to updates . <p> Pros <p> WooCommerce styling blends in with the theme , does n't  look standard <p> Marketplace support with styled vendor templates <p> Supports several other WooCommerce plugins with custom styles <p> Does n't  just focus on store design , but includes good blog design as well <p> Page builder included , which let 's you create custom content areas <p> Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workable codebase without overriding every WooCommerce template <p> Cons <p> Overrides core WooCommerce templates , which need to be kept up-to-date with major releases to avoid issues <p> Requires bundled page builder plugin to use <p> Bundles plugins , which means no automatic plugin updates / support <p> Set up is a bit time-intensive <p> Has a learning curve to get site looking like demo <p> All in all , with enough time , you will be able to use the theme to create a unique and complex store for your WooCommerce products . <p> Note : This post see our editorial policy . 11394 @qwx871394 11391 @qwx871391 11392
