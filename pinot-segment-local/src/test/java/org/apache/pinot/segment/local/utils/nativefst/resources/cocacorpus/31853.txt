Not whether or not Bill from marketing is intimidated by our blazer . FFS ! ! <p> We totally get you gurl ! And were all about girl power , and power dressing for the female form . Thank you for commenting , we love hearing back from you and we see your point . Do n't  be scared to rock that black blazer though ! Black is empowering , bold and the uniform of a leader ( and this is straight from the psychology of colour ) . Keep posting Sophia x

This role introduced me to the supply chain management of goods , which is about the movement of stock from the suppliers to the Distribution Centre and then to stores . I had to forecast and manage the brands stock movement and had close contact with Senior Management . <p> Later the brands moved into specific divisions and I was transferred onto Burton with total control of the Logistics area . With experience I gained an understanding of how the business operates its forecasting from department level to brand and then company level . I also had daily contact with other areas of the business e.g. the Leeds Distribution Centre , Imports , B&amp;M teams . This all helped to build my confidence in dealing with Management and improved on my presentation skills . <p> My interest was in product and forecasting and this encouraged me to move across to Merchandising . I started as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the brands biggest department , Shirts and Ties . My role involves forecasting and budgeting and working closely with the buying team to achieve the departments stock targets , margins and profit . <p> I have a clear understanding of the business and I am able to demonstrate a professional approach to dealing with others and working well in a team . This role will hopefully lead me to become a successful Merchandiser . Arcadia offers great opportunities to progress as well as an extensive training package that will help me to achieve my goals . <p> I have been with the company for 2 + years and have made many friends .

Were here to unravel that jeans jargon and share a few handy tips along the way . <p> First up , let 's tackle the terminology- When it comes to denim there 's a whole heap of technical terms that the fash-pack like to use , us included ( sorry about that ) . So here 's our handy glossary of the most commonly used jeans-related jargon just in case you were wondering . <h> A-Z of Denim Definitions <p> Abrasions : - Surface damage and distressed sections that sit on the denim and do n't go entirely through the fabric . The abrasions give the jeans a worn-in , authentic look ( which were a big fan of ) . <p> Acid Wash : - A washing technique made famous in the 80s that strips the top colour off the denim . <p> Ankle Grazers : - This refers to the length of the jean ; the hem sits on the ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for showing of your favourite high heels . Take a look at our handy guide on which shoes to wear with jeans . <p> Authentic Stitching : - A term used to describe a contrast-coloured stitching , - which makes all the design details of the jeans stand out . <p> Blasting : - Areas of the garment ( usually the front and back thigh or pocket areas ) are sanded off to create a worn , lived-in look , leaving different shades of denim . Saves waiting for it to happen naturally , right ? <p> Bootcut : - The bootcut , or bootleg jean , has a wider than average hem , originally intended so the jeans fit over boots more easily . This shape is notoriously- figure-flattering as a wider hem balances out the hips- on curvier figures . <p> Amy Neville knows how to work the boyfriend jean <p> Boyfriend Jeans : - The boyfriend design , also referred to as the boy fit , is a looser fitting jean. - Its supposed to look like you casually borrowed your guys clothes this also works for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . <p> Brushed : - Brushing is part of the final treatment for a worn-in look .

A pain when you need the loo , but hey , they look nice . <p> Cat Scratches : - Slight scratches on the surface of the denim that add a little extra interest . No cats actually required , or harmed , in the process . <p> Coated : - The jeans are coated to give a leather-look effect . We love this style for a glam , going-out look . <p> Coin Pocket : - The small pocket that is found at the front of jeans , inside one of the main functional front pockets . Do we ever use them for coins ? No . But someone must have in the distant past . <p> Callie Thorpe in indigo denim <p> Colour Fast : - This refers to the level of dye attached to the garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its low colour fastness , meaning- it fades at a slower pace than other colours . <p> Fabric Weight : - Refers to the ounces per square yard of a fabric . Denim is typically woven in weights from 4 to 15 ounces per square yard . The weight indicates the thickness and durability of the denim . <p> Faded Denim : - An effect that is achieved after repeated wear and wash of indigo dyed denim . This can be done by stone washing or bleaching or wearing them for years and years and years . The first options are obviously quicker . <p> Fit : - Describes the cut , shape , length and design of jeans , i.e. skinny fit , bootcut and straight leg. - Trends come and go , but the classic cuts stand the test of time which is why the skinny will never be dead for us . <p> Flat Fronted : - This is a pull-on jean with stretch- an no zip or button fastening . <p> High Waist : - Jeans designed with a high-waisted cut mean they sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion of having longer legs and were all for that , thank you very much . <p> Jeggings : Look like jeans , feel like la second skin <p> Jegging : - The term jegging ' was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2015 , and is going nowhere . Similar in style to a jean , but extra-comfy , slightly stretchy- and pulls on like leggings . <p> Laser Design : - Lasers are used to burn away areas of the dye on the surface of jeans , - this is done- to create patterns . And sounds slightly more futuristic than it is . <p> Let Down Hem : - A normal hem is placed on the jeans , then after washing this hem- is unpicked and let down ' , creating areas of darker denim and giving that cool- raw-finished hem effect . <p> Overdye : - The application of additional colour to the fabric in order to achieve a different shade . <p> Patch : - An additional piece of fabric- added to give more fashion detail. - You can also do this yourself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - A garment that has an elasticated waist that is pulled on , rather than zipped and fastened up . Jeggings are usually pull on . <p> Raw Hem : - The hem has been undone and manually frayed . <p> Recovery : - A term used when talking about the stretch and fit of a jean staying true to its shape , having a good recovery means- the jeans- will hold its shape for longer . <p> Rinse Wash : - Light washing process that softens the denim to make it more wearable without washing out the colour . <p> Lucia Thomas-Holland rocking knee rips <p> Rips : : - Forms of abrasions which go right through the surface of the jeans. - Easiest to wear are knee rips ; if you 're feeling brave try rips on the thighs or under the bum . <p> Rivet : - Metal trims used on the corners of pockets to reinforce weaker- areas or support areas of stress ' , so the seams do n't rip or come away . Rivets help the jeans stay durable and hardwearing . <p> Slim Fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the thighs , they are not necessarily tapered and a little bit looser than true skinny jeans . <p> Stretch Denim : - A denim fabric that includes elastane or Lycra to give a stretch and a more comfortable fit . <p> Tapered : - This just means they gradually become less fitted towards the- ankle . <p> Weight : - Denim is graded in terms of weight per square yard of fabric . The denim weights are either ; light , medium or heavy . <p> Whiskering : - Whiskers are patterns in the denim created with either chemicals or from sanding . <p> Yoke : - The yoke is the V-shaped section at the back of jeans that gives jeans their curve and determines its fit . The deeper the V , the greater the curve and more shape this gives the wearer in their jeans . Curved yokes have a clever way of creating the appearance of a lifted bum , so were all for them ! <p> Chloe Plumstead in 5 pocket jeans <p> 5 Pocket Jean : - The most common type of jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring- five pockets " two at the front , plus one small coin pocket , and two back pockets . <p> Phew , that 's it ! You 're quite the denim expert now . We 've just got a few more handy hints about jeans that every girl needs to know <h> How to Care for Your Jeans <p> Youve probably heard the rumours , and they 're true . Washing your jeans too often is not good for them at all. - But before you think we 've gone completely mad with this unhygienic suggestion , we do have some sneaky tips to keep your jeans clean , without the constant- trips to- the washing machine . <h> Spot Clean <p> Grab the damp cloth or an old toothbrush , even spritz a tiny amount of water if you must , and treat any stained areas . Then allow for your jeans to fully dry out . Hang them up flat in a well ventilated part of the house , but away from direct sunlight . <p> And literally that 's all you should do for now . Do n't you just love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to Rest <p> Lay the jeans out flat once a week in a well ventilated area , this allows them to breathe and stops bacteria from building up , plus deodorizes them a little too. - There 's also a spray available called Denim Refresh Spray- by Mr Black ' that helps treat and cleanse your jeans , without the need for washing . It 's antibacterial and helps extend the lifespan of denim . <h> The Way to Stay Fresh <p> Another hack that denim aficionados swear by is to freeze jeans into staying fresh ! When you feel your jeans need a wash , fold them up twice , place them in an airtight , zipped freezer bag and pop them next to your peas in the freezer for a few days , and- at least 24 hours . This will kill any bacteria , remove any odours and leave your jeans feeling fresh and clean . <h> The First Time <p> The first time you wash your jeans they can shrink up to 2-3cm in width or length . Eek ! <p> So let 's steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and- opt for- a cold wash in the sink first . We know- it 's time consuming , but its well worth it to preserve your style staples . You can also add a couple of spoonful 's of salt to the wash at this time , as some experts say this- will help to set the dye . <h> Meet the Machine <p> OK , so the inevitable day is upon us and it 's time to use the washing machine . Obviously , we always recommend checking the care label ( not all jeans are made of the same stuff , so its best to check ) . Let 's start on a cool wash , washing the jeans inside out and just- on their own in the cycle . Liquid washing capsules are also the better option over washing powder ( as no one likes those unsightly white lines to appear ) . <p> Once the wash has finished , be quick to take out your jeans , hang them up flat and allow them to dry out naturally . Some say to dry your jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 minutes first , then allow them to air dry after that . We say stay safe , and air dry all the way ! This will help avoid any shrinkage . <p> We- recommend you- follow this method- each and every time you need to machine wash your jeans . <h> Final Thoughts <p> It may seem- obvious , but a great pair of super-flattering jeans is the holy grail of fashion . Once the shape has gone , or if you lose weight , it 's time to make a change . Life 's just too short ( and you 're too fabulous ) to wear ill-fitting jeans ! <p> Ready for something new ?

Less than a year later I was promoted again to my first Branch Management role and over the next 5 years I rapidly progresses to become Joint Site Manager of Topshop/Topman in Bath . Following the birth of my daughter I changed brands and moved to Dorothy Perkins and I have been the manager of our mega store in Cribbs Causeway for the past 5 years . <p> I view running my own store as if it were my own business , focusing on making as much profit as possible , reducing my overheads and securing as many customers as I can for the future .

My progress was noticed by the area manager who then proceeded to give me the opportunity to put my skills into practice through a couple of secondments , until I was offered my first deputy position in Accrington . <p> I gradually gained exposure and developed relationships with the Brand Directors and Area Managers and progressed through a rapid succession of promotions until at the age of 21 I was given my first Branch management role in Preston Debenhams .

And because Burton is developing all the time I know that it will continue to give me the opportunities to develop along with it .

What a time to be petite . <p> But if that was n't good enough , here 's our petite style guide on how to create outfits that will flatter your figure and make you appear just that little bit taller . Ready for a confidence boost ? Read on ! <h> Follow the 2/3 1/3 Rule <p> First things first , the 2/3 1/3 rule is the one fashion experts swear by when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will create the right proportion to your smaller- frame . To adhere to this rule , dresses will always come in handy but if you 're using separates wear bottoms that are 2/3 of your body and tops that cover the remaining 1/3 . This will prevent you from splitting your figure in half horizontally , which would automatically result in a shorter looking silhouette . <h> Avoid Knee-Lengths Hems <p> There are no half measures when it comes to the length of your dress or skirt if- you 're petite . You 'll look best in either- a short hem ( hello legs ! ) or a long one ( midi or maxi , either way below the knee ) . While a short hem will make your legs appear longer by revealing more of them , longer hems will on the other hand create a continuous line that will trick the eye and make the lower half of the body look longer than it actually is. - Win ! <h> Go Co-Ord <p> All hail tone-sur-tone , the biggest trend of the season . As mixing and matching prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love prints opt for co-ordinates ( aka sets of top and bottom in the same print ) and favour- smaller prints to big ones . If however prints are not your cup of tea choose monochromatic outfits that is to say the same colour ( or different shades of it ) from head to toe which will give the illusion of a longer looking figure . <h> Opt for High-Waisted Trousers <p> Whether you choose palazzo or cropped trousers , high-rise can be more flattering than low . Wide leg trousers and culottes are having a moment , however they can be very tricky for petite girls . Either go for extra-long and dramatic or cropped and ankle-baring . While the first will need heels and will create the illusion of longer legs from the waist down to the floor , the latter can be worn with either heels or flats but make sure you show the right amount of ankle avoid mid-calf lengths as they will virtually crop your legs in half and break the 2/3 1/3 rule . <p> But what about jeans ? High-rise skinny jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will elongate your figure vertically . Once again dare to bare your ankle by choosing ankle grazers or simply roll up your normal skinny jeans . <h> Choose a V-Neck <p> If you 've never had a go-to neckline , let the V-neck become your new best friend . On top of being extremely feminine and occasionally sexy ( which makes it easier to take them from desk to dinner ) V-necks will elongate your neck and chest area making the upper half of your body appear longer . Get yourself a V-neck cami top , a building block of every great wardrobe ! <h> Tuck Your Shirt In <p> Avoid boxy or excessively baggy tops and tuck in your shirt where- you can to reveal the lower half of your body which might otherwise be overwhelmed by your upper half . Remember that if you are a fan of baggy clothes its always better to balance them out with a tighter counterpart ( baggy top with tight bottoms or- vice-versa ) . <h> Reveal Your Feet <p> The trick is simple : the more of your feet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick straps or anything that will unnecessarily cover your feet and ankles . Heels will always give you those extra inches , but if your feet need a day off opt for pointed-toe flats which will help make your feet look longer and by association make your legs look longer too ! The colour of your shoes is important too : go for a colour that matches either your skin tone or your trousers , as if they were an extension of them . As for boots , avoid mid-calf ones and go for either ankle boots or tall ones . <h> And Finally <p> High slits in skirts and dresses will make your legs look longer- while- vertical prints and lines will elongate your figure . Choose mini bags over maxi ones which might look way too big on you and be careful when layering and accessorising : in this case less is definitely more ! <p> In need of petite clothes ?

From the dresses to the favours , this is your day , so show your personality and let the excitement begin . <h> #1 Choose your wedding dress , then the bridesmaid dresses , then the flowers <p> Finding the perfect dress for you and your bridesmaids really is the most important part of your planning . The shape of your dress will often help determine the type of bouquet you choose and your bridesmaid dresses will usually give a nod to the colour or theme of the entire day . <h> #2 What 's your Tribe ? <p> What makes you tick ? What kind of gal are you ? Is fashion your passion ? Or are you a country girl at heart ? Forget the bouquets carried by celebrities or in photo shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That may be a billowing boho creation , a traditional shower bouquet or a neat hand-tied posy . <h> #3 Choosing the flowers <p> Ok , so this is the tough part . Most of the brides coming to Emily&amp;Me know as much about flowers as we do about their chosen career ! Its our job to guide them through what 's available ( in season ) and more importantly , which flowers will fit within their budget . Best advice , do n't  get hung up on a particular flower . Go for shape and colour . That showgirl peony that was in full bloom on Instagram or the amazing ranunculus trending on Pinterest may not be around when you 're tying the knot . Do n't  sweat it , there will be hundreds of other blooms for you to make your own . <h> #4 Yes , make it personal ! <p> By now we know that the day is mostly about you ( and him , of course ) but there may be other people who can not be with you that you want to remember . Adding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your own mothers dress is easy to do and adds something personal . You could also ask your florist to include a favourite flower if its available or even a silk flower from your grandmothers bouquet . Is there a flower that he bought for you on your first date or perhaps a flower that represents your heritage ? A thistle for Scotland , a flame lily for South Africa . <h> #5 Size is everything ! <p> As a guide , we usually advise a bride to go with her frame but were all about breaking those rules too ! If flowers are your thing , go for it . If you just want something to hold as you walk down the aisle , keep it smaller and more budget-friendly . The larger you go , the higher the price unless you 're happy to add some foliage into the mix . Again there are always bouquets that break the rules . <p> Kate Middletons wedding bouquet was a small hand wired creation of stephanotis and lily of the valley , ( she had a few made that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These would have taken hours to make and the flower choice would have made them at the high-end of anyones budget , but they were perfect for her frame and spoke volumes in terms of who she is .

This got us thinking are some celeb romances just a publicity stunt , and all about the hype ? <p> We take a look at some of the key couples and let you know our thoughts <p> Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris <p> The couple did a fairly good job keeping their relationship out of the public eye , apart from sharing a few romantic moments on Instagram . According to the tabloids , the cause of the break up was purely because they were no longer compatible . Calvin even posted a heartfelt tweet declaring he still cared about Taylor . <p> Now , due to the latest news that Taylor has been spotted all loved up with Tom Hiddleson ( Taytay so soon ? ! ) this tweet has been deleted and Calvin has un-followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our verdict ? Due to her ability to move on to her next lover so swiftly ( pun intended ) , we declare this one a serious SHOWMANCE ! <p> We all now await Taylor 's new song about this awkward love triangle <p> Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Liam Payne <p> Dating since February this year , the pair has made little effort to keep their relationship private . There have even been whispers of them living together WHAT ? Sources say they 're loved up . But , we 're a bit sceptical . Could they genuinely be a serious item so soon ? The age gap and Cheryl 's recent divorce make us think SHOWMANCE ! <p> Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt <p> Sparks flew between the these two A-list celebs during the filming of Mr and Mrs Smith ' back in 2004 ( this was whilst Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston " ouch ! ) Twelve years , six kids ( including three adopted from Africa ) and a marriage later , we think the charitable , star-studded couple must be the real deal .

There 's recent rumours of a possible divorce , so who knows ?

Could it be the real deal ? Our verdict ? SHOWMANCE ! <p> What do you think ? Why do we find ourselves so absorbed in celebs private lives ? What 's it all for ? Is it because our beloved social media platforms and online mags are laden with gossip about our favourite celebs private lives ?

Which colours will be the perfect companion to your hair ? Your eyes ? Your skin tone and shape ? <p> No need to panic ! We 've got- colouring advice from professional colour consultations , the Style Doctors , to help you find your perfect look . Get inspired and if you need a little extra help , get in touch with Style Doctors before going on your next shopping trip . <p> Insider tip : The key to colour pairing is contrast so keep that in mind as you see what our stylists have hand-selected for you . <p> Jewel tones are very rich and deep . Pale skin tones work well because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ashy hair colours and harmonise with blondes and redheads extremely well . If you have a darker complexion but still love turquoise , magenta , and emerald , offset the outfit with some lighter coloured accessories white court shoes- or some silver jewellery . <p> These warm , bright colours create gorgeous contrast with darker-skinned , darker-haired women . While red is a very complementary colour on many ( including blondes ) , oranges , yellows and corals bring the rosy colouring to complete a balanced look for women with olive undertones in their skin or very dark skin . If you 're very deliberate with styling , these are also very fun colours to pair a " cool bright " with like a royal blue heel . <p> With pastels , you can split them into two groups : cool pastels include mint , powder blue , and lavender ; warm pastels include pale pink , tangerine and pale yellow . The cool pastels complement rosy complexions very nicely as they balance the reddish colouring ( powder blue looks especially good on redheads ! ) . Warm pastels work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale pinks and yellows can quickly wash out a rosy or extremely light complexion and the cooler colours mute any warmth in darker tones . Remember , pale and warm complexion = cool colours ; cool or darker complexion = warm colours . This is n't a fail-safe and there 's reasons to break these guidelines but its a good place to start . <p> Our stylists love neutrals because they can be paired with different colours and textures . Neutrals act as a blank slate for your outfit so fit and quality is especially important when investing in these types of clothes . Browns and blush tones look especially great on pale complexions . Whites , beiges and camel tones look fantastic on darker complexions and darker hair colours . For day , style your neutrals with a pair of flats and casual jewellery . Switch them out for a statement- heel with a pop of colour- for night . <h> Now Its Your Turn <p> After reading these guidelines you should have a basic understanding of which colours to look out for when picking an outfit .

We simply adore the blue classic navy coat she kept draped over her shoulders , layered onto a- black and stripy knit , and accompanied by a colour-block clutch . Striking yet oh-so-stylish .

But how much we read into them is personal , and probably dependent on- your zodiac sign- too ! <p> Whether you 're a budding Mystic Meg or the anti-astrologist chances are you 've read your horoscope recently ( even if you 're just a curious Sagittarius ) and hoped that you would get that promised- pay rise on the 11th or prayed that your love life would n't suffer from Jupiter- passing Saturn . There 's something about random- predictions that we all love , even if its just to give our inner- Virgo something to analyse . We put horoscopes to the test and asked the team at DP HQ- are Horoscopes real ? ! <h> # Taurus 1 April 21 May <p> Jessica , Digital Marketing Manager <p> About- Taurus : - Youre independent , you know what you like and you stick to it . You are honest with your friends ( and yourself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elite few . You 're most comfortable in artistic and creative environments . <p> Q : Why ? A : Sometimes it 's nice to believe that everything that 's happening is happening for a reason , that it 's been written in the stars . <p> Q : How often do you read your horoscope ? A : At least once a fortnight <p> Q : How many traits do you have that are similar to your sign ? A : One Taurus trait is that we like high-quality clothes and are materialistic so I 'm not going to argue with that . I 'm stubborn and practical too . <p> Q : Has anything ever come true from a horoscope ? A : Yes , two years ago I read mid-week that my life was going to change beyond recognition by the weekend and it did . <p> What We Think : - Jess is- a die-hard fashionista who loves beautiful things from organising life in beautiful diaries to a wardrobe that would make any style- blogger envious . Shes Taurean to a T with her love of fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precise and independent , and always has to get her- way ! We think her approach to horoscopes is typical to Taurus as her ambition would make her want to- know her future and she can always see a positive side to things . <h> # Cancer - 22 June 22 July <p> Sophia , Digital Marketing Coordinator <p> About Cancer : - You are a true power woman . Sensitive to the needs of others , passionate and strong-willed , making you one of the most powerful zodiac signs . You trust you instinct and intuition over everything else which usually turns out to be correct . However , you tend to be more cautious in the game of love . <p> Q : Why ? A : They give me a sense of control in a world filled with CHAOS ! <p> Q : How often do you read your horoscope ? A : Every month <p> Q : How many traits do you have that are similar to your sign ? A : I am SUCH a typical cancer . Proper shell-dweller " I never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those you 'd never know but dying-inside kinda gals ) and I love ANYONE who 's a Taurus because it 's written in the stars duh ! <p> What We Think : - Sophia is one sassy girl , loud and outgoing , and her- presence is always known . While she has the bold confidence of the typical Cancer power player , she can be quite shy and pessimistic . Maybe she does n't  know her own strength ! If we were to take all zodiac signs at face value , Sophia would n't be the most typical Cancer as she is WAY too optimistic about horoscopes- ( vs the- sterotype ) . <h> # Aries - 21 March 19 April <p> Aidan , Digital Production Coordinator <p> About Aries : - You are active and unpredictable ! An inspiration and positive impact to all of your friends . Ignore those who think you can be brash from time to time and embrace your bold , fearless traits which make you a natural born leader . <p> Q : Why ? A : - It 's nonsense . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with what I 'm like or what my future holds . <p> Q : How often do you read your horoscope ? A : - Never , sometimes it gets read to me . Some of my friends at Dorothy Perkins- like to annoy me with it . = <p> Q : How many traits do you have that are similar to your sign ? A : Apparently Aries are Courageous , Energetic , Optimistic , Enterprising , Independent , Impatient , Egoistic , Vain , Jealous , Impulsive. - I 'd say they maybe get it 50% right <p> Q : Has anything ever come true from a horoscope ? A : - Probably at some point , they are bound to have got lucky once or twice. - Also they are so vague it 's always easy to make it sound true . <p> What We Think : - While- Aidan might not believe in his horoscope , we think he is the most typical Aries . Not only does his personality match up to the majority of the personality traits to this sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astrology , and he s definitely too proud to admit that anything may resonate with him ! <h> # Virgo 23 August 22 September <p> Camilla , Online Trading Assistant <p> About Virgo : - Your friends would most likely call you a neat freak , but also the best friend they 've ever had . Your attention to detail translates to a care for others too , making you invaluable to those around you . However , while everyone around you sees your strengths , you tend to criticise yourself too much . <p> Q : Why ? A : Because it 's basically someone making stuff up that 's as general as possible that people can somehow apply to their life . <p> Q : How often do you read your horoscope ? A : Whenever I have a magazine with one in . <p> Q : How many traits do you have that are similar to your sign ? A : Not that many .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive traits of a Virgo ( attention to detail , - reliable , modest and organised ) " although pretty sure I am the most unorganised person I know . <p> Q : Has anything ever come true from a horoscope ? A : Not to memory . I wish all the financial windfalls I 'm meant to have had would have come true though ! <p> What We Think : - We were hardly surprised that Camillas personally traits include skeptism after hearing her opinion on zodiac signs . Her role at DP Digital is mostly spent in excel- or- knee-deep in- data which involves a lot of precision and analytical thinking . We love her bluntness- ( typical inflexible Virgo ) , but she is also caring , helpful and reliable . SO whether she agrees with them or not , Camillas horoscope seems to be spot on . <p> 2017 is the year of the dress , so read on for your 2017 dress horoscope and find the perfect style for your sign !
