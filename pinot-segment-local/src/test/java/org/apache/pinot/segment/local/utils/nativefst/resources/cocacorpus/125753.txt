Our trip back on March 12 was a quick turnaround after a long road trip to Vanderbilt and Kentucky the weekend before . We arrived back at the courts from Lexington after 1am early Monday morning and then got back on the road two days later to face the Volunteers in a rare Thursday noon affair . We also added a match with Jacksonville State following the Tennessee match on our way home . So while this trip might have been shorter in terms of mileage it would require some high octane fuel in our tanks. - <p> We had a light hit on Tuesday before traveling up on Wednesday and it was clear that a few of us were moving a little slower than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no additional days off and it was time to get after it again . That 's the beauty and the beast of college tennis . As the season goes on players grow more resilient from the constant training , competing , studying , resting and preparing from week to week . On the flip side there are n't a lot of breaks during the schedule so it 's not possible to take two weeks off to freshen up ... well , keep reading and you 'll see . <p> We came out firing against Tennessee which led to another doubles point victory , our 5th in a row and 7th out of the last 9 matches. - We 've seem to hit our stride again with doubles as it can be so critical in match play. - Up 1-0 , singles was tight with each team splitting first sets up and down the lineup . Like us , the Volunteers were relatively young and had experienced several close matches throughout the year . It was definitely a tug of war with the red ribbon on the rope moving in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for the Tide while the Vols put up three . Zhe was closing out his match serving 5-2 in the third set while Edson was on serve 4-5 in the third . Clearly this was going to be a nail biter as heads turned back and forth between courts 4 &amp; 5 . Zhe jumped ahead 40-15 and looking to even the match at 3-3 while Edson was battling . In the end it was Tennessee that won a deuce point on Edson 's court to close out the match for the home team . It was a valiant effort by our freshman from Chihuahua and now we needed to get on the road to Jacksonville . <p> We arrived in time for a 7 p.m. first serve against the Gamecocks . We proceeded to win the doubles point again which definitely helped carry momentum into the singles portion of the day . Alexey , Thibault and Zhe were victorious as was Edson , who fittingly was the last match on before we stopped play . Jacksonville State had four courts with lights so we abandoned Spencer and Ritchie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trek home. - We rolled into Tuscaloosa shortly after midnight but this time our break would appear . <p> Since the Tennessee/Jacksonville State trip we had Easter weekend off ( my first in 22 years of college coaching ) and then an additional weekend off as our SEC Champs were pushed back a week this year . Definitely a much needed and deserved respite but now we 're back where we started two weeks ago ... Knoxville , Tennessee . We face Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC Champs and look forward to another opportunity against the Commodores . We had them against the ropes back in early April before they snuck out of the corner and recorded a 4-3 victory . That memory is rather fresh in our players ' minds and no doubt will serve as extra motivation . <p> So join us in person in Rocky Top by following online .

I played in high school all four years and that 's when I started thinking about playing in college . <p> When you decided you wanted to play at the collegiate level , was it something you knew you could do or was it when you started hearing from schools that you realized your dream could become a reality ? <p> CK : My parents would always tell me there were a lot of opportunities in college for golf . When the recruiting process began and I started getting contacted by coaches , getting letters in the mail and competing in tournaments , I had several offers to choose from but Alabama was where I wanted to go . I liked Arizona and LSU but I just fell in love with Alabama . <p> Q : What made you fall in love with UA ? <p> CK : When I was a freshmen in high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I immediately knew I wanted to come here . I felt like I pretty much stalked the girls on the team and they just seemed so nice . Being from Texas , I loved football and having three older brothers that played , it just clicked . It is pretty similar here to Texas and I still get to be in the South . I like the whole athletic part of this school and I love my coaches , so it was really the perfect fit . <p> Had you visited Alabama before you official visit ? <p> CK : No , the first time I came here I went to a basketball game . I did n't even experience a football game , and to be honest , the only thing I really knew about Alabama was football . I had never even visited the state of Alabama before , and I really did n't know what to expect . But I loved it and it 's been growing so much even since that first visit . I feel like when people think of Alabama they picture some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not like that at all . Everyone said that Alabama is such a big school , but now it 's kind of small and it 's comfortable . I know where everything is and it 's so much fun . <p> What do you enjoy about your team ? <p> CK : Well , I do n't have any sisters so this team is like a bunch of sisters for me . We are all super close and I love being a part of it . One of the reasons I came to Alabama was for the competition . We all want each other to do well but we also keep pushing each other to be better every day . My freshmen year there were two seniors here , Janie Jackson and Emma Talley . They both really helped me transition and being a freshmen they were just really good upperclassmen to me . They helped me a lot with everything , even if it was just when I was homesick . I also love my coaches " Mic Potter and Susan Rosenstiel . They are like second parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive and wants the best for each other . <p> What are your top goals as an athlete and as an individual ? <p> CK : As a person , I want to grow spiritually and to know that golf is something that I do , but it does n't necessarily define me . I want to be a role model to girls who want to be into athletics and girls who want to be into golf . I want to be that positive role model that makes sure young girls know that they can achieve anything that you put your heart into . <p> As an athlete , goals are kind of hard . You want to be result based ; to win tournaments and be an All-American . Those are definitely goals , so is winning a national championship . But , for me I feel like it 's just what Nick Saban always says . It really is all about the process . Every day , everything that you do on and off the golf course affects the person you 're going to become . Going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working out , just try your best . For me , I did not like working out at first , I seriously hated it and dreaded it every time . Then you realize that it 's only to make you better , just like in practice , you need to focus on the things you need to do to get better . You also need to be honest with yourself if there is something you need to work on . I feel like just using all the resources to help you grow as a person . <p> I do want to golf professionally , that is my main goal . I think it is important now to learn how to control your emotions and how to prioritize your time . Hopefully when I am a professional athlete , I will know how many weeks I can go straight playing in a tournament . Also balancing it all , I feel that people get really caught up in their sport and that 's all they do . Some people see their sport as a life or death situation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need a life outside your sport as well . <p> You have already set a pair of school records and you 're only a sophomore . How does that feel ? <p> CK : It 's kind of funny . I did n't really know that I had even broken school records , no one really told me until my parents brought it up to me . It 's definitely really cool , it 's a huge accomplishment and I am very grateful for that . Even though I am only a sophomore , I never thought I would be able to accomplish things that I have . Of course , I want to continue to keep getting better . Just being in college and being around other athletes , it 's really important that you believe in yourself and I feel like that is one of the big things that has changed since I got to Alabama . I have realized that you really can do anything , it 's just a matter of believing in yourself and having that confidence . <p> You are extremely busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorority which is a huge time commitment . How do you balance it all ? <p> CK : Oh , gosh , it 's very hard . I decided to rush as a sophomore , I do n't think I could have balanced it all as a freshmen . I decided to rush last minute , I just felt like I needed to build relationships with people outside of the athletic community . It is hard , but I feel like I have a level head . My sport and academics comes first , and then my sorority . Since I 've been playing golf for so long , I know what to do practice-wise . School is hard to balance when you 're traveling often but you just have to be on top of things and I think that helps you mature . I am really glad I joined a sorority but I miss a lot of date parties and different events . But I am here at Alabama to play golf and get an education . I do feel that whatever I do on and off the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prioritize what is important to you . When I was going through the rush process , there was another student-athlete in my class and we agreed that we needed something a little bit different in our lives . <p> Where is your favorite place you have traveled for golf ? <p> CK : Probably California . We have a tournament in the Los Angeles area every year , in Palos Verdes . It is so nice . We stay at a beautiful hotel right on the water . Ohio State hosts the tournament , which is kind of random , but we get to stay there and walk around the ocean . We usually go a day early and tour Los Angeles . We got to see the Hollywood Walk of Stars and we saw Jimmy Kimmel Live ! being filmed . The performer on his show the night we were there was Alicia Keys , I was almost moved to tears . Kerry Washington was there and I watch Scandal so that was so cool too . Palos Verdes , the course , it is just so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so nice . <p> What is a piece of advice that you would want to give your younger self ? <p> CK : I would say , kind of a big thing for me that I have learned the past two years here , is perspective on things . At the end of the day , I am very hard on myself in my sport and in everything I do . Sometimes if I play poorly , I think it 's the end of the world and it 's the worst thing that could happen . And I feel that other athletes feel the same way . We just need to realize how blessed we are to play this sport . A lot of people are unable to play for any number of reasons . To realize that golf is something you do , that it is n't life or death , is something I have learned and want to pass along . Even something as simple as having a bad day , just know it 's going to be okay .

Alabama was ranked in the top-10 throughout the year , reaching a No. 2 ranking on May 1 , the highest rank in the history of the program . The 2014 Crimson Tide women finished with just one loss in conference play and posted seven 4-0 sweeps throughout the season . But the most noteworthy accomplishment her team pulled off was capturing the program 's first Southeastern Conference Championship . With a 4-3 , come-from-behind victory at eighth-ranked Georgia , Alabama clinched at least a part of the 2014 SEC title ; that was n't enough for the Tide women . Alabama followed that up with a 4-0 sweep of Tennessee to claim the conference title outright on the final day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected 18 wins overall , bringing its total victories since 2011 to 98 , which is the most in a five-year span in program history .

Daniell became one of the most decorated freshmen in Alabama history as she was named SEC Freshman of the Year , ITA Southern Region Rookie of the Year , second team All-SEC and All-Freshman team . Routliffe also stamped her name in the Tide record books as she became the fourth member to earn first team All-SEC honors for a third consecutive season . <p> For a program that was 0-21 her first season to a conference champion , Mainz has surely transformed the women 's tennis program into a perennial power and one of the University 's most consistent teams . <h> In the Classroom <p> As proud as she is of her team 's on-court success , Mainz is equally as proud of their academic success .

At the conclusion of the 2013-14 season , the women 's tennis team combined for the highest grade point average amongst women 's programs at UA . In the past five seasons , the Tide women have laid claim to 30 ITA Scholar Athlete Awards , with five apiece coming in the first three campaigns and a program-best seven in 2015 . The Crimson Tide 's efforts in the classroom are unmatched as the women continue to lay claim to the SEC 's and NCAA 's most prestigious academic awards following each season . <p> In five of the last six years , at least one member of the UA women 's tennis team has been named to the CoSIDA/Capital One Academic All-America team , while the Tide has also claimed five SEC Scholar Athlete of the Year Awards for women 's tennis .

I do n't mean that in a negative way because I think we 've come out of the spring in a lot of years where we do n't have an elite team .

What kind of commitment each guy makes to being an elite player , affecting himself in a positive way , and affecting his unit in a positive way is going to determine how we all affect our team in a positive way which ultimately will lead to what kind of team we really have . I think there were a lot of situations in this game today that are great teaching situations .

There were some things that got exposed today that maybe we did n't see the rest of the spring that will be interesting to see how we can get our players to respond to it . All in all , I think we had a lot of young players make a lot of progress in the spring . I think it 's a little more difficult for some of the more experienced guys in spring practice to maintain the mindset and sense of urgency that you 'd like for them to , but we 'll see how they 'll respond to that too in the fall . " <p> " He 's improved well , and he had a good day today . You know , we obviously need some young guys to come through for us at receiver . It 's not a position where we have a lot of depth . Calvin Ridley is a special player at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we need some young players like Jerry Jeudy to continue to grow and develop . He made significant progress throughout the spring , and I think it culminated in a pretty productive day for him today . " <p> " Well , Tua 's played well in all the scrimmages . He had two series with the ones where he went three-and-out , so that 's not really what we 'd like to see . But these statistics are very misleading . First of all , how many times did we run the ball , and what were the rushing yards on the rushing plays ? And if you want to get the true stats on the passing yards , take away all the sacks from that because those are all the negative plays that we had because we were passing the ball . There 's a lot more balance than what the statistics show because we take the sacks off the rushing yards in college football . There 's really no negative plays passing unless you throw an interception . There was a lot of production . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a year ago - first , second and third team guys . I think that was encouraging . But it really is not . We 'll do the stats when we grade the film because we 'll say , ' Okay , we ran the ball 27 times , and we gained 86 yards . ' What is that ? Three yards a carry ? Not good enough . Maybe the other team gained 15 yards on however many , 25 carries , that is good enough . When you take the sacks off of it , you have no way of knowing what your efficiency was when you ran the ball and really what your efficiency is when you threw it . We probably had 10 sacks out there today . Twelve . Twelve total . Each probably averaged seven to 10 yards . Now you have 250 yards passing on both teams . It 's a little bit misleading when you look at that part of it , but as I said before it was good that we threw the ball with a little more efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think is very important to being successful on offense . " <h> On what goes through his mind when kicking a field goal vs. kicking a punt <p> " I 'm not really thinking about a whole lot . When I take my steps for kicks , I 'm just kind of thinking ' Alright , take this step , line up , get it over and give them a nod . ' Punting , I 'm just ready to go . To be honest , I 'm really not thinking anything . " <h> On if he 's seen himself improve with the distance in kickoffs <p> " Yes , definitely . This year especially , I have really trained to work on all three . My kickoffs have been something I worked on and will continue to progress over the summer . " <h> On how big of an influence the spring and summer are <p> " I feel like the summer is the most important part of the whole season . The team really kind of builds itself and understands what it 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest concern on defense <p> " Really , just finishing . You saw out there , just with the white team itself . We wanted to treat that whole situation like the Clemson game . We came up short , but we went into it strong . It 's something we need to work at and focus on in the spring . "

This week , we visit with Kristen Gillman . The freshman is currently the No. 5-ranked golfer in the country and earned her first collegiate victory at the Bryan National Collegiate earlier this month . <p> When did you begin golfing and why ? <p> Kristen Gillman : I started playing golf and doing tournaments when I was eight , but I probably started hitting a golf ball when I was about five . My older sister ( Emily ) , who plays at Nebraska , and I started together . We would go out there and go hitting for fun and enjoy it . Then my dad put us in tournaments at the same time , so we started coming up in our golf careers together . <p> When did it click in your mind that you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I played in high school and I actually committed to Alabama at the beginning of my sophomore year of high school , so I knew that I would be coming here for a while . I knew I wanted to compete at the collegiate level when I was in middle school . I played a lot of sports when I was younger ; basketball , I swam a lot , I love competitive swimming and I also love gymnastics , even though I do n't think I was that good at it . But in sixth grade I stopped the other sports and started focusing more on golf . <p> If you committed here as early as your sophomore year , when did you begin the recruitment process ? <p> KG : Alabama did n't recruit me as early because I was n't playing as well then . A lot of the Texas schools began to recruit me in the seventh grade . It was cool because Texas has so many golfers , I knew some coaches , so I started going on visits just for fun . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to play collegiately too , so she started going on visits and then I just started the process as well . We went on a few visits together , we both went on one to Nebraska together when I was in eighth grade . <p> What made you choose Alabama and did you know anything about UA before you came ? <p> KG : I did n't know anything about Alabama . There were a lot of Texas girls that I had known for a long time and they were committed here , we have two other girls from Texas on our team now . They committed before me . After looking at everything , I realized that I wanted to get out of Texas . I did n't want to go west so I had to go east , and I wanted to stay south , so this was a perfect fit . I was looking for more of a smaller college town . <p> - I was planning on taking visits to Auburn and Georgia , but at the last minute I got a call from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholarship open . My first thought was , ' Oh , I do n't think I will like it , let 's not go . ' But in the end , I took a visit here , and ended up falling in love . The campus is really cool , it 's big but not too big . We have awesome coaches . I think we have the two best coaches in college golf . The team gets along really well . And , another reason I came here is that this team is good . I knew I wanted to go to a place that had a chance at a national championship . <p> Having a sister who plays golf at Nebraska , was there ever any tension or pressure when choosing what school you were going to play at ? <p> KG : No , we were never really planning on going to the same school . My entire dad 's side of the family lives in Nebraska , so she went there and had family there . But when it came down to it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How was your transition from high school to college ? <p> KG : The hardest thing about leaving home is that I do n't have any family here . I 've only gone home at Christmas . So , it gets a little lonely not having family here , especially compared to my sister who only has an hour drive from my grandparent 's house . My parents do travel to all my tournaments though , so that 's nice . The transition overall was n't that bad . I knew what to expect . I 'm pretty good at managing my time so that whole transition to school was n't too bad . The transition in the golf aspect , I felt like it was pretty much the same . We still practice a lot , but we do travel a lot which was different . But , high school really prepared me well for all of that . <p> You have traveled around the world competing in golf tournaments . Did you ever imagine that what started as you and your sister hitting golf balls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When I started golf , I felt that I was pretty good to begin with , but I never thought it would ever reach this level . Stuff like that does n't even cross my mind . When I won the US Amateur in 2014 when I was finishing , I was almost in awe . I went into the tournament thinking I would n't even make the cut , much less win , out of 170 people , it 's crazy . So , no , I never thought that starting out I would ever reach this level . I never thought that it could give me so many opportunities as it did , either . I think I have traveled to about eight different countries in the past three years because of it . <p> Even though you 're now competing for UA , will you continue to compete in those large-scale tournaments that took you all over the world ? <p> KG : You can still compete in them . Most of the ones that I did were junior tournaments representing the United States , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college , but there are still a few like the Curtis Cup . They pick about ten women on average out of all the amateur golfers in the United States , so if get picked , I would play . <p> What are you goals as an athlete ? <p> KG : One is to stay as humble as possible and not to become wrapped up in it all . Another one is to maintain hard work ethic . I want to work as hard as I can always and not think back wishing I worked harder a few years down the road . One of goals , specific to golf , is that I have always had a dream to win a major tournament , especially the U.S. Women 's Open . I do want to play professionally in the future , for sure . <p> What is your favorite place you 've traveled through golf and why ? <p> KG : I traveled to France , and that was really cool because I had always wanted to go to France , it 's so pretty . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra special because that is where golf was originated , so it was really neat to see all the history there . My favorite tournament so far at Alabama was my first tournament at Vanderbilt . I had never been to Tennessee , which is crazy to think about because I have been to just about every other state , but it was my first time there . We played really well , and set a lot of records and it was my very first college tournament , so that is my favorite tournament so far . <p> What would be a piece of advice that you 'd want to give to your younger self ? <p> KG : My advice to my younger self would probably be to make sure you do n't make golf your entire life .
