These could include : <p> seeming withdrawn or inactive <p> extreme changes in mood <p> increased spending or loss of possessions <p> changes in sleeping patterns <p> appearing agitated or restless . <p> However , there may be other reasons why a person starts to act differently . It 's normal for teenagers , especially , to go through emotional changes . It 's important to talk to your relative , partner or friend about what you think may be happening , rather than making assumptions . <p> Before you talk to someone you think may be using drugs , it will help if you get your facts right . <p> The Department of Health and Ageing- provides information about different drugs and their effects on their website . <h> Are you a carer or helping someone out ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support to someone they know who has a disability , mental illness , drug or alcohol dependency , chronic condition , terminal illness or who is frail . <h> Support for carers <p> Find practical information and useful resources for carers on Carer Gateway .

If someone you care about uses drugs , it can be very hard to understand why they are doing this . However , they are responsible for their own behaviour and it 's their decision to use drugs . In the same way , they are responsible for deciding whether to stop using drugs . <p> Families of people who use drugs can go through certain patterns of behaviour when they learn about the issue .

You may feel anxious , depressed or ashamed because of your caring role . However you feel , it 's important to remember that you 're not alone . <p> There are local and national organisations that support the families and carers of people who use drugs . Many carers find it helpful to talk to others in the same situation , perhaps at a local carers ' support group . <p> Alternatively , online forums can provide an opportunity to share your experiences .

Alternatively , the person you care for can contact their nearest drug addiction service . <h> How you can help them <p> Even when someone comes to terms with the fact that they have a drug problem , it can be difficult for them to change their situation . You may need to be patient . If they are n't ready to seek help , the support you can offer will be limited to trying to minimise the impact that their drug use has on them and others around them . <p> If the person you care for has started to think about their situation and the negative effects of their drug use , you may be able to help by letting them know about the support that 's available to them . <p> When someone has chosen to seek help with their drug use , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One way that you could support them is by being understanding about how they 're feeling , while encouraging them in the changes they 've chosen to make . <p> For many people , taking action to deal with their drug use is just the start , and maintaining the changes they 've made may be the most difficult part . Recognising situations that could trigger their drug use , and trying to avoid these , could help . If the person you care for does lapse back into drug use , you can encourage them to seek help , for example by keeping in contact with local support services . <p> If the person you care for continues to use drugs despite the support you provide , this can be very frustrating and demoralising . Remember , the decision to use drugs is their responsibility , not yours , and make sure you seek help for yourself as a carer .

@@1890702 <h> Guide to genetic disorders <p> Genes are one of the basic units of life . Problems with genes can cause health or development problems . Some genetic disorders affect people from birth , others develop later in life . If you are concerned that you or someone you care for has , or might have , a genetic disorder , this page will provide you with more information . <h> Where are genes made of ? <p> Almost every cell in your body has a centre called a nucleus . In almost every nucleus , there are 46 chromosomes . Chromosomes are passed from parent to child , and are the vehicle for carrying all that you inherit from your parents . <p> Chromosomes are made of a chemical compound called DNA ( deoxyribose nucleic acid ) . A gene is a small section of that DNA . You have more than 20,000 genes in you . <h> How do genes influence your life ? <p> Genes contain the recipes for who you are , and they influence your life from the moment you are conceived .

These proteins will help you to do things such as grow , digest food and think . Some will help protect you against cancer , while others will allow cancer to grow . <p> The way your genes work can be influenced by many different things , such as your way of life or the environment around you . This field of knowledge is known as epigenetics . <h> What 's a genetic disorder ? <p> A genetic disorder is a health condition that comes about because of a problem with a gene or with a chromosome . <p> A problem with a single gene is known as a gene mutation .

Some people have a missing chromosome , some have an extra chromosome , some have a broken chromosome . Down syndrome , Turner syndrome and Kleinfelter syndrome are all examples of chromosomal disorders . <h> Why do genetic disorders occur ? <p> Most genetic disorders occur by chance . Genes and chromosomes are complex , and they often get changed slightly in the formation of new life . <p> Some disorders are passed down from a parent . If a parent has a damaged gene or chromosome , and that is passed down to a child , the child 's health might be affected . <p> Still others come about through changes in a person 's DNA during their life .

Some genetic conditions can be seen from birth . Others show up during childhood , adolescence or adult life . <h> What about testing for genetic disorders ? <p> Some genetic disorders can be tested for . There are many issues to consider before having genetic testing , such as the effect of a test on other family members or whether having a test might affect your working conditions or your chances of getting insurance .

If you want to get pregnant , having sex every couple of days will increase the chances of an egg ( ovum ) and many thousands of sperm cells coming into contact in the Fallopian tube where conception usually occurs . <p> The menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman 's period ( day one ) . Some time after her period she will ovulate , and then around 12-14 days after this she 'll have her next period . The average cycle takes 28 days , but shorter or longer cycles are normal . <h> The male sexual organs <p> The penis is made of erectile tissue . This tissue acts like a sponge and , when it becomes filled with blood , the penis becomes hard and erect . Men have two testes ( testicles ) , which are glands where sperm are made and stored . The testes are contained in a bag of skin that hangs outside the body , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testes at a constant temperature , just below the temperature of the rest of the body . This is necessary for the sperm to be produced and function normally . When it 's warm , the scrotum hangs down , away from the body to help keep the testes cool . When it 's cold , the scrotum draws up closer to the body for warmth . <p> Two tubes , called the vas deferens , carry sperm from the testes to the prostate and other glands . These glands add secretions that are ejaculated along with the sperm " now all together called semen . The urethra is a tube that runs down the length of the penis from the bladder , through the prostate gland to an opening at the tip of the penis . Semen travels down this tube to be ejaculated . <h> The female sexual organs <p> A woman 's reproductive system is made up of both external and internal organs . These are found in what is usually referred to as the ' pelvic area ' , the part of the body below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs are known as the ' vulva ' . This includes the opening of the vagina , the inner and outer lips ( labia ) and the clitoris . <p> The woman 's internal organs are made up of : <p> The pelvis " this is the bony structure around the hip area , which the baby will pass through when being born . <p> Womb or uterus " - the uterus is about the size and shape of a small , upside-down pear . It is made of muscle and grows in size as the baby grows . <p> Fallopian tubes " these lead from the ovaries to the uterus . Eggs are released from the ovaries into the fallopian tubes ( called ovulation ) , and this is where fertilisation takes place . Typically this occurs most months of a woman 's life whilst she menstruates ( but not when taking the pill , even though there may still be menstruation ) <p> Ovaries " there are two ovaries , each about the size of an almond , and they produce the eggs , or ova ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is normally almost closed , with just a small opening through which blood passes during the monthly period . During labour , the cervix dilates ( opens ) in order to let the baby move from the uterus into the vagina . <p> Vagina " the vagina is a tube about three inches ( 8cm ) long , which leads from the cervix down to the vulva , where it opens between the legs . The vagina is very elastic so it can easily stretch around a man 's penis , or around a baby during birth . <h> Menstruation ( periods ) <p> A majority of women ovulate each month , when an egg is released from one of the ovaries . Occasionally , more than one egg is released , usually within 24 hours of the first egg . At the same time , the lining of the uterus begins to thicken and the mucus in the cervix becomes thinner so that sperm can swim through it more easily . The egg begins to travel slowly down the Fallopian tube . <p> If there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the Fallopian tube that the highest chance of successful fertilisation occurs . The lining of the uterus is now thick enough for the egg to be implanted in it after fertilisation . <p> If the egg is not fertilised , it passes out of the body during the woman 's monthly period , along with the lining of the uterus , which is also shed . The egg is so small that it can not be seen to the naked eye except under a microscope . <h> Hormones <p> Hormones are chemicals that circulate in the blood of both men and women . They carry messages to different parts of the body , regulating certain activities and causing certain changes to take place . In women , the sex hormones , oestrogen and progesterone , control many of the events of the menstrual cycle , such as the release of the egg from the ovary , the thickening of the uterus lining , and receptivity of the uterus for implanting of the an embryo . <p> A pregnancy test measures these hormones especially those that rise after conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as you have conceived , the amount of oestrogen and progesterone in your blood increases . This causes the uterus lining to build up , the blood supply to your uterus and breasts to increase and the muscles of your uterus to relax to make room for the growing baby . <h> Will it be a boy or a girl ? <p> Both the man 's sperm and the woman 's egg play a part in determining the gender of a baby . Every normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes ( 23 pairs ) , except for the male sperm and female eggs . They contain 23 chromosomes each . When a sperm fertilises an egg , the 23 chromosomes from the father pair with the 23 from the mother , making 46 in total . <h> X and Y chromosomes <p> Chromosomes are tiny threadlike structures made from DNA , which each carry human genes . Genes determine a baby 's inherited characteristics , such as hair and eye colour , blood group , height and build . <p> A fertilised egg contains one sex chromosome from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chromosome from a woman 's egg is always the same and is known as the X chromosome . But the sex chromosome from a man 's sperm may be an X or a Y chromosome . <p> If the egg is fertilised by a sperm containing an X chromosome , the baby will be a girl ( XX ) . If the sperm contains a Y chromosome , the baby will be a boy ( XY ) . <h> Healthy lifestyle <p> If you 've decided to have a baby , you and your partner should make sure you 're both as healthy as possible . This includes eating a healthy balanced diet , stopping smoking and , for the woman , taking a folic acid supplement . <p> You should also know about the risks of alcohol in pregnancy . Seeking health advice from a health professional in helping you prepare for getting pregnant may assist .
