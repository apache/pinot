I will be continuing this series starting with ABC . Before we get to that , you can read my past Emmy articles below . <p> 1950s The alphabet network had a rough start in the outstanding comedy category . In 1952 and 1953 , they managed to get only one comedy nominated , The Herb Shriner Show and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet respectively . In today 's landscape , that would be quite a feat . But , with only 3 big networks at the time , it was rather disappointing . In comparison , CBS and NBC each had two comedies nominated in both years and both also managed to win the Emmy , NBC in 1952 and CBS in 1953 . Things got even worse the following year where ABC did n't receive a single nomination in the category . But , ABC 's fortune turned around in 1955 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first win for the alphabet network , and it would be the only win of that decade . In 1956 , Make Room for Daddy was once again nominated , but it could n't manage to win a second year in a row . The following year , the series moved to CBS and was renamed as The Danny Thomas Show . This new incarnation managed to get nominated in 1959 and again in 1960 , but it was no longer ABC 's property . For the remainder of the 50 's , ABC had 0 nominations and 0 wins . Things would n't brighten up for ABC in the following decade and it became clear that the network would n't be much of a threat in the category . <p> Wins : 1 <p> Nominations : 4 <p> 1960s <p> Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick Sargent in Bewitched . <p> The 60 's were arguably a worse decade than the 50 's for the network . To begin , ABC was entirely absent from the outstanding comedy category in 1960 . In 1961 , The Flintstones became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it marked ABC 's first nomination of the decade . After yet another year of absence , ABC regained momentum in 1963 with a nomination for McHale 's Navy . The following year , the series was nomination once more alongside The Farmer 's Daughter . This marked the first time that ABC got two comedies nominated in the category . Unfortunately , neither would make an appearance again . No comedy was nominated or given the award in 1965 , but ABC once again saw two comedies nominated in 1966 , Bewitched and Batman . While Batman would not receive another nomination , Bewitched was nominated until the decade 's end . Overall , while Bewitched got 4 Emmy nominations in total , it never actually won the award . In all , ABC did n't get a single win in this category for the decade . This bad luck would continue for a while , but things would soon turn around for the alphabet network . <p> Wins : 0 <p> Nominations : 9 <p> 1970s <p> The Cast of Barney Miller . <p> CBS was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by either All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show . In total , a CBS comedy received the award 8 out of 10 times from 1970 to 1979 . ABC managed to get 3 comedies nominated in 1970 , The Courtship of Eddie 's Father , Love , American Style , and Room 222 . All three were in their first seasons , but none managed to win . Love , American Style was nominated once more in 1971 alongside The Odd Couple . The latter was the only comedy from ABC to receive a nomination for a while . It got one again in 1972 and 1974 , but the network was entirely absent in 1973 and 1975 . ABC made a comeback in 1976 as cop comedy Barney Miller and Welcome Back Kotter both took home nominations . Barney Miller would receive a nomination once more the following year . In 1978 , ABC once more had three nominated comedies . Barney Miller , Soap , and Three 's Company were all nominated , but yet again , none managed to win . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ABC took home an award for the Judd Hirsch and Danny DeVito vehicle , Taxi . Alongside Taxi , Barney Miller received its fourth nomination while Mork and Mindy , Robin Williams 's first sitcom , also got its first nomination . While ABC got a win , it had only ever won twice in the category at the time which paled in comparison to NBC and CBS . Nevertheless , things would only get better for the alphabet network in the following decade . <p> Wins : 1 <p> Nominations : 16 <p> 1980s <p> The title card for The Wonder Years . <p> Unlike the previous decades , ABC started the 80 's off in strong fashion . Right off the bat , Taxi won the Emmy for the second year in a row . In the same year , Barney Miller was nominated for the fifth time and Soap received its second nomination . Taxi continued its streak in 1981 , winning for the third time in a row . At the time , it tied several other sitcoms ( including All in the Family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins in the category . Barney Miller and Soap were yet again nominated . This marked the 6th consecutive time that Barney Miller got a nomination in the category . Finally , after being nominated for every season sans its first , Barney Miller took home the award in 1982 for its eighth and final season . Taxi was still nominated this year , but Soap was not eligible as it had been canceled after four seasons . From 1979 to 1982 , ABC won double the amount of Emmys that it had won in the span of 26 years . Unfortunately , ABC 's streak came to a screeching halt . Taxi was nominated the following year but the series had made a network switch to NBC , so ABC ended up being entirely absent in 1983 . It was beginning to look like ABC was back to square one as not a single ABC comedy was nominated from 1984-1987 . Finally , in 1988 , The Wonder Years won the award in its first season . While it would n't win again , it was nominated once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the 80 's was ABC 's best decade in this category for the time being . While they did n't receive any nominations for a couple of years , they garnered a total of four wins , more than the other decades combined . It 's also safe to say that the 90 's would go down as one of their worst . <p> Wins : 4 <p> Nominations : 101990s <p> Tim Allen , the star of Home Improvement . <p> The 90 's marked the start of ABC 's signature TGIF sitcom lineup . Despite this , none of those comedies even garnered a nomination . The Wonder Years was nominated again in 1990 and 1991 for its third and fourth seasons respectively , but would not return again . The following year , Tim Allen 's Home Improvement took home a nomination for its first season . It would receive one again in 1993 and 1994 , but it never managed to win . ABC would not make an appearance in the category from 1995-1999 . Newer faces began appearing in the 90 's like HBO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders Show and FOX which managed to win the award for the Ally McBeal show in 1999 . Things were looking absolutely awful for the alphabet network , but the worst was still yet to come . <p> Wins : 0 <p> Nominations : 5 <p> The cast of Desperate Housewives . <p> 2000s There 's almost nothing to say about this decade . ABC would n't even reappear in the category until 2005 , eleven years after its last nomination . Desperate Housewives was the series that received it , even though it was more of a dramedy than a comedy . ABC would receive a nomination for another dramedy in 2007 , Ugly Betty , but that would be the only other nomination for the decade . Clearly , ABC had hit rock bottom . Younger networks like HBO and FOX had both won the award once and had many more nominations . But , like their comeback in the 80 's , ABC would have a renaissance in the following decade . <p> Wins : 0 <p> Nominations : 2 <p> 2010s <p> The title card for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a comedy-starved ABC and instantly became a critical and commercial success . In 2010 , for the first time in 22 years , ABC took home the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series for Modern Family . That was not the end of its Emmy career . Modern Family would win a total of five consecutive times , tying NBC 's Fraiser for most consecutive wins . In 2015 , Modern Family finally lost the crown to HBO 's Veep . Last year , ABC 's Black-ish received a nomination for best comedy alongside Modern Family . Those two ended up being the only network sitcoms to be nominated for the 2016 ceremony . In an instant , ABC went from the network that was fading into obscurity to the only broadcast network to receive nominations against an onslaught of cable networks and streaming services . CBS and FOX have mostly faded away with their last nominations being in 2014 and 2012 . Even NBC , which was a powerhouse in the 2000s , did n't receive a single comedy nomination last year . ABC has already passed every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get a sixth win , this decade still goes down as a massive success . <p> Wins : 5 <p> Nominations : 8 <p> The Breakdown In total , ABC has won 11 Emmys for outstanding comedies and been nominated 54 times . Below are two graphs showing ABC 's trend in the category . <p> Judging by this data , it 's clear that there is absolutely no trend . ABC has gone more than two decades at a time without a win and several years without a nomination , but somehow , it 's managed to turn things around . <p> Conclusion <p> It 's tough to say if ABC is a winner in this category . It has been around just as long as NBC and CBS , but it has less than half the nominations that the other two have ( 54 vs 113 and 110 respectively ) and only 11 wins while the other two have had 26 and 22 wins respectively . Aside from its stint in the 80 's , ABC was never really at the same competitive level as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never home to powerhouse critical darlings like the others . For example , CBS had a variety of different Emmy winners ( The Mary Tyler Moore Show , All in the Family , I Love Lucy , MASH ) as did NBC ( Cheers , Friends , Fraiser , The Golden Girls , Murphy Brown ) . All shows listed won multiple Emmys . While shows like Barney Miller and Taxi are still recognizable today , they were never as relevant and well-known as the shows listed above . It makes sense that ABC only won 6 Emmys in the category from 1952 to 2009 . Still , it looks like ABC is getting the last laugh . It 's the only broadcast network that has a fighting chance at winning the Emmy this year and has become a legitimate threat to the new generation of Amazon and Netflix . Sure , Modern Family is just one show , but they even got Black-ish in the ring . While it was commonplace for broadcast networks to have two or even three of their shows nominated , it 's unheard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cable are kings . CBS , NBC , and FOX could n't even score one nomination and have n't been a real threat in a while . In the end , maybe ABC was n't much of a competitor back in the day , but it 's really showing up the other networks in today 's landscape .

As such , these shows will need to be renewed earlier than usual . Bob 's Burgers is set to air its 8th production cycle this season , one that was ordered back in September 2015 . Should it get a ninth cycle , it will probably be renewed sooner rather than later . The same goes for Family Guy .

Some are more interesting than others ( Going into witness protection after taking down a crime mob vs Holt leaving the Nine-Nine ) , but ultimately , no loose ends will be tied up . " The Bank Job " does a great job setting up for the finale and reintroduces us to an old favorite . <p> First off , the cold opening is handled really well . While it has a lot to do with the plot , unlike most great cold openings , it 's really hilarious to see serious police work being discussed in a setting as silly as a Razzmatazz class . Things start to heat up when Jake &amp; Rosa choose Adrain Pimento as the one to interrogate/beat up in order to prove to Hawkins that they 're dirty cops . Pimento is a character one either loves or hate . I 'm definitely on the " love " side simply because his madcap style of comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great example of this is the interrogation scene as Peralta beats him up and it 's super difficult to tell if he 's in real pain or just faking it ( until he admits he does n't have health care ) .

Nonetheless , he seriously steals the show here . <p> Aside from the Pimento stuff , we 're met with the strong duo of Jake &amp; Rosa as they get drunk and high at the bar with the rest of Hawkin 's gang . There 's not much to say except that these two continue to work extremely well off each other . The writers shake things up as the two are forced to take part in a bank robbery and ultimately double-crossed by Hawkins .

If there is any payoff to this plot , it has to be when Milton Boyle ( the father of the child ) shows up and turns out to not be the loser that Charles said he was . I guess standards of " cool " are just different in the Boyle family . <p> " The Bank Job " is a stellar Brooklyn Nine-Nine outing .

@@81116472 @2616472/ <h> For Your Summer Binge Consideration : Speechless <p> This is the first article in a series of articles that a few of us will be writing this summer . This is the For Your Summer Binge Consideration series . Each article will talk about a show that will be returning for its second season in 2017-18 , and why you might want to watch the first season before the second season premieres . We begin with Speechless . <p> The first of ABC 's two new family comedy successes this season was Speechless , which follows a family that includes a child with cerebral palsy . The show aired 23 episodes in its first season , and will be returning to its Wednesday at 8:30 timeslot this fall . This article explains why one might like Speechless , so you can decide if you want to give it a watch in preparation for its second season . <p> Speechless was one of my favorite shows this season , out of both new and returning shows . Despite this , I was n't a big fan of the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Maya , the mother of the DiMeo family , who was also a bit too over-the-top . Luckily , it seemed that the show realized this as well over the course of its first few episodes . Episode two provided a modest improvement over the pilot , and episode three improved even further . In episode three , " B-O-N-BONFIRE " , the daughter Dylan got to have some good funny moments , and Jimmy , the father , was developed further . This episode also put on display Speechless 's style and worldview , which it would adhere to more closely in future episodes . <p> The episode where I fell in love with Speechless was its fourth episode , " I-N-S-INSPIRATIONS " . This episode had two plots , one which involved J.J , the one with cerebral palsy , and Kenneth , his aide , and one which involved the rest of the family . This episode highlighted the relationship between J.J. and Kenneth , and it gave the other four DiMeos a chance to do something that they are unable to do with J.J. due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment near the end of the episode . <p> Unlike Speechless creator Scott Silveri 's previous series Go On , I would not classify Speechless as a dramedy . The show has its serious moments , but it strives mainly to get laughs out of its audience . The frequency of serious moments is perfect thus far , showing real struggles that special needs families face , but not showing their lives as depressing , or anything close to that . The DiMeo family faces plenty of challenges , but they also have a great time . <p> So , let 's get to know the DiMeo family . Maya , played by Minnie Driver , is very protective of her family . Jimmy does n't really care what people think , he just wants his family to be happy . J.J. is popular among his classmates , but still has to overcome things due to his cerebral palsy , and due to his mother wanting to be involved in everything . Ray , the other son , is more sensitive , and definitely is n't one of the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't technically part of the family , but he really does become like a member of the family , with how much he cares about J.J. The family does n't have all that much money , moving into the worst house in a nice neighborhood so that they can go to the school in that area , but they make the most with what they have . <p> So who would like Speechless ? Well , do you like family comedies with heart ? Do you like comedies about families who are n't exactly normal , and do n't really care ? This is what Speechless is . Conflict in the show frequently comes out of things like when Ray gets annoyed by his family 's inability to plan or do things on time , when J.J. tries to be treated like every other kid , or when Maya struggles to accept that her kids are growing up . <p> If you do n't have as much time , and ca n't watch all 23 episodes of Speechless 's first season , make sure you catch the highlights : episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S-L-SLED H-O-HOCKEY " ) , 10 ( " C-H-O-CHOIR " ) , 12 ( " H-E-R-HERO " ) , 19 ( " C-H-CHEATER ! " ) , 20 ( " R-U-N-RUNAWAY " ) , 21 ( " P-R-PROM " ) , 22 ( " M-A-MAY-JAY " ) , and 23 ( " C-A-CAMP " ) . But I would recommend watching them all , considering how hard it was for me to narrow the 23 episodes down to these 9 . The only episode that I found to be just okay was the pilot , and no episodes were worse than okay . <p> If you 've seen Speechless already , do you have anything to add ? If you have n't , do you plan on giving it a shot ? Leave your thoughts in the comments !

I have , however , discovered that cast options for the series expire in late June , and the show is nowhere near a renewal . This does n't mean the the Carmichael Show is a certain cancellation , but it 's not a great sign . Another factor working against it is that it is n't owned completely by NBC , as it 's a 20th Century production . That could end up working against it , along with the fact that NBC 's bench is already packed . For these reasons , NBC 's longest-running sitcom ( yes , really ) LEANS CANCELLATION . <p> Still Star-Crossed : This megabomb of epic proportions returned this week with a 0.3 .

It wo n't be included in the breakdown analysis below for obvious reasons . <p> The Great Indoors , 2 Broke Girls , Code Black , The Odd Couple , Pure Genius , Criminal Minds : Beyond Borders , Training Day , Elementary , and Ransom are the series that remain in contention for renewal , some considerably more than others . <p> THE GREAT INDOORS <p> As the season closes out , CBS appears to be ( rightfully ) disappointed in the performance of its latest post-TBBT beneficiary led by Joel McHale . They decided to air the final two episodes of its first season on Mondays at 9:30 , which is already disastrous with the penultimate episode scoring a 0.8 in the demo , its lowest data point to date . CBS left it out of its mass renewals in March , leading us to assume its demise internally . The fact that the network already renewed three freshman ( Kevin Can Wait , Man with a Plan , Superior Donuts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as newbies go . Its seasonal average ( 1.44 ) is very mediocre considering the maximum exposure all season long . My final prediction : Likely to be Canceled . <p> 2 BROKE GIRLS <p> The future of the Kat Dennings-Beth Behrs comedy is one of the hardest , if not the hardest prediction to be made across television this year . After six years , many timeslots and moves to fill in where CBS needed it to , the show has died down to the 1.0 range . The show is not produced by CBS , it 's undoubtedly more expensive than a new replacement show would be , and it follows in the wake of a comedy department that saw the surprising cancellation of Mike &amp; Molly last year after filling a similar capacity for six seasons . That decision led many to believe , including myself , that the execs would n't be so kind to the aging 2 Broke Girls in the future . Now we 're here , the future , where the show was not included in the mass renewals that gave future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pieces ( Season 3 ) . Also renewed for next season include the previously mentioned freshman comedies Kevin Can Wait , Man with a Plan , and Superior Donuts , as well as the staple The Big Bang Theory ( renewed through Season 12 ) . The fall schedule will also include TBBT spinoff Sheldon , and perhaps another new series yet to be ordered . If CBS keeps its two hours of comedy next fall , that 's already 7-8 comedies ready and willing for eight spots . The argument for 2 Broke Girls is that it could get a final 13 , which is probably what it should exclusively hope for at this point in time when the competition is fierce . <p> The difference between the way CBS handled Mike &amp; Molly and how they would theoretically handle 2 Broke Girls ' cancellation is that the former was announced as the final season while the season was still airing , so it could be advertised as having a series finale for the fans . In the latter 's case , a cancellation would come after it aired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIP that would be sour for its long-standing fans . In addition , the sixth season of Mike &amp; Molly was already short at 13 episodes , whereas 2 Broke Girls had a full 22 , signaling that the attitude towards the latter was more committal and a sign of confidence that M&amp;M did n't have . Reportedly , CBS is in intense negotiations with Warner Bros . TV over the possibility of a continuation , and co-showrunner Michelle Nader is insistent that they are not done with this show and that the season 6 finale was decisively not a series finale . Of course , no one wants to end their show prematurely , which does n't make this case special or more deserving of renewal , but surely the staunch attitude of not catering to a season six finale that COULD act as a series finale makes Nader 's and 2BG a case to still be talked out extensively . WBTV makes $1.7 million/episode from its syndication deal with TBS , which makes this an important negotiation for WBTV . The fact that it was n't renewed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second-longest running sitcom still on air that has immense fan support and an apparent impassioned creative pitch to continue , has made me lean in its favor in these final days . I 'm expecting this one will be drawn out in front of its fans , which could help propel some interest in its final season of at least 13 episodes . My final prediction : Likely to be Renewed . <p> CODE BLACK <p> The second major question for CBS is its relationship going forward with its Marcia Gay Harden-led medical drama . Against its fellow fall freshman Limitless and Supergirl last year , the low-rated series , which only produced an 18-episode first season , was the only one to make it back on CBS for another season . It had a lower average than both Limitless and Supergirl , but other factors ( including Supergirl 's move to The CW ) made it a more feasible option to keep Code Black around , and apparently CBS champions it internally . The show took on some creative changes in its second attempt at success , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratings still dropped almost 24 percent year-to-year . Originally , the second season order was for 13 episodes , but CBS ordered an additional 3 before replacing it on the schedule again with Criminal Minds : Beyond Borders , which has failed to impress and rate any better . A renewal for this show would come from two sources : internal confidence at CBS , and a licensing reduction by co-producer ABC Studios . I 've been a supporter of the show 's chances to return for months , as it seems like a reliable albeit low performer for the network that they could use to phase out the likes of Elementary and Madam Secretary on Sundays next season , with Code Black taking the 9pm slot and pushing Madam Secretary to 10 . However , recent weeks and the closing in on upfronts have made me doubt this show 's ability to start over for a third time when it did n't produce growth and it only has 34 episodes in the can . It 's over two full seasons away from reaching a syndication deal , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant such a deal , and CBS could probably get by without it on the schedule . Despite being a different network and facing different circumstances , The Mysteries of Laura on NBC was a show that got a lot of misguided renewal support for a season 3 that ended up amounting to zilch . My gut is telling me that a similar situation of false confidence is occurring with Code Black , unfortunately for the fans of the show , which has been fairly well-received . My final prediction : Likely to be Canceled . <p> THE ODD COUPLE <p> The odd comedy couple out this season is Matthew Perry and Thomas Lennon . The series has had limited seasons for three years with increasingly troubling results in terms of ratings , where it has consistently been at the bottom of the heap . As it finished the year with 38 episodes and a 1.02 average in the A18-49 demo , there 's no foreseeable path ahead , especially to syndication , that would make sense for CBS to pursue as this show is simply unneeded . Matthew Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of the show 's future are just as telling that it 's done at CBS . My final prediction : Certain to be Canceled . <p> PURE GENIUS <p> The medical drama from Jason Katims was n't given an extended order from CBS beyond its initial 13 episodes , which made it the first evident victim of the fall . It averaged a measly 0.86 during its run , which makes a rival medical show like Code Black look much better in long term prospects . Perhaps CBS was hoping that Pure Genius would become what Code Black has n't , but the latter is still the stronger show . Katims has a new show in Rise to focus on at NBC , so I 'm sure he 's not fretting over this failure . My final prediction : Certain to be Canceled . <p> CRIMINAL MINDS : BEYOND BORDERS <p> The Criminal Minds spinoff is down nearly 32 percent from its season one performance in the post-Criminal Minds slot where it again replaced Code Black . Despite the mothership having been renewed already for a thirteenth season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been given word yet that it could continue for a third edition . With a worse seasonal average than Code Black , which has it beat in episodes ( 34 to 26 ) , the drama does n't seem to have the internal or data support it needs to continue . CBS renewed the series last year after a relatively strong debut , but it soon fizzled and if it comes down to this or Code Black , I am willing to bet on the latter returning . The lack of a renewal through this point suggests that CBS has been unimpressed . While Code Black has n't been renewed either , it 's more understandable that CBS would wait to see how Beyond Borders did before coming to a decision by May . This scenario seems like another CSI : Cyber ; a failed spinoff that gets a couple of tries , but ultimately dies in brand fatigue . My final prediction : Likely to be Canceled . <p> TRAINING DAY <p> Dredging up familiar movie properties is a gamble , as it 's worked somewhat for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Exorcist and NBC 's Taken ( their fates yet to be determined ) , and failed for the likes of FOX 's Minority Report and CBS 's Limitless . The recognizable property following four feature films got off to a very slow start , endured one of its leads ( Bill Paxton ) dying suddenly , and was moved to Saturdays in expected burn-off fashion . CBS will let this one go quietly amidst the chaos . My final prediction : Certain to be Canceled . <p> ELEMENTARY <p> The third and final big question mark on CBS this season : Elementary . The fifth season show has a loaded $3 million/episode syndication deal that has propelled its early renewal for the past few years for good reason . Les Moonves has touted how profitable the show is and how it 's a staple for the network . However , this year was a little different , with the mass renewal not including the prized drama . That 's not that surprising for those who follow ratings , as it 's CBS 's second worst rated show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's only better than a weak Saturday night program ( Ransom , 0.45 ) . It 's been recently positioned on Sunday nights at 10pm , where football typically causes regular delays . The most recent airings of Elementary not affected by football include a couple of 0.5s . That 's horrendous , rating below NBC 's Shades of Blue but above ABC 's American Crime . Does a lucrative syndication deal make it passable , though ? Could it be moved to Saturdays next season instead ? Yes , and possibly , but the lack of a firm renewal in place through early May makes that hard to assess from a ratings spectator 's angle of which does n't have the ins and outs and intricate details of the negotiations taking place about the show 's future . As with Code Black , I 've had to reassess my stance on its chances to return as of late , what with word circulating that the network has put forth permission to make writing staff deals for a sixth season and the continued touting of its international prospects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , it 's something that suggests the negotiations are serious and that this property is worth the pitiful L+SD ratings . It could stay on Sundays , it could possibly show up on Saturdays , but the bottom line is that this supposedly ultra-profitable show that gave CBS millions and millions in profits is n't dying off that easily , as aggravating and shocking as it may seem to predict the #25 ( out of 26 ) show to be renewed . My final prediction : Likely to be Renewed . <p> RANSOM <p> Speaking of that random Saturday show : Ransom ! What does Ransom have that Elementary does n't ? Nothing ; in fact , it has so much less than Elementary that it would benefit from a Netflix/Orange is the New Black ransom scandal that could at least bring it some buzz . My final prediction : Likely to be Canceled.

@@81116482 @2616482/ <h> Making History Season 1 Episode 9 Review - Season Finale <p> Making History has been an enjoyable ride . While I felt that the series lost its way after the Capone arc , it 's still produced a solid 22 minutes of comedy every week for the most part . It pains me to say that the series has been canceled and " Body Trouble " does n't ease the pain one bit . It 's an episode that just made me feel sad that the series is no more and it does n't really give any closure . That 's not to say that " Body Trouble " is a bad episode , but as a series finale , it does n't do its job . <p> First off , there 's the Hancock &amp; Adams plot . The idea to make Hancock a rich man and Adams a bum is pretty amusing , but it does n't last long and I would have preferred to see more of this new dynamic . Deb introducing the duo to emotion is pretty funny at first , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more annoying than amusing . Still , I liked seeing these characters evolve a bit from the out-of-touch people they were before . Ultimately , Hancock &amp; Adams provided a good bit of comic relief throughout the series , but I think they worked best when they were in a 1775 setting . <p> The Dan plot is a lot funnier as he continues to kill Dr. Cobel to the point where he has multiple bodies in his possession . This type of darkish humor ends up hitting the mark and Dan 's almost careless behavior towards the situation makes thing even better . On the other hand , Chris being the punching bag is n't very funny . I like Chris 's character , but the past few episodes have simply been about him being beaten down . His character was much better in the earlier installments when he was the competent and established nerd . One thing I did like here was that Dan &amp; Chris eventually made up after the hilarious burying Cobel ordeal . <p> My biggest problem with this finale is not what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't any game-changing problem that the gang had to face and it all seemed very anti-climactic . Making History showed several times that it had what it takes to be an amazing series . " Chadwick 's Angels " showcased this beautifully as Dan met his past self and realized that he could n't interact with him . The Al Capone arc was another example of how this series was able to introduce a high-stakes scenario and intertwine it with comedy . <p> The final moments of Making History feature Dan &amp; Chris debating whether or not Tupac is alive . It seems fitting to end a series that died too young by alluding to a rapper who 's life was also cut short . <p> Flaws aside , Making History had a solid 9-episode run . Maybe it did n't live up to it 's fullest potential , but the comedy and acting never failed .

Damn it , Making History , I need some answers ! <p> What happened to the reporter ( Natalie Morales ) from the last episode ?

@@81116484 @2616484/ <h> ABC is Thisclose to Reviving American Idol on Sundays <p> Per variety , ABC has won the bidding war for an American Idol revival against contenders NBC and FOX . NBC negotiations hit an impasse in February despite having former host Simon Cowell under contract . Earlier this week , ABC entered the arena and appears to have the suitable conditions for Idol to return . Also discussed is the return of Ryan Seacrest , whom earlier this week was announced as Michael Strahan 's predecessor on Kelly Ripa 's chatterbox , Live with Kelly . ABC 's proposal would place American Idol on Sundays beginning in March 2018 , a welcome change for both the network and the franchise.American Idol holds a unique place in FOX and television history , redefining both the perennially 4th place network and sculpting the reality TV direction of the 2000 's .

The series returned during the mainstreamed 2002-03 season , igniting ratings and becoming the network 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarcity of available programming , cementing not only Idol 's position as the 1st and 2nd place programs for the season , but also the first time FOX ever rose to prominence as the 1st Place network to dethrone CBS 's stranglehold.The changes are beneficial for all parties , and here is why:1 . The franchise will have rested for two years if it debuts in spring 2018 . For years , AI dominated the airwaves until NBC debuted the Voice in 2012 . Ratings slowly regressed , hitting icebergs as hosts did not click . Jennifer Lopez , Steven Tyler and Keith Urban made dynamite replacements for Paula Abdul , Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson . But lest forget the narcissistic feud between divas Mariah Carey and Nicky Minaj in 2014 . Their upstage of the show vs. the talents began a sharp plummet in the ratings . By 2018 , that will be a mere memory in a textbook . With enough time retired , Idol stands in a marketable place for renewed interest.2 . NBC 's the Voice is fading . Still prominent in ratings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softer numbers falling B flat at 1.5 in the demos . This may be demonstrating a change in taste and preference for television viewing . Just like The Voice has endured this season , American Idol began experiencing the fade in spring 2012 . With the Voice aging , viewers may give a refreshed Idol a chance with appealing hosts and minor revamps to the format.3 . ABC needs help . Like FOX did for years , it rests in 4th place with the season averages . Thanks to changes made by Disney to keep sports exclusively on ESPN , ABC no longer has football to bolster Sunday ratings . CBS , NBC and FOX still enjoy Nielsen boosts from live sports , leaving ABC Sunday ratings frozen in recent years . And not the kind that ignited an avalanche of Nielsen watershed like Once Upon a Time did in 2014 . Should ABC resurrect Idol on Sundays , it has repaired its most problematic night if successful . Idol helped FOX push past ABC in 2003-04 for 3rd Place , and enjoyed the same luxury besting NBC from 2004-07 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serious forefront of the networks.4 . Sundays were a prominent evening for ABC from 2004-13 . The evening was considered weak until crafty and well-scripted Desperate Housewives entered the fray in Fall 2004 , becoming the network 's number one show and pushing ABC back into 2nd place . DH 's welcome fortunes paved the debut for durable Grey 's Anatomy later that season , leading to Grey 's rebuilding Thursdays all the way to its current 13th season . DH faded from glory in 2011 , yet lead-in Once Upon a Time reignited the evening during its last season . That led to the mild success of Revenge , which also faded in prominence in 2014 . Since then , ABC has endured scheduling issues from the 9-11PM timeslots , and this season adds fading OUAT 's 8pm timeslot to this misfortune . Adding Idol is a welcome departure.5 . American Idol enjoyed Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday showings on FOX , which may help viewers familiarize themselves against Nielsen elimination . However , those evenings are performing modestly to successfully under ABC 's current format . Mondays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Stars , and Fridays are doing okay . Sundays would not only prove beneficial for the network , but also for Idol and reality TV fans . It will allow ABC to leave its mark on the show , as well as give viewers something new to look forward to on a new evening.6 . It is a perfect fit following Sunday Football and the Winter Olympics . After viewers tackle NBC , CBS and FOX for sports from September-February , NBC will freeze viewing patterns for the 2018 winter Olympics . What is left for viewers to enjoy from March through May ? ABC has wisely anchored this opportunity , as spring viewing patterns leave hemorrhages . Even if Idol locks in a 1.2 rating regularly during that period , it shall improve over paltry ratings which plunged as low as 0.3 this season with Time After Time and American Crime.Would you welcome the latest revival on Sundays ?

Fall numbers make fireworks , whilst Spring fails to ignite a spark . <p> MONDAY <p> CBS cornered the market on this evening with the return of Monday comedies as the other three networks have little desire to place sitcoms on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC and ABC , and FOX has modest dramas . After dismantling comedies on Monday in the 2015-16 season , CBS went all in and returned to a familiar approach which housed seven comedies over four slots . Juggernaut The Big Bang Theory resided in this block for five weeks , aiding a strong launch to Kevin Can Wait . In a week by week progression , veterans 2 Broke Girls , The Odd Couple and freshman Man With a Plan made debuts between 10/10 and 10/24 . The results were mixed , with Kevin Can Wait retaining a sizable portion of its lead-in , then leading the night with modest success . Man With a Plan never managed outshine its lead-in , yet followed the rhythm of the night . 2 Broke Girls created a firestorm 2-episode debut , then received mixed results in the weeks following . And Odd Couple siphoned off viewers at 9:30 . <p> After TOC crashed and burned , CBS utilized mid-season entry Superior Donuts at 9pm , shoving 2BG to its 10th and final death timeslot . The Spring roster delivered weak numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was burned off in 2 Broke Girls ' last workspace . <p> What Sizzled -- 2016 , duh . As usual , The Big Bang burned bright in early fall . Kevin Can Wait cemented its following and is the network 's strongest freshman comedy . 2 Broke Girls also enjoyed a successful 2016 in a familiar timeslot . <p> What Fizzled -- 2017 . ' Nuff said . CBS Mondays exhibited the first signs of Spring Mudslides as all shows sank lower into the lower 1.0 range . The Odd Couple attained the first cancellation status , and 2 Broke Girls hemorrhaged viewers due to moves and inconsistent scheduling . MWAP followed the rhythm for better or worse , as did SD . And The Great Indoors bared their fractional value , ending on a whimper . It appears the glory of the 1986-2014 CBS sitcom dominance has faded . <p> What is to Come -- Another forgettable year with the exhausted formula in play . Early fall entails TBBT launches freshman 9JKL at 8:30 , KCW takes the 9pm anchor to lead into Me , Myself and I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me Myself and I upgrading to 9pm and Superior Donuts debuting in the block 's weakest 9:30 timeslot . Absent is follower MAWP . <p> Bridger 's Take -- Like Sundays , Monday will repeat history with a strong(er) 2017 , followed by a tenuous 2018 . MWAP being absent demonstrates an alarming problem , as CBS often benches its comedies 4 seasons in , not in its 2nd season . Unless SD or one of the pilots sinks , this could present a problem as it will be mid-season putty . CBS appears to be banking on its pilots ' successes and using MWAP as a backup . SD is weak , yet may fit at 9:30 as a quiet producer . <p> TUESDAYS <p> The 2016-17 made this evening competitive television , period . ABC and FOX delivered six permanent sitcom homes to eight entries , while NBC offered timeshare viewing in its 9pm timeslot to three sitcoms it renewed . ABC took the boldest risk and enhanced its lineup with two sitcom entries , sliding its weak fares from 8 to 9pm . The greatest wildcard offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . American Housewife earned its staying value early , often besting the Middle at 8:30 in 2016 . Fresh Off The Boat played steady with its ratings , and sophomore The Real O'Neals and freshman Imaginary Mary tanked at 9:30 . <p> FOX returned to a similar formula of New Girl and Brooklyn 99 , going fractional early in the fall . Mid-season crass-com The Mick bridged their absences , and the three sitcoms shared two timeslots . NBC used The Voice to not only launch drama This Is Us , but also sitcoms The Good Place , Trial and Error and Great News with mixed results . All were renewed . <p> What Sizzled -- ABC . Tuesdays were previously the network 's weakest evening , and it appears to have repaired half of its broken evening . The Middle and American Housewife delivered steady to above average ratings , while FOTB not only weathered overshadowing from This is Us , but also Spring Doldrums . FOX mildly bolstered its roster with provocative The Mick and appears interested in using it to rebuild this weak evening . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanked , as did NBC 's timeshare sitcoms in the second showing . FOX lost its thunder on this evening ages ago , with fractions now passable fare . <p> What is to Come -- Competitive real estate , lead by ABC choosing to shake up their roster . FOTB moves again to 8:30 , Wednesday transplant blackish takes on 9pm , and freshman pilot The Mayor takes the cursed 9:30 space . FOX again appears to be sharing its two timeslots to the same three tenants . NBC relocated its crowned piece to Thursdays to take on ABC 's TGIT , establishing permanent anchors for Thursday fares Superstore and The Good Place . The 8-10pm hours will be dominated by ABC , and Superstore may receive a little lead-in-TLC from The Voice . <p> Bridger 's Take -- ABC has n't learned their lesson that 9:30 entries are cursed . FOTB will not burn as bright as other sitcoms and is ideal filler for this space . It should have been placed at 9:30 , unless ABC is optimistic about enhancing it in the event The Middle vacates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead the network to ruling the timeslot . The Mayor needs a prayer to avoid impeachment , while The Good Place may finally grow in its new home . <p> WEDNESDAY <p> ABC ferociously claimed a territorial victorious evening with all of its sitcoms placing among the top 7 sitcoms airing in 2016-17 among the 34 entries . It moved established Goldbergs into the 8pm slot , and Speechless thrived in its plum setting . Having cemented the same schedule for two seasons , ABC mildly shook things up in the 8pm hour to expand its brand . Empire faded into dissension , while ABC endured the nastiness of spring ratings with moderately successful results . Modern Family eroded into ordinary territory , yet it received a 2-season pickup along with The Goldberg 's . <p> What Sizzled -- Fall ratings . All shows burned bright , with only blackish taking a weak 1.2 rating . Little more needs to be said as the numbers tell us what burned hot this season -- The entire Lineup ! <p> What Fizzled -- The creative pacing in 2017 . MF grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speechless became another run of the mill crazy family sitcom , and blackish took to many topical bold risks . All minor repairs which can be cleaned up . <p> What is to Come -- A mild shakeup , as blackish moves to Tuesdays and American Housewife receives a little TLC as The Goldberg 's received in 2014 . <p> Bridger 's Take -- ABC wisely moved blackish , as it has three years of critical acclaim and enough visibility to anchor Tuesdays at 9pm . American Housewife took Tuesdays by storm , narrowly edging The Middle in most 2016 entries . The show has great potential for growth , and appears to be MF 's predecessor should it exit in 2019 . ABC appears to have FOTB and blackish to anchor the prime hours on Tuesday , and The Goldbergs and American in the prime hours on Wednesday should MF and The Middle exit in 2019 . This strategy may ensure the comedy blocks survive beyond that timeline . <p> THURSDAY -- <p> CBS again opened its doors to 4 permanent sitcom spaces , while NBC reopened two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus a guest showing of Superior Donuts , while NBC split three sitcoms in the two spaces with softer results . The Big Bang Theory eroded as expected , yet rules the roost . The Great Indoors squandered its plum timeslot to dismal results , sinking the remaining lineup . In spite of this shortcoming , Mom showed its strangulation power and eventually would outshine its lead-in . Life in Pieces struggled in the 9:30 timeslot , yet delivered a sturdy performance similar to ABC 's FOTB . Over at NBC , fall was silent for critically heralded Superstore and The Good Place . Both received early mid-season renewals , and Powerless made a low-voltage run in The Good Place 's exit . <p> What Sizzled -- The Big Bang , of course . Mom also provided stability , and critical acclaim traipsed the majority of the lineup . NBC also deserves praise as it is making mild attempts to relive the glory of Must-See TV . <p> What Fizzled -- The Great Indoors dumped its rating into the network outhouse . So sad Big-Bang-Lite , aka a common rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitcoms minimal promotion . Powerless drained NBC 's grid , and suspiciously damaged Superstore further than common doldrums were capable of doing . <p> What is to Come -- A minor cleanup of atrocity TGI paves the way for a welcome Little Sheldon . Beyond that , NBC made an about-face decision to move its powerhouse This is Us against Mom and Life in Pieces . Will and Grace returns to its former home at 8pm , while under-performing Great News receives TLC wedged between two critical darlings . <p> Bridger 's Take -- CBS is playing their cards correctly . Not only " If It Ai n't Broke , Do n't Fix It " , but also forecasting Little Sheldon becoming its parent 's predecessor in 2019 . Mom and LIP could endure damage against This is Us , yet few humorous undertones exist in the superior-rated , leaving alternative viewers to enjoy their laughs . NBC is making bold strides at 8pm , yet will spend another season 3rd in their timeslot . Will and Grace makes sense , and hopefully Great News will establish in its plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented the usual soft demos . ABC scrapped the only showings here , with Last Man Standing delivering a stronger year than the previous year , while Dr. Ken had the opposite effect . <p> Bridger 's Take -- In an era which only sitcoms and select reality TV fares rule the roost on their weakened network , ABC made the foolish choice of turning this night into a dumping ground . Is n't that its definition of Sundays or 10pm any other evening ? All but one freshman drama tanked . Fridays were mildly stable , yet ABC undid its stable tapestry . ABC should have cooled it on another drama and perhaps relocated Speechless to plug LMS 's hole , or taken a risk on another sitcom paired with Dr. Ken . Once Upon a Time may have worked at 9pm , or buried into the Sunday schedule . 10pm dramas are a hard sell in recent years , and Marvel and appeal to younger male viewers who enjoyed Sundays . <p> During the Summer hiatus , I welcome you to join us and look back at retrospective seasonns ' ratings .

The silliness of the prison panties arc stifled out through a vice business war as Dominican leader Maria Ruiz ( Jessica Pimental ) not only threw the soiled story into the washer , but took the lead this season as she vengefully crusaded for her fellow Dominican inmates to fight for their place inside the walls of Litchfield . Maria 's ruthless rise to prominence was welcome as OITNB explored prison overpopulation and the effects on the community.Prior to the overcrowding story , the large ensemble was divided by the whites , blacks and Latinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter a rash of Dominican transplants , dividing the Latinas as the dynamic shifted to Puerto Ricans vs . Dominicans . The Dominicans managed to divide the Latina demographic , intertwine and create divides among the whites within themselves and against the other ethnic prisoners . And most potently , it boiled over creating a writhing divide between the enforcers and the prisoners.Season 3 lacked polarizing writing and tension , leaving Season 4 to restore the rhythm . New characters emerged , and established characters either came to full circle or are overstaying their welcome . And thankfully , caricatures like Judy King ( Blair Brown ) existed solely for plot fuel/comic relief and will burn off fast . Without divulging too many dirty twists and ruining the experience for new viewers , let 's take a look at what worked and fizzled this season --What Worked in Season 4The overcrowding arc is the standalone MVP in OITNB tales . Season 1 set up the launchpad for us to invest in our detail-rich characters . Season 2 added a crime thriller perils of Vee and her drug empire with mixed-to-positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploits of prison panties . Season 4 's Overcrowding arc utilized its 13 episodes like stair steps escalating to a full-blown conflict . Pimental 's ruthless portrayal of Maria managed to command and upstage several characters who outlived their plot purposes , including increasingly irritating Piper Chapman ( Taylor Schilling ) . While Schilling 's performance is not to blame , she has been written into a corner as a narcissistic WASP whose caustic choices land her in hot water . Her brutal attack was cringe-worthy , yet leveled the karma route for Piper 's haughty antics . Several viewers cheered as the Dominican baddies belted a white supremacist in comically rewarding fashion . <p> Outside the overcrowding arc , Judy created some laughable distractions which manipulatively tackled the class issues . A shameless and passive aggressive narcissist , Judy was inappropriately placed with organic minimalist Erica " Yoga " Jones ( Constance Shulman ) . She also degraded passive Poussey ( Samara Wiley ) , as she depicted her as a stereotypical product of a black crack fiend vs. an upper-middle class black lady fell on bad decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fairweather Joel Luschek ( Matt Peters ) via a drug-hazed threesome . Judy is a cartoon character against the gritty , character-rich , dirty ensemble , and gratefully will vacate OITNB 's house after her purpose expires like a gracious and phony houseguest.Luschek was not the only DO who experienced an about-faced comeuppance , as Charlie Coates ( James McMenemin ) demonstrated his remorse for raping Tiffany " Pennsatucky " Doggett ( Taryn Manning ) . The DO house was a plot hindrance this season , yet Coates standing his ground and defending a prisoner redeemed much of his tarnished presence . Director of Human Activities Joe Caputo ( Nick Sandow ) fell victim to the toxicity of the system , yet eloquently towed the line between heroic and shady in the prison 's ultimate antihero . Caputo lost his underdog rooting by allowing Sophia Burset ( Laverne Cox ) to be placed in solitary confinement after enduring a hate crime . He returned to our beloved hero when he slyly allowed Sophia 's image in confinement to be leaked under the radar , facilitating her return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayley ( Allen Aisenberg ) to get out of the prison and save his soul , yet threw the DO under the bus after Poussey 's senseless death . Caputo is tarnished , yet has created a standalone status as the most enriched male character in a female-dominated cast.Speaking of Poussey 's death , Samara Wiley was an iconic and peaceful presence in core original cast . Her purpose came full-circle to our dismay , yet her last season delivered a rewarding bite . She and her two true-loves , Brook Soso ( Kimiko Glenn ) and Tasha " Taystee " Jefferson ( Danielle Brooks ) delivered lighthearted fuel minus outlandish antics , devastating us as their trio is down to two . After saving a despondent Soso from a suicide attempt and psych , Poussey cemented Soso as an asset to the cast vs. a nuisance via their slow-built romance . And Poussey 's tragic last moments burned the best tearjerker in the show 's history into our viewing memories as Taystee somberly unleashed that cry of grief at realizing her spiritual soulmate met a tragic end . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janitorial duties as Caputo wisely promoted her to his assistant . She has steadfastly progressed from the moments she returned to prison , making efforts to polish her tacky demeanor in hopes of a promising life upon release . Taystee 's community neighbors also enjoyed some lighthearted endeavors , albeit they rooted from initial hatred dating millenniums beyond origin . Newfound Jewish convert " Black " Cindy Hayes ( Adrienne Moore ) channeled an immediate hatred toward fellow Muslim inmate Allison Abdullah ( Amanda Stephen ) , poetically over territory and space . Both sparred over the first half of the season , then bonded over a disdain over Scientology . This site does not have any faith preference and does not condone lambasting any religion , yet it was touching to see two women switching their pawns from adversaries to alliances.Galina " Red " Reznikov ( Kate Mulgrew ) continued to command as the mother of the Litchfield ladies . She took a backseat this season to her younger counterparts , yet retained the sage wisdom needed from the over-45 demographic . She played the central force in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts like a a beloved mother to the displaced inmates . She mediated the murder of Alex 's would-be killer by recommending turning him into tomato fertilizer . Red also repaired Piper 's injured hoof after Maria punished her with a swastika brand for leading to profiling the ethnic prisoners . Red branded her " an open window " and righted a remorseful Piper . <p> Red faced her " conviction " in one of the finalepisode as viewers learned precisely what landed her in prison -- a murdered mobster found dismembered in her restaurant 's freezer , similar to the DO found chopped into a mixed green salad in her garden . The " Between Heaven and Hell " plot hook helped us reinvest in a character who was sidelined by younger , brassier inmates . Just as she did to protect her nuclear family , Red stood fiercely cold and silent to protect her prison community . Kate Mulgrew 's appropriately stoic performance tugged at our heartstrings as we feared our beloved prison mother would wrongfully endure another conviction in spite of never committing a felony by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's den-mother role . Laura Prepon entered OITNB red-hot as Piper 's heron of sexuality , yet waned into a plot device in Season 3 . After Lolly defensively murdered her assailant in the season 's opening hook , Alex Vause upped the ante and suffocated her would-be-assassin . Prepon flourishes in dramatic tones on OITNB , wise to leave her comic abilities behind with her persona on That 70 's Show . Tragically , mentally unhinged Lolly Whitehill ( Lori Petty ) fell victim to her insecure psyche . <p> After Alex wrongfully pegged her as her stalker and attacked her the previous season , she inadvertently led to Lolly 's downward spiral as she dutifully dispensed Kubra 's enforcer with her steadfast , defensive heels . Said plot twists unhinged Lolly 's last screws , leaving her in death 's clutches as Freida Berlin ( Dale Soules ) had her marked for death . Tragic foreshadowing painted a souring portrait of Lolly 's descent into prison life via backstory , as she was an intelligent soul gone sour via conspiracy theories in the 90 's . After wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rambling vagrant pushing a shopping cart and lost her freedom . Tragically , the clutches of sanity slipped , and she fell victim to the psych unit late in the season.Sam Healy ( Michael Harney ) made valiant efforts to save Lolly , as he projected his mother 's loss of mental clarity into keeping her in clarity . He spared her life , yet lost the battle as she was confined . We learned Healy 's mother suffered the same tragedy as Lolly , and his mother 's loss left him with power complexes over controlling women , as depicted by Judy , leading to his convex , damaged psyche . Healy 's committal is appropriate as he his a layered , flawed and valiant soul.In a welcoming comic foil , Sister Mary Ingalls ( Beth Fowler ) deliberately invokes the wrath of the guards by smoking like a frisky teenager , then slapping a guard . Comic farce ? None of the above . She smuggles in a cell-phone in solitary confinement to do reconnaissance on Sophia . Sophia 's wrongful isolation ripped the scab off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her protection " . Sophia 's sickening suicide attempt was sour at best , yet upped the dramatic ante . It also magnified the root of the conflict with Gloria , who shined as she used her resources to keep Sophia 's family abreast ( no pun intended ) of her latest tragedy . Thankfully , the sour plot dissolved mid-season with Gloria polishing a wounded Sophia 's image with her wig , narrowly repairing their fragmented friendship.What Failed in Season 4As triumphant as Season 4 delivered , several plot holes emerged in lieu of writing , characters and delivery . Elizabeth Rodriguez is a talented performer as depicted by her guest-spot on The Big Bang Theory as Raj 's Cuban date who schools him on profiling . She is a beauty and a capable performer . Yet her being a mere 2 years older than on-screen daughter Daya ( Dasha Polanco ) retired the useof her character Aleida as she outlived her purpose of guarding Daya during her pregnancy . Whilst Aleida 's reemergence into the free world made a nice arc , it left unease as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodriguez is a great actress , but lest pray Aleida decides to adopt stability over familiarity.The DO house was an eyesore to OITNB viewers this season . Initially Suzanne and Maureen 's love nest , it morphed into the misogyny playhouse for the corrupt male DO 's . Most disturbing was Humphrey pointing his loaded weapon at Maritza 's ( Diane Guerrero ) head and forcing her to pick between ingesting dead roaches or a live baby mouse . Maritza 's backstory painted her as a vile opportunist , and this tragic twist moved the sympathy pendulum too far . Even beyond Coates raping Pennsatucky or Pornstache facilitating an inmate 's overdose death.Apologies are in place for that visual , yet it was necessary to depict the graphic flaws committed this season . The DO 's exhibited minimal redeeming qualities this season outside of Coates ' redemption and Bayley 's innocent nature . In order to depict an effective villain , writers must establish some rooting qualities to make us invest in their dastardly deeds . Luschek has yet to pay for his role in Nikki 's downfall and loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sent to a deprogramming camp . And the image above left little rooting qualities for Humphrey . George " Pornstache " Mendez was a despicable presence we hoped to fall , yet his vulnerability made us care when he was sent to prison for " raping " a scheming Daya . And John Bennett ( Matthew McGorry ) plunged to cowardice as he abandoned his pregnant mistress . Yet his PTSD from the Iraqi conflict was carefully painted to justify his flaws . If OITNB wants us to care about Humphrey taking a bullet , they best fill in the blanks as to why we should care if he dies . Luschek exhibited mild guilt over his wrongful actions against Nicky Nichols ( Natasha Lyonne ) , yet her lapse into her addiction lacked punch . Instead of being a heartbreaking downfall , it was glossed over like an ABC After School special or self-contained sitcom conflict.Big Boo ( Lea DeLaria ) and Pennsatucky ( Taryn Manning ) were criminally underused ( no pun intended ) , and Lorna ( Yael Stone ) lost her credibility as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrum from a 5-year old . Worst of all , Daya ( Dascha Polanco ) languished after her heralded birth last season , depicting regression as she had not learned from her tragic consequences which landed her inside the walls of Litchfield.Suzanne " Crazy Eyes " Warren ( Uzo Aduba ) finally explored the root of her incarceration to souring results . Audiences knew Crazy Eyes is developmentally delayed , yet they took it to far as she accidentally murdered a young boy . Her boundaries backstory would have sufficed in an accidental kidnapping , yet OITNB upped the ante and took it too far when he fell to his death in a graphic visual . Yoga committed a similar offense , yet OITNB restrained itself and avoided a graphic visual of the boy 's death . Worse yet , Suzanne and Maureen Kukudio ( Emily Althaus ) were used as pawns in the guards ' twisted fight club.Movie night delivered disastrous results . Not because Taystee played critically lambasted " The Wiz " . Or the racial tensions . But rather , that nasty slur we shall not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully depict the sour , toxic environment inside the prison . Yet using that nasty slur which is a boil on the sagging behind of American society and is a cheap way out in depicting racial divides . Nothing good comes out of that word , even in prison ; just do n't use it ! <p> Breakout PerformancesLaura Gomez created the best scene-stealing performance of Season 4 as Blanca Flores , an unkempt , intriguing addition to the cast . Viewers first notice Blanca 's rough entrance as she sports a surprisingly sensual tribute to Frida Kahlo 's prominent eyebrows . OITNB writers promptly ( and wisely ) explored part of Blanca 's backstory as a put-upon servant of a nasty shrew who desired a roll-back on civil rights . Saged viewers may recognize Mary Wilson Brown 's Millie in a contrasting cameo to her One Day at a Time role as free-loving Ginny , the key ingredient to igniting Blanca 's vengeance . Blanca put up with the nasty curmudgeon renaming her " Bianca " as it fit her spelling and culture . Yet she stood her ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bianca " inheriting her figurative paradise . Gomez sympathetically delivered a factual declaration when she stated " he is a person " vs. the distraction Millie fired him for . Dangling the carrot of " you may inherit my estate , " Blanca stands her ground , declaring she will not live her life waiting for her inheritance via speculation . Blanca wistfully ( and vengefully ) takes a lover on her cantankerous employers ' antique furniture , displaying one of the few artistic nude scenes an actress desires as it was deemed necessary . Gomez has evidently invested in the role with dulling her natural beauty and doubling down with nudity , grit and vulnerability , deserving praise for rebelling against the easy route of being a Hollywood starlet . She displayed her distinguished beauty and subtle prowess as she will likely enjoy three-plus seasons of material.Most rewarding , Blanca takes vengeance on the ethnic profiling via frisk by making herself undesirable and filthy . She revels in her vile reputation , albeit she enjoys a refreshing shower and applies sardines and noxious scents along with her " Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeland 's occupants being viewed as the trash of the Latin culture , but Blanca revels in the disdain she brings the brutish guards.After a fiendish standoff , Blanca is forced to stand on the tables as punishment . She revels in her durability , urinating on the table to avoid losing ground in protest . And most poetic , she gives Piper her first redeeming scene at the season 's close , as Piper 's social justice trend lands her standing on the table as she attempts to feed protesting Blanca . Both crusade against issues , yet Blanca holds grit . Most fitting , Blanca 's smelly stance led to the series ' greatest tragedies . The writer better reward Laura Gomez with a contractual upgrade , or their proper crafting of an iconic figure was all in vein .... Time To Go ... OITNB 's fittingly bloated cast necessitates trimming like a refreshing makeover from Sophia 's boutique salon . Though she helped launch the show 's premise , Piper Chapman has withered into a grating nuisance . Still drama-prone from placing herself in harm 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for social justice leaves her the perennial dramatic punching bag . Even social activist Soso has learned her social cause antics had consequences , so why ca n't Piper grow up ? Piper lost her signature naivety when she led to penalties for Stella and Maria.A vicious branding appears to be an attempt to swing the sympathy pendulum ack toward our " heroine " , yet we do not care anymore . Alex keeps advising Piper to " Stay out of other people 's business , " yet her choices continually lead her to drama . Not even feeding a protesting Blanca made us care for Piper , so release her and let us explore the plethora of rich , damaged characters . Just like Piper , Lorna Morello ( Yael Stone ) lost her edge this season . The ultra perky , ultra friendly beauty had rooting qualities laced with femme fatale until Season 4 . Her disturbing backstory painted a tale of an obsessed and dangerous lover imprisoned as she was a threat to society through her unbridled love.Season 4 scraped the dangerous beauty of Lorna to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of Jessica Walters ' chilling and unhinged performance in Play Misty for Me . This twist downgraded her to an annoyingly jealous twit men shrug off or run away from out of cliche . We 've seen enough of Lorna 's Fatal Attraction , ruined like an insipid and dismissive twit . Much like Lorna 's diminished presence , Daya ( Dascha Polanco ) floated through the system like a carefree teenager . The new mother should have exhibited growth and maturity via childbirth as majority of women do , yet Daya could care less about formulating a plan of release from the prison walls.Losing her mother to release left Daya carousing with the drug-dealing Dominicans , foreshadowing more trouble coming her way . The question is whether we care if she pulls the trigger in Season 5 . Her invested purpose of her unplanned pregnancy has served its purpose , and viewers can do without another embattled trainwreck stealing the spotlight . In a flattering demand for removal , it is time for Aleida ( Elizabeth Rodriguez ) to stay out of prison . Earning an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played out after her child 's birth . OITNB beautifully depicted her struggles with returning to mainstreamed society as we learned why she landed in prison to protect the man she loved . Let 's hope she does not return to prison to protect her insipid daughter . Elizabeth Rodriguez is a lovely performer and enriched the show 's legacy , but her character has come full circle.So What 's Coming ? Little has been disclosed about plot developments or cast changes from Season 5 , and it should stay that way . Publicity stills and teasers have been released , yet viewers need not spoil on early plot details as needed with Season 4 . Much of the season was leaked as interest waned after an underwhelming previous season . Such leaks proved necessary to get fans to invest again . Now as we peer forward , we know we are primed for a Greek Tragedy with Season 5 . Tune in starting June 9 , as Netflix unveils its show pony 's epic 72-hour arc story .

Reality <p> Every year , networks commit to ordering a bunch of pilots , and from there decide which ones will make it to series . Sites like Deadline even do " Pilot Buzz " articles to say which pilots appear to be frontrunners for a series order . Through our results from the Pilot Pick-Up Tournament , it was interesting to see how there were pilots many thought would be ordered but were n't , as well as some that were under our radar . Let 's take a look : <p> ABC Comedy Nearly everyone saw multi-cam Household Name , starring Carol Burnett , as an automatic pick-up , as well as Libby &amp; Malcom from the creator of Blackish . Neither were picked up ( though Household Name has been put in redevelopment ) . Behind that ?

While bound to skew older , many speculated it would air Mondays at 10pm behind Dancing with the Stars . Instead , it was n't even ordered to series , and The Good Doctor got that time slot . Luckily , most of us at least expected that one to be ordered . Deception was another popular pick , and is slated for midseason , while Las Reinas and The Trustee were no-shows both in all of our predictions and on ABC 's schedule . <p> CBS Comedy Everybody saw 9J 9K 9L ( now ( 9JKL ) getting picked up .

But , at least in this episode , the ince cream business leads to the introduction of Mona . <p> I do n't understand why the writers insist on making Chris a punching bag , but it gets to the point where I 'm just feeling miserable for the character himself . For what it 's worth , he does get some great scenes , particularly when he decides to let Adams &amp; Hancock duel to Dan 's dismay . I just hope that everything works out for him in the finale , because this is seriously starting to get depressing . <p> " The Duel " is a solid outing of Making History , even if I do miss the episodes where Dan , Deb , and Chris were actually time-traveling . The introduction of Mona gives the characters a real struggle to deal with . Ultimately , Making History is a show that does n't seem to know where to go next . One episode it 's focusing on Al Capone , the next it 's about Deb 's ice cream shop . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride , I look forward to see how everything is resolved in the final episode of the season.Stray Thoughts <p> The introduction of Natalie Morales makes me miss The Grinder . I loved that show . <p> Dan &amp; Chris seem to talk about time-travel way too much in public . I 'd definetly be worried that someone would find me out if I were them . <p> Loved the joke about the 2nd Amendment <p> Unfortunately , Making History is taking a two-week break . So , by the next review , we 'll know if it 'll be a season or series finale . Not going to lie , things are n't looking good . <p> Grade : B+ <p> Thanks for reading my review of Making History .

@@81116509 @2616509/ <p> UPDATE : This article has been revised to reflect Superstore 's return to Thursday at 8pm instead of airing after The Voice . <p> Welcome to The Trends ! In this segment , I discuss some of the trends that we saw in the madness that was early-to-mid-May 2017 . This second segment focuses on giving returning comedies massive time slot upgrades.Many times , when networks see a lot of untapped potential in a show , they move it to a better time slot and hope the show improves . It worked yesteryear with Seinfeld , it worked a couple years ago with The Goldbergs , and next fall there are three comedies getting the same treatment , and the second seasons of American Housewife on ABC and Great News on NBC.Back when it was a pilot named The Second Fattest Housewife in Westport , American Housewife is the show that I thought was going to be scheduled behind Modern Family due to Blackish moving to Tuesday . I was wrong . In fact , The Middle moved to Tuesday to launch American Housewife while Blackish stayed put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday at 9pm , and to pretty much everyone 's surprise , American Housewife got the post-Modern Family time slot . This mostly shows that ABC was n't too into their family comedy pilots , given none of them even made the fall schedule . Since Blackish is now about to get to syndication , ABC seems to be protecting fellow ABC Studios comedy American Housewife now . With Modern Family renewed for a ninth and tenth season , American Housewife can really be nurtured if ABC wants to go that route . While it did well in its first season , getting great retention out of The Middle , is was n't a show that screamed 8 seasons and anchor material . ABC is attempting to change that by putting new life into the show ; in fact , it 's entirely possible that it ends up being Modern Family 's heir . That being said , we have to remember that they once moved Suburgatory behind Modern Family in its second season and it did n't improve , so maybe the same will happen here . Either way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it their next big hit.It 's an interesting trend overall ; in the 2014-15 season , we saw The Goldbergs , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , and Mom get massive time slot upgrades , all so-so rated freshmen shows which are now about to enter their fifth season as a result . There was nothing of that type in the two seasons to follow , and now we 're seeing it happen again . The difference is while many saw the potential The Goldbergs would have if aired between The Middle and Modern Family , the Internet was blindsided by American Housewife moving behind Modern Family , and Great News even getting renewed.It is also notable that the big time slot upgrades are going to comedies . Like we saw this season , moving a drama past its freshmen season to a better time slot may not always work out like one would hope ( see : Quantico ) . Comedies are much easier to grow if given better time slots and a big promotional push , and it 's quite possible that more than one of these shows will be alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedies have a lot of value to advertisers and can be long-term investments , even if they do n't live up to their full potential right out of the gate.What do you think ?

This is the midseason follow-up to the fall edition , in which I ranked all of the midseason shows for each of their first three episodes . I watched most of the midseason series , but skipped Star , Ransom , Training Day , and Taken . Any show whose pilot I watched at least 50% of will be included . <p> Unranked : Ransom , Training Day , Taken , Star#18- Time After Time <p> When this show was first announced , I was very excited for it . Then the promos came out , and I got less excited for it . They just did n't wow me . This pilot was , simple put , terrible . I almost fell asleep during it , that 's how bored I was . There was really nothing special about this pilot , nothing to pull me in . The fact that the premiere included two episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end.Pilot Grade : FPilot Score : 4/10Note : This score is for the first half of the two part premiere. #17- 24 : Legacy <p> I have never seen 24 , so I wo n't compare it to Legacy . Because of that , I was n't planning on tuning in . But since there was nothing else on that night ( other than the Super Bowl , of course ) , I tuned in . And I was disappointed . It bored me , and I did n't enjoy it much at all . While it 's not my least favorite midseason entry , it 's close . I ended up turning it off halfway into the episode , which was when my TiVo stopped recording it.Pilot Grade : D+Pilot Score : 5.5/10#16- Emerald City <p> This was just too weird . And boring .

Seriously.Pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powerless is the most disappointing midseason show for me , even if it was n't the worst . With the cast it has , it should have been better than this .

It was just pretty weak.Pilot Grade : B-Pilot Score : 7.5/10#12- Chicago Justice <p> This was enjoyable , but it was n't as interesting as the other parts of the Chicago crossover that helped to establish Justice . It was the weak link in the crossover , which is n't a promising development as I do n't even watch Fire and I stopped watching PD early into this season . Pilot Grade : B-Pilot Score : 7.5/10#11- Making History <p> Considering who this show comes from , and who stars in it , I expected a bit more from Making History . It was an enjoyable episode for sure , but it was n't all that funny . The ending set up something that could really be great , so I 'm definitely sticking with this one .

Jenna Elfman is great as always , but Rachel Dratch as the voice of Mary was my favorite part of this Pilot.Pilot Grade : B+Pilot Score : 8.5/10#7- The Mick <p> I 'm a huge fan of It 's Always Sunny , so saying that the Mick felt like IASIP is a huge compliment .

The cast was really good , the premise was interesting , and the show as a whole was fun . The best part was that I just decided to watch it the day it premiered . So it really shocked me when I loved it so much . The order of Redemption and its fellow top 6 shows could easily be reversed . I enjoyed them all about equally , but in the end , Redemption could n't top the others .

By that , I mean it 's not just entertaining for me to watch , but I actually think it 's a quality show . The cast is certainly very good , and the characters are entertaining to watch .

I 'm a huge fan of Andrea Martin and think she 's one of the funniest people alive . I think the same of Tina Fey .

Every other midseason entry for the network ranged from just okay to snoozefest. #4- ABC , 7.62 , Grade of B- <p> This was a solid midseason for ABC , with three fantastic shows and one big stinker . If it was n't for Time After Time , ABC would have been much stronger. #3- NBC , 7.83 , Grade of B <p> While NBC placed in the middle of the pack , three of their shows took spots in the top 6 , which is nothing to shake a stick at . However , I ca n't say their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all pretty meh . All in all , NBC was a mixed bag this midseason. #2- The CW , 8.0 , Grade of B <p> With just one new show , the CW comfortably takes second place . While Riverdale is n't perfect , it 's pretty freaking entertaining. #1- CBS , 8.75 , Grade of A- <p> The clear winners , with absolutely nobody near them , is somehow CBS . Despite taking a massive beating in Fall , taking 4th place in the fall edition of the First Three Weeks , this was a very successful midseason for the Tiffany Network .

@@81116513 @2616513/ <p> Welcome back to 1984 , the year sitcoms experienced their first of many rebirths . After the late 1970 's fantasy bubble , plus the saucy primetime soap deliveries of the early 1980 's , fans tired of the fast burn and crash . Much like cocaine swept the country like an endemic , Escapist and Soap fares became a tiring trend . Enter NBC , who never flourished during these trends . They had a few middling 60-minute showings and several soft sitcoms . Then , they tapped Bill Cosby to deliver a sitcom about everyday life for an upscale New York City black family . Fans flocked , and NBC 's fortunes changed . <p> Unlike the last two entries , which centered on 4 networks in the height of sitcom demand , 1984-85 was the first year of recovery as the previous crop of sitcoms aged , burned off or failed to capture landmark ratings . Only 25 entries straddled the season , with 14 returning the following year . This is less than half of the 1989-90 and 1992-93 seasons which tried out 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NBC poised 48% of that market with 12 entries . The Cosby Show , Family Ties , Cheers and Night Court graced the solid Thursday evenings , placing between 3rd and 19th Place among all shows , and 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 6th highest as sitcoms . CBS , who took 1st place the previous season , delivered successful Monday night laughs with Newhart and Kate and Allie , who placed 16th and 17th for the season , as well as 5th and 6th highest in this table . <p> ABC 's biggest laughs were generated from Dynasty , which binged on enough vice to 1st place . Sadly , that was not classified as a comedy , and it burned off like a wild night out . ABC 's highest-rated sitcom for the season was Webster , as it placed 23rd for the season . Its minor success story is this season laid the bedrock for two sitcoms , as well as a stronghold on the Friday sitcom market which would continue well through the 90 's . Who 's the Boss started soft and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically-acclaimed sitcoms to join them in upcoming seasons . It fared better than mid-season entry Off The Rack , which is only remembered as it featured Michael J. Fox 's Back to the Future Girlfriend , Claudia Wells . <p> ABC struggled mid-decade to reinvent itself after reigning in the last eras . As Three 's Company aged , ABC attempted a rebirth centered on John Ritter , which crashed and burned . Too many late nights of 70 's jokes were irrelevant during the mid-80 's . Like ABC , CBS had to part with it 's 70 's kitsch and parted with Alice , the Jeffersons and spinoff After-MASH like bell bottoms and old social topics . They also dispensed Happy Days sensation Scott Baio , an odd choice as his sitcom flourished in original syndication . CBS seemed to be out of era in past and future , as they axed George Clooney 's E/R . No , not the powerhouse who ruled the 90 's and 2000 's on NBC . But rather a sitcom which inappropriately cast a 23-year old as a doctor . Viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Doogie Howser that is . Perhaps E/R may have succeeded had Clooney been typecast as a 16-year old Doctor . Though CBS narrowly took 2nd place from ABC , this season left CBS in deficit for sitcoms . <p> While NBC ruled Thursdays , they also sported several soft sitcoms . Silver Spoons and Punky Brewster teetered on rating in the Abyss , yet they stabilized a soft timeslot on Sundays and provided family-friendly laughs . Gim me a Break ! never excelled like 1982 entries Cheers and Family Ties . Like Cheers ' death of Nicolas Colasanto , Gim me a Break ! was affected by the death of Dolph Sweet in early 1985 . Break stood in threat of cancellation , yet NBC treated its sitcoms loyal as they bolstered the network in leaner years . That same fortune did not greet Diff'Rent Strokes , which was cancelled after 7 seasons . However , their spinoff , Facts of Life , managed to settle the soft Saturdays . <p> NBC and ABC laid groundwork for future enterprises , the greatest victory of the season . Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited around and gave ABC a purpose for sitcoms on Fridays . NBC staked Thursdays to strong perfection for the next 20 years , and Gim me a Break ! provided a need for laughs on Saturdays . Mondays on CBS belonged to NBC , who two seasons later would have 4 sitcoms at all times on this evening for 28 years . Most fittingly , NBC reclaimed 1st place , which it would retain for 14 of the 16 seasons .

I knew that I wanted Young Sheldon to get the Big Bang lead-in , but after that things get messy . I have no idea what the 9 PM hour should be . I 'm guessing that Life in Pieces will move to Mondays to air with fellow single-cam Young Sheldon , so I 'll slot LIP post-Sheldon . I do n't know what to do after that , but I 'm just guessing that Superior Donuts will go there . Scorpion will likely return to 10 . <p> Monday ( late fall ) : 8:00- Kevin Can Wait 8:30- Man With a Plan 9:00-Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot easier to make than the early fall version . Kevin and Man With a Plan are doing fine and should return to the 8PM hour . After getting a boost from The Big Bang Theory for awhile , Young Sheldon should get to lead a single-cam hour with Life in Pieces that I discussed earlier . <p> Tuesday : 8:00- NCIS 9:00- SEAL Team 10:00- NCIS : New Orleans Bull has done well this season , but not amazing . I think it should be moved to give another show the NCIS lead-in . I think the most compatible and the series most likely to get the slot is SEAL Team . NCIS : NOLA should stay at 10 . <p> Wednesday : 8:00- Survivor 9:00- Criminal Minds 10:00- SWAT While I personally would prefer for Criminal Minds to move to 10 , I think CBS will leave it there to lead into a new series . That new series should absolutely be SWAT . It stars former Criminal Minds star Shemar Moore , so the Criminal Minds audience will likely embrace the series .

It should lead into a new series , which I believe will be 9JKL . I think 9JKL has enormous potential and can do very well . Mom should remain at 9 , because it 's doing very well there . Superior Donuts is in dire need of help , and as an owned series , CBS should do whatever it takes to try and save it . The 10 slot is a huge disaster . Nothing does very well there , and even the Amazing Race has struggled a bit . Instead of banishing a new show to the slot , they should move a veteran ( or at least a sophomore ) to that slot . As I 've already put new shows in their slots , Code Black and Bull are the only shows that fit this .

It only got renewed because of how much money CBS makes because of it , and the ratings do n't really matter . So why not move it to Saturday ? It can make CBS money in a low-priority slot . <p> Sunday : 7:00- 60 Minutes 8:00- NCIS : Los Angeles 9:00- Bull 10:00- Madam Secretary NCIS : Los Angeles made the move to Sundays seamlessly , and it 's even year to year .

@@81116516 @2616516/ <p> The two biggest lead-ins on the network are The Flash and Supergirl . In order for the CW to utilize these lead-ins , Legends of Tomorrow and Jane the Virgin will have to move . Open timeslots will be Wednesdays at 9:00 and Fridays at 8:00 . Most likely , instead of causing a lot of moves , the shows move into those timeslots , where they each pair with one of the most compatible shows to them on the network . I think it 's possible that Legends of Tomorrow goes to Thursday , and Riverdale goes to Wednesday to avoid This Is Us , but I think that the CW will assume that since This Is Us skews older than Riverdale , it wo n't be affected much . <p> The CW has four new shows this season .

I think those will be Tuesdays at 9:00 and Wednesdays at 9:00 ( either with Legends of Tomorrow moving again , or Black Lightening waiting ) , with Valor going Tuesdays because it needs the lead-in more , and it is CBS-produced . If a new fall show is successful , something has to go to summer , and I think that something is iZombie . If both new shows in the fall fail , The 100 goes to Wednesdays again . The Originals is likely Fridays at 8:00 bound . <p> What do you think of my predictions ? Leave your thoughts in the comments !

@@81116518 @2616518/ <p> A writer 's strike has been diverted ! Per Deadline , ATPMP and the WGA have defined a bridged deal to cover healthcare issues and pay to accommodate limited seasons . This is a welcome relief as we take a retrospective look back on the last four : <p> 1960 : <p> The second-longest strike occurred inside this calendar year from January 16-June 10 , only outlived by the writer 's strike of 1988 . This strike rooted from the writer 's right to receive a share of revenue of the studios from the lease or sale of movies to television . No known effects occurred to television programming as the target was the motion picture studios . The eight studios active that year -- Universal , Warner Bros. , Allied Artists , Columbia , Paramount , 20th Century Fox and Walt Disney pictures -- hammered out an agreement to compensate writers for movies broadcast on television . Their agreement arbitrated the following:1 . The studios pay out the writers ' pensions and health funds $600K.2 . Motion pictures released pre-1960 which aired on non-paid television would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caveat they were not being shown on pay television.3 . Motion pictures released post-1960 which aired on non-paid television would pay 2% of the studio 's profits to writers under the caveat they were not being shown on pay television.4 . Minimum wages for studio writers increased $350 a week , plus 10% bonuses for the following 24 months , furthered by 5% bonuses for the following 18 months.5 . Television writers would receive a 100% minimum wage increase for the first 24 months , followed by another 100% increase for the following 24 months.6 . Writers for low budget TV shows received raises from $835 to $950 per week.7 . High budget TV shows increased writers ' wages from $1,100 to $1,200 per week.8 . All TV writers received a 4% royalty domestically and internationally on syndication in perpetuity.9 . A health and welfare fund was established for all TV writers.Damage to Television Viewing : None Known .

Residual for hour-long shows ( producers , claiming syndicated reruns of these shows were performing poorly in syndication , wanted a softened , percentage-based formula ; writers wanted a residual hike ) 2 . Expanded creative rights ( the writers wanted consultation on the choice of actors and directors for some projects ) 3 . Cost cuts in other areas ( a producers ' demand ) Several television shows straddled through Daytime , Primetime and Late Night broadcasting were affected gravely . The hastened 1989 cancellations of CBS ' Kate and Allie , as well as ABC 's Moonlighting were attributed to the long hiatus the strike caused in 1989 . NBC 's Cheers lost an episode and finished the following season with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and LA Law two episodes at 24 and 20 respectively , and ABC lost three episodes of acclaimed Thirtysomething , finishing at 21 for the season . Many primetime scripted shows were delayed as long as November vs. their September premiere dates.Most grievous was the continual damage inflicted on Daytime Soap Operas as the showrunners ceased work . In their place , networks replaced them with non-union ( scab ) writers . Quality and stories tanked , leading to the ultimate decline in one of America 's sturdiest institutions . In 1988 , 12 soap operas covered the airwaves on ABC , NBC and CBS . That number dwindled to a current 4 over the three networks decades later.Damage to Television Viewing : Considerable .

Now that most things are known , I will predict what ABC 's schedule will look like tomorrow.Sunday7:00 America 's Funniest Home Videos8:00 The Gospel of Kevin ( new ) 9:00 10 Days in the Valley ( new ) 10:00 Quantico ( new day ) <p> With American Idol coming to ABC in the spring , likely to go to Sundays , Sunday night needs some placeholders for fall . Since Once Upon a Time is 22 episodes , I expect it to move to Fridays , where the 8:00 hour has recently been opened up . Quantico has a short order for season three , so I expect it to return to its original timeslot for the fall . 10 Days in the Valley is a mini-series , so it makes sense for ABC to air it on Sundays this fall as well . There is one more timeslot open on Sundays , and I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeslot , as they are the most likely new series to be limited , since they are high-concept . I am placing The Gospel of Kevin in that timeslot because of its comedic nature , making it more compatible with America 's Funniest Home Videos , and because I think it will have a more similar audience to Once Upon a Time , who used to be in that timeslot , than The Crossing would . I chose to put The Gospel of Kevin at 8:00 and 10 Days at 9:00 due to those reasons , and because 10 Days will likely have less overlap with The Walking Dead than Kevin would . <p> When it comes to the comedy hours , I expect 5 of ABC 's 7 returning comedies to stay in place . I think that Fresh Off the Boat will have to wait until 2018 to begin its fourth season , and Black-ish will make the move to Tuesday . Modern Family and Black-ish would then be lead-ins to the new comedies in the fall . I expect the Zach Braff project ( formerly Start Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are the most compatible with those two shows , with Start Up going Wednesday and The Mayor going Tuesday for maximum compatibility . I also expect these two to be chosen for fall over Splitting Up Together because I believe that ABC ended up with Splitting Up Together because they wanted Deception ( like how they got Fresh Off the Boat because they wanted Cristela and another season of Last Man Standing ) . Designated Survivor stays put on Wednesdays , as does Agents of SHIELD on Tuesdays , but waiting until November to premiere , with fellow Marvel series The Inhumans airing in the fall . I think Deception will air Mondays at 10:00 because it is the most Castle-like of ABC 's new shows , and I believe they really wanted it , though I would be unsurprised if The Good Doctor got this timeslot instead . Thursdays remain familiar with the three biggest series of TGIT . <p> At mid-season , the Sunday night line-up would most likely turn into American Idol at 8:00 and new drama The Good Doctor at 10:00 . On Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:00 , avoiding competition from This Is Us on NBC . The one mid-season drama that remains then is The Crossing . Unless Deception fails , there wo n't be room for it , so I see it airing in the summer , assuming Deception is successful . I do think that it will get a lot of promotional attention for its summer run , because I believe that ABC cares about the series , I just do n't think that they have the room for it in-season . On the comedy side , Fresh Off the Boat will be a priority to get back onto the schedule . If one of the two new fall comedies fails , I expect Boat to take its place . If neither does , Fresh Off the Boat will probably fill in the mid-season gap for Once Upon a Time . While this is a very low-priority timeslot , January sometimes does see some higher than usual viewing levels there , like when Last Man Standing hit a 1.5 this season .

Before delving into the rewards and punishment of this weeks entry , let 's discuss the situation at hand with May Sweeps .

However , so did blackish , and both rest in the throws of 7th Place in their ongoing jockeying . American Housewife also donned that trendy 1.2 number , while The Great Indoors experienced a devastating blow with its first fractional delivery of 0.8 . The tie for 9th Place has been determined as 9th Place belongs to American Housewife , and The Great Indoors will take 10th . Mom proved to be the greatest MVP this week , scoring the largest boost thanks to albatross TGI moving to Mondays and a TBBT rerun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle of the Pack , Family Guy also picked up the 1.2 trend , preserving most of its season average .

CBS made a broom sweep renewal of 6 sitcoms , and NBC locked in their Thursday anchors , FOX renewed 3 sitcoms , and ABC chose the Middle for an early renewal . 12 Sitcoms rest in Purgatorys clutches , ranging between 20%-70% chances of renewal .

Divides have been drawn , as these shows rest Between Heaven and Hell during this crucial week and are fighting each other for survival . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided up into four arenas and led away by their networks . The first to be called before the ABC jury was by highest rating . Sadly , that was The Real ONeals . They pleaded they had critical acclaim on their side and some interesting characters .

They pointed out the evident fact that IM was right in line with its predecessor it stands next to , and updated the family sitcom premise . And finally , biting his nails , Dr. Ken is dragged forward and tell the jury why it deserves a third season . Dr. Ken points out his show has lasted the longest behind Last Man Standing , with a slew of predecessors such as Malibu Country , the Neighbors and Cristela burning off within one season . <p> The three ABC shows are to take a seat , as the network judge issues the following statement : <p> " You three are dispensable at best to ABC .

Chances of renewal are 20% , as the only way ABC will air this show again is if they need room for other sitcoms or want to air you in the Summer . " <p> " The same can be said for Imaginary Mary . While this is a cute sitcom , the animated portion is costly , and your performance matched the ONeals . This argument may either save or seal your fate , as you could be the next desired filler show . Unfortunately , the odds reduced with that 0.7 rating this week , downgrading to 20% .

High Nielsens are not the only renewal factor here , as you would have all been shoved down the escalator t hell the first time you delivered a fractional demo . But rather , it is about compatibility and portability . The weak shows will just have to move around or take the slots no one wants .

Therefore , I think a move to Hulu and/or TBS is very much possible . If it does happen , that 's still a correct prediction . Ditto with The Last Man On Earth , which I could see going to the niche FXX network , given that it 's a serialized show whose ratings probably are n't about to rise any time soon . In fact , if Son of Zorn did n't collapse without football I 'm not sure we 'd even be talking about chances for Last Man On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 24 : Legacy for PR purposes , though it may not be next season . The same goes with Prison Break , whose revival I consider to be more successful . With the cancelation of Rosewood , I think FOX could be getting rid of Sleepy Hollow 's low ratings too , though I would n't be surprised with an Exorcist renewal . I think there 's a chance one of the two gets renewed , and I 'm slightly ignoring the fact that Sleepy Hollow 's relative rating is one point ahead of the predicted target . Should I be ignoring it ? Time will tell , usually the correlation beats me but I just ca n't see Sleepy Hollow returning , and the margin between the target and actual is so small too . <p> UPDATE FOX has cleaned up Fridays with Rosewood and Sleepy Hollow now officially canceled . It 's tough to tell if this means similarly-rated The Exorcist is a goner too , or if this means there 's more schedule space for it . Stay tuned , but for now it 's still in the renewal predicted category .

@@81116531 @2616531/ <h> NCIS : Los Angeles S08E23 Review <p> An episode written by Frank Military is characterised by dark , in-depth character stories that are worth numerous rewatches . In S2 Little Angels , a girl was buried alive , causing Sam to relive the time he was buried alive during a SEAL mission . In S3 The Job , he blew up Kensi and introduced Callen 's nemesis Janvier in Crimeleon . He tortured both Sam and Deeks in the Sidorov / nuclear arms deal arc and in S5 , had Deeks visit his dark side when he waterboarded an Afghan cleric to find Kensi . In S6 he sent Callen undercover with white supremacists and touched on Callen 's self destructive youth , and in S7 almost had Kensi sexually assaulted and blew up a child suicide bomber . Frank Military penned episodes take the audience to places where they feel uncomfortable ; the lighthearted core of the show is called in to question and so his reality hits hard ; life as an agent is not all sunshine and laughter . It is not only the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy recurring character for a while ; they do not do so wantonly . Dom , Renko and Hunter have all been lost to the greater good of the narrative and the decision to kill Michelle Hanna , Sams wife and coping mechanism , would not have been taken lightly . It would be very foolish of the show to kill one of the main cast when they have such chemistry and so they have turned to the periphery cast . There are only a few such characters that would have any impact ; Arkady ( already done , sort of ) , Anna ( which would really only affect Callen ) , and Michelle . <p> Sam has been prominent all season yet has only had the odd episode taking centre stage . He has continued to be Callens anchor in the face of his huge family revelations ( although whether his errant partner always listens .. ? ) . He supported Deeks during Kensis turbulent recovery , imparted words of wisdom to Eric and given Anna Kolchek advice on her father and Callen . He is the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secure upbringing and a loving family of his own . He is a constantly stable presence for the team and has been since the very first episode . And that is what makes Uncaged even more heartbreaking . It rips the heart and soul out of not only Sam , but the entire team . <p> The episode is set up with a demonstration of how in love Sam and Michelle are . They exercise together , joke with each other and talk about their future . A normal family portrait is painted with the two of them and daughter Kamran in the kitchen , the first day mother and daughter have returned home from the safe house ( after the moles threats ) . At one point Michelle tells Callen to take care of Sam , to which he replies he always does ; a line which is repeated later in a very different context . The focus on the normality of family life and their relationship makes the coming events even more brutal . <p> Rather than a random kidnapping and death , Military has cleverly pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully tying them together . Michelle is called to a federal prison as Zirov ( cohort of S4 Russian arms dealer Sidorov ) has information to pass on , that he will divulge to her alone . Tahir Kaled returns , having been transferred to the same prison as Zirov . In an effort to prove he had nothing to do with targeting the NCIS LA team in the mole debacle , FBI Agent Sabatino makes an appearance to help Sam find his wife , . Crucially though , all of this happens on the very day Michelle finally leaves the safe house . Is there another mole ? Is Sabatino still playing the team ? Is Joelle aka Beth connected to these events ? And how is Kaled obtaining his classified intel ? <p> Michelle is taken early in the episode and is on screen throughout via a video feed . Kaleds crew has permitted Michelle to communicate with Sam and the team ; he has allowed them to watch her suffocate to death . It also means Michelle unwittingly feeds false information about how long the van drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts . But more importantly the open communication channels allow her and Sam to have those goodbye conversations no couple ever wishes to have . <p> During these conversations the rest of the team are desperately for any lead possible . The tension is built at a frantic rate as Kensi and Deeks search for nearby cameras . Hetty negotiates Kaleds release in exchange for Michelle , with Sec Navs caveat that he s kept under surveillance , which Callen runs . Hetty and Nell later risk their jobs , advising support agents that Sec Nav authorised them to let Kaled go , when he s lost to an unforeseen ploy . The team have no leads and realise at the eleventh hour the van never left Sams neighbourhood . The intensity of Kensi and Deeks return search of a former pharmaceutical storage building is gut-wrenching . They were so sure they were in the right place , and as they leave the camera transitions through a false wall to a large room with a single refrigeration unit at its centre . <p> The real tear jerker comes when Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . Kensi and Deeks are embroiled in a gun fight and only by chance find the storage fridge . The camera cuts to Sam and Callen driving to their location . The desperation with Kensi and Deeks rush towards Michelle is countered by a lack of urgency to Sams driving ; he knows . When they arrive at the scene , surrounded by ambulances , Sam does not frantically run to find his wife . He walks past the paramedics and everyone parts to allow him through . Very few words are spoken and the rawness of emotion is felt from the extras through to Sams fellow agents and the use of the soundtrack . <p> The hype surrounding this episode meant there was a high level of fan realisation that Michelle would die . Yet the manner of her death , the surrounding storyline and the acting , particularly from LL Cool J could not have been predicted . It really was a tear jerker , and not just the odd tear trickling down the cheek . This was full on .

But what after that ? Showrunner Scott Gemmill has said season nine will be something of a reset , so how will this change Sam in the future ? By taking away a core element of Sams being , he will become destabilised and have to work his way through to find a new equilibrium . During that journey he might become more reckless which would mean a change in the dynamics of his partnership with Callen . He may also stop feeling , bury his emotions and remain numb in an altogether different way to how Callen builds his internal defences . Kensi and Deeks could question their shared profession and future . More likely it will make them realise they need to live for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not wait for the perfect sunset over a southern Californian beach . <p> The best episodes are those which affect the characters personally and Frank Military has demonstrated time and time again this is the case . The episodes he writes and directs tend to be the darkest , affecting both characters and the audience , and pulling the best performances out of the actors . This is by far the best performance from LL Cool J , and by far the best episode of the show to date . <p> What did you think of this episode ? Did you feel the tension and share this horrendously emotional journey with Sam ? Do you think Frank Military should write more than two episodes a season ( maybe turning his hand to black comedy , to lighten up the darkness ) ?

Below is a chart of the fates of all FOX scripted shows : <p> In total , FOX renewed 13 shows ( counting the already-renewed Bob 's Burgers ) , canceled 9 ( counting the final-season-announced Bones ) , and has left both 24 : Legacy and Prison Break unannounced . This could be an X-Files-like scenario where the shows come back , but not immediately . <p> This year , FOX Renew/Cancel had a perfect record with no incorrect predictions , save for the two shows that have yet to be decided . The predictions more or less followed a simple formula : compare the show 's ad rate relative to the rest of the network to the show 's Live + Same Day A18-49 ratings relative to the rest of the network .

It was n't exactly great at freshmen or sophomore shows . As Polyester Poontang pointed out , ad rates have more to do with expectations for the show , but regardless , this has been something that happened to have a good track record . When using it , I focus specifically on shows that are " bubble " veteran shows . So how did it do this season ? <p> Well , it told me that all three of The Last Man On Earth , New Girl , and Brooklyn Nine-Nine would be renewed . That 's not something all sites predicted . If there was any doubt about Gotham , a show that got held back longer than many other veteran drama renewals , the correlation also nailed that one . It also said that Rosewood was getting renewed , and between that , The Mysteries of Laura , and Undateable , I 've deemed it useless for sophomore shows . The only real miss for it was Sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one point . Thankfully , I ignored it when making my own predictions , as it was still a show that was under 50% of FOX 's average ratings . <p> Perhaps I 'll also take a look into what it said for the other networks to see what happened there . Without it , I 'm not 100% sure I would have predicted renewal for all three of that comedy trifecta.

@@81116536 @2616536/ <h> Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 4 Episode 19/20 Review <p> Brooklyn Nine-Nine is no stranger to having episodes centered on family members . Earlier in the season , we were introduced to Santiago 's father and Peralta 's mother and Holt 's sister made appearances back in the previous season . But , Holt 's mother has got to be the family member I 'd most like to see , so I 'm glad that " Your Honor " brings her into the mix . <p> First off , I 'm glad how seriously Brooklyn Nine-Nine deals with continuity . The series first alluded that Holt 's mother was a judge in Season 1 's " Thanksgiving " . It 's been three years and that detail has not been forgotten , it just goes to show how consistent this series is . <p> Similar to the episode following it , " Your Honor " has a very strong main plot alongside two weaker throwaway stories . In the A-plot , Laverne 's ( Holt 's mother ) house is broken into and we learn that she is having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never told Holt . It 's almost reminiscent of Jake 's mom getting back with his father without telling him , but it 's a lot more amusing to see a normally emotionless Holt having to deal with a situation like this . It also opens up opportunities to learn more about child Holt . Even though we know that Holt was an intelligent child , it just never gets old to hear about how he did n't need a ruler to do trigonometry functions or how he made a macaroni infographic about educational spending during the Johnson administration . One of the biggest strengths of this plot is how Laverne is just like Holt , which makes Jake seem like the weird one . It opens up a whole new avenue comedy-wise . Also , Peralta 's attempts to help patch up the relationship between Holt and his mom is touching and funny at the same time . It 's touching because Jake does n't want Holt to have a poor relationship with a parent , a subject he 's all too familiar with , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laverne is funny , but at the same time , it also balances it out with some drama as the two talk about how detached their relationship has been . Everything in this main story works well and it has a sweet ending without being too sappy amongst many great one-liners . <p> The other plots are definitely lacking in comparison . The B-plot features Terry , Rosa &amp; Boyle renovating the break room to Hitchcock and Scully 's dismay . There is an interesting twist here since Hitchcock and Scully 's opinion actually represents what everyone else in the precinct is thinking . There 's also a great montage at the end as the two ruin the break room 's new couch , but other than that , it 's not a very memorable outing , though not an unfunny one at that . <p> The C-plot is a lot less entertaining . Gina does n't want to change a tire , but Amy wants to teach her . It 's as simple as that . Gina 's behavior ends up being more annoying than funny since she acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negatively affected as a result . The writers do n't seem to know what to do with Gina this season as she 's usually neglected to tedious C-plots and is almost always given the role of treating the character she 's interacting with poorly before ultimately saving the day . I hope Linetti 's character can stay away from this in the next season . <p> " Your Honor " is a solid outing of Brooklyn Nine-Nine . The A-plot features some great chemistry between Holt , his mom , and Peralta , it easily makes up for the middling B and C-plots . <p> Grade : A- <p> The Slaughterhouse <p> FOX <p> Brooklyn Nine-Nine works best in high-stakes settings . This is why the Figgis arc at the end of season 3 was so exciting , and in my opinion , one of the best things that this series has ever done .

It 's a lot of fun seeing Jake &amp; Rosa try to sabotage each other , my favorite part has got to be the running gag where Rosa spikes whatever Jake is drinking with caffeine . It works a lot better than Gina 's " cement " gag from " The Last Ride " solely because of Rosa 's deadpan nature while admitting what she did . One thing I have to criticize about this otherwise fun plot is the whole " meeting your hero " shtick . This has been used countless times in the B99 universe and two other times this season . At least in this episode , it 's not the main focus of the plot . Just like the other " meeting your hero " plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the wrong side of the law . I 'm glad we 'll be getting a signature high-stakes Brooklyn finale and this reveal cements that fact . <p> In the B-plot , we have Hitchcock &amp; Scully fighting with each other as Terry and Boyle hopelessly try to stop them . The two cops fire off enough hilarious insults at each other to make this plot amusing , but yet again , Gina " saves the day " without even being involved in the ordeal , a shtick that 's really starting to get old . Still , that does n't hinder the fact that this plot is comedy gold . <p> The C-plot is fairly amusing . I liked seeing Amy stop being a pushover for one episode and tell off Holt . This back-half of the season has really started to return to the great Holt &amp; Amy dynamic that has n't really been explored in a while and I 'm glad that the writers are focusing on them again . <p> Overall , " The Slaughterhouse " is a great episode that sets up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Stray Thoughts <p> I love how Scully 's girlfriend ( Cindy ) actually gets a mention .

This was seen as the final nail in the show 's coffin , and it 's been seen as dead ever since , making this announcement merely a formality . This was a correct prediction for the TV Ratings Guide .

@@81116542 @2616542/ <h> Hunter 's NBC Schedule PREDICTION <p> NBC will be releasing their fall schedule tomorrow ( Sunday ) around 9:00 or 9:30 in the morning Pacific Time , 12:00 or 12:30 Eastern Time . Now that most things are known ( though the fates of Chicago Justice , Trial &amp; Error , and pilot The Sackett Sisters remain unknown as of my writing of this ) , I will predict what NBC 's schedule will look like tomorrow . <p> The network 's two strongest nights ( aside from night 's with sports ) are Monday and Tuesday with The Voice and now This Is Us . This is why NBC is likely to debut two new dramas on those nights , just like they did last year , and dramas The Brave and Rise were the network 's first two pick-ups this spring , so I expect that they will make the fall schedule , with Rise going Tuesday because it is more compatible with This Is Us than The Brave would be . I think that NBC will keep This Is Us at 9:00 because they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comedy air at 10:00 in its first week . Rise boots Chicago Fire off of Tuesday , and I think it will land on Wednesday , forming an all Dick Wolf show night . I do not think that Law &amp; Order SVU and Chicago PD will swap timeslots , despite an increased flow as a result , because that would mean two more moves to promote . <p> While still not in great shape , NBC 's comedy slate has more projects this season than last , so I expect a two-hour block on Thursday . Superstore and The Good Place can keep their timeslots from this season , while Will &amp; Grace airs at 9:00 . NBC has no multi-camera options to pair with Will &amp; Grace , though I 'm not sure how much they care considering how the network has mixed camera set-ups in the past . Great News has been rumored to have been renewed to be paired with Will &amp; Grace , possibly because it has a more multi-camera feel to it than other comedies on the network . I also think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be retooled as a multi-cam . NBC attempted to retool Up All Night as a multi-cam back in the 2012-13 season when its ratings continued to decline , though this never went through as star Christina Applegate left the series . This would also make Great News cheaper in the long run , as multi-camera sets are a lot less expensive than single-camera sets . The two-hour comedy block would send Chicago Med to 10:00 , and The Blacklist to Friday , along with Blindspot , which will be pushed off of Wednesdays by Chicago Fire . The Blacklist is the highest profile on the night , so it gets the 9:00 spot . I put Dateline before it and Blindspot after it so it can serve as a lead-in to Blindspot , and Dateline avoids competition with 20/20 . <p> For mid-season , NBC has two new comedies , AP Bio and Champions . I imagine that these will be the focus of the Winter Olympics promotion . Limited series Law &amp; Order True Crime is also coming up , and I think that its eight episodes will air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this same time , The Wall will probably return to Tuesdays at 8:00 . New drama Good Girls will probably end up on Tuesday nights after This Is Us wraps up its season . Little Big Shots and Shades of Blue will likely return to their Sunday night timeslots , and Chicago Justice as well assuming it returns , maybe beginning its season on Mondays after Law &amp; Order : True Crime . New drama Reverie can replace a new drama from the fall that fails , or air Sundays at 9:00 if Chicago Justice does n't return . Otherwise , I expect a high-priority summer timeslot . I also expect Timeless and Taken to return in the summer . <p> What do you think of my predictions ? Leave your thoughts in the comments !

@@81116544 @2616544/ <h> NCIS : Los Angeles S08E21 Review <p> The team are called to investigate after a homeless man , later revealed as Retired Navy Captain Charles Langston kidnaps a corrupt VA administrator . When Hetty contacts her former colleagues Retired Admiral AJ Chegwidden and Admiral Sterling Bridges to request their assistance , it gradually becomes clear to the team that there is more to this case than meets the eye . <p> Battle Scars is very much the subject of this episode , jointly written by Jordana Lewis Jaffa and Andrew Bartels . The scars are results of various characters experiences and adventures in the field , extremely very recent and others dating back decades . The damage is psychological and physical and varies from character to character . The after effects of the teams operations have been explored throughout season 8 , starting of course with Kensi . She has struggled with her temporary paralysis and whether she would ever be able to return to the field . Even when she did visit the mission before being cleared to return , her paranoia and internal fears were realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the flip side , Deeks struggled with his emotions as he witnessed Kensi in her coma and then offered his unerring support as she fought to return to fitness and was subject to bouts of self doubt and depression . When you are the person experiencing the trauma and trying to recover , it is easy to forget that your support network and loved ones are also going through a tremendously difficult time . Kensi broaches this subject with Deeks and unfortunately before this can be explored , they hear and then rescue Bryant . Deeks temperament is very subdued during this episode , which seems to commence when he and Kensi return to the VA hospital as part of the case . He continues to feel off throughout the episode . He is distracted but whether this is attributed to the VA hospital , uncertainly over the internal affairs confession ( not mentioned in Battle Scars ) or just because the actor was i 'll whilst filming maybe more will be revealed in next weeks episode . NCISLA has attempted to demonstrate the effects of PTSD in S4 finale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sidorov , but the consistent references during this season show the longer term effects , which is clearly much more realistic . <p> Shorter term effects have been shown with the return of Nate and his off screen sessions with Nell and Eric ; both have struggled after killing for the first time . Eric in particular , and he confides in Sam in the opening scenes at the shooting range . Even Callen has suffered through his betrayal by Joelle . Instead of zipping up his emotions as usual , he has chain-sawed and thrown out what little furniture he has , and blown hot and cold in his relationship with Anna . A case of regressing with his trust issues ! <p> The team may be dealing with psychological issues , but it is the older generation who are suffering the physical effects of their past missions . Grangers time in Vietnam and exposure to Agent Orange is again referenced in respect of Hettys former colleagues , all of whom expect to succumb in the same way . Langston has already been diagnosed and Chegwidden realistically tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . As well as being realistic , it also provides a legitimate way to write Hetty out at a ( much ) later date , should the need arise . <p> Granger is respectfully mentioned several times outside of Hettys pessimistic outlook . He was the only senior man in Kensis life , and the connection to her late father had made her want to ask him to give her away at her wedding . Sam and Callen reminisce about their first encounter with Granger and how Callen put him down and pulled a gun on him . Cunning , sly , dry sense of humour ; the tributes to Granger lead to comparisons with Chegwidden and Bridges , who show they have just as much guile , spotting Sams Challenger when the younger pair are waiting to see where they lead the agents . ( And the Challenger is an easy car to spotBridges does say that he has eyes , when Sam questions how they were made . ) <p> There are throw away ( political ) statements about the treatment of the homeless as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Langston , who posed as a homeless Vet to kidnap VA bureaucrat Bryant . Bryant himself is the epitome of this . He thought homeless people made up their signings reading homeless vet , single mum and incurable blood disease . He has complete disdain for not only the homeless but also the vets requiring medical attention , as he is skimming money meant for their treatment . There are long queues at the VA centre and disgruntled patients are unable to obtain medical appointments for months , despite their needs and having served their country . This aspect is not really mentioned again . The narrative progresses with more focus on Langston himself and the hidden antics of Hetty and her former cohorts . <p> The older generation of Chegwidden , Bridges and Langston are well created and the former in particular have great chemistry and patter . It was fascinating to see them take on Sam and Callen , referring to them as Hettys lap dogs , in response to Sam calling them Abbott and Costello. Each pair took turns at one upping the other and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , including the incredibly annoying FBI Agent Morris . In fact Chegwidden and Bridges provide a glimpse as to how Sam and Callen may well be in another fifteen to twenty years , still running around causing mayhem and chaos . Unfortunately there was some clumsy storytelling ; Kensi and Deeks drove past where they found VA administrator Bryant hanging but failed to spot him from the road . Several times various characters repeated that Bryant was a corrupt official , just in case it wasnt understood the first time . And if Hetty and co had to find all the money for equipment , fuel , bribes then where did they find $1 million worth of gold bars ( now worth $40 million ) ? And Sam and Callen blame the FBI collectively , for shooting Undersecretary of Defence , Duggan , yet during the mole trilogy , the blame was firmly placed on the CIA . <p> Battle Scars is the first of a two-parter and as a result , the narrative does not race along at one hundred miles an hour . The plot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of Hettys former colleagues and the slow unravelling of their real story . The exchanges between Chegwidden and Bridges with Sam and Callen provided a light hearted tone to the episode which overall had a slightly sombre feel , particularly with Deeks not dishing out the usual wise cracks , the joke about Kensi finding fresh prints , and Deeks immediately asking Bel Air , excepted . Callen is reminded of Joelles lame attempt on Hettys life and has clearly been talked about behind his back . Sam and Bridges are constantly sniping and part two will hopefully continue the gentle antagonism between them . There was a risk that an episode focusing on characters from Hetty and Grangers past would detract from the screen time of the main agents however the risk was unfounded . This was a team episode , the team has temporarily become a little bigger and even with a slightly subdued Deeks , it was again reassuring to see Sam and Callen on form as partners , and Kensi and Deeks sharing some emotional moments .

But what does a cheerleader do for the rest of the year when Football goes to sleep , especially when football-inflated Nielsens leave spring stretchmarks and crow 's feet ? Zorn realizes their value diminished as they are no longer the young show , and will need to get to know the phrase FILLER to plump up those sagging ratings .

@@81116558 @2616558/ <h> A Look into FOX 's Pilot Season <p> It 's almost mid-April , and upfronts are quickly approaching . This means that now is as good of a time as ever to talk about the upcoming pilot season . <p> You may have noticed that FOX only has five new dramas eligible for the fall season . One is Seth MacFalane 's Orville , a dramedy that received a series order well before the heat of pilot season . Another is a TV adaptation of the movie franchise Behind Enemy Lines , which could be next season 's edition of Lethal Weapon . A third option is Controversy , an anthology drama about a football university dealing with a sexual assault scandal . The other two are The Resident , a medical drama , and the untitled Marvel X-Men pilot . <p> So what could this mean ? Are they bringing back many veterans ? Is Pitch getting a second shot ? Or are they just trying to cut costs on pilot season by only ordering a few ? These questions are all equally reasonable . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two seasons , I would n't be surprised to see the Marvel drama airing on Mondays midseason , though it could also air in the fall if they want to revamp a night . <p> The amount of dramas on FOX 's schedule next season most likely is determined by how many hours of reality they air . One of MasterChef Junior and Hell 's Kitchen is very likely , but nothing else is obvious . A renewal for Pitch and/or The Exorcist is possible since there are so few drama pilots . It will certainly be a new and interesting idea if a network picks up all their pilots to series ; after all , it eliminates the factor of a show being rejected in the pilot stages that very much could have been a hit show . 
@@81116559 @2616559/ <h> Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 4 Episode 17/18 Review <p> Brooklyn Nine-Nine works well when the cast is n't divided and thrown into separate plot bubbles . Do n't get me wrong , the series can do both types of episodes very well , but in most cases , an episode works a lot better when the whole cast is in one place ( see Season 1 's " The Party " and Season 2 's " Beach House " ) . Cop-Con is similar to the episodes mentioned as the characters all get something to do in the same setting . <p> There 's nothing particularly original about the character hiding a party from Holt or waking up from hangovers , both are scenarios that 9-9 has already tackled . The twist in this episode is that Holt 's promotion is on the line . The episode ends on a somewhat sour note as Holt 's presentation ends up being sabotaged by his arch-nemesis ( who is not Wunch ) all because of how careless the squad was . It 's really kind of sad that Holt could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind that they jeopardized Holt 's reputation and the entire precinct . The mini-resolution itself is a watered-down version of " Beach House " as Holt does n't end up being mad about not getting his promotion , but mad that he was n't invited to the party . <p> While the ending might be a bit of a downer , that does n't stop the episode itself from being great . Boyle 's obsession with Jake 's new robot best friend is just completely hilarious . I also liked the way Terry , Jake , and Charles had to retrace their steps to figure out what happened the night before . Again , this is well-trodden material in the sitcom world , but little tidbits like Jake getting put on fire or Boyle breaking Jake 's robot in an act of jealousy is what gives it more comedic depth and makes everything worthwhile . <p> Meanwhile , Scully actually gets some time in the spotlight . It only makes sense that Scully would get back in the dating game after his wife ( or dog ) passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilized in an episode without having to rely on Hitchcock . The story itself is nothing new , we 've all heard of the story where the odd goofball guy finds a woman exactly like him , but I did enjoy the twist that Cindy did n't want an overly confident Scully , but just the weird and clammy version . <p> " Cop-Con " is n't an episode that tries to be original , but it is one that 's thoroughly enjoyable . The change in setting is admirable after having the bulk of recent episodes take place in the precinct . It definitely takes a page from previous " party " episodes and it 's an episode that showcases how talented the ensemble cast really is . <p> Grade : A- <p> Chasing Amy <p> FOX <p> Despite airing back-to-back , " Chasing Amy " is the antithesis to " Cop-Con " . This episode is a return to an A , B , and C plot , but nothing really works and is nowhere near as funny as the installment that aired a half-hour before it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as the squad is away from the precinct , it 's kind of ridiculous to have a precinct-based episode without any crime to solve or perp to catch . <p> The A-plot features Amy mysteriously disappearing as Jake &amp; Rosa attempt to find her and get her to the sergeant 's test before it 's too late . It 's not a bad synopsis , but in a show that focuses on crime , it would have been much more intriguing if Santiago had been kidnapped or caught up in some other sort of crime . Nevertheless , I do have to give props to the writers for their great continuity . I love how they alluded back to Season 1 's " The Bet " when Jake finally found Amy , it 's a nice touch and it proves how consistent this show is . Also , Rosa 's Amy voice was easily the best part of the whole story , if not the episode . <p> The B-plot is probably the most interesting of the three stories . Terry &amp; Holt are a solid pairing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Holt 's obliviousness to the fact that kids do n't want a drab , colorless train set . Ultimately , both are proven wrong and have to understand that no one really cares about their passion . It 's nothing exciting and it 's a bit strange that Holt would abandon his job just to work on making a toy , but it 's fairly amusing in a drab episode . <p> The C-plot is definitely the least interesting . Boyle is a great character , but the running gag of how lame his family is never really worked in the first place , and is just getting old now . The whole thing felt like a retread of an earlier season 4 episode where Gina and Boyle talk about the Boyle family vacation and that plot was n't very amusing either . Charles as a character is great , but his family ( aside from his dad ) does n't add much to the series or his character . <p> Ultimately " Chasing Amy " is n't a great episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine .

@@81116561 @2616561/ <p> The following review was previously published on the Pop Culture Cosmos website and authorized to be posted to The TV Ratings Guide . <p> Its easy to understand why in our most recent podcast ( which you can listen to here ) we at Pop Culture Cosmos labeled DC Comics latest entry into the superhero movie realm , Wonder Woman ( Warner Bros. , Rated PG-13 , Running time : 2 hours 13 minutes , directed by Pattie Jenkins ) as the most important film of 2017 . With the recent critical failures of movies such as Man of Steel , Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice there is plenty at stake for both Warner Bros. and DC Comics when it comes to the release of this film . Another sub-standard performance would send public word of mouth of the DC Extended Universe ( DCEU ) at an all-time low ( which includes the decade of debacles of the Superman iterations of the 1980s ) . This would almost certainly spell doom for not only the upcoming Justice League ( due out in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put most likely on an indefinite hold . While these films have done " OK " at best when it comes to box office returns ( garnering over 2 billion dollars combined for the last three films in the series ) the public perceptions of how the DC movie universe has progressed as compared to its Marvel rival is almost a " night and day " point of view . Does this tale of the Amazon Warrior prove to have enough " fight " to bring the DCEU back into the forefront of superhero stardom ? <p> As an origin tale outlining the rise and the motivations of Diana Prince ( played by Gal Gadot ) , Wonder Woman boldly sets out to not only prove it can set things straight in the DCEU and also send a message while doing so . As princess of the island of Themyscira , her drive even as a young girl to become a great warrior and defend those who can not defend themselves leads her straight into the middle of the battlefront of World War I as she discovers that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erich Ludendorff ( Danny Huston ) and Doctor Maru ( Elena Anaya ) , searching for ways to keep the conflict alive even as an armistice for peace is clearly within reach . Led on this adventure by American spy Steve Trevor ( Chris Pine ) her naivety to the new world she has been thrust into has her not only questioning herself but the people she swore to defend and liberate . Her beliefs and training bestowed upon her by her mother Queen Hippolyta ( Connie Nielsen ) and her aunt Antiope ( Robin Wright ) leads her to believe strongly that the motivations of battle are being influenced by the God of War Ares and that only his defeat at the hands of Diana will stop the bloodshed and violence that had been covering the world like a plague for so many years . <p> Of the items that stick out the most is that Gadot appears to have that " it " factor as her screen presence is clearly felt throughout the film and the experience itself is quite the better for it . Her fighting scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience without wearing out their welcome such as the previous DC films . Her only weaknesses come in exposition when tasked with with extended dialogue are few and far between and Jenkins ensures smooth transitions by providing her with veteran actors and actresses who only provide quality assistance in elevating her performance and the narrative as a whole . Most noteworthy of the performances being those of Nielsen and Wright who provide in more ways than one the solid foundation for what 's to come in the story and Pine whose Trevor character is his best work in a movie outside of a Star Trek uniform . <p> Gadots rendition of the Wonder Woman character herself reminds audiences of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme in the earlier stages of their career that even with a noted accent , the charisma oozes out of the screen from that of a true movie star that has officially arrived . The daft direction by Jenkins in both battle and non battle scenes alike prove to be the big winner for movie fans overall as the films few flaws .

True , the film often resembles and parallels Marvels Captain America : First Avenger but seeing how that movie universe has gone so far modeling Wonder Woman in a similar mold is definitely not a bad thing to emulate . <p> For all the right reasons Wonder Woman has placed itself definitively as the best DC movie since The Dark Knight which is something not only admirable for everyone involved with the film but for the future of the comic book movie series itself .

@@81116562 @2616562/ <h> Making History Season 1 Episode 7 Review <p> While I have thoroughly enjoyed the first six episodes of Making History , the show definitely does n't seem to know where to go next . In one episode , the gang could be trying to start the American Revolution , and in the next , they 're focusing on relationship problems in present day . One thing to note , the series got its episode order cut from 13 to 9 , which might explain why the setting can change really quickly . Nevertheless , whether it is intentional or not , it 's a good thing that the series is n't always stuck in the same place . There are way too many shows on television that tend to follow the same formula week after week , and with Making History , there is no formula . Tonight 's episode follows this trend , or lack thereof , as the trio return to present day and return to normal life . <p> Chris 's storyline is n't too different from the last time he was in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence and he is forced to explain it all . There 's the additional element of Hancock and Adamas entering the present , after an extended absence , that freshens up the situation a bit . Some of the funnier moments of the episode center on Hancock and Adams being totally oblivious on how things work in the present . Other than that , the two have some solid lines , but there 's nothing new to be found . I liked seeing Ben Vereen 's character and Dean sort of interrogating Chris . Dean 's lines about his sketchy past were one of the funniest moments of the episode while Vereen 's Dr. Cobel excelled as he did in the last episode that he was in . I would have liked to see more of Dan &amp; Chris interacting , they 've come to be a solid duo . I also did n't like the absence of any real danger like the past episodes have shown , but overall , it 's an amusing plot , even if it is n't out of the ordinary . <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's great to see her owning a business and making a life for herself in the present , but the whole thing seems like exposition that should lead to something bigger . When a show about time-travel has just 9 episodes to prove itself , it 's best to steer clear of sitcom shenanigans and move forward to more gutsy stuff . There 's nothing wrong with Deb telling off Dan and opening up an ice cream parlor , but when the previous episodes focused on Al Capone and colonial times , it feels like the series is betraying its premise . <p> Ultimately , " Night Cream " reminds me of " The Boyfriend Experience " . It 's an episode that does n't take advantage of its premise and focuses on what Dan , Chris , and Deb are up to in present day . But , unlike the 3rd episode , " Night Cream " does bring in elements like Hancock and Adams to spice things up and all of the plots were very enjoyable .

Now , Undateable is n't the best comedy on television , other shows like Fresh Off the Boat and Mom are superior , but Undateable is a lot of fun , and worth the watch , and here are some reasons why ! <p> 1 . This season is live ! <p> Live episodes is n't something that solely belongs to singing shows and Saturday Night Live , sitcoms can be live too , though are any other sitcoms currently airing live episodes ? Nope , only Undateable ! Airing episodes live allows for more improv , and more current topics can be discussed . Think about SNL , what would it be like if they filmed it weeks prior to its airing ? Everything on Weekend Update would be old news , and many things would n't be as relevant . <p> 2 . The actors can handle live <p> Four of the seven main actors on the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live television . Also , they all proved they could do live last season with the show 's initial live episode . Chris D'Elia is very funny recorded , but he is ten times as funny live ! <p> 3 . Fridays at 8:00 , what else is on ? <p> Undateable will be airing up against Last Man Standing , Dr. Ken , The Amazing Race , and Reign tonight . While I do like Last Man Standing , I would still prefer to watch Undateable on Friday nights , especially now that the episodes are live . <p> 4 . Single-camera is NOT superior to multi-camera <p> Great sitcoms can be single-camera , great sitcoms can be multi-camera . Yes , single-camera shows Fresh Off the Boat , The Middle , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , Scrubs , Suburgatory , and more is and were great , but think about Friends , Seinfeld , Cheers , How I Met Your Mother , and other multi-camera sitcoms , they are great too ! Do n't be prejudice , give multi-cams a shot ! <p> 5 . Ron Funches <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ron Funches deserves to be mentioned again . His character of Shelley is perhaps the funniest character currently on television , up there with Fresh Off the Boat 's Jessica Huang , Mom 's Bonnie , and The Middle 's Sue Heck . He has some of the show 's funniest lines , such as my personal favorite " Somebody call Kerry Washington , ' cause we got ourselves a scandal !

@@81116603 @2616603/ <p> Before I get started , note that this article can be seen as a sequel of sorts to " The Hits and Misses of Famous Creators and Franchises " , which can be found here . Turns out , ABC 's recent failure Conviction is n't the only show named Conviction that did n't make it past the first 13 episodes . <p> Criminal Minds : Suspect Behavior and Criminal Minds : Beyond Borders While the CSI and NCIS franchises are far more well-known , CBS has also made two spin-offs for popular , yet only partially-owned , Criminal Minds . The first spin off , Suspect Behavior , came in Criminal Minds ' sixth season . As mentioned in the other article , its second episode got a 2.4 A18-49 Live + Same Day rating out of a 3.2 for Criminal Minds . Not terrible , just a little bit below league average . The season finale , however , hit a 1.8 rating airing after a rerun of the mother show , just 70% of the league average that season . It never saw a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Beyond Borders , which premiered last season . Its 1.25 average out of a 1.6 average lead-in was n't terrible , and it was remarkable how it received an ugly 1.1 out of a 2.1 , but a much more stellar 1.0 out of a 1.0 . The second season is where it fell apart . The fact that an episode received a 0.8 rating out of a 1.6 for the mother show is simply not acceptable , that 's rejection at its finest . If anyone was to accept Beyond Borders it should be the fans of the mother show , yet the show only had half the audience . <p> Whether CBS looks for a third Criminal Minds spin-off or not is a big question-mark , though it would n't be surprising to see one come during the find season of the mother show . <p> Law &amp; Order : LA and Law &amp; Order : Trial By Jury If you turn on your TV right now , I 'm guessing you 'll find at least two or three Dick Wolf shows airing . Law &amp; Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly all the time , and Law &amp; Order : Criminal Intent also made it 10 seasons . Both peaked as monster hits , and while Law &amp; Order did n't exactly have a glamorous goodbye , it 's still arguably one of the most remembered shows of all time . Law &amp; Order : LA and Law &amp; Order : Trial By Jury did n't exactly live up to that standard . In 2010 , NBC canceled both the original show and LA , something that they probably would n't be able to get away with today given Dick Wolf has even more of a presence there now . While Law &amp; Order : LA was a failure , only getting to air 22 episodes , Trial By Jury was even worse , with only 13 episodes and even then , only 12 aired on NBC ( the final aired on Court TV ) . Airing on Fridays at 10pm , the final episodes went below 10 million viewers , which was considered poor in 2005 . Compare that to the over 15 million viewers SVU was receiving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade and a half after it premiered .

However , eventually the two spin-offs were canceled and CSI was declining fast as well in its new Sunday time slot . The plan was to end the original CSI show and carry on with the franchise with CSI : Cyber . The short first season did n't exactly do all that great in the ratings , but being part of the CSI franchise both meant international sales , network support , and Ted Danson signing on to do Season 2 .

NCIS : Red never made it past the pilot stage . While NCIS and NCIS : LA were big hits , this NCIS : LA spin-off clearly was not liked by CBS brass and/or focus groups . There was speculation that this spin-off would lead to CBS creating an all-NCIS Tuesday , and it would be one of the most obvious pick-ups of the season . Something about the show had to have been off ; probably it was just plain bad , whether that be because they could n't find the right off-screen talent or if the acting was sub-par . It almost certainly was n't because they were afraid of over-saturation , as NCIS : New Orleans was ordered to series just a year after this forgotten failure.Chicago Justice This article would n't be complete without discussing the cancelation of Chicago Justice .

@@81116604 @2616604/ <h> ABC Renew/Cancel - April 28 : Once Upon a Time is Likely to be Renewed <p> You wo n't be able to say that this edition of ABC Renew/Cancel is boring ! We have some prediction changes ( three , to be exact ) in this penultimate week of ABC Renew/Cancel , and I have to say that some of these shows are very difficult to predict . In particular , The Catch , Once Upon a Time , and Imaginary Mary are challenging . So , take a look at this week 's predictions , and then read my analysis to see why things are predicted the way they are , and why this network is really making it challenging to figure out what they are going to do . <p> Format for predictions : Show title ( average 18-49 rating , season low-high ) Certain to be Canceled <p> Once Upon a Time : After a ratings uptick this week , I decided to move Once Upon a Time to a not-very-confident likely to be renewed . I believe that ABC will want to renew at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time or The Catch . While The Catch does have the power of Shonda Rhimes , and Once Upon a Time does have the risks of a big ratings drop with its very different seventh season , I think that Once Upon a Time 's stronger ratings than The Catch will get it a renewal . <p> Imaginary Mary : Why is this show getting upgraded after going down this week ? Well , it 's complicated . First , there is the season finale date announcement . With this announcement , ABC is saying that , at least at the moment , they only plan on broadcasting 8 episodes in Imaginary Mary 's first season . Imaginary Mary produced nine episodes , and the production numbers listed on The Futon Critic show that this episode order was not cut to eight . Imaginary Mary is not getting ratings that would make the network that aired all episodes of Notorious and Conviction not air an episode , so most likely the episode not scheduled would air as part of season two if renewed , like ABC did with Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely ABC would stop calling that the season finale and air the episode at a later date . This means that a renewal is at least on the table . This brought a theory I had in the back of my mind to the front of my mind . What if Dungey likes to give first season shows second chances , as long as they do n't completely fail ( like Conviction and Notorious did ) ? While other reasons could be prescribed to those shows , this could help explain the renewals of The Real O'Neals and The Catch last season . Imaginary Mary performed well enough on its own this week , so I am leaning towards a renewal . I just want to make sure it does n't fall to 0.7 or something next week , so I 'm not moving it to likely to be renewed yet . ( Also , I would like to note that , while the animation may be a concern to some , the show is not using as much anymore , with the Mary character having little screen time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The Catch : After another 0.6 this week , I have downgraded The Catch to a toss-up like I said I would in this case . Additionally , my thinking about how ABC seems to favor first season shows got me more down on The Catch 's chances this week . Was the reasoning for last year 's renewal " Shonda Rhimes produces it , so we will renew it " , or was it " Shonda Rhimes produces it , so we will give it a second chance , despite not fully deserving one " ? Additionally , even if it was the former , perhaps the new project Black 's Law , which is likely to get ordered and put on the fall schedule , will be enough for Shonda Rhimes , and she wo n't care about a cancelation for The Catch . But , could holding off Still Star-Crossed for the summer make ABC more inclined to renew The Catch to keep Shonda Rhimes happy ? I am unsure as to the answers to all of these questions , though I have some guesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC Renew/Cancel for the season next week , I will make a decision one way or another for The Catch , but for now it 's a toss-up . <p> Agents of SHIELD : Back down this week to 0.7 , Agents of SHIELD is still likely to be renewed , and still the most likely out of the non-Designated Survivor yet-to-be-renewed dramas . While the 0.8 it got last week was nice , I do n't think many expected it to stay there this week , and its upgrade last week was not based on that , it was just a plus . For more on why Agents of SHIELD is likely to be renewed , you can take a look at last week 's ABC Renew/Cancel . <p> What do you think of my predictions ? Leave your thoughts in the comments !

Given that it is the network 's #10 show , already had a first season of 12 episodes , is owned by CBS , stars Matthew Perry , fits the network 's comfortable multicam mold , and is seemingly working moderately well in this midseason/burnoff-ish strategy with some episodes airing on Thursdays and some on Mondays until the season is done , I think it stands a comfortable chance for renewal . Of course , it has The Big Bang Theory for a lead-in and is still down a sizable 29.5 percent year-to-year , but CBS 's standards are a bit lower for comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out in the next few seasons . CBS had too many comedies ordered last season to fit them all in strategically , especially with Supergirl occupying a historical comedy hour on Mondays , which essentially forced Mike &amp; Molly out and did n't give Angel From Hell much of a chance to grow . CBS could hypothetically duplicate that scenario next season , with 2 Broke Girls acting as the Mike &amp; Molly throwaway , and they could always burn off The Odd Couple in midseason/summer should the situation present itself where they have a successful freshman batch and do n't need it . There are a lot of possibilities , if CBS is willing to invest in more episodes . At this point , I think the show has given a fighting effort in its second season and will likely be renewed for another 10-13 episodes as upfronts are nearing .

This season delivered a hearty helping of sitcoms after years of reduced comedies . However , those numbers pale in comparison to the glory days of the 80 's . Back in the 1989-90 season , the four networks bolstered a whopping 55 entries , with 31 network renewals. 32 returned , as the Hogan Family was resurrected on CBS after a 5-season run on NBC . This season presented changes in the heart of the Family-First era , which dominated airwaves from 1984-92 . Back in 1989 , the first president Bush entered into the White House , presenting the first time since 1929 that the Republican party had a president in a consecutive third term . The Cold War which terrorized America like a passive-aggressive threat began to thaw ; perhaps Global Warming aided the end to the longest war of the 20th century . November 9 cracked the Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government overthrew Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega on December 20 . These developments were indeed heavy , offset by topical issues such as the AIDS crisis and escalated drug usage . Fittingly , TV presented a wholesome escape for Americans tired of everyday troubles.Viewers were in the center of the Family First Era , which emerged due to The Cosby Show 's prominence in 1984 . This year also presented the rebirth after a quieter 8-year Escapism era which sitcoms took a backseat to fantasy fares like Charlie 's Angels , Dynasty , Dallas and The Love Boat . Every evening this season featured a family-friendly sitcom , with ABC cornering the market with its Tuesday , Wednesday and Friday offerings . 1989-90 also featured a rise in workplace laughs for adults with an equal number of 25 offerings . Seven sitcoms split the emphasis of subgenres of Hangout , Workplace or Family themes , of which five were renewed . <p> Above is the breakdown of the 55 sitcoms offered , minus the current covered 18-49 demographic . Although these numbers were tracked by Nielsen , the target moneymaker with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching . A show with a healthy 13.9 share meant 13.9% of the population was watching . Also valued were overall Nielsens. 7 of the top 10 programs of this season were sitcoms scattered across Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday between ABC and NBC , both of which assured viewers 4 sitcoms at all times during the schedule . Stacked against the current Sitcom Scorecards , the 4 classifications would break down with 21.9M overall viewers to break into the " Leading the Pack " range , 16M to enter the " Middle of the Pack " , the delta of the " Anemic " range would be 11M , and everything below in " The Abyss " . The 1989-90 breakdown differs from the 2016-17 classifications as majority of the Anemic range was cancelled , and The Abyss featured a true toss-up due to FOX dominating this region . Nielsen winners and losers received their ratings by evenings . Here were the evenings for sitcoms , by strongest evenings ( out of order ) : THURSDAYCompetitors knew to steer clearn and place softer fares on this evening , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 9:30 timeslot less prominent and scattered between 4 sitcoms . Two weaker players who aired later in 1990 in that slot , Wings and Seinfeld , would become sleeper hits who ran until 1997 and 1998 , respectively . All four 9:30 shows were renewed , with Grand burning off the grid the following season , and Dear John making it to 85 episodes by 1992 . TUESDAYCosby narrowly tied with ABC Tuesday 's Roseanne , which built its pre-audience with The Wonder Years placing 6th at 8:30 and aging Who 's the Boss taking 8th at 8pm . Like Thursdays , the 9:30 ABC timeslot shadowed the earlier block with forgotten Chicken Soup and establishing hit Coach . Chicken Soup placed 9th , yet was cancelled due to star Jackie Mason 's controversial political remarks , making it the highest rated cancellation . Successor Coach placed 16th that season , yet cost less as its marquee stars were Craig T. Nelson and Shelley Fabares against powerhouses of CS , Jackie Mason and Lynn Redgrave.SATURDAYNBC cornered this market with shares of gold , thanks to our polished seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and 6th Place in overall network measures outside of sitcoms ) . It led into Empty Nest , who retained nearly 95-percent of Nielsens and Shares . The 8pm Hour rated 30-percent lighter by comparison , shared by aging fares 227 , Amen , Hogan Family and ALF . ALF and Hogan family relocated after 4 and 5 seasons from Monday as NBC opted to reinvent said evening against CBS ' moderately rated sitcom block . Of the four helpings , only Amen would survive as NBC opted against renewal . Spring 1990 saw changes again as the 8pm slot went to dramatic piece A Home For Joe , and NBC 's lowest rated and properly forgotten workplace sitcom 13 East at 8:30 . The 10pm hour opened the gates for Carol Burnett vehicle Carol and Company ( 14th Place ) and Down Home ( 32nd ) . Both fares were renewed , yet burned off the following season . ABC made mild attempts at laughs with aging Mr. Belvedere and Who 's the Boss spinoff Living Dolls ( featuring upcoming stars Halle Berry and Leah Remini ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-evening sendoff in July 1990 .

After the young doctor outperformed Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis ' ABL , it was sidelined , Doogie moved to 9pm and dramatic pices complimented Doogie with lackluster results . Seeing softer ABC performances , NBC and CBS assembled half-hour affairs in each hour . NBC 's Night Court emerged victorious against ABL , yet Cloris Leachman workplace sitcom The Nutt House placed 3rd in its timeslot and roasted over an open fire . Spring sitcom FM failed against Doogie Howser and faded out by Season 's End.FRIDAYTGIF debuted this year with soaring results blazed by increasingly popular Full House ( 12th ) and freshman Family Matters ( 17th ) .

Subsequently , the 9:30pm timeslot struggled in succeeding years to find a suitable replacement , cancelling nearly all 1990-2000 players in this slot by season 's ends . CBS made a minor play for laughs in the springtime in the 8-9pm hour with Baghdad Cafe and Sugar and Spice . The results ? Baghdad Cafe faltered mid-season the next year , and Sugar and Spice soured to staleness by May 1990 . MONDAYHowever did Mondays rate weaker than Fridays in sitcoms ! ? CBS managed to build a praised feminist workplace 9pm hour with Murphy Brown and Designing Women . 8pm launched moderately successful family/workplace fare Major Dad .

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is CBS produced , as well as Jane the Virgin . Jane the Virgin and Reign were dreadfully low rated last season . If all three shows are renewed , what will this mean ? At least one of the Warner Bros. produced shows will go to the chopping block in order to settle the imbalance . Will it be The Vampire Diaries , The 100 , DC 's Legends of Tomorrow , Containment , or iZombie ? Stay tuned .

The Cosby Show increased its viewing base by 38% , bringing the network to an overall 20% gain over the previous successful season . CBS and ABC descended downward , with the Tiffany Network losing 8% , and the alphabet network dropping 13.5% .

@@81116618 @2616618/ <h> Brooklyn Nine-Nine S3E11 Review <p> Brooklyn Nine-Nine moves back to Tuesday this week . I am sure that it will take its funny with it back to its original day of the week , but read my review to find out what I thought about this week 's episode . <p> S3E11 " Hostage Situation " <p> The episode starts with Holt bumping into a person dancing in the street , which leads to Holt showing him how it 's done . This is funny in itself , but it gets funnier when Jake tries to film this , but his phone is dead , and Boyle drops his phone . This was an amazing teaser . Boyle and his girlfriend of three months tell Jake that they are wanting to have a baby , which is very typical Boyle . Holt and Rosa try to intimidate a suspect , but he will only talk to Gina . Amy asks Terry to fill out a recommendation for her , and she does so in the most Amy way possible , which is entertaining . Then , she accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reveals that she legally owns the sperm he saved when he got a vasectomy , so she took it out of storage , and the only way she will give it back the sperm is if he convinces a man she hit with her car to drop his case against her . Jake excitedly sees this as a hostage situation . <p> Jake and Boyle talk , and he reveals that the one thing he won in the divorce is their hairdresser , which results in some funny lines , so they decide to use that as a bargaining chip . They use it to get up to her apartment . Meanwhile , Amy makes things worse as she gives Terry tea that makes his nose burn , then spills it on him . This was sadly predictable . Holt and Rosa let the suspect talk to Gina , and while she thinks that he wants to talk to her because she is n't a cop , it 's because he knew her from high school . Jake tries to steal a container of Boyle 's sperm , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals that there are two containers , and she destroys one . <p> Boyle reveals that he is going to intimidate the old man to get his sperm back , and handcuffs Jake so that he wo n't stop him . Amy gets rejected from the program , and automatically assumes that this is the result of Terry 's recommendation , but he reveals that he wrote her a great recommendation . Gina talks to the suspect again , and asks him some hilarious unrelated questions . Jake chases down Boyle when he gets free , and it is a very funny scene . Jake brings Boyle back to the precinct and locks him up , but when he releases him , Boyle runs off again . Terry reveals to Amy that he went to extra lengths , and she has been accepted into the program , again very expected . Rosa reveals that she got the suspect to confess after they bonded over their mutual hatred of Gina . I loved the line about how Gina once called her Gina , that 's her own name ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at donor options , and one happens to be Jake 's dad , which Boyle wants to use , but Jake hates the idea of . It was a great and fitting ending . <p> Though Amy and Terry 's storyline showed a predictable path , the others were great . Overall , this was a very good episode . <p> What did you think of " Hostage Situation " ? Leave your thoughts in the comments ! 
@@81116619 @2616619/ <p> NBC 's presentation of the Stanley Cup Finals ( 1.4 ) helped them win the night even if the airing was significantly below the last couple results . <p> FOX 's game show duo , Beat Shazam ( 1.0 ) and Love Connection ( 0.8 ) , each lost a tenth in week 3 but still look rather solid , at least in comparison to the reality and game shows they 've aired in the last couple of years . <p> ABC had their own game show line-up with absurdly strong encores of Celebrity Family Feud ( 1.0/1.4 ) and The $100,000 Pyramid ( 1.1 ) . The 9 pm showing of Family Feud beat out 50% of its originals from last summer so this could be a good sign going into premiere Sunday . 
@@81116621 @2616621/ <h> Does FOX Have the Best Comedy Development ? Part 4 <h> Do n't  Worry , Theyre Still Trying Broad Comedies <p> This season , FOX tried to air some more broadly-appealing comedies in Grandfathered and The Grinder , to try to balance out their niche comedies , such as Family Guy and The Last Man On Earth . It did n't  work , but they are still trying to make it work due to the fact that they gave both new sitcoms full backorders and new time slots . It has been made clear that FOX has not given up on the broader comedy style yet , based off the premises of a few of their shows currently in development . Let 's take a look : <p> +Sugarland is a single-cam that is said to be about a pair of friends who work for difficult managers and are trying to keep their home life and work life separate . Produced by 20th Century Fox . That 's all the material that has been released about its content , so it should be interesting to see how it works out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +Think Like a Man is a script that FOX has received for a TV adaptation of Steve Harveys book , which was later turned into a film . As quoted from The Futon Critic , it shows four parts of romance : " newly married , moving in , breaking up and hooking up " . Sounds a little bit like Life in Pieces to me , personally , and also has kind of an iffy title , and a Sony production company name attached ( not FOX-produced ) . I do n't  like its chances as much as Sugarlands , though Steve Harveys name as an executive producer may help . <p> +Untitled Chernins Project is a single-cam that will be about a hard-working , industrial woman who moves to a rich neighborhood in Connecticut in order to raise her spoiled nieces and nephews after their parents left the country after being caught doing unspecified illegal things . Maybe not that broad of a comedy , but I thought it fit best in this category . The plotline sounds intriguing to me . It is produced by 20th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if FOX decides not to order a pilot . <p> +Untitled Daley &amp; Goldstein Project is a single-cam that is about a group of adults trying to save their town after a teenage gang starts to ruin it . It has a script with a penalty attached and is produced by 20th Century Fox . Does it sound interesting to me ? No . But I do n't  need to like a show in order for it to be worthy of making the air , so who knows . <p> +Untitled Elizabeth Beckwith Project is said to be semi-autobiographical as a workplace comedy set in Las Vegas in the 1970s , where presumably the son works for the dad . I heard every episode will start with a Patton Oswald voiceover saying , " Back in the 70s " wait , no , that 's The Goldbergs in the 80s . Interesting enough , both The Goldbergs and this one are produced by Sony . Looks like FOX is looking into getting into the blast-from-the-past comedy genre ?

@@81116622 @2616622/ <h> Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Season 3 Review <p> Ever since it premiered , I have loved Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Its cast is incredible , its storylines are hilarious , and its characters are all flawed yet somehow lovable . <p> My favorite character , especially in the second season , is Lillian . She 's always so very funny and I love her interactions with the other characters . So I loved that her involvement in the season is greatly increased . Her storyline was a high point for me , and I loved that she got an interesting love interest ( sorry Fred Armisen , you 're great , but Bobby Durst was n't a good love interest ) . The story of Lillian becoming a city councilwoman and meeting Artie was really great and it was the best storyline Lillian 's gotten to date . I enjoyed watching her coming to terms with and accepting change , and I loved her character development throughout the season . <p> Titus is a character that is just a delight to watch . He 's just larger than life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to see Titus trying to come to terms with his breakup with Mikey . As we see in the finale , he obviously still has feelings for Mikey and he 's not over him . I think it 's going to be interesting to see what happens between these two next season , because I find it hard to believe that things are over between them . It was also interesting to watch Titus still trying to become a star in this season . Between his attempt to join the cast of Sesame Street , recording awful music for Gordy ( or as I like to call him , Frank ) , and his adventures with Dionne Warwick , Titus provided lots of laughs this season . And his take on Lemonade was wonderful . <p> Jacqueline is the one character that I feel the writers never really know what to do with . Her storyline this season was just weak for the majority of it , and I have always hated the character of Russ . He 's not worth any screen time , and I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the season featuring Jacqueline and Duke were probably her strongest , and I enjoyed seeing Josh Charles in that role again . I also liked the episode that saw Jacqueline convince NFL team owners to change the names of their teams to things they hate , and the guest appearances of Paula Pell and Chris Parnell were great here . Overall though , Jacqueline do much that I found very interesting this season , even though I love Krakowski and think Jacqueline really has so much more potential . But at least she dumped Russ this season . Progress ! <p> One thing that really was disappointing to me was Kimmy 's storyline . I just did n't find it very interesting beyond the first few episodes with here interacting with the Reverend ( the always wonderful and always welcome Jon Hamm ) . I did n't really care about Kimmy being in college and I was expecting more from that storyline . Kimmy really did n't provide me with many laughs this season and that was surprising to me , as I 've loved her before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulls Off a Heist ! , when Kimmystruggles with helping Titus , well , pull off a heist . It was an episode where Kimmy was front and center , and I loved it . If I had to pick a favorite Kimmy moment of the season , it 's her devouring Pixy Stix and developing an addiction to them . It was hilarious . <p> This show really has great guest appearances , and that continued this season . Ray Liotta , Paula Pell , and Chris Parnell all had great appearances in the fantastic Kimmy Pulls Off a Heist ! , perhaps my favorite episode of the series . Judah Friedlander also made an interesting appearance as Gordy , the producer of Boobs in California ( the catchiest musical moment of this season ) , a high point of the season for me . Maya Rudolph 's appearance as Dionne Warwick was also hilarious , and it helped resolved questions provided by the opening moments of the season . Also , I 'm so happy Titus did n't eat her . Rachel Dratch also made a memorable performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herwife . My beloved Andrea Martin made a brief appearance as one of the many Lindas from HR , and it was a really funny scene and I just loved seeing her again because I already miss Great News and ca n't wait for it to return . <p> One character sorely missed in this season was Andrea , who made an all-too-brief appearance in the season . Her presence was missed , as she was one of my favorite parts of the second season . <p> All in all , while I did n't love every aspect of this season , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt continues to be one of TV 's best comedies , and I 'm excited to see what 's next for this gang of misfits.

All networks experienced minor losses in overall averages between 4.3-7.0% , yet the sitcom averages maintained ( ABC ) , experienced mild Gains ( NBC , 5% ) or soared to new heights ( CBS , 20% ) . A fourth network , FOX , entered the arena in 1987 and was not counted in seasonal averages . <p> Unlike the previous season , two outlying sitcoms in the Anemic classification survived . Only Mr. Belvedere would exit the season with a renewal , narrowly dodging cancellation for its remaining run .

However , an attempt at 2 hours of sitcoms on Fridays proved disastrous , as all but one show was cancelled . Even lone survivor Mr. Belvedere dodged the network blade as ABC decided to reverse its initial cancellation . A failed Saturday 8pm sitcom hour featuring marquee stars Lucille Ball and Ellen Burstyn crashed and burned against NBC 's power night , and ABC used the remaining season to shop its weak sitcom crop around in these hours . <p> CBS produced their own Monday comedy expansion with respectable results .

@@81116641 @2616641/ <h> 2014-2015--What the New Shows and Bubble Shows Needed on ABC <p> You may have seen all my posts on this year 's ad rates--but what about the numbers from last year ? According to these calculations , what did the shows on the bubble need in order to survive ? What They Needed--The New Shows and the Bubble Shows ( ABC ) <p> How to Get Away with Murder : 2.31 ( 2.96 ) <p> Forever : 1.16 ( 1.12 ) <p> Cristela : 1.06 ( 1.00 ) <p> Blackish : 1.84 ( 2.28 ) <p> Revenge : 1.61 ( 1.11 ) <p> Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. : 2.17 ( 1.59 ) <p> Galavant : 1.02 ( 1.32 ) <p> American Crime : 1.31 ( 1.16 ) <p> Fresh Off The Boat : 0.95 ( 1.73 ) <p> Secrets &amp; Lies : 1.38 ( 1.50 ) <p> As is seen , ending Revenge was probably an easy decision for ABC , considering how far below its ad rate it was . With a 1.61 , it looks like they may have expected more of a Resurrection boost--and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to me is Marvel 's Agents of SHIELD , which they may have expected to level off at its spring Season 1 ratings . Another theory for why its number was so relatively high may be because advertisers were attracted to grab a spot during the Marvel hour . <p> Even though Blackish is a family show , it still looks like they were being a little cautious about setting its rate too high in case it underwhelmed--now they are probably wishing the ad rates for Seasons 1 and 2 were switched ! <p> Also of note are how close midseason entries American Crime and Secrets &amp; Lies were--even at a 1.16 , American Crime did not seem to underperform too much , and this combined with possible award recognition may have saved it for a second season . In the case of Secrets &amp; Lies , looks like ABC was almost spot-on in deciding how it would rate . <p> That being said , they could n't have been more spot-on with Forever and Cristela--they actually overachieved slightly . Looking at the numbers , I 'm actually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it looks like the advertisers got what they paid for in their one-and-done runs , so that 's always a plus . Was ABC perhaps expecting to cancel the shows all along ? That 's definitely something to look into , but the important part is that according to this , they did n't really lose any money on the two shows--maybe they just thought they could do better with Quantico/Beyond the Tank/Wicked City and Dr Ken . <p> In addition to Cristela on the comedy side , ABC seemingly WAY underestimated Fresh Off The Boat . Then again , when they set the rate it was set to air after Selfie . Galavant also underperformed a bit , and I 'm not taking theories as to why it was renewed . <p> What do you think of all this ? Would you like to see the calculations for the other , safer shows ? I 'll do them on request ! 
@@81116643 @2616643/ <h> Shows That May Be On The Move : CBS <p> CBS is now known for its aging , slowly declining in ratings procedural dramas . They have plenty of them , and only one new dramaScorpionhas emerged as a true hit . In the upcoming weeks , we will see if CBS is conservative and for the most part keeps things the same , or if they move shows around to try to fix this . <p> Surely , they are keeping in mind that shows such as CSI , The Amazing Race , NCIS:LA , and Person Of Interest were significantly hurt my their time slot changes in the last two seasons . They will also be keeping in mind that the shows replacing them , including Madam Secretary and Stalker , are doing no better or even worse . So , here are the shows I think may have a possibility of moving next season : <p> Madam Secretary and The Good Wife ( if renewed ) <p> If Madam Secretary moves , it will be to The Good Wife 's 9pm time slot , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or used somewhere as a bridge series . Remember that my CBS Bubble Shows Analysis article predicts that The Good Wife will not receive another season , but many think it will and its decision will be announced in the upcoming weeks . <p> Person of Interest <p> Person of Interest has not been holding onto its NCIS:NO leadin to well , and its ratings are down significantly from its Thursday airingsin fact , its first Tuesday airing hit a series low , and it failed to recover from its prior numbers . If it moves , it would either be to Sundays or Fridays . The most likely place to move , in my opinion , would be to Friday at 9 in the event that CBS opts not to renew Hawaii 5-0 . <p> The Odd Couple and Mom <p> With its low retention rate out of The Big Bang Theory , combined with the fact that it goes up and down accordingly with its leadin , The Odd Couple does not look like too strong a show . Surely CBS knows that ratings would plummet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast members . However , would it be worth it to premiere a new show in the time slot and simply hope for the best ? At this point , I think they should keep it where it is and pair something else with Mom in the 9pmhour . Speaking of Mom , I really do n't understand all the time slot changes it has underwent in such a short period of time . After booting it out of the post-Big Bang Theory slot for The Odd Couple , one would think they would put it at 9 . Instead , they put it at 9:30 after reruns of The Big Bang Theory ( at this point Two and a Half Men had ended , while The Millers and The McCarthys had both been pulled from the schedule ) . Although Mom could move to 9 next season , I think either 9 or 9:30 would suffice . <p> Elementary <p> Elementary needs to leave that Thursdays at 10 time slot . There is so much more potential to be found out of something airing there , and Sunday at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of having more episodes for syndication , like Elementary . Truly , that is all I have to say about that . <p> The Amazing Race <p> The Amazing Race was definitely hurt by its move from Sundays , where it has spent numerous years , to Fridays . It was one of the unsung heroes of CBS in my opinion , but they gave priority to the disappointing Madam Secretary . It is cheap enough to squeak out at least a few more cycles , but the question is where they would air . I think that the best option would be to cut down the episode orders ( effectively eliminating the non-elimination legs ) and air it Wednesdays at 8 between cycles of Survivor . It is the type of programming that most likely would n't be affected by Empire , and could even take a tenth or two out of the ABC comedies . <p> This is not saying that I predict all of these shows to movein fact , I think CBS will be more conservative than the other networks ( besides maybe The CW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , there is a small chance that a show other than the ones listed here could move ( just do n't expect to see NCIS on Monday , Criminal Minds on Thursday , and the like ) .

For instance , who wants to see Daphne run around with homeless kids ? No . No . NO . This is not what the show was supposed to be . As far away from the original premise Nashville strayed throughout the years , it never got to this homeless-teen trash .

Grey 's Anatomy set up the rebranding of Seattle Grace to Grey-Sloan Memorial , ensuring the show 's continuation if Ellen Pompeo ( Dr. Meredith Grey ) chose to exit the series . The move paid off , as the show has continued to deliver powerhouse ratings and a valid premise 5 years later . 2 Broke Girls finished season 5 with creative finesse , then burned off their newfound energy the following season , ending in cancellation . And Cheers created its second arc , centering around the will-they/won't-they of equally vapid counterparts Sam and Rebecca .

In the literal sense , the title refers to the radioactive nuclear core but the core values of NCIS , which in essence , is their ( nuclear ) family . <p> The case of the week is an investigation into how Marine Gunnery Sergeant Hugh Patterson , suffered radiation poisoning , and yes this episode is a rare example of the Los Angeles team actually going back to their roots in the traditional NCIS sense . Patterson was exposed to radiation when he was moonlighting as a security officer at a decommissioned nuclear power plant . When Sam and Callen get the PR tour of the plant , Kensi and Deeks go undercover to find the real story . It turns out the Chief Engineer Leon Chadmont , was extremely bitter about taking a hefty pay cut and also concerned about safety levels , so he decided to fake a nuclear accident to demonstrate his point .

The detail in Core Values is an understanding of how the radioactivity from nuclear cores are kept safe underwater , and the audience learn this as the field agents do . Oh , and apparently , underneath the glorified swimming pool is a large plug - just so water can drain out really quickly to allow the cores to heat up rapidly .. ! ?

The best boom is the first , unexpected blast , which prompts the team to re-start their investigations . <p> Many of the scenes take place on location at the nuclear power plant , where the field agents are segregated in to work in their pairs and really only meet up when searching for the second bomb .

Sam tricked her into leaving her home land , and destroyed her dreams when he abandoned her upon arrival to the US ; Jada had to testify against Tahir or return home , where her brother would kill her . In The Long Goodbye , Jada managed to escape witness protection and returned home , leaving the storyline open for her brother to finally seek revenge upon Sam , hence the title Revenge Deferred . <p> Sam and Callen are flown into a destroyed renegade army camp in Eritrea , Africa , where only Sam is initially privy to a tent full of surveillance photos of his family ; it seems there is a new mole at NCIS . The photos are less than a year old and none of the Agencies are willing to share information with the Office of Special Projects . Of course Sam involves the team , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe that even Hetty does n't  know the location .

Meanwhile , back in Eritrean , Sam and Callen disobey Hettys orders and search for Tahir , and then Jada . <p> Torture was also high on the agenda , with Sam intent on securing the information on who at NCIS leaked the information on his family to Tahir . Sam has always been portrayed as a moral and honest character , so it was interesting to see where the writers would take him and how his partner would react . Sam asks Callen to leave him alone with Tahir and Callen acquiesces , even going so far to say that whatever Sam does , will stay between them . Bearing in mind Callens dispensation to premeditated violence ( in season twos Lange .

Throughout the torture scenes , Tahir taunts Sam that he is American and conditioned not to carry out his threats . The power struggle continues and even when Sam has Tahir tiptoeing on a chair with a noose around his neck , he still says he is not afraid . Sams calm behaviour and admission that he has self control and is a trained SEAL , is a psychological game which Callen interrupts ; but on the face of it , Sam has lost the power battle with Tahir . <p> The team in LA are extremely focused on the case , with Nell and Eric safely finding and analysing information from Ops .

There was one reality check for the couple when Kensi responded to Deeks comment that the job does not allow the white picket fence lifestyle , that at least they have each other to come home to . This is an important affirmation of how far both characters have progressed in their commitment to each other and their ability to communicate . <p> The mole story arc has suddenly returned with a vengeance , having been mentioned in odd episodes during the season . It is now common knowledge that there 's a leak within the NCIS Office of Special Projects . No agencies will release information to them and even the African Army Colonel in Eritrean is aware of the issue . This suggests the thread will be picked up within the next few episodes and it would be refreshing to see a known character as the traitor , rather than a random member of staff , never seen before , as in last seasons Traitor . <p> There is an interesting dynamic this week between Hetty and Granger . Their scenes are always intriguing , often with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hint of a rich back story that has not yet been told , with Hettys line that they have never stopped lying to each other , adds fuel to that fire . Both characters are now seeking to protect the team albeit in differing ways . Hetty wants to bring Sam home to remove him from the temptation of interrogating Tahir and possibly his feelings for Jada . Granger stated that Hetty underestimates Sams obligations to Jada , unspoken obligations caused by guilt and confusion over his feelings . Granger deliberately sent Sam the photo so he would find Jada and not have regrets , sounding like a lesson he has learned the hard way . <p> Although this is a powerful and thoughtful episode , it does have the misfortune of following last weeks Matryoshka Part 2 , where Chris ODonnell gave an emotionally charged performance . This makes it more noticeable that LL Cool J does not have the same range and his scenes with Jada do not have the desired emotional impact ; his strengths lie in the action and buddy scenes . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sam and Callen reversed . On countless occasions Sam backed his errant partner , usually without voicing the concerns he clearly harbours . This time it is Callens turn to support Sam unconditionally . <p> The investigation from LA was fairly complex with duplicitous charities and money trails and at times was difficult to follow . By comparison the capture of Tahir Khaled in Africa was extremely easy .

@@81116692 @2616692/ <p> ABC has 11 shows with their fates left up in the air right now , and there are only 3 shows--Agent Carter , The Family , and Galavant--that I feel are locks for cancelation , while none of them are locks for renewal . But let 's look at their chances as it stands right now . <p> Last Man Standing and Dr Ken <p> After a Shark Tank rerun hit a 0.8 for a RERUN in the 8pm time slot last week , trouble was spelled for Last Man Standing and Dr Ken ; many believe that the latter 's fate will go hand-in-hand with the former , especially because there has n't seemed to be much buzz for their only multi-cam project , The Fluffy Shop ( though it could still be picked up , remember Cristela ? ) . But with Beyond the Tank premiering in the 8pm time slot to a 0.6 demo rating , it would probably be in ABC 's best interest to negotiate with Tim Allen and renew both Last Man Standing and Dr Ken . It will most likely come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings and the fact that Last Man Standing is heavily syndicated , I 'd say these two are officially the safest of the shows with fates left up in the air . <p> American Crime <p> It seems like American Crime 's chances go up and down every time an entertainment site like Deadline or Variety sends out a bubble watch or pilot buzz article . Just a few days ago John Ridley 's new procedural Presence was looking good , thus spelling the end of American Crime . Now , Deadline is reporting that Presence is n't looking as good as before and that a renewal for American Crime would be the more likely outcome . I 'd rather keep my American Crime prediction as a likely renewal like I 've had it for months . I would rather have been wrong on it the whole time than panic and predict it as a cancelation , only for it to be renewed after all . As for Presence , it really looked like the next Castle . But maybe there wo n't be a new Castle next season ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fillion has signed on for a potential ninth season of Castle , which may come at a lower licensing fee and a shorter order . Then it was reported that ABC had until the end of the day Friday to make a decision , but they pushed the decision for later ( how , I do not know ) . Contrary to what some tell others , not every decision for every show has been made . Castle is one of those shows . The fact that they went through all the trouble to get Nathan Fillion back indicates to me that they plan on renewing it , but maybe they are also considering the fan backlash . This could be one of those situations where a show would be renewed based on past performance , but looking ahead to future performance comes as a bleak outcome . I assume they are weighing the fact that the show probably makes a lot of money for them against the fact that many have said they would boycott a ninth season . If it is indeed canceled though , that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is bad news for American Crime . Or it could be good news for The Catch . It 's impossible to know if you do n't work for ABC . Predictions would probably be WAY easier with a Castle decision out of the way , but I 'm sticking to the information I have available . All I know is Castle has two episodes left , so they have to make a decision soon . I 'm guessing if its a final season it wo n't rate as well as a series finale would have , since they 'll have virtually one week to promote it . <p> The Catch <p> What The Catch has going for it is a 16 episode order for Scandal . Another thing it has going for it is stable ratings . What it does n't have going for it is the fact that it loses a lot of its Scandal lead-in , and unlike American Crime last season , nobody is really talking about this one . In fact , it even managed to tick down to a 1.0 demo rating when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for a freshmen show that is n't making any backend money and wo n't for a while . Not to mention how absurdly high ABC is charging advertisers for a spot on the show , showing how massive a disappointment its ratings are ( then again , its lead-in is wildly underperforming as well ) . I 've moved it down to a likely cancellation because it does n't make any backend money and would make significantly less money in ad revenue next season . Plus , Shondaland has Still-Star Crossed looking decent for midseason , as well as comedy Toast being in the running . If Shonda Rhimes created the show herself , we may be having a different conversation . <p> Nashville <p> Nashville is a heavily serialized drama that has struggled in the ratings its entire lifespan , and is doing so now more than ever . It 's stable , but at a 0.8 A18-49 rating . It 's one of the lowest-rated shows on all of ABC at the moment . It loses a lot of its Blackish lead-in . The show does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are probably huge deal-breakers . This includes money funded from the state of Tennessee ( $8 million sounds like a lot but it really is n't ) , music sales ( though the music flies severely under the radar ) , tours , and syndication ( though its a serialized show , a genre that tends to fare very poorly in syndication ) . If ABC can bring it back at a low enough licensing fee , maybe they will . I 'm much less confident in its prospects now that ABC has new management , but I 'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say they 'll renew it , either to take a hit against awards/event season on Sundays in the winter , or for a summer run . But considering how bad its first-run ratings are , it does n't have a ton else going for it . <p> The Real O'Neals <p> I 've previously explained that ABC does n't need The Real O'Neals in order to expand their comedy lineup , if they even choose to do so . It 's easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Fresh Off The Boat lead-in . Like The Catch , it 's not making any backend revenue , and considering how it dropped like a rock after its premiere and failed to improve upon its lead-in , I do n't think there 's a ton of potential here . It 's not well-talked-about or highly-publicized like Fresh Off The Boat was last season , nor nearly as well-rated . Unless ABC opts to not bring back the Friday block yet still wants to schedule 8-10 comedies next fall , I do n't see this one surviving . Especially because reportedly ABC likes their comedy development . They 'd be better off rolling the dice on something new and/or getting Fresh Off The Boat to slightly better numbers . Now that 's a show with potential . <p> Agent Carter <p> It averaged a 0.79 A18-49 rating . It 's down 47% year-to-year . Its lead joined a new ABC pilot that seems like a lock to be picked up . They 're developing another Marvel spinoff . Need I say more ? This one is a confident cancelation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscripted , of ABC 's season , at a 0.63 A18-49 demo rating . Down a whopping 52% year-to-year , and even then many were questioning the renewal for a second season . Bye , Galavant . <p> The Muppets <p> The Muppets was definitely one of the biggest disappointments of the season . It premiered high like everyone expected ( 2.9 demo ) , and was supposed to be the fix to propping up Fresh Off The Boat without having to disrupt the successful Wednesday comedy block . But it dropped like a rock . Massive promotion and a retool could n't save it . But you know what could ? The Muppets is a brand for Disney , who owns ABC . If they continue on with bridge season and want an experimental-like comedy to replace Galavant , The Muppets is the obvious choice . It would probably perform even worse there , but how much would it matter if ABC/Disney is only concerned with international revenue and promoting the brand ? In my humble opinion I think they should kill it before it tarnishes the brand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short time we will know if this one lives on or not . <p> The Family The Family has shown a tiny bit of promise in rising each week ; well , if you count the three-digit unrounded numbers . It has been stuck in the 0.8 range for some time now , and unlike Nashville , does n't have much going for it outside of the first-run ratings part . With Secrets &amp; Lies already confirmed for the fall , I do n't think we 'll be seeing The Family back on the schedule . <p> What do you think ? What are your predictions ?

@@81116698 @2616698/ <p> As you read in my analysis of ABC , 2014-15 changed the powerplay among the four networks . Like ABC , CBS attempted to shake things up , but with less success . CBS Has regularly placed 2nd since NBC took 1st place with its Voice renaissance . Since 2000 , CBS has rested on its laurels as the 1st or 2nd place network in the demo . However , their time in the sun may be eclipsed if ABC rises and CBS continues to erode . The last season saw two deserved cancellations , the end to a diminished Two and a Half Men as well as the end of the Mentalist , which received a mercy swan song in a 7th season . <p> Commenters scoffed at CBS-owned The Millers receiving a 2nd season , as well as receiving a plum post-Big Bang Theory timeslot . I called bull-smoo when Millers rode on TBBT 's coattails to a failed Monday temporary move , only retaining a paltry 45-percent of TBBT 's massive demo . The Millers sported a strong cast , featuring screen veteran Beau Bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll save to mention the Sean Hayes curse , as even he can not be blamed for this clunker 's snuffing . From what I read in the comments section , few praised this boiler plate sitcom , which even some spectators stated made 2 Broke Girls seem sophisticated and original . When CBS su rprised us and pulled the plug mid-fall , we hailed good riddance like when Kate Gosselin ditched that asymmetric wedgie hairdo years ago . <p> Next , The McCarthys could only brag it was not as horrible as Millers . But then again , that is like claiming you 're the second highest rated drama on NBC . The show had some promise , but was deserted behind a faded sitcom to start . I praise Laurie Metcalf , as she can turn a pile of smoo into emeralds . But even she could n't carry this tenuous show with mostly cardboard caricatures . Tyler Ritter delivered like an angel , channeling all of his late father John Ritter 's endearing wit . And the Good Wife references were an excellent touch of synergy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show which loses a rerun 's lead-in at b est ? In spite of having a 30-minute sitcom hole for the remainder of the season , CBS made a wise choice . <p> Just as wise as retiring the long-lasting , embattled and unfunny Two and a Half Men . Blaming Charlie Sheen for why this once mighty powerhouse turned into a mess left behind like a fart at a party is so 2012 , so let 's skip that excuse . By season 10 , 2.5M clearly played itself out like Paris Hilton did in the 2000 's . CBS should have ended this series after S11 , but clearly needed to fill its six sitcom places . CBS is no longer the leader in sitcoms , as I hand that gold to ABC . But it is still a venerable player , and CBS sought to give this once solid show a farewell . I 'll hand it to CBS for giving its exiting shows proper treatment , but 2.5M disappointed , and the ratings showed . Was it really a loss not having Alan and Walden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CBS treated Mentalist viewers to a shortened season , albeit with little fanfare . As I stated above , I applaud CBS for its swan song treatment , but did they have to relegate it to afterthought scheduling over two timeslots ? It would have served CBS better to keep Mentalist on Sundays and move potentially cancelled CSI back to Wednesdays , but that is spilled milk from the syndication cow . Risky scheduling failed for CBS , and several shows suffered . CBS lost four shows mid season , and it will be a nail biter finding out which shows will be joining the deceased . <p> What are your thoughts on CBS 's failed scheduling moves ?

NBC was on top of the world last night , looking down on the other networks as they all failed to crack a 1.0 against the huge premieres of America 's Got Talent and World of Dance . AGT started with a 2.6 , steady year to year .

Less impressive was Downward Dog on ABC , which fell three tenths against the increased competition . Also working against Downward Dog was its decreased lead-out , which likely was also a contributing factor to the show 's drop .

@@81116706 @2616706/ <p> Every network has one or two super-creators . For example , ABC has Shonda Rhimes , who has given them Grey 's Anatomy , Private Practice , Scandal , How to Get Away with Murder , and The Catch . Her shows used to be automatic pick-ups , and although she is still a super-creator , her popularity is n't what it was even a year ago . While President Channing Dungey mentioned she 'd take what Shonda would give her , the second season of The Catch did even worse than the first , and got canceled . Her newest entry , Still Star-Crossed , is going to air over the summer and does n't have a ton of promotion . While it is airing after The Bachelorette , that far from means automatic hit . She does have two shows on next season 's schedule ; upcoming law drama For The People , as well as a Chicago Fire-like Grey 's Anatomy spinoff .

Goldberg gave ABC their midseason comedy entry Imaginary Mary , which was fractional throughout its run and promptly got canceled . He also had in development a Goldbergs spin-off named Schooled , which was to take place in the 90s starring a tertiary character . It was n't ordered , and Adam Goldberg will have to stay content with The Goldbergs , when he could have had three shows on the air . Kenya Barris had an even worse last couple weeks . His drama pilot Unit Zero was officially passed on , and prized possession Blackish will air on Tuesday now instead of the comfy post-Modern Family time slot that it 's known for its three years on the air . Furthermore , while some considered political comedy Libby &amp; Malcolm to be a frontrunner of the pilot season , ultimately it was n't ordered to series . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackish spin-off would receive a series order .

He 's been cranking out a new show every season , with Justice being the fourth show in the franchise . While its ratings were nothing to brag about on Sundays , they also seemingly were n't terrible . Regardless , it is in a unique situation where a week after NBC released their fall schedule , and it was just recently canceled . Meanwhile , four post-Voice occupants--dramas Taken and Timeless as well as comedies Trial &amp; Error and Great News--have been renewed with lower ratings . Deadline mentioned that Chicago Fire and PD have n't sold into syndication , which has gotten NBC to rethink the whole Chicago plan and maybe downsize .

Furthermore , Dick Wolf was planning on making a reality show called Law &amp; Order : You the Jury , but between both the existence and failure of FOX 's series You the Jury , the consensus is that it probably wo n't ever make it to air . Wolf can take solace in the fact that his anthology series Law &amp; Order : True Crime will be airing after This is Us , though the shows do not seem to be thematically compatible and it is n't an automatic success . While Dick Wolf is doing better than the days where NBC canceled both Law &amp; Order and new spin-off Law &amp; Order : LA , it seems that a Chicago show is no longer an automatic renewal . It also shows that four shows of one franchise on the air at the same time may be too much , and Dick Wolf fans would rather see Law &amp; Order take on the theme of law than a Chicago show . <p> Over on FOX , they were very close to having a comedy super-creator with Phil Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lego Movie .

Most of Son of Zorn 's run was masked by boosts from football overrun , but without it the show went lower than any other FOX comedy . Making History , meanwhile , premiered low and went lower . FOX rightfully canceled both shows , with The Last Man On Earth hanging in there for a 4th season , though it 's no longer a breakout hit . At this point , if we 're looking at super-creators at FOX , we should look at the slight resurgence of Seth MacFarlane .

Also , there is Greg Berlanti , who has given The CW Arrow , The Flash , Supergirl , Legends of Tomorrow , Riverdale , and the upcoming Black Lightning .

What started as an aggressive , compelling arc lost its punch when the ever-grating , putrid meth-head characters , Angie ( Julie Lake ) and Leanne ( Emma Myles ) stole the gun and downgraded the poignant uprising to an asinine talent show among the guards . Lake and Myles are wonderful performers , yet their alter egos have escalated beyond the guards ' villainy , sinking to an all-time low turning a vulnerable black inmate 's face white and turning her into a clown . Every time something terrible happens every season , these two parasites antagonize every plot from Nichols ' wrongful punishment in maximum security to slurring insults . Their vile actions almost resulted in a cliche prison fire , a twist the writers quickly extinguished as it would have jumped the shark of outlandish . <p> The problem with the pace and tone was the danger came and went like a guest checking in and out of a hotel . Two characters died , yet no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been orchestrated as the perfect Greek tragedy became as mild as an ABC Afterschool Special telling kiddies not to make bad choices . The season was peppered with preachy tones of Norma Rae and social justice , diverting a tragic disaster to a soapbox piece for social issues . 1995 's Up Close and Personal , the Robert Redford/Michelle Pfeiffer movie about an upcoming TV reporter , held more tension when Pfeiffer 's Tally is trapped inside a prison riot during an exclusive . The 15-minutes of tension packed more threat , and ended in tragedy as reforming prisoner/interviewee Fernando ( Raymond Cruz ) perished in the riot . It ripped open the scabs on society as prison bureaucracy 's budget cuts led to the uprising and tragedy . OITNB failed to capture this escalating tension , perhaps because it had to populate 700 minutes of material vs . Up Close and Personal 's impacting 15 minutes . <p> Still , the season delivered a landmine of greatness . Episodes 9 and 10 delivered two frightful evenings resembling a mystery/horror film , followed by an intense crime thriller at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Henke ) . In spite of the flashbacks being lackluster this season , the historic nods to the Cold War via Frieda ( early 50 's bomb scares ) and Red ( 1977 , showing the black market of communism leading to her escape ) . There is still a story to tell , albeit the cast will need to be reorganized andSPOILERS BELOWWHAT WORKED -- Save for the extreme sadism exhibited , the vengeance against the guards exhibited some humor initially . Luschek 's capture is in character , having thrown a pair of scissors at a converging inmate 's head . Luschek is as boyish as Bayley Baxter ( Alan Aisenberg ) , yet more of a scoundrel viewers enjoyed watching being made a fool of . Non-inmates rose to character development and prominence as they endured the same dehumanizing treatment inflicted on the ladies . The first to be expanded upon was Thomas Humphreys ( Michael Torpey ) , who received welcome doses of the same sadism he exhibited on so many . After a feeble attempt to get Daya to not shoot him by speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet in his upper-inner thigh , hitting an artery . After being critically wounded , Maritza ( Diane Guerrero ) savagely kicked him , joined by several . Retract that word , as Humphreys forced her to eat a live mouse at gunpoint during the last season.Out of the heightened shooting , Sophia Burset ( Laverne Cox ) reached a pinnacle of need as her backstory as an EMT became a valued resource during the disaster . She saved Humphreys , who faced another trying look at his soul as he was strapped to a bed juxtaposed between Maureen Kukudio ( Emily Althaus ) and Suzanne " Crazy Eyes " Warren ( Uzo Adubo ) . After attempting to befriend the very women he ruined , he suffered a massive stroke , as Kukudio blew an air bubble into his IV line . This led to a slow , agonizing , degrading death , suitable for such a vile stain on this show 's legacy.The black ladies of Litchfield shined , exhibiting a welcome lack of violence . This hook left enough space to explore the backstory of Janae Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the show 's 5 seasons . The inner-city tale was trite and weak , paling compared to Tasha " Taystee " Jefferson 's layered , tragic tale . Taystee became the center of the show this season , having rightfully usurped the role from the hot-to-not love story of Piper ( Taylor Schilling ) and Alex ( Laura Prepon ) . While her grammar needs a little polish , she exhibited the greatest critical thinking and processing among the masses , making her ideal to lead negotiations and keep this outlandish tale grounded . Such measures included releasing narcissist Judy King ( Blair Brown ) , declaring she was not a hostage and not welcome in their prison . <p> Amanda Stephen shined as Allison Abdullah , receiving the proper time to explore her backstory as she debuted as a side-player the previous season . Her backstory was disappointing , yet her front story kept viewers captivated as she made the perfect compliment to Taystee in assembling the demands with an educated , tactical approach . Adrienne C. Moore completed the trifecta of leading , rational ladies with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes . Previously a stereotypical sidekick spitting out wisecracks , Black Cindy became the wise trio 's bodyguard against the chaos.Selenis Leyva continued to take the " den mother " role of Gloria Mendoza from slop to sugar in a two-fold tale . Initially the voice of reason who helped save the sadistic Humphreys , Gloria towed the line of risk by stealing " the gun " which somehow kept the inmates in charge of a large prison ( again , suspend disbelief to keep this tale going ) . All changed mid-season as Gloria received a devastating phone call revealing her son was in critical condition . Realizing her only chance at furlough was to release the guards , she plotted over two episodes to free the guards by locking them all in the outhouses . Her efforts are voided as she is taken prisoner within the prisoners , yet received a welcome shine of luck when her son survived his critical injuries . <p> Dale Soules has always provided side fodder as survivalist Freida Berlin . Her spotlight derived at the proper time of chaos , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 's . Her backstory as a pre-teen in post-Korean Cold War stood as the greatest initial flashback to deepen a character this season , tugging at our heartstrings as it appeared as though she was abandoned in the woods by her impoverished father ( a sadly common practice during the Great Depression ) . However , this was her father preparing her for " The Apocalypse , " testing her survival skills as she made her way back to her bunker-style apartment . Viewers learned Frieda has spent 40+ years behind bars , explained as she revealed the story of the abandoned swimming pool which none of the regimes bothered to fill in . Frieda eyed the masses and gave select invitations to seasoned prisoners and providing asylum for the calm inmates . <p> Frieda 's bunker became a welcome and remote departure from the bleak surroundings viewers have known during the show 's 5-year run . Suspending disbelief ( as a SWAT team would have overtaken the yard as it was merely secured by a barbed-wire fence ) , the yard also made a nice change of scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subculture and lay around outside . Outlandish , yes , but it provided another non-violent , calm departure from the viciousness inside the building . Beauty also became a balancing force , as social warrior Piper decided to round up the prisoners with art projects to create a positive movement . It inspired a new library-inspired tribute to Poussey , as well as allowing in-limbo Daya to express herself with art in the yard.Beauty queens Flaca ( Jackie Cruz ) and Maritza ( Diane Guerrero ) used the opportunity to exhibit their style and skills , delivering regular blog videos to the public to depict prison-style . After the art initiative launched , the girls delivered their own brand -- makeovers . Their first target project was the unkempt Blanca , who wowed her peers . Viewers echoed Blanca 's sarcasm as she said " All they did was comb my hair and give me two eyebrows . " Ha ! Next , the weathered Nicky ( Natasha Lyonne ) received similar treatment as she sported a new hairdo which Alex comically described as " Heroin Barbie . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with Piper . These twists are not what highlighted the show , but rather led to a future for the beauty queens , who realized how much they loved blogging . That is rehabilitation as both felons have foreshadowed potential careers outside the prison walls . <p> The same rehabilitation can not be stated for Judy King ( Blair Brown ) , who never redeemed her narcissistic soul in spite of a disaster breaking out around her . Disasters such as prison riots provide the perfect opportunity for people to set their preferences and differences aside to survive . Judy was given a golden opportunity to champion for the ladies as a frail Soso ( Kimiko Glenn ) begged her to save Poussey 's library . Judy could care less and fled , leading to nearly every book being burned . The savagery exhibited this season was appalling , yet viewers could not help but cheer when Yoga Jones ( Constance Schulman ) tackled and captured her , stringing her to a cross and handing her over to the general population to be auctioned off for goods . Laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-pack in vengeance as Judy was auctioned as prison slavery . Though it appeared Judy received mercy when she was released , she capitalized on the situation by going on live TV and betraying her former inmates . Lest hope Judy King stays away from insider trading , as no one wants her back on our screens again.Carrie " Big Boo " Black ( Lea DeLaria ) and Tiffany " Pennsatucket " Doggett ( the ever bristly Taryn Manning ) experienced a stronger presence where laughter and anguish were needed . During the first three episodes , the two ran the commissary like two backwoods yokels running a country store . After the prison brass is disrobed in shame , Boo grabs Caputo 's suit . which the white trash dwellers dubbed her " CaBOOto " . " Why thank you ! " sniped back Boo , who fit the suit perfectly . Boo of course stirred the pot , and shined as the MC of Litchfield Idol . She even experienced a brief reprieve of love , as rogue prisoner " Amelia Von Barlow " ( Beth Dover ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she fell for her protector . Boo and Pennsatucky sadly endured abuse this season , as Pennsatucky set her beau Charlie Coates ( Michael McNenemin ) free , earning her the vicious wrath of prison scourges Angie and Leanne . The level of disgust Pennsatucky earned being locked in " The Poo " ( the prisoners ' version of " The Shoe " in the stank outhouses ) is indescribable . But she finally felt the brutal bullying she inflicted on Alex and Piper in season one . It made a sound departure as Pennsatucky 's final moments of the season featured her relaxing in the DO 's cottage . Suspended disbelief , yet again , but viewers welcome a few moments of peace . Boo 's violent kidnapping in the horror/mystery arc was disgusting , yet kept her entwined in the action after being taken captive by sociopath Piscatella . Even more heartbreaking , her newfound love was a fraud , and Boo fed her to the general population in a welcome dose of vengeance.The horror/mystery episode was well executed . It began with the return of uber-villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening act of a slasher flick . Next came the disappearances of Nicky and Boo , heightening the terror and danger . And finally , paying great tribute to horror cliches , Alex and Piper were assaulted in a shower scene . Laced between , Black Cindy received " ominous " phone calls asking " have you checked the children ? " Her response ? " How about you check yourself ! " She was then spooked by beauty girls Flaca and Maritza at the end of the corridor resembling the twins in The Shining . " Oh hell no ! " she appropriately snapped . Most frightening of all , Red experienced the horror while coming down off of a Speed high , revealing a stronger flashback to Russia in 1977 when her friend involved in a bluejeans smuggling scheme went missing . All great homages to Friday the 13th , When a Stranger Calls and The Shining . <p> The final praise is a prickly love/hate relationship with the villainy of Piscatella . A masochist and sociopath , he was one of OITNB 's most complex villains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in episode 10 when he lectured the ladies about not respecting violence . After unceremoniously being dismissed in Season 4 , he was called back to the fold as he was the only freed prison employee . Galina " Red " Reznikov ( Kate Mulgrew ) had a less-than-stellar end product this season , yet Red and Pish 's jarring adversarial game of cat and mouse left another tense threat . Red initially sought to smear and defame Pish , posting flamboyant pictures of him all over the prison walls and posting to the internet.The spoils and overdose of sadism were not in vain , as the ladies finally had a video of the system 's brutality as he snapped Alex 's arm . After the video went viral , the public finally took the ladies ' cause serious . Though his backstory fit the fizzled category this season , it demonstrated where much of Pish 's damaged psyche emerged as he murdered the man who savagely violated his lover . Pish 's reign of terror ended with a bullet in the forehead , ending one of the greatest villains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extreme levels of sadism ran rampant , making even the strongest cringe and most will not be displayed in imagery . The sleaze factor escalated this season with higher levels of gross humor , excessive bondage in every episode , and extreme dehumanizing behaviors peppered every 10 minutes of an episode . Dehumanizing is a large issue in the prison system , and OITNB depicted it brutally accurate to the point it deserves criticism . Menstruation blood , graphic cavity searches , scalping a lady 's hair with a knife , characters soiling themselves and prisoners toying with their hostages ' arousal heightened levels of disgust to the point that images of such will not be displayed in this review.Blanca Flores ( Laura Gomez ) became washed out in a parade of silliness which made even Suzanne " Crazy Eyes " Warren seem lucid . Blanca unveiled a rich layer as her spite led to her protest , leading to the events which launched season 5 . So how did the latest activist spend the season ? High on speed and dulling the performance of Red to beige nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed fitting , right down to their color-hued names . The problem is Gomez and Kate Mulgrew lacked chemistry with each other despite resonating so well with others . Red jumping up and down on couches was out of character , even if she was on speed . The problem with Blanca 's material this season is it undid the scarlet beauty Red had carried in her character.The Red we knew from season 2 would never knowingly bait trouble into her home , even for the fruitful product of overthrowing a villain . These actions placed her girls in danger , out of character for a cold-war refugee . Blanca paying homage to Home Alone was meant as comic relief , yet voided itself to a puerile degree . Speaking of immature , Lorna ( Yael Stone ) became a uneven mess for even an unhinged woman . She 's pining for Nicky . Wait , she 's pregnant . Wait , she 's a makeshift doctor . Wait , she 's a mess . ENOUGH ! Chemical imbalance is in the mind of the beholder , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two mosquitoes named Angie and Leanne , who sucked the joy and blood out of the scenes they touched , like true meth-heads . They followed Pennsatucky in persecuting Alex and Piper in Season 1 . They led to Nichols ' imprisonment in maximum security . Every time something negative or contrived occurs , Angie and Leanne are always involved . The problem with their haughty wrath is it is fueled by stupidity . Calling these two ignorant does not suffice , as it would imply they can be redeemed . The ladies exhibit the same sadistic nature as the guards , as they painted black Suzanne 's face like a clown , and attempted to cut off CO Stratman 's ( Evan Arthur Hall ) finger to replace Leanne 's missing digit to complete her hateful hoof . Either the writers need to give these poisonous , putrid characters a comeuppance or get rid of them.Jessica Pimental smashed the alarms as aggressive leader Maria Ruiz in Season 4 . The material she played during the first half of the season was compelling , as Maria softened some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , she voided out her powerful delivery by impulsively handing over he hostages and nullifying the prisoners ' grounds . Viewers were supposed to feel some sense of reward or joy when she held her baby for five minutes . The problem is we could care less about yet another selfish inmate throwing her fellow prisoner 's needs out the window with little thought . Maria 's choice lacked the dramatic punch and buildup Gloria 's tough betrayal exhibited , and perhaps worsened the plight of the inmates.Beth Dover 's Linda Ferguson proved a lost opportunity as a hostage blending in with the general population , thanks to a less than flattering flashback depicting her opportunistic nature . OITNB has dozens of characters worthy of that space wasted on Linda . The rogue inmate tale could have opened the door on may plots , including ongoing advocacy having experienced the injustice herself . Instead , she was thrust into one cartoonish plot farce after another , including a fauxmance with butch Boo . How are viewers supposed to care about a character whose role in her sorority sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing her under the bus ? Given the large ensemble , balance is a difficult task to undertake , even in a compressed timeline . Michael Harney was absent from all episodes of the seasons as CO Sam Healy has been committed to a psychiatric facility . This was a poor decision by the writers , as his mental break would have provided the prickling dramatic effect if he was detained with the hostages . Regardless of choices in displaying characters , Harney 's name should have been omitted from the opening credits . Elizabeth Rodriguez provided a limited performance as recently-released Aleida Diaz , and the writers dropped the ball , centering her on Daya 's forgettable floundering through the season . With the array of reporters surrounding the prison , the writers missed a golden opportunity to have Aleida advocating about the conditions in the crowd.Alan Aisenberg delivered a tragic performance as Baxter Bayley , yet should have been left out of the season for dramatic impact in absence . Finding out Baxter has been bumbling around attempting suicide with non-toxic green dye and getting himself arrested produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backstory had the character returned in the future . The two contract spaces offered to Harney and Rodriguez would have better suited Diane Guerrero , Amanda Stephen or Brad William Henke , all of which were present driving plots this season.Given the ominous ending which it is implied no one will return to Litchfield next season , some cast paring is necessary . <p> STANDOUT PERFORMANCES -- Critical acclaim does not discriminate or take on the form of equal representation , as nearly every Black American cast member stood out with critical acclaim . The previously mentioned performances of Brooks , Moore and Stephen have been highlighted , and Uzo Aduba ( Suzanne " Crazy Eyes " Warren ) and Laverne Cox ( Sophia Burset ) deserve to join their elite league as the power hitters in season 5 . Aduba gave an uneasy , unsettling performance as mentally fragile Suzanne who was given the worst threads among the blinged out prisoners . Crazy Eyes endured the horrors of not being able to process what was going on around her , still viewing the world as a 6-year old would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazed , tortured and treated as an animal.After the same inhuman treatment during Seasons 3-4 , Sophia Burset ( Laverne Cox ) only graced the first half of the season , yet experienced welcome character development as her medical expertise was utilized . Realizing Sister Mary Ingalls ( Beth Fowler ) was nowhere to be found , Sophia made the ( not-so ) difficult decision to go to max to find the woman who saved her , only to sigh relief as she realized the nun flew away from the hellhole due to compassionate release.Other demographics who shined including Brad William Henke 's sadistic run as Pish , and Matt Peters ' immature delivery as bumbling CO Joel Luschek . Rosal Colon played stereotypical jailer Ouija for the run of the season , yet had us in stitches as she impersonated all of the inmates , including Red 's impeccable Russian accent . Her comic delivery was fractional compared to DeLaria 's Big Boo , yet made a welcome dose of joy in the savage tone.TIME TO GO -- The list of characters who need to exit the series expands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Sandow 's Joe Caputo has been a welcome delivery in the male demographic , yet storylines dictate Caputo should lose his job . He lost several prisoners , experienced a massive walkout of skilled CO 's , hired poorly vetted replacements , botched the investigation into Poussey 's accidental death and now the riot which claimed two CO 's lives . If Caputo is kept running the zoo , the show will drift further into disbelief . The riot story showed little impact in the loss of Sam Healy ( Michael Harney ) , perhaps dictating the show can survive without the character.Previous contract entries into this list included the privileged inmate Piper Chapman ( Taylor Schilling ) , unhinged Lorna ( Yael Stone ) , caustically floating Daya ( Dascha Polanco ) and her recently-released mother Aleida ( Elizabeth Rodriguez ) . It was revealed Piper has three months to serve out , foreshadowing the character will exit in two seasons . Though Piper 's role delivered pleasant results this season , her story purpose is limited . Plot developments appeared to have pushed Rodriguez and Polanco off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has a wrinkle in her tale as she is pregnant . If OITNB plans on keeping Lorna , deeper exploration into her background and growth are needed.Rest assured Blair Brown will likely not return as Judy King , yet have the unpleasantness of Angie and Leanne stirring up trouble via Julie Lake and Emma Myles . While both lovely performers , their exit would be a sigh of relief . OITNB needs to figure out where to center when it returns next season , as it will have another bloated mess on our screens if they do not retool the cast.WHAT 'S NEXT -- The fate of Litchfield Prison was left ambiguous as prisoners were loaded onto various buses and divided . 10 inmates stood in the makeshift bunker , holding hands and anticipating what will happen when the door breaks down , similar to doomsday . The direction for the next season has yet to be declared , and perhaps some reveals and PR may get viewers invested again as there are two more seasons ordered by Netflix.

It feels like a show which should have followed OUAT 's fantasy theme , as well as being family fare . What respectable parent would allow their children to stay up till 10pm ? It will be another DVR choice show , with ABC missing the mark with parents of young children tuning in live . This timeslot would have better suited for Castle or Nashville , as adults like these shows and may have potentially stayed awake to view .

It 's two strong reality platforms -- Dancing With the Stars and The Bachelor/Bachelorette clearly have a niche and perform well enough to keep ABC out of 4th for the evening .

Many weeks , they have even performed in 2nd place above CBS , which previously dominated the evening with powerhouse sitcoms . I 'm not a reality TV fan , but have considerable respect for these two franchises as they perform with a touch of class , remain consistent where they need to and even spice in a little variety when the waters grow stagnant . <p> Where I feel ABC missed its mark is Castle is aging and losing viewers .

With three hours free , ABC took risks and completely revamped the night during the 2013-14 season , with mediocre success . Agents of Shield started as a runaway hit and cooled to a middling niche performer by its sophomore season . Goldbergs performed mediocre as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series low bottoming at a 1.3 . And sigh , Trophy Wife 's poor scheduling killed its potential , ending too soon . And the 10pmslot featured an endless barrage of forgettable failed series . <p> Where I was critical of ABC was killing Body of Proof , which would have provided the perfect bridge on launching 2 hours of entertainm ent . But that autopsy was performed two years ago , so we 'll move on . The 2014-15 season proved just as problematic , as two forgettable sitcoms drowned at levels even appalling for Fridays . Shield once again performed mediocre , albeit it cooled its ratings losses to create a bridge for the troubled night . And Forever remained in an anemic , yet stable rating , averaging a 1.1 for the entire season . ABC made four good decisions on this night during the 2014-15 were giving Forever a full season , bringing in bridge series Agent Carter to cover undesirable timelsots during Shield 's breaks , taking a risk by scheduling Fresh Off The Boat in the doomed 8pm place and following with reality/variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilize the hemorrhages . FOTB h as gained critical acclaim , and performing on-par with Goldbergs during the previous season . With two failed sitcoms , Repeat After Me topped their performances , and I 'd welcome a return in another tenuous timeslot next season . Forever 's ratings were paltry , yet it had a loyal niche following to the end . It had the same stability factor Body did , and perhaps some fans may check out what replaced it . I was pleased with the choices ABC made , as the Muppets is a wise choice for the problematic 30-minute slots pared with FOTB . There is nothing else like the Muppets on this evening , and perhaps young parents will tune in with their children , a la Once Upon a Time . I 'll reserve my judgment on Quantico until the season resumes . And we 'll see how The Real O'Neal 's debuts , but Martha Plimpton 's versatile presence will afford my attention for at least the initial showing . She is a Tour de Force , and I 'd follow her anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an d will reel my DVR to sample this night as I only watch FOTB on Tuesdays . <p> Playing It Safe With Willful Wednesdays <p> Many questioned if ABC should move its successful sitcoms to shake things up on the schedule . But why fix what is n't broken ! ? With two of its heavyweights , Middle and Modern Family , aging into their 7th seasons , they could experience erosion common to longstanding shows . MF took a dip , and Middle saw some showings drop as low as a 1.7 during the last season . If Middle drops to a 1.3 , ABC may move the show and allow Goldbergs to anchor the 8pm slot in favor of a new helping at 8:30. blackish 's performance proved it does n't just ride on MF 's coattails , rising when its lead in fell and vice versa . Blackish will likely maintain or grow in its slot , and I am pleased . I record Goldbergs and blackish and eagerly await their returns after this season 's closing acts . <p> With the powerhouse success of ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights rest ! ? Two consistent seasons of scheduling will perhaps enhance viewership , similar to the 2004-06 season which Sundays were dominated by the Desperate Housewives/Greys Anatomy power showing . I still believe Nashville may have been a good option to move , but perhaps ABC may subconsciously be hinting at wanting a 5th season from Nashville . We 'll see how it p erforms in the fall , or if CBS fades and allows Nashville to retain 2nd for its timeslot . Secrets and Lies will either be made or broken in this timeslot , which in my view fits this timeslot better than Sundays . Secrets and Lies is dark by nature , and will be offset by the comedies , which means a nice balance . <p> Thinking Thursdays Are Landmark <p> TGIT turned ABC 's industrial wasteland into an urban hub for young professionals . Falls will remain in tact , and Shonda will reign as the queen again . ABC dropped the ball with American Crime this spring , and The Catch wi ll be better suited to bridge the mid season with Shonda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shonda 's talents across the board , and The Catch may not be surefire . But that is a risk all networks take with the schedule . <p> I could potentially see Greys eroding without Patrick Dempsey as the show opens S12 , but then again , Shonda has reinvented this show so many times it could still survive as a middling drama . With CBS 's Big Bang now clearly declining , Greys is still going to take 2nd place , unless Heroes somehow becomes a runaway hit . I 'll laugh incessantly if Fox somehow claims 2nd ( or even 3rd ) place during this timeslot . Overall , ABC knew this was a good night to proudly play it safe . <p> Why Wiggle Founding Fridays ? <p> The only change in store for Fridays is the graveyard which used to be occupied by Cristela . I 'm not particularly excited about Dr. Ken , and that is all I will say . However , I will be keeping an eye out for Uncle Buck . I hope it fares better than the failed 1990-91 attempt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how the show 's concept is received with a new demographic telling the story . Some nasty commentators chose to sling acid about Shonda Rhimes ' desires to eliminate the color lines so some roles could be told from any demographic , creating roles which are told by character instead o f race . This is a prime example , as Uncle Buck can be told with Russians , Asians , Blacks , Hispanics , etc .... <p> ABC predominantly shares success with CBS on Fridays , and I do n't see any shifts in the network 's rankings next season . NBC may present some competition shifting sitcoms to Fridays , but the NBC programming killer seems to have an easy time poking holes through sitcoms in recent seasons . Overall , ABC still stands strong as a junior landmark night .

I know it is a long time before the Dirty Dancing ABC Remake comes out but I ca n't help but feel that they are providing early promotion for it . But still , this was a great homage for not one , but two famous dance movies . <p> S3E17 " The Dirty Dancing Dance " <p> After watching Dirty Dancing 17 times , Beverly gives Erica the idea to throw a Dirty Dancing Dance at her school which Barry refused because he thought Footloose was better . But the principal refuses because he wanted a 50 's themed dance . Erica tries to convince the principal but it is Beverly who gets him to agree to the idea .

The plan goes well until Erica tries to do the famous jump from the movie with Jeff but he fails to catch her and she crashes into a table . Beverly and Murray come to pick her up and scold her but Beverly realises that just like in the movie , she was being the controlling mother .

@@81116718 @2616718/ <h> NCIS : Los Angeles S08E07 Review <p> NCIS Los Angeles is an office that specialises in undercover work and it 's been a while since any of the team have been on assignment . Recent cases have focused on the investigative side but watching various team members adopt different personas differentiates this show from the mothership . Episode writer Frank Military ( Spoils of War , Rage , The Seventh Child , An Unlocked Mind ) has set the bar high for dark , character driven episodes and once again , he does not disappoint . NSA Analyst Gary Dill has gone missing whilst investigating an ISIS cell who 's using a Mexican drug cartel to infiltrate the US . Using information from two fellow analysts , the team believe Dill may have been committed to a mental health hospital under the name of Noah Leipzig , and Callen is sent undercover as a fellow patient to make contact . <p> In the usual style of Military , the case itself is reasonably straight forward . The simple twist is that there is no ISIS cell and NSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is chasing down her associates and feeding them to the sharks . Despite some amusing scenes the tone of the episode is set in the pre-credit opening sequence , where a man is found dead inside a shark 's stomach , and Granger is undergoing an MRI scan . For the last season or so , Granger has looked a little i 'll and has slurred and mumbled his words somewhat but with no prior warning of any ailment it comes as a shock to see him having the scan . True to the shows format , post opening credits the seriousness of the previous scenes are juxtaposed with the lightheartedness of the bullpen , with Sam playing a " would you rather " game with Callen ( who only finds it fun when he realises he can beat Sam ) . The fun is quickly dampened as Deeks fails to join in , barely knowing what day it is , having slept at the hospital again . This pattern of seriousness and lightheartedness continues throughout . <p> It was fun to watch Sam , Callen and Deeks argue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally Deeks volunteers , stating that neither Sam or Callen can pull off crazy , but Granger vetoes the idea immediately . Callen volunteers Sam who counters by stating that Callen is a recluse who ca n't form long term social attachments , quickly followed by Granger agreeing that he does have issues . That Callen looks puzzled , just adds to the hilarity of Granger 's brazen comment and admittance that he 's seen Callen 's psych evaluations ! Deeks , Nell and Eric jump on the bandwagon , suggesting he could be backstopped as a double murderer with a history of killing animals . <p> Callen 's past has caused him to be ' damaged goods ' , and early season seven demonstrated how this still affects him , going rogue to desperately discover Arkady 's whereabouts and later spectacularly failing the HL7 psych eval test for the wrong reasons . It would have been interesting to see Callen 's stint as a sectioned patient push further in to the psyche of the troubled agent , yet instead there is a glimpse into how calculating he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks the culprit 's pocket and plants it in Dill 's room . Callen calls to the mobile , causing Dill to be accused of theft and physically threatened and having orchestrated the attack , he then wants to take on three men at once . Callen later attends a group therapy session , calmly observing before voicing his own opinion of the shrink , cleverly analysing and slowly humiliating him in front of the group . In past episodes Callen has frequently played Dr Nate Getz , beating him at his own game . So it is no wonder Granger recognises Callen has issues , particularly if this type of behaviour is reported in his NCIS psych evals . <p> Elsewhere Deeks has his own therapy session with Sam and Hetty , both of whom do a better job than the one in the mental hospital . Deeks is not fine and neither is Kensi who is now in physical therapy and pushing herself too hard in the belief she can recover quickly , despite warnings . When left on her own outside , her determination and optimism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by herself for a few seconds . The result devastates her . Again Deeks is on the receiving end , even though he can still make her smile . Believing the moment is right , he proposes but Kensi does not want to be a burden to him . She also wants the proposal to be memorable for the right reasons . Kensi may be hedging her bets - remember she has abandonment issues and subconsciously she may be afraid that Deeks will also leave . The strength and reassurance Deeks has received from Hetty and Granger means he stays by her side despite the rejections , and he now helps her return to her bed . Kensi is broken , more so now than she ever was after her torture in Spoils of War . <p> There is a little action amongst all the drama particularly when Callen assumes the identity of Dill 's alias Noah Leipzig so the cartel thugs take him instead . Callen is shipped to the ocean in a box and then thrown to the sharks as an interrogation technique . The madness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Callen makes fat jokes and likens to the cartel boss to Chevy Chase - even when he is in the water - although he is genuinely scared when the sharks begin to approach , and Callen is rarely scared . Sam was always going to be in time to save Callen 's life and the underwater scenes of Sam passing Callen his breathing apparatus and handing him a gun are brief but chaotically dramatic . <p> There are three sets of closing scenes to ' Crazy Train ' . Firstly Callen returns to the metal hospital to release Dill and his final encounters with his new BFFs are endearing and amusing . The next is Deeks ' failed proposal to Kensi and lastly is a shocking conversation between Hetty and Granger about the latter 's health . Granger advises the doctors are still be investigating but he knows his time is coming . Granger was in Vietnam and the reference to Agent Orange was the nickname given to one of the herbicides used during the war , to which many men were exposed . He has been a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has developed in to a tough-love father figure for the team . There have been no rumours that Granger is leaving , however is this the beginning of the end for the Assistant Director ? <p> Although there 's nothing radically different about this episode , it is one of the best of season eight so far . It follows the established formulaic structure and with a fair amount of predictability . Kensi was always going to reject Deeks ' proposal , Callen would swap hospital I 'd bands with Leipzig and Sam would save him from the sharks , but this does n't matter . All of Frank Military 's episodes are strong as he utilises simple stories that are complex in terms of character . NCIS Los Angeles is a character driven show that develops individuals and explores their histories and their present lives . It is not a serious drama like Homeland , so Callen will never really be sectioned and subjected to drug therapy - or probably any kind of therapy ( no matter how much he needs it ) - however it 's always fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . <p> PS - Sam 's SEAL pal Tom Olsen was played by none other than David Olsen , husband of Daniela Ruah ( Kensi ) and brother of Eric Christian Olsen ( Deeks )

@@81116731 @2616731/ <h> How a Lead-in Can ( and Ca n't ) Affect a Show <p> Note : There are many links embedded in the text , keep your mouse on the words so you 'll be able to find them . <p> While there are many exceptions , networks tend to air new programs after established hits in order to help them gain an audience . Historically , this generally works if the two shows are compatible but it 's not always the case . <p> In the 2016-17 television season , CBS 's The Great Indoors and FOX 's Son of Zorn could only retain around 50-60% of their seemingly compatible lead-ins , those lead-ins were The Big Bang Theory and The Simpsons respectively . It 's not a surprise that both shows were canceled earlier this month . Despite poor retention , both comedies were some of the highest-rated series to be axed because of how strong their lead-ins were . The Great Indoors averaged a 1.4 in the 18-49 ratings while Son of Zorn managed a 1.3 , both against a 1.2 league average . The true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lead-in declined . For Son of Zorn , the series collapsed to just a 0.6 in the 18-49 demo for its penultimate episode . Sure , its Simpsons lead-in also declined , but the latter still had a digestible 1.0 while Zorn could barely retain 60% of it . That 0.6 rating was less than half of what the comedy was averaging in the fall . While The Simpsons is also boosted by a lead-in ( that being football ) , there 's a difference between Zorn and Simpsons . The yellow family can still pull respectable ratings without being inflated while Zorn simply can not . Similarly , The Great Indoors crashed when CBS decided to air the final two episodes on Monday after Superior Donuts instead of Thursday after The Big Bang Theory . No one was expected The Great Indoors to do well , but it managed a meager 0.7 for its finale and lost two-tenths from its Superior Donuts lead-in . To put things into perspective , that 0.7 was 42% below its Thursday low . Things got even more ridiculous as The Great Indoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already being canceled ) and improved 43% from its finale to a 1.0 . This made it even more clear just how much the series needed a massive Big Bang Theory lead-in to do well . Overall , both Son of Zorn and The Great Indoors are textbook cases of shows that do n't have a stable audience and rely on their lead-ins to inflate ( or deflate ) them . <p> On the other hand , ABC 's Speechless and American Housewife are positive examples of shows affected by their lead-ins . Both retained the bulk of their lead-ins , The Goldbergs and The Middle respectively , and both were renewed for second seasons . The latter was even rewarded with a timeslot upgrade by getting to air after a stronger Modern Family . While both shows performed well , they still grew and fell with their lead-ins . From February 8th to May 17th , Speechless lost two-tenths from its Goldbergs lead-in for every airing . When its Goldbergs lead-in was at a robust 1.8 , it was at a strong 1.6 , and when The Goldbergs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.1 . This is n't to say that Speechless is a flop like the examples listed above . The series holds a good amount of its lead-in and has even shown that it can hold its own without The Goldbergs . Still , it 's clear that the series soars with its lead-in , but also falls with it . American Housewife is a similar , but slightly better case . On average , the series has lost just a tenth from its Middle lead-in and has even grown from it at times . The finale tied its Middle lead-in , so it 's understandable why it 's getting a timeslot upgrade and not Speechless . While American Housewife has done a good bit better than Speechless , the series still rises and falls as The Middle does , so it 's clear that it is n't lead-in independent . Nevertheless , both shows are strong performers for the network and will someday likely be lead-ins themselves.Shows NOT Affected By Their Lead-ins <p> Will Forte and Kristen Schaal in Season 1 of Fox 's The Last Man on Earth <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by a comedy lead-in while a comedy wo n't be affected by a drama lead-in . ABC 's Designated Survivor is a textbook case of a drama that does not gain or lose anything from its comedy lead-in . The series began its run on September 21 , 2016 , at 10 pm with a strong 2.2 in the 18-49 ratings . It grew two-tenths from its comedy lead-in , Black-ish , which had a 2.0 . Fast-forward to October 26 , and the series has fallen off a cliff , managing just a 1.2 . In this airing , it lost a whopping five-tenths from its Black-ish lead-in . The series definitely looks a lot worse here , but that 's only because it has dropped on its own accord.and not due to its lead-in rising or falling . Also , a 1.2 at 10 pm is certainly still a solid performance so it 's not much of a problem . It became even more clear that the series was n't affected by Black-ish when it returned from hiatus in March and managed a 1.1 despite Black-ish airing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black-ish managed a 0.8 , so Designated Survivor grew three-tenths from it . The following week it kept that same 1.1 despite Black-ish having a 1.5 . To recap , Designated Survivor did n't lose or gain anything despite its lead-in growing seven-tenths , or 88% , week-to-week . Designated Survivor is a serialized drama while Black-ish is a family comedy , so it makes sense that they would n't share the same audience . ABC decided to move American Housewife to Wednesdays at 9:30 for the 2017-18 television season , we 'll see how this affects Designated Survivor , but I 'm almost certain that the lead-in will not hurt or help the Kiefer Sutherland drama . <p> On the other side of the spectrum , FOX 's The Last Man on Earth does n't fit into any of these categories as the series is a comedy that did n't seem to benefit from its comedy lead-in this season . While the Will Forte comedy had great Family Guy retention in its first and second season , it was a much different case in season 3 . On October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating for its second episode airing after Family Guy . The only problem was that Family Guy had a 1.7 , so the retention looked very ugly . The previous year , Family Guy had that same 1.7 for its second episode but Last Man had a 1.5 . Falling 33% year-to-year while your lead-in is steady is an absolutely terrible result . But , one month later , Family Guy had a 1.2 while The Last Man on Earth clocked in at a 0.9 . Compared to the October airing , Family Guy fell five-tenths while the post-apocalyptic comedy lost just one tenth . The Last Man on Earth continued being relatively steady throughout the fall , always in the 0.9-1.1 range . The fall finale yet again had poor retention as it managed just a 0.9 after a 1.4 Family Guy . It seemed like that was it for the series and that ratings would only go lower in the spring , but after a long hiatus , the series returned in March up one tenth to a 1.0 demo while it 's Family Guy lead-in was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got when Family Guy was at a 1.7 ! The series was relatively steady throughout the spring , staying in the 0.8-1.0 range and was ultimately renewed . It did end up falling to 0.7 for its finale airing out of a much lower rated Making History , so it still might not be entirely independent , but for the most part , it seems that this serialized comedy has become lead-in independent . Fox decided to keep the series after Family Guy for the 2017-18 season , so they definitely see the series as a respectable performer even if it does n't always have great retention . <p> NBC premieres many of their programs after The Voice in order to give them more exposure . <p> One of the most recent examples of a non-serialized comedy that is n't affected by its lead-in is NBC 's Great News . Despite averaging just a 0.8 in the 18-49 ratings , NBC decided to renew the series for a second season and give it a timeslot upgrade . This was a massive shock due to how poorly it did . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series averaged just a 0.7 after The Voice , the latter had a strong 1.6 . That 's less than half of its lead-in . A 0.7 is terrible in general , but after a 1.6 , it 's disastrous . Two weeks later , it did a 0.7 for its first half-hour and a 0.6 for its second airing after The Voice . Yet again , the series retained less than 50% of its lead-in . NBC scheduled the season finale at 8 pm instead of 9 pm . For this airing , it would not get a strong lead-in . Surprisingly , the series was actually up from its last airing , despite having to stand on its own . It 's very likely that an old-skewing reality series had very little effect on a young-skewing comedy . Great News will get to air after a comedy this season , that comedy being the revival of Will &amp; Grace . I would n't be surprised if the series improves a good bit , but I also would n't be surprised if it backfires . Nevertheless , having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a reality show leading into a comedy . <p> Recap <p> It 's not the size of the lead-in that matters , but how compatible it is with the show in question . But , just because a show has a strong , compatible lead-in does n't mean it 'll do well.With serialized dramas , it 's best to give them exposure earlier on , because it 's unlikely that they 'll end up building an audience in season 2 ( see Quantico ) . Networks simply have to take a gamble . Sometimes they 'll work ( American Housewife ) and sometimes they wo n't ( The Great Indoors ) , but that 's just how it is in the ratings game .
