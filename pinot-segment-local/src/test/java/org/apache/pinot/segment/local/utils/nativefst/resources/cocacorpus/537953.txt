Maintaining a vegan diet with ease is about turning simple choices into everyday conscious habits . For most people , everyday decisions about what food you chose to buy , eat , and stock your fridge will happen in a matter of milliseconds and with very little thought or inconvenience the same as the choice to buy or put on black socks instead of white or grey , or even those hipster ones that are super thin and have silly colours and weird patterns . All the choices to make it simple are right there in front of us all . We just have to be brave enough to become aware of them and then actively make those decisions- that 's when after a while it magically becomes an unacknowledged habit . <p> The amount of healthy plant-based food alternatives that are available today , even in our chain supermarkets , make almost everything you need to transition into a plant-based diet or to simply maintain your vegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vegetarian lifestyle as a teenager the only place you could find a veggie dog was at the hotdog stand on the corner of Queen and Spadina in Toronto . I actually remember considering taking a train into the city just because I would crave them so badly. - But slowly every dollar spent towards meat alternatives and healthier products has acted like a vote , and the capitalistic invisible hand of the marketplace has began to stock replace the empty calorie , unhealthy , and cruelty ridden foods with the great nourishing alternative options . That 's how it works- the more we care about what we put into our bodies , the more the grocer has to stock his shelves with what we want . I remember when Yves veggie burgers first appeared on my grocery shelves for the first time , I had a single man parade down Hwy 2 all the way home. - And now , fast forward more than half my life , and a plant based diet is easier than ever before for your shopping logistics , wallet , health , energy levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which make it super easy to take a little extra thought at the beginning to turn it into a simple habit . <p> I chose to include my chili recipe to my very first blog on this site because I think it illustrates the simplicity of living veg/vegan lifestyle . These days there almost seems to be an alternative for almost every meat and dairy product so I wanted to share a recipe that included them all. - The beauty of my chilli recipe is just like that of any vegan diet , you can customize it to fit your own unique taste pallet and the accessibility of what products your local market stocks . So if you cant find or do n't want to include certain items in the recipe you do n't have to . And the best part of all is that just like if you want to experiment with your daily diet and habits , you can with this recipe there is very little you can do to fail when switching things up .

It 's the perfect ground beef alternative and my personal favorite of all that are out there .

There are a lot of ground beef alternatives on the market- Yves brand being the most popular and they are all pretty good TVP however reigns supreme to me . <p> Variation Ingredients : <p> 1 can lentils <p> 2 small cans of corn <p> 1 can of chickpeas <p> 1 pack of tofu <p> 1 handful of mushrooms <p> 2 roasted garlic cloves <p> 1 tomato <p> 1 green pepper <p> 1 handful of chopped onion <p> Note- The best thing about my chili is the experimentation from pot to pot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to different canned legumes and whatnot , its incredibly fun to try new and different things as it is extremely difficult when the base is made right to screw the rest up .

Take a spoon out , scoop some up , and have a taste . In my book , you should be checking for three main sensations chili flavor , hot spice , and garlic . Depending on your own personal favored pallet utilize your shakers of cayenne pepper ( for spice ) , cumin ( for chili flavor ) , and garlic well for garlic- a shake here and a dash or pinch there. - Every time you put a little more in , stir it up a bit and have another taste . Keep in mind that later once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more potent , so tread carefully . But also , and most importantly be brave . = <p> Bubble Then Simmer <p> Once you 're at a point where you seem to like the flavor crank the heat almost up to full and stir like the dickens . Once the chilli starts to boil , stir for another 60 seconds and turn the heat back down to low . Stir on low for about 2 or 3 more minutes and then pop a lid on and let it sit , simmering from anywhere of 10 minutes to an hour. - Its up to you how hungry you are at this point balanced against how well you want it all to settle in the pot . The longer you leave it , the better it tastes . <p> I like 30 minutes it usually works perfect for me . <p> Note- Its actually best letting it sit overnight with no heat , but who has patience for that that 's what leftovers are for .

Just like TVP it can easily be found at Bulk Barn and a bunch of other places and it is a secret vegan dream come true . Nutritional yeast is healthy for you and acts like creamy or cheesy topping . It turns soups into cream soups , turns noodles into mac and cheese , sits on salads like parmesan cheese , and tastes like shredded cheese for chili and other such hot dishes . Its brilliant ! - Go buy some . Seriously . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shelf-life of a few days . <p> In the refrigerator : A shelf- life of a couple weeks . <p> I always freeze a ton of chilli in plastic tupperware containers which then I have stored for months on end before thawing for a last minute bowl . <p> Just so you 're not eating bowls upon bowls of straight chili I suggest pairing it or eating- it with : <p> spaghetti or other Italian noodles or shells and suchchilligetti ! <p> nachos- chilli nachos ! <p> veggie dogs and burger- chillidogs &amp; chiliburger ! <p> brown rice- ricen chill ! <p> quinoa <p> on top of french fries- chilly fries ! <p> So there you have it : <p> Amazing VEGAN chilli on a budget and made in about 30 to 45 minutes depending on how hungry you are .
