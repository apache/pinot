The problem : Always starts first time hot or cold . Runs like a dream as always but recently it has taken to cutting out : When : anytime - speed any speed 10MPH to 70/80 MPH - engine temp cold to normal -Fuel unleaded normal have put 2 tankfulls in just incase dirty petrol . Driving under normal conditions the engine will MOMENTRAY cut out Battery light comes on engine will restart immediatly and carry on as normal . Can do it 4 or 5 times in a row or not at all yesterday did 70 miles nothing today did 25 miles did it twice -CAN ANY ONE HELP PLEASE 196060 @qwx1056060 <p> Intermittent faults like that can be a nightmare to diagnose . Was going to suggest idle control valve / throttle body for engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mph . Usual suspects for misfire or flat spot can be engine coolant temp sensor , coil pack / coils , leads ( depending on year of car ) , plugs etc. etc . But they normally show up on diagnostic check . Best I can suggest to help , hope you get it solved . <p> Posted on Friday 12th of November 2010Do n't understand this ? Ask a question <p> thanks your reply whittingehame . I have recently rplaced 2 coils which failed . The sym , ptons where entirely different - this problem is so frustrating because it does not show up on diagnostics . But thanks anyway n regards - so if there is still oneone out there ..... <p> Posted on Friday 12th of November 2010Do n't understand this ? Ask a question <p> You need to read the codes using a BMW specific code reader , as other readers may not show the problem . From the sounds of the problem you are having , it could be the camshaft sensor , but do n't disregard a split vacumn pipe or other air leaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose , just after the MAF . <p> and <p> 31-05-2010 , 00:56 I had the same thing within hours of buying my car a few weeks ago . Issue with mine turned out to have been the crankshaft sensor . I 'm told that the sensor can sometimes act a bit erratic causing cut-outs , etc , and then work fine . Mine was cutting out for a few hours , and then after a journey on a recovery truck ran sweet as the following morning . Diagnostic revealed crankshaft sensor was the problem so got it changed . Touch wood , she now seems fine . <p> and <p> Check the inlet pipework after the maf for any signs of wear . <p> Posted on Friday 12th of November 2010Do n't understand this ? Ask a question <p> I am due to change my crankshaft sensor tomorrow due to the usual cutting out every now and then etc that is associated with a failing crankshaft sensor . My question is this . Has anyone changed one on the N42 and can give me a few pointers of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what to take off to get to it . I have a good socket set and a set of torx sockets so i 'm fairly well preppared . <p> Please do n't  confuse this with the easy to get to get to sensor on the M43 etc as i know the inlet manifold definately has to come off to gain access . Cheers in advance . <p> Found this post while searching the net . I thought i would post it here incase anyone else is going to attempt it . <p> It is a fairly long job , took me several hours but being careful helps . You need a torque wrench , a set of common sockets and spanners , a set of 1/4 " drive sockets , a set of hex bits , and a set of small-size torx bits or keys . A lot of stuff comes off , so have a clean bench to put it all down on . You really need to have a good manual such as T IS or the Haynes manual , I have both and they were both useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramps too . First clean the top of the engine well to remove dust etc to avoid it going down into the injector holes and the intake ports . Depressurise the fuel tank to avoid spraying petrol around when you disconnect the fuel pipe . Also disconnect the battery ! Generally a straight-forward job with a few awkward bits . <p> The whole intake manifold has to come off . Take off all of the air intake assembly and all of the stuff above the rear of the motor , which is the micron filter housing - looks daunting but is fairly simple . The hardest part I found to be removing one of the screws which hold the intake manifold on to the manifold support bracket , because my car has air conditioning ( maybe you do n't need it in your part of the world ) and the compressor gets in the way . There are two screws , the one at the back is easy since you can see it from under the car but need a very long socket extension to get the torx bit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a magnetic bit holder or tape it on with sticky tape . The front one is a b*gger with the aircon compressor restricting access from below , so you have to do it from above and there is almost no room below the screw to get the torx bit in and turn it . It helps to have very small hands and my neighbour 's daughter was a big help ! When replacing it I used a hex head bolt , since it was a lot easier to tighten from above , and would be easier to remove in future . If you do n't have air it should be easy from under the car I think . Also , remove or at least loosen the dipstick tube to allow the manifold to come off and go back on more easily - the T IS manual does not show this . <p> The fuel injectors were a bit sticky but came off with gentle leverage with a screwdriver . The connectors are fiddly , and the Jesus clips holding them on can fly away ! The manifold lifts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace if any suspicion about condition . <p> Replacing the crank sensor itself is easy ( a bit of an anticlimax ) , just above the starter motor , the screw is Loctited in so needs a bit of a twist to undo . <p> Clean the surface around the head ports with a bit of kerosene if it is even slightly dirty . Do n't wipe stuff into the ports . <p> Replacing the manifold , take extra care to have the port seals securely in place in the manifold or you will have to do it all over again . ie they can fall out as you put the manifold on . But they do hang on in the manifold pretty well if you put them in carefully . If they do n't then get new ones . Getting the manifold back on is almost impossible if you do n't loosen the dipstick tube . You have to put the manifold back on while holding the oil separator assembly on below it - it has to slot into place into guides on the underside of the manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily when I did it . The T IS manifold says you need special tools to do this ( Haynes does not ) , and I was worried about this but it was easy . Using both hands at front and back and holding up the separator to the manifold seemed to do the trick . Torque the nuts etc down . <p> Keep the injectors clean when replacing them , use a very small amount of silicone grease to lubricate the O-rings . <p> Replace the screws under the manifold support ( see above for advice ) . After that it is easy . I was a bit nervous while doing all this because I kept imagining that it would never go again and I would have to tow it down to the BMW experts , but it went first twist of the key . <p> My car has been fine since I did this , which is about 1000 km or so by now . <p> My thanks to ALL who have contributed - Had a good search for air leaks ? vacuum pipes only thing found is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( before maf ) this hose was perished and have now replaced it but has made no differnce to cutting out ( 2 times ) So i shall book the BMW in to garage for Monday and hopefully that will resolve the issue - Once again thanks all you have been very helful R <p> Posted on Saturday 13th of November 2010Do n't understand this ?

( the battery in the car is brand new , also a temperature sensor has been replaced ) 196060 @qwx1056060 <p> Because you say the fault is sometimes cleared by switching the ignition off and back on , I would suspect an electrical connection problem . Check the integrity of the wiring harness to the gearbox , particularly where it enters the the black junction box on top of the gearbox next to the shift cable . <p> Posted on Friday 22nd of June 2012Do n't understand this ? Ask a question <p> Mark . Your problem has all the trade mark symptons of a citroen automatic box . I cant help thinking that the vibration when starting is not connected to the gear box problem , but what I would say is that 1 . your Citroen dealer should have been able to give some clue as to the gearbox fault through diagnostics 2 . They probably did n't  because they do n't  believe they can fix it . 3 stay away from Citroen dealerships with this problem and look for an automatic gear box specialist . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERMAN company called ZF , therefore most Citroen dealers know nothing about the workings of the gearbox. 4 . This will cost money to fix and depending on the cars history may not be fixable . <p> I will give you some idea on how to go forward with this . 1 . Check the gear box model , it will be AL4 OR 4HP20. 2 . AL4 boxes have a very specific method of checking the oil level , but it is not difficult and should take no more than 1 hour of time for a mechanic to do , this includes driving the car to raise the oil temp to 60 degrees.There is plenty of info on this on the internet , and a proper autobox garage will know how to do it.The 4HP20 IS EASIER BECAUSE IT HAS AN EXTERNAL OIL GAUGE . 3 . If your car has been dealt with by somebody that does not know these types of gear box it is very possible that the car has been over filled with oil and possibly the wrong type of oil . 4 . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil is a red colour . IF IT IS IT IS WRONG YOU WILL NEED TO GET THE CORRECT OIL AND START DILUTING THE WRONG OIL OUT OF THE BOX , THIS CAN TAKE SOME TIME AND NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU , GET THE PROPER MOBIL ATF LT 71141 OIL TO REPLACE THE RED FLUID . 5 . SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IF THE OIL IS A BROWN COLOUR AND SMELLS BAD IT IS BURNED OUT . HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CORRECT MOBIL OIL IS A GOLDEN BROWN COLOUR AND SMELLS BAD BEFORE YOU PUT IT IN , SO DO NT GIVE THIS ADVISE TO MUCH CREADANCE. 6 . You will only be able to drain about 2 litres of oil from the gear box at a time . You will then replace the drained oil with the exact same amount of new mobil oil . Drive the car , repeat the process 4,5,6 times to dilute the poor oil into good oil . This oil is expensive , but can be bought on the internet from many different places , you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you know the oil is good and at the correct level drive the car for a day or two to notice any different behavior . If the car behaves better but the fault still comes back , you need to go a step further . 8 . There are two valves at the top of the gear box that give trouble . these can be replaced with an updated version made by a company called Borg Warner . It would be best if this was done and a software upgrade to suit the new valves was installed ( unfortunately the soft ware upgrade has to be done by Citroen ) 9 . Before you go buying new valves , get the valve block removed from the box and check that the valve have not already been replaced . You will know the Borg Warner valves because the electrical connector will be black and BW will be stamped on the body of the valve . 10 Changing these valves is not a very difficult job . A compident trustworthy mechanic should be able to do it because you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer housing which is an almost oil free area . With all the tools and 2 pairs of hands these valves could be changed in 3 hours no problem . 11 . If you are going to have a go at this it would be prudent to remove and clean all the sequencing valves in the valve block at the same time and even open the valve block and clean the matrix aswell . If you discover the 2 top valves have already been changed to Borg Warner it would do no harm to clean these also . Use electrical contact cleaner to do this and opperate the valves with an auxillary 9volt battery as you spray the cleaner into all the open ports . Make sure the cleaner is the type that does not react with rubber or plastic seals.You can not opperate the sequencing valves with a battery , just remove them one at a time clean well with spray and refit.Some would say you should change the seals every time you remove the valves but I would check the seals visually and if you see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 12 . These steps are proposed to prevent you from spending money unesasarilly . However the proper oil will cost you about -10+ per litre and you should allow for 12 litres if required ( I would do it anyway ) If you need valves they will cost you about -80 each and there are 2 of them . Refreshing the oil , changing the valves , and cleaning should require no more than 10 man hours with a good mechanic . This is not a very difficult job , a bit fiddly but not difficult and no speicial tools are needed , just a level head . <p> If you want to you can call me on 07795458216 and I will be happy to chat . <p> It is important to remember however that this may not cure the problem but this is deffinately the way to go to in elliminating all the fundamental problems . <p> The thud you hear when the car goes into limp mode is simply the gearbox locking into 3rd gear , so it is best if you are driving the car to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ max to prevent high rev lock up. ( this is normal behaviour and is meant to protect the box ) <p> I might be wrong but I think the vibrating when started from cold may just be because you have a diesel engine and if it does not heat properlly before it starts you will experience some shaking because the engine is not fireing clean on its cylinders , once you pull the car into D it will labour the engine thus not allowing it to move freely as the energy is then being transfered to the torque converter . Get the engine mounts checked . I do n't  think it is connected to the gear box problem . <p> Hope this helps . <p> Posted on Sunday 12th of August 2012Know the answer to this ?

Seat back angle knob levers off with a couple of screwdrivers . Remove 2 size 50 Torx bolts to separate seat back from base .

I broke mine not knowing how they were attached ... it cost -18 to replace doh .... Disconnect cable ends from seat latch before attempting to remove handle else cables will hold handle in place . Use a bit of string on old cables to pull new ones into place feeding down from top of seat .

Ask a question <p> Thanks for the previous posts . They gave me some useful ideas . The following applies specifically to the Mk6 : but may also be relevant for other models . <p> If you want to replace the release cables , you must first remove the release latch . <p> It 's not a good idea to remove the handle from the release latch when removing or replacing it , as this weakens the hinge and it will be liable to fail more quickly . <p> Removing the tilt release latch without damaging it can be very tricky , as the plastic retaining clips on either side of the latch are constructed differently . On one side it is possible to insert a screwdriver from the side , as previously described , and apply pressure to release the latch . On the other side the latch is completely hidden inside the seat framework ; and for me it successfully resisted all attempts to wriggle it loose . That 's when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least ) ! If you prise down the seat fabric at the front of the latch , you will find an access hole in the frame . This is ideally aligned for releasing the hidden catch on the right hand seat . It 's not so well aligned on the left-hand seat and you may need a stout bit of bent wire : but it 's do-able without too much difficulty . <p> There is no need to remove the seat covers to replace the cables . ( I wasted hours doing this before I picked up this great tip ! ) Once the latch is off , just unclip the bottoms of the two cables and tape about a metre of string to each cable end . Then twist the top end 90 degrees and lift it out , taking care not pull the strings all the way through . Untape the strings , attach them to the ends of the new cable assembly , and lower it into place , pulling gently on the strings to guide them into place . <p> Twist the top to lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refit the latch , push the seat into the latched position and make sure the cable lug is sitting neatly in the bottom of its trough .

Ask a question <p> I know this may sound stupid but I ca n't for the life of me find the " 2 clips " that everyone is talking about on this and several other posts I have read , the ones you need to push in with two flathead screwdrivers to remove the old latch/handle . <p> I tried for around 2 hours today with no luck to my frustration the seat is now out of the car but still no easier ? ? <p> Replaced this part yesterday .

I basically broke one of the clips to get the old part out . <p> Also , I messed around with a piece of string ( as per the first post ) on the end of the cable trying to work out how to fit the new part and could not see how that would work . This is bNOT/ the correct approach . As per the later post you need the seat back upright clicked into the normal driving position then bake sure the cable end is seated nicely on the lower end of the plastic sliders then as the post describes you simply push the new part in to place tith the release lever closed till it clicks . <p> Worked a treat - cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013Do n't understand this ?

I ordered 2 genuine ford replacements latches via eBay for about -45 for the pair inc postage , however the instructions that came with them were next to useless . I read many forums to see the best way to go about it , and here 's my advise for anyone about to undertake the job . <p> 1 . Remove the headrest and then save your self a lot of trouble by removing the seat from the car . It 's a 5 min job to remove the seat from the car via 4 x 50T Torx bolts below the seat squab . <p> 2 . After the seat is out of the car then separate seat squab from the seat back . Again this is a 5 mins job by removing the 2 x 50T Torx bolts that sit behind the plastic covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers ( without breaking them ) by locating where their plastic lugs locate into the metal slots in the seat back frame . <p> 3 . There are two cables running down the back of the seat squab . Release the 2 lugs at the bottom of each cable from the holes in the seat frame . This is an easy to do just with your fingers . <p> 4 . Using a flat headed screw driver then prise off the clips that hold the bottom of each cable sleeve onto the seat frame . Gentle pressure is all that is needed . You now have maximum play on the cable at the latch end of the cables . <p> 5 . Remove the old latch by compressing the 2 lugs that locate the latch to the seat frame . <p> 6 . Make sure the cable is pulled through to its maximum length at the latch end . Now locate the ' T ' bar into the cup in the replacement latch . Now secure the new latch into the seat frame via its 2 lugs . <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re-clip each cable sleeve into the seat frame at the bottom . <p> 8 . Locate the lugs at the end of each cable back into their locating holes . <p> 9 . Check that T bar at top of cable is still located in the ' cup ' within the new latch . <p> 10 . Reconnect the seat squab to the seat back ( 2 Torx bolts ) and check that the latch is still working . <p> 11 . Re-install seat back into car ( 4 Torx bolts ) . <p> It took me 3 hours to to replace the passenger side latch - because i had to figure out how to do it - and 30 mins to replace the drivers side . <p> Good luck <p> Posted on Sunday 6th of October 2013Do n't understand this ?

@@110707913 @6107913/ <p> The most honest and helpful garage I have come across in 30+ years of motoring . Family run ( I think ) and not out to take as much money as possible off you . OK , you pay full price for an MOT , but they will want it to pass , not be left behind for expensive work to recoup any fake half-price offer etc . <p> The Old Dairy is your perfect local garage - I took 2 cars for an MOT - they both passed .

This is a common problem with Polo 's <p> see LONG ... <p> I have posted here and other forums before but no one is expert enough to be able to conclusively say what a simple fix is . <p> The fix seems to be quite complex . Basically , there are tow motorised flaps in the heater control . One that controls the temperature and one that controls the fresh air intake . Both these motors are pretty unreliable and tend to get jammed intermitenly . I have checked this on my car with VAG-COM diagnostics cable connected to my laptop and get the following fault codes : <p> The fix is to replace these motors ( V68 and V154 ) . They are not cheap but the real problem is getting to them . To do it properly , the whole dashboad has to be removed to get to the heater mechanism . Which requires removing the steering wheel ( which requires removing the battery lead which disables the airbags ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour ! ! <p> I have learned to live with the problem by trying one of these workarounds : <p> 1 . turn temp dial to coldest and close the central airvents for 1 minute or two while the vent dial is set to DEMIST . Then open the central vent fans -- that then lowers teh temp to the coldest . or 2. turnthe fan speed to ZERO for a minute or two and then to 1 . That will then reset the temp to the coldest . <p> Try that to see if it works for you .

The fan was also not working on the first setting so he also replaced the " Heater resistor " to put this right .

Ask a question <p> Hi Many thanks for your reply . I think the car is not overheating . A friend said to me that there 's a smart charge system on this car if you unplug the 3 pin plug off the alternator it reverts to being a normal alternator and will charge the battery ok and the battery warning light will be on . He wondering if there 's a problem with the wires near the plug as they can break or a problem with the smart charge ecu . The temp warning light coming on and off could be a faulty sensor .

The recovery man said the bulbs might have been loose and fell off . The gay told me i could find someone that could just screw the running engine back in place at my house or go to a garage and ask to run a rump to make chure is that the problem . As i do n't  know anybody that could come and do the work at my house i have to go with the second option . It looks like it is a very simply job , my question is : Is this job going to be expensive ? Will I be able to ask for the mechanic to come to my house for the job or I have to pay for a recovery vehicle to take the car to the garage ?

@@110708164 @6108164/ 196060 @qwx1056060 <p> There are two main causes of this problem which is common across the Skoda and VW ranges . The problem is to do with the global opening " feature " which allows you to open all the windows by a long press of the lock button on your remote control . If you inadvertently press the button in your pocket this will unlock the doors and open the windows . If none of the doors are opened within a set period ( 40 secs I think ) the doors re-lock but the windows will remain open . If you are sure you are not pressing the button then it could be water ingress in one of the front window control units located in the front doors . The door control unit is mounted at an angle that allows any water that has entered the top of the door to sit in the top of the connector . This eventually corrodes and causes false signals within the electronics . Corroded connections will be obvious and will need thorough cleaning and treating with petroleum jelly or silicone grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global opening feature can be programmed out by your dealer if all else fails or you do n't want it anyway . <p> Posted on Tuesday 23rd of August 2011Do n't understand this ?

Once the gearbox oil hits critical temperature , switch off the engine and reconnect the drain plug . <p> This gives the correct fill level at running temperature and must be done to ensure that the oil is nether under filled or overfilled . Both are bad for the gearbox . " <p> Posted on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
