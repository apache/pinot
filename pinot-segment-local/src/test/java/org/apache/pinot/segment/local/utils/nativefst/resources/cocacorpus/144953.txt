@@98239011 @2439011/ <h> Using the HomeSeer Server with a Router <p> If you are using a router in your home to share multiple PC 's with your internet connection , you may not be able to access your HomeSeer web server from a remote PC . To fix this problem , set up your router to forward all requests for the HomeSeer server port to the HomeSeer PC IP address . For example , if your PC IP address is 192.168.1.10 and you set up the HomeSeer web server on port 80 , then set up your router to forward all requests on port 80 to IP address 192.168.1.10 . Just about all routers have the ability to do this . Some other things to keep in mind when doing this : If your router ( or multiport cable modem or DSL router ) is vending an IP address to your HomeSeer computer using DHCP , then you should also change the router 's configuration to vend DHCP addresses to the other PCs in your home but not the HomeSeer PC . This is typically done by configuring the DHCP server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number - e.g. 192.168.1.50 , and then assign a static IP address to your HomeSeer system using one of the addresses below 192.168.1.50 such as 192.168.1.10 . This is because very few routers allow you to set up port forwarding to a host name - it is often that you need a single IP address to forward the port request to , and you will always want this to be your HomeSeer PC for your HomeSeer PC 's web server port . See your routers documentation on how to set this up . <p> After setting this up , you will be able to connect to your HomeSeer system from the Internet using it 's wide area network ( WAN ) or Internet address that your ISP provided for your home , and you will also be able to connect to your HomeSeer system on your local network ( LAN ) using it 's LAN address . Here is a short description of how this typically works : <p> Your cable modem or DSL router is given an IP address for your location by your ISP - for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address ( 192.168.1.10 ) into the WAN address of 15.17.181.110 . It does this for all of the PCs in your home , but do n't worry - it does n't mix up who is who when the website you are accessing on the Internet replies . When a reply comes in , the router stored connection information so that it knows which PC in the home to route the incoming data to . <p> To the website you are accessing , your IP address is not your LAN IP address , but your Internet IP address of 15.17.181.110 . <p> To access your HomeSeer web server , enter your home 's WAN IP address followed by the port number ( if it is something other than 80 ) like this : http : //15.17.181.110:8080 When the request comes to the router , it will not find an existing connection such that it would know which PC to send it to , so it then checks the port forwarding information to see if the port indicated is suppose to go to a specific PC . If your port forwarding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming connection request to your HomeSeer PC at its LAN address of 192.168.1.10 , and you will get a HomeSeer web server login dialog box . <p> Note : Many ISPs block well-known server ports , so even if port forwarding is set up correctly , you may not be able to connect . Try some different port numbers and you may find one that allows you to connect to your system . <p> Making It Easier - Give Your PC A Name <p> Memorizing your PC 's WAN IP address is unpleasant and not very friendly , and when you access the HomeSeer web page , you enter HomeSeer.com instead of the IP address of the server . The service that converts friendly names of servers ( hosts ) into their IP address is DNS , or Dynamic Name Service . Setting up a DNS server is complex , and you have to have the DNS server known by your ISP for it to work . Instead of using a DNS service , use a Dynamic DNS ( DDNS ) service . DDNS is designed to give names to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - such as the IP address that your ISP may assign to your home . DDNS typically uses software that runs on the PC in your home to get its current WAN IP address , and then report it to the DDNS server . After obtaining the WAN IP address of your network and after you have given your HomeSeer computer a name , you can access it using that friendly name from anywhere in the world . <p> HomeSeer offers a very inexpensive service called MyHomeSeerConnect that will handle all of this for you . See the MyHomeSeerConnect product page for more information .

Some devices stay awake when their batteries are first inserted . On the HSM100 , just press the blue button on the side of the unit , the sensor will stay awake for 10 minutes . On the **26;0;TOOLONG temperature and flood sensor , press the button 3 times . See the manual that was included with your Z-Wave hardware .

The node is not factory-set it 's set at the time the device is added to the Z-Wave " network " . This is done when the device is synced to the Z-Wave Remote Control Unit . <p> Network refers to the collection of Z-Wave devices in the home . <p> Z-Wave employs each node in the network as an intelligent router . Thus , a failure by a controller to communicate directly with a device will cause the controller to hand off the control request to a nearby device . The nearby device will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network and will determine which node to hand the control request to so that it gets routed to the appropriate node in the shortest amount of time . The same path is used for the information returned by the node that received the control request . Z-Wave is inherently two-way , which means all commands are acknowledged and information is returned that alerts the system as to whether or not the command was able to be carried out . Z-Wave is also very fast compared with defacto standard lighting control systems in use over the past 30 years . Typically , a Z-Wave control signal makes a round-trip completion in 80ms as compared to 666ms , in just one direction , for X-10 . The system supports up to 232 nodes . <h> Topology <p> Z-Wave is a mesh network - that is , all devices can communicate with all devices ( with some exceptions ) . There is a hierarchy for some types of functions such as adding or removing nodes from the network , optimizing the network , etc. and that is that those functions must be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many secondary controllers , and they are created by copying network information from the primary controller to secondary controllers . It is even possible to transfer the role of primary controller between controllers - for example , you can transfer the role of primary controller from the HomeSeer Z-Wave interface to a handheld controller , so that you can then use the handheld controller to add or remove nodes from the network , and then transfer the network information and the primary role back to the HomeSeer Z-Wave interface when you are done . <h> Controllers <p> Controllers can send and receive Z-Wave commands . Although every node in the network is capable of this , controllers do have additional functions that make them special in the network . ( See the Topology discussion above . ) Some controllers are portable controllers - that is , they can move around and do not rely on being in a fixed location . When they send a command , they try to communicate with the destination node directly , and if they can not then they will hand off the command to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command to the destination node . Since a portable controller does not always know which nodes are around it , this can take a little bit of trial and error before it finds a route to the device - although the total time is probably still less than one second ! A static controller is just the opposite - it expects like most nodes to be in a fixed location , and so its information on how to route commands is based upon nodes that it knows are near it , so if it can not talk to the destination node directly , it 's handoff to another node is going to be one that it knows can talk to the destination node or knows how to get it there . Even if there is a surprise such as a node in the network is not functioning , Z-Wave nodes ( which include controllers ) will make a few attempts to find other routes before they give up and let the sender know that the command could not be delivered . Some controllers are designed to be computer interfaces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this form factor there are also both portable and static controllers . HomeSeer 's Z-Troller interface has an RS-232 connection so that it can be your HomeSeer interface , but it is also a portable controller in that you can disconnect it from HomeSeer temporarily so that you can add or remove nodes from the network . HomeSeer also offers the Z-Stick , which is a battery powered USB interface . <h> Nodes <p> As mentioned before , nodes are added or removed from the network using the primary controller . When a node is added , it must not already be a part of another network . This is why you can not have two primary controllers - each primary controller has a unique network I 'd number , and when a node is added to the network it is imprinted with that network I 'd , and so the node can not communicate with devices on the other network - this is how it is not possible for your neighbor 's Z-Wave controller to control the devices in your home . If a node you are adding was already added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was made , or because you bought it used or are re-using one that you removed earlier , then you will first have to remove it from its current network before you can add it to your network . You do not need the primary controller from the network the node was added to in order to be able to remove it - any primary controller can tell a node that it is no longer a part of a network . This is still secure however because the process for adding or removing a node involves having the node send a specific signal at the proper time , and that signal is a very low power signal so that other controllers do not hear it . This is why adding or removing nodes must be done with a portable controller or by placing the controller near the node being added or removed - it was designed to use a low power signal for security purposes and so it must be within a couple of feet of the controller when it is added or removed . <p> All nodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to your network will be listening for Z-Wave traffic and helping to route commands to/from other nodes , there are some that do not listen at all , and do not participate in routing on the network . These devices are typically battery operated devices because having the RF radio on all the time listening for commands would drain the batteries in a VERY short time . Examples of these types of devices are battery operated motion detectors , door/window sensors , or battery operated transmitters . This also includes most handheld controllers ! That 's right - even if a handheld controller is the primary controller , it usually will not be listening and will not participate in routing on the network to conserve battery power . For these devices , many support a Z-Wave class called " WAKE " which means that they can be configured to wake up at a regular interval so that other devices can communicate with it . With many battery operated devices , the wake class ( or Wake-Up as it is also known ) will be used to ask the device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that monitoring of the battery can be done to avoid the device failing outright . Some of these devices do not support the Wake-Up class , and in this case for purposes of adding the node to the network and configuring it , they should support a method for keeping the device awake for a period of time -- for example , when you first insert batteries in some motion detectors , they will stay awake for 10 minutes so you can communicate with them . <h> Working with HomeSeer <p> It is helpful to point out how a few things about Z-Wave fit in with HomeSeer . While we were pioneers of adopting the technology , we are not the makers of most of the Z-Wave enabled products , and all products incorporate the heart of the Z-Wave functionality using electronics from Zensys , the makers of Z-Wave . The process of using Z-Wave with HomeSeer involves ( of course ) having an interface on your HomeSeer PC so that HomeSeer HS2 can send and receive Z-Wave signals . As mentioned before , it does not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the interface you choose will determine how you will go about adding nodes to your network . After nodes are added to the network and ( if necessary ) copied or transferred to your HomeSeer interface , you will then need to import the node information to HomeSeer so that it can compare the nodes on the network with the nodes it already knows about , and create devices for the new nodes that you added . When this happens , HomeSeer has to communicate with the nodes to gather information about them - what type of node they are , what their capabilities are ( whether they are listening nodes or not ) , and what Z-Wave " classes " they support , which define many of the features that HomeSeer will make available for them . For this purpose , when you are transferring node information into HomeSeer , it is important that the node you added is awake and listening for commands , and also that your HomeSeer Z-Wave interface has a way to communicate with that device . For example , if the device is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the second floor , and your HomeSeer interface is on the computer in the basement , then there is not enough of a Z-Wave network to route signals to the node upstairs , and it will be unlikely that HomeSeer can communicate with that node . If your home or apartment is small , this may not be a problem since the nominal range of Z-Wave devices is quite far , but remember also that metal ( HVAC duct work , refrigerators , appliances ) can block RF signals and make communication with a node only 20 feet away nearly impossible . Build the network starting around the HomeSeer interface if possible , and the addition of nodes will allow you to expand your network as you go . <h> Optimizing <p> HomeSeer includes an " Optimize " feature , which will appear if your HomeSeer interface is also the primary controller for your network , because optimization can only be done using the primary controller . When a node is added to the network , the primary controller asks the node to discover which nodes are its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new node that lists which nodes can communicate with it . This routing table is what the controller and other nodes will use to know where to send a signal in order to be able to reach each node in the network , if it fails to communicate with it directly . There are , however , four sets of routing information for each node in the network . This means that if the other 3 entries were never filled in or are outdated because you have changed your network , then nodes may not have good information for knowing how to get commands to a node . HomeSeer 's optimize feature , which is at the heart of the Z-Health system , uses the primary controller to instruct a node to discover its neighbors . When this is done four times for a node , it can be assumed that all four copies of the node routing information are up-to-date so that the most number of routes are available . Optimizing should certainly be done whenever a node is added or removed from the network , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture and potentially changed the RF characteristics of the house to make some working communication paths inoperable . The danger of optimizing when it is not needed involves " fringe " nodes , or nodes that are near the outside of the network and have unreliable communications . With fringe nodes , they may only have one node that can reach them , and if there is a problem with that one node communicating with the fringe node when the optimize is done , then the result of the optimize could be that there are now NO routes . For this reason it is always best to mesh your network thoroughly . <h> Features <p> One of the features of Z-Wave is that it is a fully two-way communicating protocol . This means that when a node is sent a command , the node will respond when it receives this command , so the originating device will know it was received . This should not be confused , however , with " two-way " features of other technologies which meant that when the device was operated locally ( e.g. with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it changed . This feature does NOT exist in Z-Wave . There are ways of getting " instant status " reports though , and thanks to a basic class that almost every listening ( awake ) node supports , HomeSeer can also be set up to query the node on a regular basis for its status . A couple of ways that a node can report its status immediately is with the Association Command Class ( Association for short ) , or with the Scene Class if HomeSeer is made to be a part of the scene . Whenever possible , HomeSeer will use one of these methods and will program the device so that HomeSeer can receive instant status of changes . If a device does not support either of these features , then the most likely reason is that the manufacturer did not license a patent owned by Lutron for instant status notification of electronic devices . The association class allows a device which was made to be an association source , transmit commands to other devices . The recipient devices do not need to support the association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ones that HomeSeer uses to turn a device on , off , or to a specific level . An example of this is a transmitter , that does not have a light that it controls itself , but looks like other wall switches in your home . When you press the transmitter to turn on an association group , the nodes that were made a part of that group receive an " On " command from the transmitter . Some types of transmitters support multiple groups , so that if you press the transmitter once , it sends a command to Group 1 , press the transmitter twice or press a different button , and it sends a command to Group 2 . There may be multiple devices that are a part of any group . When a device supports being an association source , HomeSeer will attempt to add itself to one of the association groups so that it will be notified when the device is operated . Association is how a device such as a motion detector is configured to turn on a light in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support associations but supports the scene class , then HomeSeer will attempt to add itself as a member of the scene . It does this so that when the scene is activated , HomeSeer will receive the scene activation command and can then update the status of the scene device that sent the scene activation to show it as being " On " . The final way for HomeSeer to receive status of a device to know whether it is on or off is through polling . This is not instant status , since the polling takes place at a regular interval , but by setting a polling frequency in the device properties in HomeSeer , you can cause HomeSeer to ask the device for its status at that frequency , and so it will eventually learn of changes in the status of the device and can trigger events based upon it . Keep in mind that due to the Lutron patent , some manufacturers who did not license the patent can still support the association class , but eliminate the ability for the device to have any associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand its ability to report instant status before you make a purchase ! <p> The scene class sounds redundant when you consider that a HomeSeer event that operates multiple Z-Wave devices is the same as a scene , but the scene class is actually quite different and useful . When HomeSeer sends a Z-Wave command to several devices , it will try to send a single command to operate all of them at once , but more often it ends up sending individual commands . Although individual commands are very fast with Z-Wave , there can still be a bit of a lag before all of the devices are at the level you specified , and they all went to the level you specified immediately , or at least as fast as the default ramp rate it was configured for if the device supports a configurable ramp rate . Scene capable devices have support for a ramp rate for the scene itself , and the ramp rate could be anywhere from one second ( on instantly ) to as long as 10 minutes or more . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) slowly increases its level , ever so slightly , so that it ends at the desired level at the end of the desired time ( ramp rate ) . If you are automating a theatre or putting the kids to bed , the ability for the lights to change over a period of time is quite useful . So to summarize the difference with an example , a light that does not support scenes that you want to turn on to 80% in 5 minutes can be controlled by HomeSeer to do that if you create a series of event actions with delays and set levels that the device is set to - very inconvenient to set up . Or , you can configure a single delay of 5 minutes in HomeSeer , and then the light goes to 80% instantly . With a scene , however , HomeSeer activates the scene and then slowly over that 5 minute period the light gets brighter and brighter until at the end of 5 minutes , it is at 80% brightness as you desired .

@@98239025 @2439025/ <h> How Event Conditions Work <p> Conditions are checked once every minute and when an event occurs , such as a Z-Wave signal received or device state change . All conditions are checked only once and an action for a condition can not affect any other conditions during the current check . For example , suppose we have the two conditions shown below . These conditions would allow a wall switch to turn a light on if it 's off or brighten the light by 10% if it 's already on . ( The light is identified by the code Q18 -- see the Status screen to find the code for a specific device . ) <p> If received Q17-ON AND Q18 is OFF then turn Q18 ON . <p> If received Q17-ON AND Q18 is ON then brighten Q18 10% . <p> Let 's assume Q18 is OFF and HomeSeer receives a Q17-ON command . HomeSeer does the following : <p> Condition 1 is now true ( received Q17-ON and Q18 is OFF ) so Q18 turns ON . <p> HomeSeer does not update the status for Q18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is NOT true and does not execute ( HomeSeer still thinks Q18 is OFF ) . <p> After all conditions are tested , the status for Q17 is set to ON and the status for Q18 is set to ON . <p> Why , if the status of a device is changed in the event , is the change not detected during that event ? <p> If the status for the device was updated immediately , both conditions would become true and the light at Q18 would go on and then brighten 10% . ( This is probably not what you want . ) <p> Status of devices changed by a condition are not updated until all the conditions are checked . <p> All conditions must be true for the event to trigger . <p> You can use the Status Change trigger to trigger events when the status of a device actually changes . Status changes trigger events immediately . <p> Conditions take the form : <p> IF ( condition ) AND ( condition ) AND ... <p> OR <p> IF ( condition ) AND ( condition ) AND ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose you would like a light to be turned off if it was left on for 30 minutes . Assuming the light was named " closet light " , the event would appear as : <p> IF closet light has been ON for 30 minutes then turn it off <p> In the Conditions area of the trigger screen for this event , select the " closet light " device from the Device Condition field , then select Has been on for in the Condition field . Set the time for : 30 . You would then add the closet light device to the events device list and set its action to OFF . This will turn the light off after it has been on for 30 minutes . This only works if you turned the light on from a switch that sends Z-Wave commands so that HomeSeer knows when it was turned on . If an event turns a device ON or OFF , HomeSeer knows the status . <h> Using Conditions to Control Devices Using Timed Offsets <p> Conditions can be used to delay the action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at 10:00 PM and then have a second light go on 30 minutes later . Create an event that triggers at 10:00 PM and turns ON light #1 . Create a second event and set its trigger to the following condition : <p> If ( light #1 ) ( HAS BEEN ON FOR ) ( : 30 ) <p> Set the action for the event to turn ON light #2 . You can add as many events as you like as offsets from the light #1 event . <h> About Time After/Time Before Conditions <p> Note that using the " before " and " after " time conditions are based on a 24-hour day . For example , if you would like the condition to trigger " after 9:00 PM " then the valid range is " 9:01 PM to 11:59 PM " . This makes sense since 12:00 AM starts a new day and is treated as " time 0:00 " . The condition " before 8:00 AM " is valid between " 12:00 AM and 7:59 AM " . The " day time " and " night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . <h> Or Conditions <p> The condition triggers if all the conditions in the condition list are true . It may be desirable to trigger the event if any of the conditions are true , rather than all of them . You can create OR groups , where all conditions in a particular group must be true , but the event will trigger if any group is true . This allows you to group your AND conditions together and OR them with other groups .

Conditions can be added to events when the Apply conditions field is enabled in the Trigger screen for that event . <p> Conditions are also a type of trigger . When used as a trigger , the condition set is evaluated at least once a minute - more frequently if one of the conditions is a device condition and the device changes .

This application is used by HomeSeer to control all audio functions , such as speaking , playing WAV files , and accepting voice input for voice recognition . The Speaker Client can be run on the computer on which HomeSeer is running or on any number of remote computers .

@@98239054 @2439054/ <h> Voice Commands <h> Devices and Events <p> There are many different voice control commands available in HomeSeer . Before discussing the device , event , and reminder specific commands , there are some time modifiers that apply to each of those which should be discussed first . In all of the format descriptions listed here , words or phrases enclosed in brackets ( and ) are optional . Multiple choices of required words or phrases are shown enclosed in &lt; and &gt; symbols . For example , the phrase diagram " Turn the light &lt;on off&gt; " indicates that you can speak Turn the light on , Turn light on , Turn the light off , or Turn light off . <p> The General tab of the Setup pages has three settings related to voice commands and are : <p> Speak Recognized Voice Commands When this option is set to Yes , commands that you speak are spoken back to you by HomeSeer . This is not a confirmation , the command is carried out , but this will let you know if HomeSeer heard what you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice commands ( e.g. Turn On All Family Room Lights ) If this option is set to Yes , you will get a confirmation question prior to HomeSeer carrying out any " All " location device commands . <p> " Confirm " In " and " On " voice commands even if the device confirmation is turned off When this option is set to " Yes " , a command such as " In 20 minutes turn on the kitchen light " will be confirmed even if the kitchen light device is not set for voice recognition confirmation . <h> Time Command Modifiers <p> Many of the commands the system supports allow you to delay the start of the command or provide a time period until the command is reversed . These are time modifiers and take one of these forms : <p> Future Time Period <p> in LONG ... LONG ... <p> Example : in 20 minutes in 2 hours <p> Duration <p> for LONG ... LONG ... <p> Your computer 's globalization settings will replace the above month names with the ones used on your system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month on the twenty second <h> Device Commands <p> In the device properties for each device , enable this option ( checkmark visible ) if you want to be able to control the device by voice . A voice command will be created in the following formats ( Note : You can also specify confirmation of voice commands per device on the device properties page . ) <p> Example : shut off all family room lights turn off all first floor lights turn off all first floor family room lights shut all master bedroom lights off <h> Event Commands <p> Events allow you to configure the voice command for the event in the event properties . You can trigger an event to be run by speaking the event trigger command , or using the syntax below with the event name . Events do not have to have a voice command , but if you wish to command them by voice or by voice using the event name , then the event must be enabled for voice command via microphone , telephone , or both . If you enable an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice command , you will still be able to run the event by voice using the event name . <p> By event command <p> event command string <p> By event name <p> run event event name <h> Reminder Commands <p> Reminders use the dictation capabilities of the voice recognition engine to allow you to speak anything after the reminder keyword(s) . You should be aware , however , that the VR dictionary will not have some words that you may wish to be spoken such as proper names . For example , the dictation engine would not recognize ' George ' , and although they sound alike , the name Harry would be recognized as hairy . HomeSeer Technologies may provide a way for you to add words to the dictionary at a later date . Reminders only work with the time modifiers above - they can not be spoken by themselves . Here is the syntax for a reminder without the time modifier : <p> &lt;reminderremind me&gt; &lt;tothat&gt; dictation list <p> Example : remind me to go to the store remind me to pick up the dry cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Voice Reminders " configuration page , you can set up reminder labels and associated destination remind methods . For example , you can create a reminder method where the label is " my wife via phone " and configure it to deliver the reminder via a phone call . If this is set up , then the syntax for reminders becomes : <p> &lt;reminder for labelreminderremind labelremind me&gt; &lt;tothat&gt; dictation list ( ' label ' in the above is replaced with one of the voice reminder names/labels that you created on the Voice Reminders page . ) <p> Example : remind my wife via phone that it is time for the appointment reminder for Karen to please stop at the store and get some eggs <h> Cancel Commands <p> When a time modifier is used with a device or event command , it will result in an event being created in HomeSeer to carry out the command . These events are created in the " Delayed Voice Actions " group . You can use the HomeSeer Web UI to delete these events or run them earlier , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , use the cancel commands described here . These commands will only cancel future device and event commands that were created with a voice command ( i.e. Only the events in the Delayed Voice Actions group . ) <p> Example : ( assume an event called " Party Mode Start " has a trigger command of " Let 's get the party started " cancel the event Party Mode Start cancel Let 's get the party started cancel the delayed action for master bedroom light <h> Putting It All Together <p> The device , device all , and event commands all operate standalone as well as with certain time modifiers . The reminders only work with a time modifier . Here is the list of all of the commands with the time modifiers they can work with - this is the list of all of the voice command types supported in the system ( telephone voice recognition adds voice commands for working with mailboxes and messaging and are listed elsewhere ) . <h> Device On/Off , Dim , Status and " All " Location Commands <p> Command <p> turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of the kitchen light <p> All Command <p> shut off all first floor lights <p> Future Time Period Command <p> in 20 minutes turn on the kitchen light <p> Future Time Period Command Duration <p> in 20 minutes turn on the kitchen light for 2 hours <p> Future Time Command <p> at 6 PM turn on the kitchen light <p> Future Time Command Duration <p> at 6 PM turn on the kitchen light for 20 minutes <p> Future Day Future Time Command <p> on Wednesday at 4 15 PM turn on the kitchen light <p> Future Day Future Time Command Duration <p> on Wednesday at 4 15 PM turn on the kitchen light for 30 seconds <p> Future Date Future Time Command <p> next month on the twenty first at 3 in the afternoon turn on the kitchen light <p> Future Date Future Time Command Duration <p> April first at 11 AM turn on the kitchen light for 45 minutes <h> Event Commands <p> Command <p> run event Party Time <p> Future Time Period Command <p> in 20 minutes run event Party Time <p> Future Time Command <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future Day Future Time Command <p> on Wednesday at 4 15 PM run event Guest Lighting <p> Future Date Future Time Command <p> next month on the twenty first at 3 in the afternoon Let 's get the party started <h> Reminder Commands <p> Future Time Period Reminder <p> in 20 minutes remind me to go pick up the kids <p> Future Time Reminder <p> at 6 PM remind Karen via phone to leave for the meeting <p> Future Day Future Time Reminder <p> on Wednesday at 4 15 PM reminder to stop at the cleaners on the way home <p> Future Date Future Time Reminder <p> next month on the twenty first at 3 in the afternoon remind me to bake a cake <h> Cancel Commands <p> Event Cancel Command <p> Cancel the delayed event Party Time <p> Device Cancel Command <p> Cancel the family room light <h> Messaging and Phone Voice Commands <p> If you have HomeSeer Phone installed , there are additional commands available to work with voicemail messages and to place calls using the information in your HomeSeer Phone Address Book . <p> When you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional command available that is not available via the microphone , and that is " help " - speak this to get a list of the basic commands you can use while accessing HomeSeer via the phone . <p> After accessing HomeSeer via the phone using the local-access method ( pick up a phone in the house and press the pound # key ) or from a phone outside the house ( * and # when you hear your greeting , then enter a mailbox passcode when prompted ) , here are the commands available to you : <h> Messaging and Phone Voice Commands <p> To leave a message for somebody in their voice mailbox <p> Syntax : Leave a message for ( mailbox name ) Example : " Leave a message for Mom " You can abort the recording at any time by pressing any key on the telephone keypad .

@@98239061 @2439061/ <p> Just wondering if there is a way , or if I am missing something simple , to where I have an event turn a light on and then after X time it will restore it back to it 's previous state ? An example would be with dimmable Z-wave switches . <p> If I have the kitchen lights currently set to 50% and I get a phone call ( tasker linked to HS3 ) I 'd like to have the lights kick up to 100% , then after the call is ended the lights go back to the " previous state " , in this case 50% or whatever it may have been . <p> This is a totally made up example , but something I 'd like to have happen but with the event engine it does n't allow this ( from what I can see ) .

In the Events below are one example . I built a Virtual Device that mimics a dimmer . I used a double tap of the HS-WD100+ as a trigger for the first event . I used Spud 's Easy Trigger Action to store the current level in the Virtual Device . The second event is what returns the value from the Virtual Device to the dimmer .

Follow the steps below to add a device to the Remote Control Unit and set its node I 'd . <p> This section gives basic instructions on adding a device to the Remote Control Unit . See the documentation that came with the Remote Control Unit for more information on the features available in the Remote Control Unit , such as groups , scenes , and ALL ON/ALL OFF control . <p> Hold the Remote Control Unit close to the device with the top of the unit pointing toward the device and the units buttons facing up so that you can view them .

( This device will be added to the group number " 1 " and will later be controlled by pressing this key . Buttons numbered " 1 " through " 6 " are speed buttons that give you quick access to your most-used devices . ) <p> While pressing the 1 button on the Remote Control Unit , press the button on the front of the plug-in module . If using a wall switch , press the top or bottom of the switch ( not the cover plate ) . Pressing the button or switch sends a signal to the Remote Control Unit indicating the presence of the module or switch . The Remote Control Unit will determine the next available node number and will transmit a signal back to the device to set the device to that node . <p> The device and the Remote Control Unit are now synced each knows the node assigned to that device so when you press the 1 button on the Remote Control Unit it will transmit a signal to that device and the device will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any other Z-Wave devices you have . Step 3 will change slightly after you 've programmed the six available speed buttons . For this step , you 'll need to press the MENU button on the Remote Control Unit once .

At this point , continue to Step 4 . <p> Write down the devices as you add them to the Remote Control Unit . The list will be useful when naming the devices in HomeSeer.

I do n't  want them to come on at all . <p> I have not been able to figure out why Jowihue turns on lights off . <p> I have gone into the Bridge Maintenance menu , Scenes and deleted all but my Den scenes . No change . I have given the Den scenes unique names like Reading Den to make sure they were not common to the bedroom scenes . <p> I am at a loss as to how to get Jowihue to be room specific when triggering a scene and turning on Hue lights <p> So am I. I would expect the scene on the bridge to only control the lights that are used by the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hue app for a long time , as I am no longer using the Hue app . <p> Could you do a test for me ? Activate the Hue app scene ( make sure all other lights are off ) and then go to the creativity page of the plugin. ( * ) Choose to copy all current light settings . The plugin will then copy all lights that are on and will save their setting for future use . Check this new scene and remove all references to lights that are not needed in the scene . Once you have done this , change the event you are using to use the new created scene from the plugin . <p> Does it work correct then ? <p> Thanks , <p> Wim <p> ( * ) In case you have not yet used the plugin 's scenes , you might have to go to presets tab first and generate the demo set as the scenes tab has an issue with creating the first scene . By creating the demo set you can add new scenes to the scenes tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sorry for the late response . Tried what you suggested using the Creativity function . This does work normally . The problem definitely lies in the importing of the scenes from the Hue app . For me the Hue app is easier to use to create scenes than Jowihue . I can easily see and set colors and intensities when I am in the room . Be great if I could accurately import these scenes or at least edit them to use them . <p> Quick question . How do I delte the unused scenes that come up within the Set Scene list . I now have a very long list of scenes imported from the Hue app as well as those created by the plugin . Want to clean this up . <p> Sorry for my late answer . Deleting scenes has to be done by the app owning the scene . The plugin can not see what anothe app is doing with the scene and might mess things up for other apps . so I think you need to check if the owning app can remove those scenes ?

@@98239098 @2439098/ <p> Briefly : I have an outdoor motions sensor in the driveway . When it detects motion an event triggers which does some lighting stuff and also rings the Aeon Doorbell so I know a car has driven in . <p> Since it appears in device manager with an " On " and " Off " button , I just assumed I should send an off command a few seconds after it rings , so it is not left in the on state . Not that it really matters , I guess . <p> I get the error shown , and just want to understand why the command fails . Thanks . <p> You can determine how many times a tune gets played by setting parameter 2 to number of times to play . 1 Byte . <p> I set parameter 2 to 1 for all my doors , I just play a different tune for each door . <p> Also , if changing the tune for a different action , just setting parameter 6 to value x will automatically play that tune the number of times set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or off commands . <p> @racerfern , did you ever get you sound to work ? I noticed that the downloadable sound files within your link were MP3 , can anyone confirm that HomeSeer will play MP3 sound files ? Everywhere I look I see only WAV files being mention , and if it does how pray tell does one get them to work in an " Event " ? Is there a general topic that one can get eumcated on what formats work and do not work ? <p> MP3 files definitely work . Keep the files small as it seems files of 100k or more and the doorbell do n't like each other . <p> The screenshot show my events for playing a different mp3 based on which door is opened and the other screenshot sends a text to my phone if all the doors are closed but the doorbell rings . That way , if I 'm in the backyard or away from the house , I will know someone is at the door . <p> There are many other ways to achieve this , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle is that the bell sometimes plays one of the tones 3-4-5 times instead of just once . I know the issue is the bell but it 's tough to prove . <p> @racerfern , thanxs for the comeback . Looking at your screen shots I do not see where your playing sounds through HS , it appears that your commanding the Doorbell to play the associated sounds which makes sense . Not that I 'm an expert by no means . I was hoping you were play the sounds via speak function within a event action . <p> @MNB , you are correct . I play the sounds through the doorbell . I have a ranch house so I chose unique ringtones and I can hear them anywhere in the house . <p> I actually do n't use any sounds with my z-net or PC with HS3 since those pieces are in the laundry room at one end of the house along with a bunch of other electronic stuff . I 'm not sure where I could put speakers that would n't be obvious . That means running more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything else . It just does n't make sense to me for my needs and my layout . <p> @racerfern , the easiest way is to have wireless speakers is via SONOS speakers in key rooms that will allow you to both play your music individually and/or group speakers in real time via the SONOs App and/or be able to speak and/or play sounds via HS3 depending on what ever you can think of . In my case I use them to announce weather , calendar events , door lock status , announce birthday and Anniversary wishes .... get the gist . What that does in regards to your doorbell is it allows a much greater range of your door bell chimes and announcements with speaking words if you so desire .

With Ubi I can tap my phone and say " Trigger gate open " ( no " alex " required ) , and my gate opens while I am driving to the house blocks away . Any of my Alex commands work from my phone , controlling my Alexa at home . Ubi is the thing that has made the HS3/Alexa integration the most useful for me .

Server 2012r2 is the replacement . You can buy it in the Essentials variety or add the Essentials role to the other varieties . There is also a media pack that will allow streaming media just like WHS2011 . For home use 2011 might be a better choice as in its default configuration WSE2012r2 requires the client computers to join a domain . There is a registry change that can get you around that requirement . 2012 also takes over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave it up 24/7 . Depending on the variety you will also get Hyper-v with 2012 . It only comes with the Standard and Datacenter editions , but you can add the Essentials role to those version . Hyper-v is what drove me to switch . 2012 also has better handling of large GPT hard drives , offers ReFS and will support up to 25 client computer as opposed to the 8 of WHS2011 . <p> If you do n't need a lot of large drives or Hyper-v stick with 2011 . It is rock stable and a little easier to manage and comes in at a very reasonable price point . To go to 2012 Essentials will cost you substantially more and Standard substantially more than that . 2011 and 2012 have the same excellent client computer backup and restore strategies . <p> For a dedicated HS server what difference does it make that Microsoft quit supporting it ? If you can get the drivers you need it should work for many many years with no issues . I still have two PC 's running XP which as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it 's memory footprint and stability . <p> For a dedicated HS server what difference does it make that Microsoft quit supporting it ? <p> Good question . I 'd rather not make too many assumptions , so that 's why I 'm asking . Has Microsoft , in fact , quit supporting it ? I mean , is Microsoft at least earnestly doing bug fixes , or has Microsoft dropped it like a hot brick altogether ? I gather from S-F 's answer that Microsoft will be issuing updates . If so , that at least rules out the hot-brick scenario , but what kind of updates ? What about patching new security vulnerabilities that might emerge ? Also , will WHS11 be able to back up Windows 10 computers and beyond , and is that a reasonable expectation , or is it asking too much ? <p> In short , I 'm just trying to figure out the road map , so that I know where I should go from here , and what might trigger the need to move on to the next destination . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? " scenario that has my concern over even basic backups . I 've been using Acronis TrueImage for backups , but I 'm hoping to replace it with WHS-2011 . In the past , some years I would n't need to buy the latest version of Acronis , but other years it seemed I had to upgrade to the latest version because the old version could n't handle changes to the way Microsoft boots its OS ( more specifically , it could n't handle restoring a new OS so that it would be bootable ) . So , one concern is , from a backup standpoint , will I soon be facing that type of problem with respect to WHS-2011 ? Can WHS handle post-2011 UEFI changes and produce a fully bootable backup of a computer running Windows 8.1 for instance , or do I get access to files only and but not something I can boot up for disaster recovery purposes ? Maybe WHS2011 works just fine regardless , but that 's the sort of scenario that rendered the need to do upgrades on Acronis backup software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't allow Acronis to produce bootable backups , but a couple or so years ago instead required users to find some obscure files on their own to enable that . That 's when the whole Acronis thing started to fall apart , and on average reviews have been much worse ever since . <p> I was not aware of this . Many people are and have been using it with Very large drives . Like 60 TB + . Could you elaborate on this ? <p> My memory is foggy . I was able to use larger than 2tb drives and GPT on 2011 , but I seem to recall it was a bit of a kludge . You had to RDP in and could n't use the dashboard ( not a problem ) but there were some issues with permissions I think . I also think one of the service packs addressed some of those issues . <p> I had my 60tb and 30tb raid arrays working on 2011 , I just do n't remember exactly what the issues were that we had to find workarounds for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles large drives somewhat better . <p> So here 's an example " What difference does it make ? " scenario that has my concern . I 've been using Acronis TrueImage for backups . Some years I would n't need to buy the latest version , but other years it seemed I had to upgrade to the latest version because the old version could n't handle changes to the way Microsoft boots its OS , or it could n't handle restoring a new OS so that it would be bootable . So , one concern is , from a backup standpoint , will I soon be facing that type of problem with respect to WHS11 ? Can it handle all the UEFI changes and produce a fully bootable backup of Windows 8.1 for instance , or do I get access to files only and but not something I can boot up for disaster recovery purposes ? Maybe WHS11 works just fine regardless , but that 's the sort of scenario that rendered the need to do upgrades on Acronis backup software . <p> I 'm confused . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs on that OS then what is the problem ? I use a really really old version of Acronis on XP everyday with no issues . If and when I update that server I will update the Acronis version . As far as Windows 8 goes it was Vista II and thus the reason Windows 10 is coming so fast . I would avoid Windows 8 at all costs for a server type scenario . <p> My memory is foggy . I was able to use larger than 2tb drives and GPT on 2011 , but I seem to recall it was a bit of a kludge .

I guess a more correct statement might be that 2012 handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the issues with GPT were fixed in WHS 2011 . With V1 there were some registry hacks you needed to go through to use larger drives . It 's normal with WHS 2011 . I 've seen people pass huge ZFS arrays to WHS 2011 with no issue at all . <p> @ NeverDie , <p> WHS 2011 will get all of the security updates . It regularly gets the normal Server 2008 R2 updates as well as the occasional WHS 2011 specific ones . MS has never said that they will no longer support it , just that there wo n't be any further development . <p> For a dedicated HS server what difference does it make that Microsoft quit supporting it ? If you can get the drivers you need it should work for many many years with no issues . I still have two PC 's running XP which as far as I 'm concerned is the best OS due to it 's memory footprint and stability . <p> When the OP stated there would be no future releases of WHS2011 , that is true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported product and will be for quite a while . Windows XP and earlier are no longer supported , which is not a problem for a HomeSeer server , but Vista , Windows 7 , server 2003 , server 2008 ( at the core of WHS2011 ) are all fully supported O/S versions . It will be some time before WHS2011 is not supported . <p> I would also argue that XP is a very good O/S but it would not be my choice for a dedicated server . Put me squarely in the Windows 7 camp for now . It is very stable and makes a very good server , as does WHS2011 which is the same generation as a server model . <p> AFAIK that was V1 and the issues with GPT were fixed in WHS 2011 .

I just can no longer remember what it was about 2011 . Regardless , I agree that the 2008r2 kernel is proven , stable and will be supported for quite some time . And yes , I remember V1 , I had the maximum 32 x2tb drives on my V1 server and it worked fairly well , except when serving up Blu-ray ISOs it would freeze for a second or two about two time per movie . <p> Has anyone tried putting WHS 2011 on one of the HP MediaSmart servers ?

It is very stable and makes a very good server , as does WHS2011 which is the same generation as a server model . <p> That 's the one I am using . win7 . I was using WHS , but it was too restrictive for me . I loved that the original WHS had the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to WHS2011 , I purchased some drive pooling software . Then , again , as I mentioned I found it too restrictive and slow on the hardware I was using . I never used WHS WITH Homeseer . I 've only used Win7 for that ( since my original issues ) . <p> I now have it setup : Main server : Win7 running virtualbox and I have my drive pooling running on there . WHS ( Asus Easyhome ) : was TOO slow for WHS 2011 , so I turned it into a iSCSI extender running FreeNas ( or whatever they are calling it today ... NAS4Free ? ) . Then I take that as an iSCSI drive into my drive pool . Works really well . It has a DEDICATED connection to my server ( no switch ) and I get rates in the 200MB/s burst and 105MB/s sustained writes . Reads are about the same . This is significatly faster than when I was running WHS on that same hardware ( 50-60MB/s range ) . <p> Now I just have to reconfigure the UPS . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My UPS only lasted about 5 minutes . Originally purchased it to run my server for 30-40min ( so there would be time to shut down all the VMs ! ! ) . <p> Found that out this last week when the power went out for 5 hours . Luckily I installed a fireplace this year . Kicked that on for heat . Got the portable inverter out and had light . Had it lasted any longer I would have broken out the generator . Not a good thing to not have power for 5 hours in winter - with temperatures 16 degrees and dropping . <p> --Dan <p> Tasker , to a person who does Homeautomation ... is like walking up to a Crack Treatment facility with a truck full of 3lb bags of crack .

Luckily the Easy Home was made with all true server grade stuff - lots of hardware acceleration . So , it did not affect the perceived performance from external accesses ( accessing file shares ) . However , logging in , or running a remote backup was terribly slow . <p> I 'm much happier now that it is running FreeNas . What is great about that , if you change a few jumpers , you get write access to the onboard WHS recover drive . I just wiped that , placed FreeNas in there and that is what I boot from . All 4 ports in that box are now being used as a ZFS drive pool . The hope is that I will have similar capabilities as with the Drive Pooling software I am using on my main server ( StableBit Drive Pool ) . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more memory , still running like a champ .

This- program was one of the very first to offer remote internet access as well as voice control . As HS1 evolved , a software API was added to allow third party developers to create " plug-ins " or drivers for emerging technologies and products as they entered the market . In very short order , HS1 became the #1 selling home automation software in the US and many other parts of the world . HS1 remained in production until 2005 . <p> Embracing Z-WaveIn 2003 , HomeSeer became the first control system company to add support for a new wireless technology called Z-Wave . At that time , Z-Wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , homeowners can choose from more than 1,000 Z-Wave certified products including light switches and modules , thermostats , door locks , vater valves and sensors for temperature , humidity , motion , light levels and much more ! <p> Introducing the " Gateway " ControllerIn December of 2005 , we released our first home automation controller . The PRO-100 was a- fan-less , - disc-less- unit , equipped- with- HSPRO software and newly developed technologies ( HSSentry &amp; HSProtect ) for maximum- up-time- and reliability . At its introduction , the PRO-100 was the only ' gateway ' controller on the market , designed to combine the best- attributes of panel-based home controllers with PC-based home automation software . The PRO-100 was in production until 2014 as our flagship controller . <p> Our First Z-Wave ProductsIn 2006 , we released our first Z-Wave product . The Z-Troller was the worlds first ( and only ) portable , self-contained inclusion controller , allowing quick and easy setup for any Z-Wave network . Then , in 2007 , we released the HSM100 , the world 's first Z-Wave multi-sensor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These products have enjoyed wide distribution since their introductions and remained in production until early 2014 . <p> Power Meets Economy2007 saw the release of our HomeTroller line of products , starting with our Series 1 controller . The unit featured HS2 software , embedded on a small PC-like chassis . Although the original model featured active cooling and conventional disc storage , all subsequent models were designed to be fan-less and disc-less. to achieve better reliability and energy efficiency . Today , the current version offers very high levels of performance making it a- worthy- lower cost alternative to our PRO-100 controller . <p> Fully Customizable Interface Design SystemIn 2009 , HSTouch was released . This new interface design system featured a drag and drop screen editor ( HSTouch Desigtner ) that allowed dealers and users to create their own " projects " for deployment on a wide variety of conventional and mobile touchscreens ( clients ) . With HSTouch , users can create their own ' dashboards ' or custom control panels .

Each of these internal network segments allow you to apply respective firewall rules which should limit traffic to only access devices they require . My main point with this example is that you do not want your HomeSeer system and the cameras ( or other IoT devices ) on the same network segment as you want to protect your HomeSeer machine from possible illicit tampering . <p> Warning : Some folks here may call this overkill , but it suits my purposes .

Other technologies that use the Bonjour or the like network communication technologies fall into this same category . <p> Internal - LAN2 : **30;194;TOOLONG This internal network segment is designated for all sensitive home automation equipment such as HomeSeer , security systems , and the like . This network segment is protected from access from all network segments other than what ip/ports are needed . I would refrain from adding any IoT devices on this segment . You want your HomeSeer system and home security system ( for example ELK M1G ) protected . <p> Internal - LAN3 : **30;226;TOOLONG This is the internal network segment that is designated for all of your cameras or similar IoT devices . <p> If you hard wire the cameras then you would need a network switch to connect them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapter ( wall wart ) which you could power on/off at will via HomeSeer when you did not want them operational . The firewall rules for LAN3 are set such that only limited inbound/outbound network connectivity is available to the cameras on this network segment . <p> This network segment could also host another access point for any respective wireless camera - if you have them . You could combine this functionality with LAN4 if you wanted . <p> Internal - LAN4 : **30;258;TOOLONG This is the internal network segment for Guest WIFI clients and could host a captive portal .

A simple change of database schema between versions could really ruin your day if you have n't backed up the database and only the plugin files . The USB uirt plugin for hs2 used the registry for the ir keys so if you did a reformat you would lose the keys and have to relearn them , the only plugin I ever used that did that but just shows that some people do things differently .

The main reason all my indoor cams are connected to z-wave outlets is to appease the wife . No matter what I say , she still thinks that there is someone out there watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and keep funding for future HS purchases . <p> I do n't think I am in the minority here : One of the main reasons I have security cameras is to be able to check the house while I am away . To do this , they must be connected to the internet ! And that makes them vulnerable ! Not connecting to the internet is not an option . But disconnecting from the internet when they are not needed makes perfect sense to me ! <p> Years ago , my modem had a button on top . Press it and everything was disconnected from the internet . A simple and effective approach . <p> I think everyone on this forum could benefit from knowing how to minimize all hacking threats to their HA stuff . I for one am very interested in having HS3 automate a connect/disconnect method . I like the idea of z-wave modules on the cameras , but for me , this is not a viable solution . A single z-wave module ( maybe on the modem ) might be viable but that seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? How secure are our networks ? Like I said before , Blue Iris still seems fairly secure so you can access all of your cameras through it . I 'm sure ZomeMinder is similar in this respect .

Snort and pfblocker ( recommended by @Pete ) are cornerstones of my network 's security . In this instance you could configure a second VLAN and separate subnet . A good wireless access point ( I use Ubiquiti ) would host a separate wifi connected to the new VLAN . The wifi cameras would then be connected to this subnet .

The first ACL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second ACL would disallow communication between the camera subnet and the rest of the network equipment .

IMHO , it is not worth this much effort to prevent someone from hacking into my cameras . I really do n't care if someone wants to look at my front porch or driveway . <p> Is there some way that HS3 could turn off/on the port forwarding configuration in my firewall . If the camera ports are closed , I think they would be inaccessible right ? <p> I agree with a lot being said from all fronts on this thread . It does come down to how much risk are you willing to accept , and the effort needed to minimize that risk . <p> I think for 90 percent of us , keeping the cameras behind a NAT 'd router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective for the ease of effort/cost . Can it still be hacked ? Of course ... but takes some effort and most hacks are there to catch opportunity . <p> And if its made outta China , expect that its not secure at all and has a backdoor in it . There are ways around this too ( blocking outgoing traffic completely and go thru a proxy of sorts ) . <p> My setup for cameras is as follows and I do plan to do something with PFSense down the road as a precaution , but not because I have had issues ... yet <p> I just use cameras outside , I figure if I catch you on the camera outside going into my house and something is missing , I did n't catch the actual act , but I know who you are ... I do n't trust the sickos that hack cameras and get off in watching me walk around in my tighty whiteys ( nor do I want to subject that to the internet ) . <p> I have no port forwarding anymore , I use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use their servers to give me my camera feed . I do agree that HS is probably low on the threat risk of getting hacked in comparison to other companies like trendnet and foscam . <p> Is my setup completely secure ? No , but I have always looked at security as a whole as to level of effort to get whatever it is the bad guy wants . It 's just like the lock on my door ... with the window right next to it . Are they going to take the time to hack my zwave lock , or just toss a rock thru the window ? Is the hacker going to take the time to dissect my low level security , vs my neighbor just opening the ports and not changing the default passwords ? <p> It comes down to how paranoid are you , and what are you wanting to do about it . <p> I have my Foscam camera on its own segment with limiting firewall rules such that it can not go out and only my HS system is able to access it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HS can initiate the communication . In other words , the camera can not communicate to HS . <p> Of course the older Foscam cameras complete junk .

Additionally , if you are not going to spend the time double nat'ing between Router 1 and Router 3 and then creating routing rules to reroute outbound requests from Router 2 to router 3 you end up having to use whatever cloud hosted service the vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of layers of network not to actually protect the network from the risk the IOT camera poses . <p> my plan for my home security cameras includes : 1 . POE network cams , connected to a managed POE switch . 2 . All cameras will be hosted on a separate VLAN and will have network ACL rules that deny access to the other internal subnets , my guest network , and the Internet. 3 . I will have one NVR ( network video recorder ) with 2 IP addresses and will have access to the Security Camera VLAN and the internal infrastructure network . A. communication with the cameras will occur on the security camera VLAN IP address only on appropriate ports B. communication with the rest of the network will occur on the internal network VLAN IP address . <p> Any access to live/recorded videos will have to be done through the NVR 's infrastructure IP address . this segregates the cameras from my other network devices and the Internet.

This can also be done automatically by enabling Z-Health at the bottom of the Manage Z-Wave Interfaces page . Optimizing a single node is the act of the controller telling the node to discover which other nodes are neighbors to it . This is done when a node is added to the network , but changes in your home , your Z-Wave network , or even the atmosphere can change the signal strength of other nodes and whether they are still considered to be a neighbor to other nodes .

Several times in the last month I have seen the Z-Wave plug-in CPU usage spike and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% and when the Z-Wave plug-in spikes just the plug-in executable can go to 40-50% with total CPU at 55-65% . On the instances where I have caught it , the Z-Wave network has a longer delay , but so does everything else in HS ( Event Page and Event editing and Device Manager page loading ) . <p> I 've also been seeing sporadic delays in Z-wave devices turning on . Thought moving to the beta plugin 3.0.1.116 would help but I 'm not seeing any consistency in the issues or when they 're working flawlessly . <p> I 've been seeing a delays of as little as 5 seconds and as long as up to a minute but there is 0 errors or delays present in my logs . <p> Example : I have a light configured in my laundry room configured to turn on when the door sensor changes to open , and the light to turn off when the door sensor changes to closed . Upon the first open of the day , seeing a delay between 5-30 seconds . Once I close it though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No queues anywhere I can see . Almost like the door sensor needs to be ' woken up ' before events fire off correctly on it 's status change as far as I can figure . <p> Is there anyway to help try to narrow down where the issue is occurring ? Maybe some more verbose logging for the z-wave plugin somewhere that I 'm missing ? I 've had this system for a few years now and did n't experience any delays until this year when I added around 10 more physical devices . All virtual devices and events triggered off them seem to work with 0 delays that I 've seen . <p> I am still on .87 . Each time I try to go into the 100 series , I kept seeing crazy delays after a few hours of running . I 'm kinda at a point though that I need to update because of some fixes in the plugin , but I have n't been able to figure out the delays in the betas either . As it stands currently , if you are running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public release and I am guessing/betting your issue of delays goes away . <p> The light 's did n't actually turn on until the 4:12:59AM portion . Is there a difference when it 's written with a type of " Device Control " vs when it 's written with a type of " Z-Wave " ? That 's the only noticeable difference I see . <p> To further expand , I 've pulled some more logs and can see that no gap was exhibited between when the event fired and when the devices actually turned on . <p> With what I 've seen so far , I can see the 20 second difference between " Device Control " and " Z-wave " . It seems the " Z-Wave " portion actually turns them on ( which makes sense ) , but my event fired and matched all conditions so I 'm not sure what could have created that delay between the device control and z-wave portions . <p> I rolled back to the official release as well . I have n't noticed any delays as of yet , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay event I had was consistent with your observations , Device control from HSTouch , then zwave and actual control of the device much later . <p> Well I guess my idea did n't work . Sorry about that . The only other thing I could think of , you have a zwave node acting funny , which is a really tough thing to find sometimes . I 've had a light switch in the past that was starting to go bad , but things would work , most of the time , except when commands would get routed thru it before HS . I happened across a random error that pointed it out after months of pulling my hair trying to find the problem . It was causing delays everywhere in my system . <p> Try not to overlook the use of ' at least ' command in events ... for example if gate has been open for at least 5 seconds then trigger zwave device ! <p> All my delays of 5-10 seconds vanished completely after i did some common sense maintenance on my events . Did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zwave device over and over and over and over again ... <p> Using the becomes or exactly command dropped resources on zwave engine to minimum ! <p> Try not to overlook the use of ' at least ' command in events ... for example if gate has been open for at least 5 seconds then trigger zwave device ! <p> All my delays of 5-10 seconds vanished completely after i did some common sense maintenance on my events . Did not think that the same event would be triggering the same zwave device over and over and over and over again ... <p> Using the becomes or exactly command dropped resources on zwave engine to minimum ! <p> Do you mind sharing a sample event and it 's accompanying logs ? I ask this because in my current setup , I have a few events I need to trigger on state changes and would rather not adding a 5-10 second delay on their states for the action to occur . It makes sense in a lot of situations though .

@@98239186 @2439186/ <h> Updating from a Previous Version of HomeSeer <p> Updating is a simple process as we provide a small update installer program that will update your current installation . You can download the update installer from our downloads web page at www.HomeSeer.com . There are a points to note when upgrading to this version , see below . <p> If your using Z-Wave , there are a few things to know when upgrading to HomeSeer version 2.4 . The way HomeSeer represents devices for Z-Wave has changed . This impacts your current devices . The following needs to be done when upgrading : <p> Devices such as wall switches and plug-in modules should not require any changes , they should work as they did before . However , as HomeSeer is not the manufacturer of most of these devices , we can not be sure that all of these types of devices will be unaffected by this update . After the update , if any of these devices are not working properly , go to the device properties for the device and click the " Rescan " button - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as motion sensors ( HSM100 , ZIR000 ) , etc. or any other battery powered device , will need to be deleted and re-created . Delete all devices in HomeSeer that reference the specific Z-Wave device . For example , if you have a HSM100 , you probably have 4 devices . One named Motion , one for Light , one for temperature , and one for the battery . Delete all of these devices . Then press the button on the sensor to wake it up . On the ZIR000 , remove and re-insert the batteries , this will keep it awake . See the manual for any other battery powered device and perform any procedure that will keep the device awake for a few minutes . Now in HomeSeer , click on Setup , then Interfaces , then Manage . Click Import Devices . This should re-load your sensor and re-create the devices that represent your sensor . You will see a new device name Root Device . This is the actual Z-Wave device and you can use this device for configuration and optimization . This same procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more than one HomeSeer device created for it . Other devices include multi-button scene controllers . <p> If you have several events that reference one or more of the devices in a multi-device described above , then there is another procedure which may be used to aid you in finding and fixing the references to these devices to make the transition easier : <p> The devices that need some MANUAL INTERVENTION on your part for them to operate properly are the currently supported battery based sensors - the HomeSeer HSM100 , the ACT ZIR000 motion detector , the Hawking Technologies motion detector and door/window sensor . For these devices , you will need to delete all of the current devices associated with these sensors , and then use " Import Devices " to have HomeSeer re-create the devices . When you remove the devices , you will lose the ability to find the events that referenced these devices for triggers or actions , so if you use the sensors extensively and can not modify the events from memory , then please use this helpful tool : Go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion detector device or door/window sensor device - and go to its device properties . Using the drop-down list of node numbers where the node number for the sensor is displayed , change the node number to the entry at the top of the list - the blank entry - and then click " Save " to change the node number for the device to zero . This will effectively remove it from the system as far as HomeSeer is concerned without actually removing the device . After you do an " Import Devices " as described above and get your new set of devices created and have renamed them and set their location , you can click on one of the old devices , choose the device operation at the bottom of the page " View event references for a device . " and it will display for you a page with all events that reference that device in one way or another . On this page you can click on the events and modify them to use the new device . When you are done making the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page that is empty - you are done . You can now delete the old devices . <p> Device Values have changed for Z-Wave devices . Previously , if you used the value on the motion sensor the values were returned , for example , as 725 for a temperature of 72.5 . You would divide this value by 10 to get the actual temperature . If you used conditions to check for ranges , the range would be 0 to 100 for light . The ranges have changed to reflect the actual values that Z-Wave reports . The light level will be in the range of 0-10000 ( for light levels of 0-100% ) , and the temperature range will be in the range of 0-9000 ( for temperature of 0-90.00 degrees ) . Simply divide the value by 100 to get the actual value . <p> Z-Wave thermostat support has changed . Previously , we included a Z-Wave thermostat plug-in that needed to be installed to control Z-Wave thermostats . This is no longer required as support for Z-Wave thermostats is now included in the program . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interfaces page ( not required as it will not be loaded anyway ) . Delete the device in HomeSeer that represents your thermostat , then go to the **31;290;TOOLONG page and click Import Devices to re-load your thermostat . You may need to restart HomeSeer after this procedure as it will contact your thermostat when HomeSeer starts . <p> After modifying any of the devices using the procedure above , you will need to edit any events that used these devices . 
@@98239189 @2439189/ <p> Guys I have several outdoor Dahua IP cameras . If I turn On/Off the outside light near the camera , the camera will record this activity as Motion Detection . <p> the cameras are registered with my synology surveillance station . <p> Any suggestions in the way of logic or camera settings to avoid motion detection when lights go on/off ? <p> I use the motion detection capability of my Hikvision cams and had the same problem . I now set a virtual device to On a few seconds before the lights change state and then to Off again a few seconds after . I test for the state of the virtual device in my event stack that determines what to do when motion is triggered . This has solved that problem entirely . <p> However , after a long period of very few false triggers ( I use a trigger mask in the cam setup ) , yesterday I had false triggers multiple times during the day . It was the weather ! We had a mixture of sun and clouds and it was quite windy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger motion on the cameras . If this becomes a more constant problem I will probably go to a wired motion detector when I get around to replacing my alarm panel . Yesterday it was kind of funny as my Sonos kept on playing the doorbell chime and my 3 year old asked every time who was at the door . <p> so if i understand correctly , you disabled the motion detection on the hikvision camera , and used Homeseer to start and stop the recording based on your virtual device . <p> Sorry , should have been clearer and I needed to go take another look at the setup also ... <p> I am not actually using the motion trigger from the Hikvision cam , I am using the motion trigger from BlueIris s/w which is managing 4 cameras . This is highly flexible and means that I can normalise the behaviour between cameras from different manufacturers . <p> When motion is detected by BI , I have it set to send a JSON command to run a top level event in HS3 : <p> " Front Door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run multiple other events if those events ' conditions are true . One of those is my Sonos Doorbell chime event and I use the virtual device as a condition in that event . <p> I turn the virtual device on/off as actions either side of the lights going on or off in the same events that control the lights . <p> So , I am not preventing the motion trigger , just deciding when to ignore it and that 's just a few seconds . <p> From a recording perspective , Blue Iris only records alert clips when it detects motion - my choice . It also has a clever feature called MakeTime , that prepends 2 seconds of video before the alert . It has to record full-time to do this , but it only keeps the 2 most recent seconds available to stitch to the front of a motion triggered recorded file . <p> All of that said , I think the Hikvision cams can send similar motion trigger commands , it 's just that I found the BI config and functionality more streamlined - expecially across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So i am using Synology Surv Station in place of your BlueIris <p> so do you use the blue iris plugin to start and stop the recording based on motion detection ? <p> No , I am not using the BI plugin currently . BI s/w records every time the BI motion triggers and it 's saved offsite . I have the pushover plugin notify me and I can jump to the BI app on my phone to check the video clip if I want to . <p> There 's a huge amount of flexibility in the BI software and quite a lot I am not using like multiple profiles and schedules etc . I think the plugin provides easy integration with that type of functionality . 
@@98239190 @2439190/ <h> The Manual with Conditions Trigger <p> You can set the trigger to manual , which forces the event to be triggered either as an action in another event or by clicking the Run button in the Events screen . Manual events are useful as macros -- they define a set of actions that may be triggered by some other event . Sometimes , you need to have conditions checked on the event , even though it is being run manually by another event . This trigger type will allow you to do that . <p> When the Manual with Conditions link is clicked in the Event Trigger screen , the trigger is immediately set to manual ; unlike the other trigger types , there are no additional parameters that require a second screen . <p> If you wish to use conditions with the manual trigger , there are two additional steps to take : 1 . Click on " Apply Conditions " so that conditions can be added to the event , then add the conditions you wish to have checked when this event is set to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run Event action in another event , enable the Run Only If Conditions are TRUE option . <p> This is a powerful option to the manual trigger because it allows you to have HomeSeer perhaps try to trigger several events that run under certain trigger conditions , yet only the appropriate one ( according to the conditions ) will be executed . For example : You might have two events triggered by the act of disarming the security system . One turns on some devices in the home and raises the thermostat temperature , and the other turns on lights in the home . The latter event does not need to run during the day , so you could set up that event to be the type Manual with Conditions , add a condition that time is nighttime , and then check the option in your event triggered when the security system is disarmed to check the conditions on the other event . The result is that both events are triggered at night , but only one is triggered during the day .

@@98239194 @2439194/ <p> The amount of info on this HS message board is insane ! I am a noob looking to build an HS3PRO system to automate the house , yard , everything . I think I need to start with the hardware first . Is there a thread that has the latest HS3 hardware successes ? I 'm not sure if I want to buy an HS Home Controller or build my own and buy the HS3PRO software . I currently have an UnRAID server in a 19-inch rack . However , I typically let it go to sleep every night to save some wear and tear on the harddrives and CPU . What do others do for their HS3 controller , do most folks keep them running and awake 24/7 or let them sleep ? <p> I have a couple of fanless CPUs that use a couple of watts power . They run 24/7 , since I have events that run around the clock , as well as the logging of energy , temperature , and humidity data . The reason I have 2 is that I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated box for each . It has taken a long time , but I am almost there . <p> a ) With HS3PRO , you only get the plugins provided by Homeseer Technologies and not what you find in the updater ( which are mainly 3rd Party developers ) . b ) If you buy HS3/HS3PRO software for Windows , you get the Linux version thrown in as well . This is not the case for any of the controllers . c ) There are more plugins available under Windows than Linux. d ) You have to run HS3 24/7 ! <p> Bottom line , it really depends what you want to do . If you are happy just using a few plugins then you could use a Pi3 . If you are a tinkerer and want to be able to do anything , you should go with Windows . <p> Sorry to jump into this thread , but I am in a similar boat . Can you add more to your comment ( a ) ? What is the " updater " . <p> My requirements are basic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might dream up a couple of 12V relays I need to activate based on motion or another sensor . I 'd like to get a feed from one of my outdoor web cams to do something , but that is not critical . <p> So from all that I have read , the Pi based model seems totally adequate . I plan to buy the Homeseer hardware controller . My only concern is that Pi 's are known for corrupting SD cards . I will read some other parts of the forum here , there must be a way around that to save everything . <p> The updater is the main location to download plugins/add-ons for HS3 . You access it via the HS3 web server under Plugins/Manage . There are numerous other plugins on this board so you should search there too . <p> The examples below shows the plugins available under the ' Camera ' heading both under Windows and Linux ( which has less plugins available ) . If it is marked up as ' Homeseer Tech ' and you have HS3Pro , they are included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zee up and running . I have one indoor motions sensor turning on my basement lights . <p> I have searched everywhere , and it seems that OUTDOOR motions sensors are almost impossible to find ! ! I would think this would be hugely popular requirement to turn on outside lights , etc. with motion . <p> Can you recommend a way to trigger an event on outdoor motion ? I have some older X10 stuff , but am unable to read that traffic yet , even with the CM15 . <p> Hi Jon , My only concern is that Pi 's are known for corrupting SD cards . I will read some other parts of the forum here , there must be a way around that to save everything . <p> Note that on the Zee S2 version of HS3 they pointed the logs to a RAM drive instead of on the SD card which should help reduce the SD wear issue . I believe the DB holding device state etc. is still on the SD though . It 's fairly easy to back up everything in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the case , pop out the SD and copy the entire image to another SD card for disaster recovery . <p> I 'll toss in here , as was pointed out already , you will have to run HS3 24/7 - otherwise it does not work . <p> You also probably want to pick a favorite technology . While Homeseer let 's you tie into everything through plugins , some of the controllers are not good choices if for instance you decide to use UPB . As such , this could be something that could influence your decision . <p> For me , I run Homeseer on a Dell T110 server using ESXi . The Windows 7 install is virtualized . I 'll be moving over to a T20 server ( again running ESXi ) as I finish up converting over from HomeSeer 2 to HS3 . <p> Once you decide if you want a dedicated controller or not , the next is where to put everything ! That can also influence what you get . For instance , I have a 19 " rack with everything on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I 've been at this too long ... Old Pic 19 " rack That is my old Demm XPS266 with a Super Micro Motherboard . I think that old case is one of the best flowing cases out there . Of course , the T110 and T20 are rather superior ... but hey , desktop vs server . <p> If you go controller , HS 's are fantastic ... I use a HS Zee S1 just to control Z-Wave/HVAC ) . That ties back to the PC , so if there is an issue with my HS PC for whatever reason , the controller is still ... controlling ? Every once in a while , I take the SD Card out and DD back up the OS/et. all . I figure , if the box does for whatever reason , I can replace it rather simply by doing that . The same thing for my ESXi install . Just move the VM and any assocuated hardware to a new box . It is all a bit overwhelming . Keep asking questions , I have found this is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you wo n't be ridiculed , everyone on where are very supportive . <p> --Dan <p> FYI , if power is a concern , you probably will not be able to beat a controller . For me , my T110 used to use 35W of power , unless there was something that ran the Xeon processors high ( say transcoding a video for my TV ) . At that point it would run closer to 270W . Then , I added a rack of hard drives and lots of other things . I have not measured it recently , but I bet I 'm closet to 270W idle and who knows when it 's running full bore . Couple in that I added a T20 ... so I 'm just running the power up and up ! I will note that I am getting a lot of services for that money/power/cost . Things we use in my household , so I 'm okay with it . I just wanted to point out that a new PC server CAN be fairly competitive to a larger controller , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you run pfSense , 10 other virtualized servers and have a 10G network with 7 network ports on a controller ! ) . I digress , my point is the controller is just that ... single purpose . That would not have worked for me as my main system . However , as I said , I use one to control my HVAC ! <p> Tasker , to a person who does Homeautomation ... is like walking up to a Crack Treatment facility with a truck full of 3lb bags of crack . Then for each person that walks in and out smack them in the face with an open bag . <p> I used a HomeTroller S2 ( upgraded DOM/SSD to support HS3 ) for years , and it worked great . Recently , I started adding a few more plugins and saw I was starting to push it 's limits . <p> I re purposed an old , unused netbook ( specs in signature ) that I had stopped using as it had a very small screen.I swapped out the HDD for a SSD and updated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HS machine about a month ago . <p> It works great for running HS , even though it 's a 7 year old machine that was under powered even when I bought it new . The nice things about getting a laptop instead of a desktop or server are : - Screen , keyboard , etc already included . - Low power consumption - Built in UPS - Less expensive spec-for-spec than the same desktop <p> 99% of the time I interact with HS via the web interface or VNC , so I never really use the screen and keyboard , but having them there when I need them is nice . I leave the laptop closed , resting on a shelf on my equipment rack and use a USB-to-Serial adapter to connect my Ocelot . I have a 128GB thumb drive plugged in the side for nightly backups . I prefer to backup data ( HS directory , documents , important downloads ) and reinstall the OS when stuff fails , so I do not make a full backup . <p> The processor idles in the teens and rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can buy an extremely HS-capable laptop with benchmarks 2-3 times what my old machine can achieve for less than $300 ( I think I saw something for under $200 the other day ) . <p> CPU , RAM , and hard drive requirements are pretty low for HS3 . Currently , I run my HS3 standard on a raspberry Pi 3 ( 1.2 GHz quad core , 1 GB RAM , with a 16 GB flash card for disk space ) . I have 6 plugins running within HS3 and host a dozen extra applications on the OS . My dedicated memory usage is 390 MB of RAM . CPU utilization will sometimes spike on one of the cores but never stays there for more than a moment . Overall I barely see above 30% CPU Utilization . I bought a high grade flash card , and take regular images of the system with win32diskimage . I also run samba in the back ground on the server and copy the backups made by BLbackup to my home NAS on a regular basis . I did this because , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HS3 standard for linux on an RPI 3 , I am running my home automation server on a device that essentially sips power from a cell phone charger to run ( 12v , 2.5A , 30W ) <p> If you are going to buy a PC make sure you do n't skimp on the hard drive . A lot of PC vendors bundle a 5900 RPM 2.5 " hard drive with the PC . Those are terrible and will make your rig sluggish . Spend the money on a good quality Samsung or san disk SSD . <p> same goes for flash media on an RPI. do n't go cheap on the flash media . make sure that it has a speed class rating of class 10 , U1 or U3 . UHS card clssification of UHS or UHS-II . My preference is Sandisk . <p> whether you buy a controller , or build your own PC and install the software , create a backup routine and find a way to automate notification on failure . the last thing you want is to have a failure and lose all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration and plugins , some plugins require a Windows OS instead of Linux .

@@98239196 @2439196/ <p> So I am looking at this plug in now and I really like it . The Kinect is a cheap way to get a solid mic . Too bad it can not be run easily in different rooms without a PC . <p> Anyway my plan is to use a script to processes the VR using a database to match phrases , learn new ones etc . So I want to pretty much have the plug-in pick up the recognition phrase and then trigger a event passing all of the phrase as a variable . I know you have the different options like KinectVar0 , KinectVar1 etc . Is there a variable with the whole string unparsed ? <p> That is very helpful . The learning I am referring too is that I will be taking commands that do not match to the database and then logging them for review so that I can either map them to an existing response or create new ones . <p> That said I am running into a problem with using the variable . I could not figure out a syntax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event itself . So I tried to pull it in the script using hs.GetVar but I am only getting the first word in the string . Is this some sort of object or array instead of a string ? <p> again I 'm not sure I understand what you want to do , but I guess it 's not possible because the Kinect can only recognize predefined phrases that are set as " A phrase was recognized " triggers or device commands , so it ca n't really " learn " anything ... <p> I just tested the KinectLastVoiceCommand global var , and it works for me , it is set to the phrase recognized .

I 'm a little confused about what you want it to do differently . It sounds like you want it to ignore the motion sensors and just follow a strict schedule regardless if it senses someone is home ? <p> If that 's the case , with the temps and schedule that you have in combination to HS it is pretty simple . Because the temp you 've set for Sleep and Away are the same " 63 " . I would just create a HS event that sets the mode to sleep if you are still home past 7am . Then resume the normal schedule at 4pm or when you leave the house . In sleep mode the ecobee ignores the motion sensors and keeps it at the desired temp that you set . <p> My wife and I had a similar issue , when we first installed ours we had a set schedule that we followed but when it changed a little the following year ( wife &amp; I started getting up later and leaving the house later ) I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the time that it changed from Home to Away , the sensors saw that we were still home and changed it back to Home mode . To compound the issue , I had set the system to keep that change until the next scheduled change which did n't happen until 4pm that night . So the HVAC stayed on all day while we were gone . I changed the setting to " keep the change for two hours and then resume " which now adjusts for any possible tardiness leaving the house . I 'm in the process of implementing PHLocation and soon an HS connected alarm system which should eliminate any issues with changes in schedule . <p> Would that not defeat the purpose of using an Ecobee ? The motion is pretty spot on in regards to you being there or not . I never scheduled mine , just left it to learn on its own . Within a couple days it was pretty good .. Every now and then I get up in the early hours and its hot , but easy to adjust .

@@98239242 @2439242/ <h> Troubleshooting Speech Recognition <p> First , use a good quality microphone . Second , test your sound card by recording your voice with the sound recorder that is available in Windows . ( In Windows XP , it 's located by going to Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Entertainment &gt; Sound Recorder ) . If you can record your voice and it sounds fine when you play it back , then speech recognition should work . <p> If the computer refuses to respond to your voice commands , check the following : <p> Make sure the voice recognition is enabled in each Speaker Client that you intend to use to communicate with HomeSeer . <p> Check the HomeSeer Speaker screen to determine if HomeSeer is listening for the attention phrase or listening for commands . You can always say the attention phrase even if HomeSeer is listening for commands . By default , the attention phrase for each Speaker client is Computer . <p> Check the Event Log screen for startup error messages . An error message will also be logged for events that have improperly-formed voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Client . <p> Not all sound systems work properly with voice recognition . Some older 8-bit sound cards will not work at all . You need a good quality 16-bit sound card . If the recognition is not working at all , or is very unreliable , try installing a newer sound card . SoundBlaster cards work fine . If you ca n't record your voice clearly with your sound recorder , then recognition probably will not work . <p> Most laptop computers will not support voice recognition , especially older ones . Newer ones may work if you use an external microphone . <p> Microphones built into the monitor or laptop usually do not work . <p> If speech recognition was working before and it suddenly stops working , check any scripts or plug-ins that you may have installed recently for malformed voice recognition phrases that may have been added to the speech context . This can happen when the context is modified by using data , and the data has characters in it that are not allowed when defining speech recognition commands . <p> In the Windows Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then click the Settings button . In the Recognition Properties screen , disable the " Background Adaptation " option ; this setting can sometimes cause the voice recognition accuracy to decrease . <p> To get to the Speech Properties screen , go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Speech .

@@98239246 @2439246/ <p> BTW , if anyone has a better method for doing this , do n't hesitate to post it . Just do n't show me up too badly ! <p> OK , out of interest my way of achieving this is slightly different and NOT simpler but may or may not be better ( probably not ) . The reason I do it differently is because I have an irrational aversion to continuously recurring triggers of a few seconds . I know the event does n't actually trigger unless the condition is true but HS is checking every 4 seconds to see if it should run the event . So , I use a timer to trigger the blinking which is only started when the real device is set to ON . This method actually reveals a little bug in HS which I will report on in a bugzilla . <p> Instead of 2 events this way requires 3 events . <p> 1st Event ' Blinking On ' is triggered by the real device changing to ON . The actions are : Start a timer called ' Blink ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set to trigger on the timer becoming 2 seconds . However testing reveals that the timer is restarted when the event fires not when it should do after the 2 second wait . If you set it to 2 secs it wo n't re-fire because it has already reached 2 again when the event completes . By setting it to 4 seconds you get a longer pause for the first change from red to yellow then it continues blinking at 2 second intervals . <p> Whether there is any difference to the overheads on HS3 using this method I do n't know . It certainly would be insignificant for one device but I am setting it up for a number of motion sensors as I like the ' Motion ' graphic to flash . <p> Another little observation , is there any reason for the second 2 second wait at the end of your ' Set garage door indicator to flash .. ' event ? It appears superfluous . 
@@98239247 @2439247/ <p> I thought I saw somewhere on this board at one point a scrip that someone had written that would allow me to have HS monitor for things like a phone connecting to the WiFi . If anyone remembers where this is please let me know , my searching has failed . I would like to give this a shot at detecting when different people in the house are actually home . <p> That may be what I was thinking of , but I thought there was one that could use just a simple join or unjoin from the wireless network and allow HS to monitor . I may be thinking of Jon00 's Bluetooth . <p> But what would be neat would be if I could setup something like a DHCP reservation for each phone , then put that IP in and have a Virtual Device that changed status based on whether or not that IP is live . <p> That may be what I was thinking of , but I thought there was one that could use just a simple join or unjoin from the wireless network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jon00 's Bluetooth . <p> But what would be neat would be if I could setup something like a DHCP reservation for each phone , then put that IP in and have a Virtual Device that changed status based on whether or not that IP is live . <p> I could then trigger events off those devices status change . <p> I wanted to do this same scenario but would n't it require a constant ping to that address to see if it 's connected or not ? <p> Yeah , I think you are right Rupp . It would have to be something on the phone itself that can send an email or text based on getting home or leaving home . Which brings us back to Snavl Lattitude , which is simply too laggy for what I would like to do , I used it in the past and while it is really cool , the Google side of it takes too long too update . <p> I wanted to do this same scenario but would n't it require a constant ping to that address to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultramon to do this .

I do n't do much with it as unless you set the phone to stay on , bad for battery life , it connects and disconnects often enough to be annoying if you have it run an event or TTS of some sort . <p> Why not have a virtual switch to indicate presence which turns on when the phone is connected for x minutes and does n't turn off until it 's disconnected for z minutes ? <p> I use Jon00 's RCCNM package to do this . I set a static IP assignment for each of the devices I wanted to monitor ( e.g. iPhone ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script every x amount of time ( in my case 1 minute ) and it updates the HS device when the IP address is found or not found . <p> Further to that , since the RCCNM package looks at MAC addresses , you do n't actually have to make the devices static , you just need to change a setting to say it is a Dynamic IP address and it will look for the MAC instead of IP address . <p> Works quite well , I have been very impressed with the Script . <p> I am not aware of anything that is dynamic and automatic ( e.g. as soon as the phone connects it updates realtime ) , if you had an android phone you could probobly use tasker and a profile ( when phone is connected to X wifi , or not connected to x wifi update device value through http call ) <p> A friend was telling me about the Nest thermostat and claimed it tracked your presence using a smartphone and used that top help determine your home/away schedule . While I know of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed one of the things it does , is there anyone here who knows how it does this ? Maybe the same technique could be applied . <p> Why not have a virtual switch to indicate presence which turns on when the phone is connected for x minutes and does n't turn off until it 's disconnected for z minutes ? <p> I did try that at one point but the phone connects/disconnects were not steady enough and the timing was a mess , especially if I was in for the evening or a whole Saturday . Using the phone for a call or to check email set the timing off so that it was inconsistent . These days I use RFID tags in the cars for knowing who is home and who is n't . Since this is n't a walking kind of area if the car is here so am I. I still use Ultramon just for other things these days . <p> I use tasker to detect if I 'm connected to my home wifi , and update a virtual device in homeseer using tenHsServer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone but it takes a while to not detect the Wi-Fi . How long does it take for HS to know you are gone ? <p> I do a presence with Tasker on my daughter 's phone so I know when she leaves for and gets home from school but am using GPS to do this . Unfortunately that sucks battery life and I would get false readings when the satellites would be less accurate . I have a small radius set so I can tell if she goes to our house or the neighbor 's . So I turn off her GPS between 5 pm and 8 am and Tracker does not believe she has left . I could detect her lack of connection to the Wi-Fi and turn GPS back on if I wanted to get readings during these of hours . My phone is an older one though and battery life is our enough without turning on the GPS . <p> I use ultramon to do this . All the devices in my home have a static/reserved IP address . I do n't do much with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for battery life , it connects and disconnects often enough to be annoying if you have it run an event or TTS of some sort . <p> Yep , I tried to do the same thing , but the connect/disconnect drove me crazy . And sometimes the connection lag defeated the purpose . <p> More about using an RFID tag ... is there a plugin to set events based on RFID proximity ? How far can the car be for detected presence ? It might make for an interesting event in a multi-car household .. if car1 or car2 or car3 or car4 leave , turn on alarm etc <p> Yeah , that was my initial plan Rob . I was going to leave an RFID tag in each car and use that as a determinant of whether or not we were home . The problem is that we also have a gold cart that we use to take the kids to and from school and such , so I have no good logic to use to determine for sure . If I can get RFID tags that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they tend to be bigger than I would like to carry . <p> I can see the difficulty .. With me , my daughters drive their own car . Coming and going to university as much as they do and not to mention the ' rents ' who come and go to work , I could see this as a viable solution . Now to figure out where I can get rfid tags and if there is a plugin or method to detect them is my challenge .. <p> The tech that you shoul dbe trying to use is NFC , RFID typaclly is NOT for distances greater tehn a few inches . RFID uses magnetic feilds to generate enough power t transmit the it 's data . When the tag passes through the feild it acts as a generator and wakes the chip up to transmit , much like prox cards . <p> NFC in most phones is always on and would work real well . I just do n't know of any receivers that could be integrated into HS , but then again I have n't really looked .

Once a port is opened , it remains open until the CloseComPort function is called . The port is not closed when the script terminates . However , the port will close when the application terminates . <p> In previous versions of HomeSeer , the OpenComPort function was limited to COM ports 1 to 8 and OpenComPortEx was for ports above 8 . Beginning with HomeSeer Version 2.0 , there is no limit on the number of COM ports , so these functions can be used interchangeably . The " Resource " parameter in the OpenComPortEX function is not used in HomeSeer 2.0 , but the parameter is included in order to support scripts created with older versions of HomeSeer . <p> If you need to control the hardware handshaking signals Request To Send ( RTS ) or Data Terminal Ready ( DTR ) , please refer to the SetComPortRTSDTR command . <h> Parameters <p> Parameter : port Type : integer Description : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is returned if the port is already open or is not installed on the system .

It is up to the called function to call GetComPortData to actually get the characters . <p> 1 = strings mode <p> This mode buffers up characters until a terminator is received . At this point the specified script and function are called with the data . This mode makes it easy to deal with devices that send text data terminated with known characters . To specify the terminator characters , see the term parameter description below . If you do not specify a terminator , the default terminator of carriage return and line-feed ( CrLf ) are used . <h> Port Data Handling Script <p> This parameter is the name of the script that will be called when COM port data arrives .

@@98239250 @2439250/ <h> Formatting Voice Commands <p> There are some tricks you can use to format voice commands . <p> For instance , say you would like to give a command that changes your television to a specific channel . You could do this by creating a voice command for every possible channel , but that 's impractical . Instead , your voice command can contain ranges of words . The recognition engine will accept any one of the words . The command that will change your television to any channel would look like this : <p> TV channel ( 0123456789 ) + <p> This configuration will accept any command like " tv channel 0 1 " , or " tv channel 1 3 6 " . You can substitute the actual word for the number in the command like this : <p> TV channel ( zeroonetwo ) etc . <p> It works the same either way . <p> Nested parentheses " ( ) " and brackets " " are not allowed . For example , the following configuration will not work : ( hello(billsue) ) <h> Special Characters and Alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracket characters ( ) to indicate optional words and vertical bar characters , ( ) to indicate alternative strings . Alternates must be enclosed in parentheses . For example , " ( hello there hi ) " tells the speech engine to accept " hello , " " hello there , " or " hi " for the command . Remember to include appropriate spaces between the text that 's in brackets or parentheses and the text that 's not in brackets or parentheses . <p> You can use the star ( * ) operator to specify zero or more instances of the words included in the group or the plus ( + ) operator to specify one or more instances . For example , the following expression results in grammar that supports " try this " , " please try this " , and " please please try this " , with unlimited iterations of " please " : <p> please* try this <p> Note : Alternatively , a question mark ( ? ) in front of a word is the same as an asterisk behind the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format excludes " try this " because the + operator defines at least one instance of " please " : <p> please+ try this <p> The repetition operators follow normal rules of precedence and apply to the immediately preceding text item . For example , the following grammar results in " New York " and " New York York " , but not " New York New York " : <p> New York+ <p> Therefore , you typically want to use these operators with the grouping characters . For example , the following grammar includes both " New York " and " New York New York " : <p> ( New York ) + <p> Repetition operators are useful when you want to compose an expression that includes a repeated sequence such as a phone number or specification of a list of items : <p> call LONG ... <p> I 'd like ( **32;353;TOOLONG baconmushroomsand ) + <p> Although the operators can also be used with the optional square brackets grouping character , doing so may reduce the efficiency of the Speaker Client as it processes the grammar . <h> Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support word spotting . Word spotting is where you tell the speech recognition engine to ignore words spoken in this position in the phrase ( sometimes called garbage words ) . When you use ellipses , the speech engine recognizes only specific words in the string regardless of whether they 're spoken with adjacent words or phrases . For example , if you set this property to " check mail " , the speech recognition engine will match phrases like " please check mail " or " check mail please " to this command . Ellipses can be used anywhere within a string . <p> Be careful using this technique as voice settings with ellipses may increase the potential of unwanted matches . <h> Dictation <p> When you need to recognize one or more of several possible words in a row , and you do not know how many of these words will be spoken , you may wish to enable the dictation mode of the voice recognition engine . The dictation mode is not designed for the purposes of dictating a memo , but rather for situations such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for the dictation functionality is the sample shopping list script that is available from the HomeSeer Updater . Click here for more information about the dictation tag in voice recognition . <h> Tips and Suggestions <p> When defining the expression for your command , include at least one word that is required ; that is , avoid supplying only optional words . <p> Make sure that the word includes only pronounceable words and letters . For numbers , it is better to spell out the word than use an ambiguous representation . For example , " 345 " is not a good grammar form . Similarly , instead of " IEEE " , use " I triple E " . <p> Omit any punctuation or symbols . For example , instead of " the #1 $10 pizza ! " use " the number one ten dollar pizza " . Including non-pronounceable characters or symbols for one command may cause the speech engine to fail to compile the grammar for all your commands . <p> Make your voice parameter as distinct as reasonably possible from other voice commands you define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands , the more likely the speech engine will make a recognition error . You can also use the confidence scores to better distinguish between two commands that may have similar or similar-sounding grammar .

@@98239259 @2439259/ <p> The annual post about DMX control from HomeSeer is probably about to come up with Christmas and the like . Having a bit of an interest in lighting I do have some DMX fixtures and have built some small interfaces in the past to control DMX over a serial signal which can in turn be used from HS . My concern all along was that other interfaces could end up quite expensive , have no control method or involve building something . Also to control lights effectively ( like fades , shapes , colour mixing ) is either going to be difficult to do from the HS UI without significant effort or realistically not what you would perhaps want HS side-tracked with dealing with . Perhaps it would be fine for simple commands but my concern was always that it could end up quite resource intensive for HS to have to cope with if it was not done right . <p> I set about trying to find the simplest and cheapest way to do it from HS and considering that DMX is in reality only a RS485 serial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to RS485 converters out there and some people are already using these with some DMX software . I settled on a USB converter that had the FT232RL driver and a MAX485 differential driver ( as per the attached ) , cost seems to slightly vary but I got mine for a bank breaking 2 ( $2.50 ) . <p> These boards will work with a freeware software package called FreeStyler ( http : **33;387;TOOLONG ) if you specify the interface as the " Enttec Open DMX " option . FreeStyler has a TCP server running on port 3332 and can accept a whole host of commands via that port , a full protocol list is available when you install FreeStyler in the documentation directory and it seems fairly powerful . I figured that really if you wanted to control DMX lighting from HS you should do the programming in an application especially built for the purpose ( ie FreeStyler ) and program that application to do the hard work for you in terms of the sequencing . FreeStyler supports sequences and whilst this is not a tutorial on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much myself ) you can have up to 20 sequences programmed in , these sequences can loop or do any number of things . <p> As there is a TCP control port it is therefore possible to control FreeStyler from HS with a script , the only options I added was to start/stop a sequence rather than any actual direct control of the lights themselves ( as that is part of the sequence ) . Here is a script that should work , you would however need to do the following ; <p> 1 ) Change maxScenes to a value that you wish ( default is five ) , set to 20 if you anticipate using all the scenes . The idea is that it will create as many devices as you set this value to . 2 ) Run the " StartScript " routine once to create the devices , then ensure that you have this set to run when you launch HS by placing a hs.runscriptfunc command in your startup.vb file . This ensures that the script is run when the devices are changed ( due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) Change the IP address at the top of the script to the PC you are running FreeStyler on , the added benefit of this is that FreeStyler does not even have to be running on your HS PC. 4 ) Program the sequences in FreeStyler for your lighting setup 5 ) When you start/stop the devices the sequences should run , providing FreeStyler is running , check the logs if this does not happen . <p> This is not meant to be an exhaustive method or a polished method , I thought I would just post a way to do it because it comes up every now and again and I think this method ( as in using a third party app ) is probably cheapest and the most powerful method as you get the advantages of the programming from that application . If you wish to send a TCP command directly to FreeStyler there is the sub of SendCommand that will be happy if you pass it the TCP argument and code from the FreeStyler documentation .

Main 2 Homeseer boxes are still running on Windows server 32 bit . <p> Homeseer on Linux is just a copy of a directory / subdirectories utilized for Homeseer . There is no installationl . <p> I have not read anything about database format incompatibilities . The move out of a base of Microsoft Access to SQL had already started a few years ago with Homeseer 2 . <p> I am also ( have already started a while ago ) playing with " lite " versions of Windows 8-10 . Initially testing it on my O2 Jogglers with 512Mb of internal memory with a 16Gb SSD drive . It runs fine but not really quick though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running HS3 on Linux , it is moving a working system from Windows to Linux . A year or so ago when I started messing with HS3 ( leaving my working system on HS2 ) I started building a new system on the Pi , firstly using a Zee image and then full HS3 when mono got up to version 3.2.8 . However , due to other factors , I needed to go with a production system on Windows . I was unsuccessful transferring the half built system from Linux to Windows . I ca n't remember exactly what the problem was now as it was nearly a year ago . HS3 was going through a lot of beta problems at the time so I decided it was anyway a better idea to start from scratch so I did n't persevere with the transfer . As soon as I had HS3 reasonable stable I closed down my HS2 system . Now I am considering moving back to linux but I do n't want to rebuild a production system from scratch ( lots of devices , lots of events , HSTouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if anyone has successfully moved a working system from Windows to Linux . Steve <p> Thanks Pete . My problem is not with running HS3 on Linux , it is moving a working system from Windows to Linux . <p> Well , now I have a Raspberry PI-2 it seems like time to revisit HS3 on the PI having experimented with it many months ago . The PI-2 should be better suited to running full HS3 not just because of the quad cores but double the memory should mean the issues with plug-ins and mono memory usage will be improved . <p> I installed mono and HS3 ( 3.0.0.149 ) and got HS3 fired up and running OK . I also installed the HSTouch , ZWave and CM15 plug-ins , again with no problems . However , this is n't much of a test , I really want to try it out on a full operational system . <p> I temporarily disabled the plug-ins shut HS3 down and copied the following files across from my W7 installation as a start : HomeSeerData.hsd , Energy.hsd and the .. /Data/Z-Wave folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it started to read the HomeSeerData.hsd database : 11:33:29:1042 : Startup-&gt;Loading configuration file ... 11:33:29:1557 : Database-&gt;Opening ( Mode=Read Only ) up HomeSeer database /home/hs **31;422;TOOLONG 11:33:29:2268 : Error-&gt;DeSerializing object ( byte ) : Could not find type ' System . **30;455;TOOLONG ' . Source=mscorlib It carries on in the same fashion with many more of these errors . <p> Now my W7 version is 3.0.0.152. but the latest Linux version I could find was 3.0.0.149. , but I do n't think that is the problem . It would seem there is some incompatibility between the Windows and Linux database files causing these deserializing errors . It 's probably not the database files themselves that are incompatible but the serialized data that is stored in them is different between the Linux and Windows systems . I have seen this hinted at in other threads but no official comment from HST . <p> That 's me stuck for now . Anybody any ideas ? <p> I have no stomach for building a whole system ( many devices , many events ) from scratch just to test out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Plenty of other projects to play around with on the PI .

The databases are compatible it 's just the data stored is not . <p> It would be good if someone from HST could comment on this . I 'm sure in time a lot of people will be considering migrating a system from Windows to Linux and at the moment it just is n't possible . Somebody who understands the way the objects are serialized in mono and Windows could probably write a conversion tool to modify the information stored in the database . <p> I tried moving a DB between systems long ago and it worked , but there might have been some changes since then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on MONO but it is on Windows . I would have to do some testing to see where the issue is , but the code is the same between both systems so it does not make sense that it would fail , otherwise Linux would not be able to read the DB .

I 'd really appreciate you giving it a try . Steve <p> Hi , Any progress on this subject ? I tried to copy files from my Hs3Pro on windows into the Hs3proLinux on the PI2 . It ended up by starting all over again with a clean install . Since I luckily could import the z-wave devices it means I only have to recreate all other devices and events from scratch . Still it would be nice if it could be done by copying the db form the windows system into the linux set-up . <p> A strange thought but would n't it be possible , like for mysql editing the db files manually and than upload them again ? <p> Hopefully some of you managed to get this working ? Love to hear if and how ! I am sure I 'm not the only one here <p> Unfortunately , this does not work well . There is an issue between Windows and MONO where some data structures are not compatible . You can copy over your HS HSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it should load your devices , but it most likely will not load your events . This is an issue I would like to resolve and its on the todo list .

@@98239272 @2439272/ <p> This HowTo describes a procedure that allows you to copy a working HomeSeer configuration to another computer . <p> Many plugins store configuration informaiton in INI files .

Leaving them out insures that they will at least run as a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configuration file is copied over also . By default , your config file will be named " sample.mdb " , unless you saved it under a different name . Normally , this file is located in the config folder , so it will be copied in step 2 . But its possible that you saved it elsewhere . If so , copy it over to the new system and save it in the config folder . From the HS web setup you can only load config files from the config folder , so it makes sense to leave it there . <p> 4 ) Run HS , and look at the devices page . Since you copied your config folder from your old system , HS should automatically open your old config and load all of your plugins . See if all of your devices and events are there .

This includes all plugins that should be enabled . <p> If all looks ok , you should be running the same configuration as your old system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related , such has COM port settings , etc .

I will upgrade to hs3 in a Linus box or Windows embedded box when I get home again but for now I can say that the little pi runs the house brilliantly . <p> I also came from vera lite 's and edges ( still own but do n't use 3 of them ) <p> I was already running blueiris on Pc 's so I added the z-wave stick and HS3 windows and have been happy ever since . Just got HStouch and I like it but have issues with iPhones and the app . So it 's not perfect but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to much . Bought 3 plugins and HS3 and touch 50% off and z-wave stick . <p> I am coming from Vera Lite , Vera 3 and last a Vera Plus . As much as I loved what Vera could do , it has never been stable , and problems became unbearable when I switched to the Vera Plus . Nearly 4 months of daily email exchanges with Vera support , none of the problems had been solved in all this time . I had to redo my whole system 3 times , 70 devices , 4 big PLEGs . They then told me I had to start again . I had enough . Had the HS3 system now for a week , and finally turned my Vera off yesterday . I still have not included everything , and I am just starting with some logic and timers . First impressions are great . I am very impressed what I can do with the events , how easy and flexible it is . And the system is super quick . Remote access with Vera was always a problem , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more stable with HS . <p> I 've ran my hs3 pi for a couple of months now . It 's doing things Vera could old do with loads of luup code and debugging . Vera was slow and not consistent . The only problem I have had is the micro sd card slot clip failed and the card popped out . The system still ran but no logging and I could access the gui remotely . <p> I too am in the process of converting over from Vera . Had a Vera 3 on UI5 for a couple of years . Had descent success with what i was doing ( pretty simple stuff ) . I took the plunge and upgraded to the Plus model not long ago , and it was a total disaster . All the warnings i read about dropping devices and issues with remote access in UI7 had all come true . I had looked at Homeseer several times in the past , but as was mentioned earlier , it was a bit pricey . The combination of the May sale and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase HS3 Pro , and so far , i 've been extremely satisfied with that decision . <p> I too am in the process of converting over from Vera .

UI7 is what did it for me too last year . <p> The software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get what you pay for and even the cost of the software and plugins does n't compare to what I have paid in switches . <p> I think the zee S2 is the closest HS has the Vera and most gateways for that matter . Although the zee is around 50 more that the Vera edge and only 14 more that the Vera plus it is way more powerfully and less time consuming to set up . Having he OR available in events is worth 50 alone .

@@98239280 @2439280/ <p> You can install the Aeon Minimote remote control two ways into your Homeseer network . It took me a week to figure it out and how it actually works . I thought I would put in one posting to save you a bunch of time . It all started when I wanted to dim my lights to whatever level I choose without using an HS3 event . Below are two methods you can add your minimote to the HS3 network.Method 1You will be sending your network information to the minimote ( Instructions later ) . Once this is completed a new object is added to your network . You can use the object to perform 8 events on any of the 4 buttons ( called scenes ) . You get 4 events if you do a " short press " and 4 more events if you use a " long press " . This allows for 8 events that can be used for controlling devices on your network . Of course you can configure different light levels/dim values but are limited to 8 . I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim the light . In order to do this you have to use Method 2 . Tip : Do n't  forget you can check the " status " of your device so you can use just 1 click to turn it on and off . If the light is " ON " , then shut it off . If the light is " OFF " , then turn it on . If you use this logic , you can get by using 1 of the 8 events . You also can configure your HS3 controller with this logic to dim your lights with one of the events . Logic : If the light is 25% dim set to 50% and if 50% dim set to 75% etc.I found a good article on the site which shows how to configure your minimote to use Method LONG ... <p> In **33;521;TOOLONG management : Actions : send network information to another controller <p> Press start in the HS screen <p> Press the " learn " key on Minimote <p> Wait while the info is transfered into the Minimote <p> Wait some more until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it created a new remote device , it 's done <p> Method 2With the second method you need to add the minimote to your network using the inclusion mode . When you use the " inclusion mode " you will only get 4 events from the minimote not 8 . That said , you will be able to hold down 1 of the 4 scene buttons and can dim the lights without adding any events to your Homeseer **27;556;TOOLONG sure your Minimote is up-to-date using your Windows PC . Skip this step if you know your firmware is up-to-date on your minimote . <p> a ) Download the firmware update for your region , you can find it at www.aeotec.com/supportb ) Once downloaded , open the applicationc ) Plug your Minimote into your Windows PCd ) Run the firmware update ( should be a big button on the application ) <p> Next1 ) Reset Minimote : Hold " Associate " and " Learn " until the lights stop blinking ( resets to factory settings - takes about 5-10 seconds ) .2 ) Take your Z-Stick and put it into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button on one side . A blue LED light around the button will begin blinking slowly.3 ) While the Z-Stick is in inclusion mode , position it within 1-3 feet of your Z-Stick . Now press the " Learn " button on the Minimote and observe the blinking LED on the Z-Stick . If successful , the LED light will glow solidly for about 2 seconds and then will begin blinking slowly again.4 ) From the web interface , use the pull down menus to navigate to the Z-Wave Controller Management page ( PLUG-INS &gt; Z-Wave &gt; Controller Management ) .5 ) Locate the " Z-Wave Interfaces " area and expand your Z-Wave Controller section . Open the " Actions : " menu and choose " Import Node Info from Controller and Scan Device " .6 ) Click the Start button below the Actions menu . Wait until you see this step was completed .

The LED on the minimote should show a reaction blink faster and turn solid for 1-2 seconds , then continue to blink . <p> 3 ) Now here comes the interesting part you should still be holding onto the scene button still ! <p> 3.1 ) The Device is ON-When you let go of the scene button when the device is ON , you can toggle the switch on and off . <p> 3.2 ) The Device is OFF-When you let go of the scene button when the device is OFF , you can only turn the switch off . <p> Note : For most of us , make shure the light is " ON " before letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.1 . <p> 5 ) Test , tap the scene button ( Sometimes you need to press it a couple of times after you finished configuring it . ) <p> 6 ) Repeat steps 1-5 to add more control to other devices . ( You can add multiple devices to a single scene button ) <p> Note : You repeat the steps on the same button to add control to Multiple devices , if you repeat the steps above on the same device , you remove control on that device from that scene button . <p> Dimmers And Dimming <p> If there is a dimmer linked to a scene button , then you can press and hold it to dim it up or down . Let go of the scene button when you 've come across the correct dimness that you want . <p> Note : If you dimmed it up before , then it will dim down the next time you use the dimmer function . <p> Device synchronization needs to get Z-Wave class information for 2 nodes .

Once I used the .150 plugin ..... it worked ! ! ! <p> Re : Minimote I 'm gradually transitioning from X10 to Zwave . I currently have 2 TKB ON/OFF modules and an Everspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning . The primary controller is an Aeon Z-Stick plugged into a PC running Windows 7 . <p> I 'm considering buying a Minimote and I 've read your excellent description of how to set it up . I 'd like to ask a number of additional questions which I 'm still puzzled about . <p> In essence I 'd like to know how much of the functionality that you describe will work even when the PC running HS3 is switched off . <p> 1 ) You mention that you can assign a button to a device such that you can toggle it between ON if it 's Off and Off if it 's ON thereby having control over 4 devices . Once set up that way , is that functionality dependent upon the computer being switched on when I need to control the devices ? <p> 2 ) When issuing the ALL ON or ALL OFF with the remote , is that dependent on the Computer being ON for that feature to work . <p> 3 ) Can it be set up such that a short press of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will that feature work when the computer is Off . <p> 4 ) Can it be set up such that Button 1 represents ON and Button 2 represents OFF and similarly for buttons 3 and 4 thereby having control over 2 devices . Again , I 'm sure that 's possible but is it dependent on HS3 running at the time . <p> I 'm also puzzled because I read that if a device is capable of association it should be apparent in the " Supported Command Classes " in the device 's " Node Information " . <p> In my case both these TKB switches appear as routing slaves in the NODE INFORMATION page and the supported features are as follows : " Switch Binary ( V 1 ) , Switch All , Configuration , Version , Manufacturer Specific " . It does n't mention " Association " so I 'm not sure whether they 're even set up to work with the Minimote . <p> I 'd hate to buy the remote only to send it back because my devices have been incorrectly set up or do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can assign a button to a device such that you can toggle it between ON if it 's Off and Off if it 's ON thereby having control over 4 devices . Once set up that way , is that functionality dependent upon the computer being switched on when I need to control the devices ? Yes . Method 1 requires a controller or your computer to be active . Method 2 does not . ( You can control 8 devices with method 1 if you include the long-press but again your controller has to be active. ) 2 ) When issuing the ALL ON or ALL OFF with the remote , is that dependent on the Computer being ON for that feature to work . No . If you add it via Method 2 you do not need your PC to be on . 3 ) Can it be set up such that a short press of a button represents ON and a long press represents OFF and will that feature work when the computer is Off . Yes ( Method 1 ) . This still requires your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up such that Button 1 represents ON and Button 2 represents OFF and similarly for buttons 3 and 4 thereby having control over 2 devices . Again , I 'm sure that 's possible but is it dependent on HS3 running at the time . Using method 1 , you can create an event to turn on a light with button 1 and turn off the same light with button 2 . <p> If you are using a MiniMote with HS3 you can expand the number of functions available with counters and timers . Since you are using " This device had its value set to ... " you can count the number of times a button is pressed . Add a timer and you can have events triggered on if button x is pressed x times within x seconds <p> We use 1 second as a timer , you could use longer if you want to count a larger number of presses . A single press of a button with the light off , turns it on to a preset dim level . A single press with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a preset amount . A double press runs a small script to decrease the brightness by a preset amount . A long press turns the light off . The " Timer Reset " is a failsafe in case the button is pressed more than two times in a second . <p> What you have done with the Minimote is exactly what I would like to do . Would you mind sharing your dimchange.Vb script ? <p> Not at all . It 's not my script , it was posted on this board some time ago . It is very short and simple , but it does what is needed . I would give credit if I could remember who posted it . <p> As it says at the top of the code you pass two parameters separated by a comma - the Device Reference I 'd then the percentage change you want . A " - " sign causes it to reduce by the percentage . So the parameter 289,10 would raise the dim level of device 289 by 10% every time the script is run and 289 , -10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs . It does not wrap around at either end , so it is limited in the range of 1-100% . That is a function of CAPI , if I understand it correctly . <p> This is directly related to Minimote as a secondary controller ( option 1 ) . It has been a while since I added the Minimote and since then my network has changed . I would like the Minimote to have the latest routing table . Is there a way to update the routing table in the Minimote from my primary controller ( Homeseer Ztroller original serial version ) without completely reseting the Minimote and having to re-add it as a secondary controller again ? I did try " Send Network Information to another Controller " in the Z-Troller action menu after putting the Minimote into the learn mode but had no success . Has anyone done this already ? Thanks and this thread has been very useful .

So that when people hover their mouse over the image of your camera they see a name . <p> Additionally . If you notice in the first example there is a width= ' ' statement . You can add width= ' 640 ' for example if your IP Cameras image by default is large to control the size displayed with any value you wish while keeping the aspect ratio height of your IP Cameras image if needed . Of course you can also use height= ' ' as well if needed . <p> It 's suggested to create a visitor User I 'd for your IP camera when doing this . So that nobody could use the User I 'd and Password used to move your camera . Such as an Operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Admin User Level I 'd for your IP Camera for anything that will be public . <p> The value of 1000 represents the refresh rate which is 1000 Milliseconds which equals 1 second . If you want your IP Camera to refresh more or less often then please change 1000 to the value of your choice . <p> The value of 5000 represents how often an attempt should be made to refresh when there is an error which also is in Milliseconds which equals 5 seconds . If you want to retry refreshes that fail sooner or later then please change 5000 to the value of your choice . <p> Working Example ( " Which has a 2 minute limit for demonstration purposes included " ) using a MJPEG based IP Camera : <p> The above methods are NOT secure methods . Meaning that they expose the DDNS and/or IP Address location and Port of your IP Camera and a User I 'd and Password for your IP Camera . The same methods can be done securely as well . In fact the working example shown here is using the secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Note : Some images are small in some of the live IP Camera demonstrations . They can be any sizes . <p> The H.264 example in the first post is the Foscam HD IP Camera example syntax for automatic Snapshot refreshes . <p> Yes the " YourIPCamInfo " can be replaced with any IP Cameras CGI Snaphot command and the method will refresh that Snapshot command automatically at the interval selected . Each camera can have it 's own unique refresh rate . <p> As my first post states . I would always use a IP Camera Visitor User I 'd Level when using the method above for security reasons when it 's in the clear . The first post also has a link to show secure methods being used with this method as well . <p> There are potential connection limitations when creating direct video streams to the Foscam MJPEG cameras and the Foscam H.264 cameras . This may apply to other IP Brands and their models as well . <p> You would need to implement a video server . Because the IP Cameras have a finite limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera can support . That limit is four . This limit is any combination of copies of the Standard camera interfaces which are running and logged in . Third-party applications that are formally logged on and connected to the camera and video streams ( " For the MJPEG based cameras " ) not sure ( " Need to do testing again " ) what this maximum number of video streams is for the H.264 based cameras . It 's still four even for the H.264 based cameras with any combination shown above minus video streams . This is because ALL these connections formally logon to the camera and because of that are considered long-term connections . <p> This means that when this limit is reached . The camera WILL reject ANY connection for the camera to login to the camera , until one of those connections is released . This could/can cause you the camera owner to NOT even be able to logon for example . If four people were viewing the video of your MJPEG camera concurrently . <p> You can emulate and create this connection limit yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example opening up four browser windows and using the standard camera interface that comes with the camera in those browser windows . Logging into the camera in each browser window . When you open a fifth browser window that logon request will be rejected . Unless/Until you free up one of the connections in use by closing one of the other browser windows . <p> Please note : If you happen to have anything currently using one of these four connections already running . You may get rejected before reaching four when using your browser window test above . <p> Sadly . Most IP camera owners are not aware of this finite limit . It 's usually only when they have many things at the same time logged into the same camera that they see it . <p> Whereas when using Snapshots . Those requests use short-term connections and have a maximum limit of 80 concurrent in flight ( " Not yet responded to " ) connections . So in real life about 100 concurrent people requesting Snapshots vs. the maximum of 4 for MJPEG cameras and x for H.264 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached because it uses no long-term connections . Reaching the short-term connection limit will never lock out a camera owner as reaching the long-term connection limit can and will . <p> So . I would never use a publicly accessible method for live video streams directly to the cameras because of this unless a video server was being used so that only one video stream connection directly to the camera would be required to support the public video server . <p> Many Media players , like VLC , FFMpeg and many others can be used on a dedicated system to act as this video server . However even when using a video server . It 's very easy especially more so with the H.264 based cameras to reach a ISP monthly bandwidth limit . Which can/could cause that ISP to suspend that Internet connection or add on more charges . The refreshed Snapshot image method at least allows you to control the refresh rate having more control of the bandwidth . <p> Here are some links that show the syntax for pulling video streams from Foscam H.264 based cameras : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream for H.264 based Foscam cameras . <p> I will soon do some testing to get the maximum video streams that can be run concurrently with the H.264 based cameras . But .. The limit of Four still applies even to H.264 based cameras when using the other things mentioned . It 's just that video streams for H.264 based cameras now have their own unique pool for connections which are dedicated to video streams only and I need to find out what that pool connection finite limit is for them . <p> That said would you ever want the camera to be able to be able to stream directly say on average , 4 people at the same time 24/7/31 for a month ? Even with a video server being used to support more then any maximum the cameras can support at the cameras location for example . One could still have ISP bandwidth limitation issues because of this . <p> I have heard " Stories " I call them this because none of them have ever been confirmed . That people have had others create multiple connections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of that month . How true these stories are . Is anyone 's guess . <p> Above and beyond all the potential issues when using video streams which are publicly accessible referenced above . There is also the compatibility issue . Not every device which is Internet browser capable can support live video . Whereas these Snapshot refreshed image methods work with any Internet browser capable device which is running any OS ( " Operating System " ) and using any browser . From Computers to Tablets , to Phones and TVs . With no compatibility issues of any kind . <p> I mention this because there are private and emergency uses for this method besides the public uses . <p> Imagine yourself stranded someplace without any of your normal Internet browser capable devices with you . Pondering if your IP Camera is online or not at the same time you were with someone you knew . Who had a Internet browser capable device at that time but they had no app on it for your IP Camera on their device . If you stored a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could use their device to access your Email and grab that email attachment run it on their device . Even if their device had no app for your camera and be sure that your camera was online . <p> You could also store a copy of this method on any of your Internet browser capable devices and use that copy as needed from them for private use as well . <p> Don , this is interesting information . But how does it relate to HS3 ? How would the " one line of code " be used in HS3 ? <p> Steve Q <p> Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD <p> Thanks . <p> I would need to see the text of what you are currently using to do same posted here . There are so many machinations of how someone could be doing this currently . That I ca n't answer you in any general way without seeing specifics of how you are doing it now . <p> Of course User Supported Scripts can be used as well . Of course this same single line method can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JavaScript . <p> I have seen others mention issues with refreshing weather images which this method can also be used for . While this method can be used for any IP Camera and imaging devices that support pulling Snapshots using one line of code using HTTP/HTTPS . The same method can be used to pull images at regular intervals that change as well , again using one line of code . <p> It can also be used to poll devices for their status and receive the response as text not as an image securely at regular intervals using one line of code to do so per device . <p> The goal was/is to minimize the lines of code required to perform repetitive tasks at a specific interval that can be used without additional security and with additional security with one line of code per task . Minimizing what other more complex scripting methods might be being used now . To do these same things . Making it easier and less complex for users to create/add tasks then what it might be today . <p> Additionally . It 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be combined with the secure method protecting ANY IP Camera data from being exposed over the Internet connection you are using at the time . <p> Examples ( " Just a few of the possible ones " ) : <p> 1 . Your currently using some free Internet connection . Do you really wish to be accessing your IP Camera directly . Exposing the DDNS/IP Address , Port and User credentials over that Internet connection with a HTTP connection ? <p> 2 . Your at work and there is a proxy and/or limitations on accessing your IP Cameras because the workplace Internet connection only allows browsers there to use ports 80 and 443 . Yet your IP Camera has a different Port number ? <p> 3 . You subscribe to a weather service that requires you to use a User I 'd and Password to grab images . Combining the secure method with this method allows you to get those images without exposing any User credentials while doing so . This same one line method can be used for text as well such as current temp or forecast . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a command to at specific intervals , but you do n't want to expose the IP Address , Port and any User credentials that those device(s) may require while doing so over the current Internet connection you are using . You could use this single line of code per device , combined to do that with the secure method . Again those device(s) could respond with text using this method as well . Such as polling device(s) for their status at specific intervals , using one line to do so and securely . Without exposing any IP Address , Port or User credentials for those devices while doing so . <p> Here over the last couple of years purchased a " few " different types of SD IP cameras . Thinking one of the first " test " IP cameras was the Panasonic . From there tested the Foscam and a few others . <p> The above noted will be testing your methodology initially with SD IP cameras and will post provided HTML links . <p> I have though moved to testing primarily Grandstream IP HD cameras mostly related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I purchased many Grandstream IP HD boards and lens boards . I have pieces of these all over my little work bench . The camera boards are tiny . <p> Part of the endeavor here is to DIY a " doorbell " camera using the SIP functions included in the OS of the Grandstream . <p> Don , Thanks for this code . I had been using a java script I had found years ago and this is much better . <p> You are very welcome . What 's also good about this is it deals with errors . <p> As an example . If your IP Camera was offline , you do n't want to be creating a " Race Condition " where when there is no error you are quickly going back to get refreshed images . Because the " On Error " logic is there in this example there would be a 5 second delay between requests when errors occur vs. only milliseconds , without that logic . Of course you can modify that error delay time to be more or less then the 5 seconds shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoneminder boxes to Ubuntu 14.04 and separated one box to do 8 analog feeds plus a few miscellaneous SD IP camera feeds . Box number 2 is just running with HD IP camera feeds . <p> Today fixed an issue that I was having with the time sync on the newer IP cameras . The times were all off due to a glitch in my PFSense firewall . <p> Running the CCTV off the two boxes feeds two systems today with no direct IP camera connections but rather just one configuration for the ZM boxes for a reverse proxy kind of configuration keeping the IP cameras access local only . <p> Now mostly playing around with different mechanisms of video compression codecs for HD stuff as installed on the ZM box to save space and CPU work . Sort of how much data and compression you can use to stream HD more easily these days .

My switch from XP to win7 went very smooth . <p> Personally it was the 32 bit versus the 64 bit " stuff " . I did read though to put HS in the root directory and that would solve any issues from going to 64 bit and back to 32 bit if you decided to do so . <p> I guess I should have been a little more descriptive in my request . How do you handle the base homeseer directory issue ? Currently homeseer is c : program fileshomeseer2 ....

@@98239291 @2439291/ <p> I recently purchased a Wayne Dalton WDTC-20 Z-Wave Thermostat , and I 'm having some troubles getting power to the unit . My HVAC company came in to provide a 24V AC wire for the WDTC-20 . They believed they had it wired correctly , but my thermostat batteries end up draining every 1.5 to 2 days . <p> I have a gas-furnace and a central air system that was installed last year . My thermostat wiring looks like the attached jpg . Note that I did NOT have the C wire in use when using my original dial thermostat . <p> My questions : To test the C wire for 24V using a voltmeter , which 2 wires should the meter test ? ( for example , testing my RC and G gives 24-25V what wire should I test the C with ? ) <p> Is it necessary to have a separate low-amperage transformer to provide power to the C wire ? If so , what should the amperage be ? <p> As noted above , my RC is providing 24V . Since its winter and I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ( to provide 24V ) . This still did not work , my batteries drained after 1.5 days . <p> The HVAC company will be coming back to troubleshoot this , I 'd like to use the meter to tell if this is going to work before they leave . <p> Unfortunately , there are no standards when it comes to furnace and A/C wiring color codes , but in general , the Red wire ( terminal R ) is generally considered the 24vac " hot " and the Black wire ( terminal B ) is 24vac " common . " The ' stat works by connecting 24vac hot to the other terminals to call for heat , A/C and/or fan . These command inputs are generally relays and the other sied of each relay is connected to 24vac common inside the furnace and a/c units . <p> Where 24vac hot get a little messy is when both the furnace and a/c units each supply their own 24vac hot . This is where the RH and RC terminals come in as they 24vac hot . <p> So , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ' stat , measure the AC voltage between terminals RH and C for the furnace and and then measure between RC and C for the A/C unit . If either or both of these are near 24vac ( 20-28 ) then you should be good . If not , the 24vac common line may not be connected back at your furnace or A/C unit . <p> Best regards , -Mark- <p> If you 're not out on the edge , you 're taking up too much room ! Interested in 3D maps ? Check out my company site : Solid Terrain Modeling <p> The wdtc-20 has a jumper , I forget which one , but is marked if you have both Heat and AC with separate power supplies I think you remove it . Then If you want to run the stat with an separate ac supply you would put one connection on the C and the other on the RH . Your heat wires from the furnace would go to RH and W. Tech support at WD told me that this isolates the thermostat supply from the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it consuming batteries , it turned out that the problem was not the wiring , but the fact that the hot wire contact was not making contact with the stat , so it was running on batteries the whole time . This was because the wall it was mounted on was a bit rough , so the left side of the plate was a tiny bit deformed , causing the pin to be slightly further away from the stat when it 's mounted on the plate . By ' slightly ' I mean something like 0.01mm , but , due to the crappy design of the backplate , that was enough to screw things up . <p> I 've now done away with the backplate completely and hardwired the wired direct into the stat through a custom plate . I like the WDC-20 , but it 's design is very poor . <p> OK , my HVAC guy is here and we found the problem ... hopefully this will do it . Using a voltmeter , the Common to RH is only giving 15-16v .

It sure would be nice to know one way or the other before he leaves ! <p> OK , my HVAC guy is here and we found the problem ... hopefully this will do it .

Or does pressing the " learn " button on the opener ( in the ceiling ) erase/invalidate any previously trained cars ... ? <p> As long as the built-in " remote " in each car is rolling-code capable and has multiple buttons , you should be able to have each car learn each of your two remotes ( each remote on a separate button of course . ) Then each car can open either garage door . I use Genie garage door openers with rolling codes and was able to do what you are asking . The motor units should learn many individual remotes and not erase a previously programmed unit when learning a new one . Check the Chamberlain manually carefully - there should be a procedure for adding more remotes and also one for removing remotes . <p> Try this programming procedure ( assuming 2 door openers and 2 cars ) : <p> 1 ) Teach the " remote " built into your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #1 opener . Follow your vehicle mfgr 's instructions for this . 2 ) Teach the door #1 motor unit this " new " remote in your car . Carefully follow the instructions provided by Chamberlain . 3 ) Teach the ' remote ' built into your car the code sequence of the hand-held remote for the door #2 opener . 4 ) Teach the door #2 motor unit this " new " remote in your car . <p> Most of the openers today have receivers that can respond to multiple remotes - you just train them according to the instructions with the opener/receiver . For example , the Genie Intellicode receiver ( $50 ) I retrofitted to my garage door opener can use up to 7 remotes or wireless keypads . BTW , the Genie is a nice remote system for those of us looking for secure RF remote use for HA , not a bad price , either . <p> If you use the same single remote in one car on both doors , hitting the button will open both garage doors at once .

I run a recurring trigger on IFTTT and log it on HS . It 's actually getting better over the last few weeks . It 's supposed to trigger right on the hour and it logs the delta between when it 's supposed to trigger and when it actually does . When I first put it in place , it was typically triggered about 2-3 minutes after it was supposed to . I also run a similar log with HS as the trigger and it always triggers exactly when it is supposed to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well a 45 minute delay is worse than useless . Up to three days ago I was getting notified within a few seconds , which was good enough for my purposes , now this long delay . What concerns me is that IFTTT flag the issue - up to " one hour delay " . Why is it happening ? Is it a Homeseer issue ( which I assumed since it is only " Applets/Recipies " using the Homeseer Channel that I am seeing this issue on ) ? ? <p> The IFTTT plug in from Spud is showing great promise . It utilizes Dropbox for a temporary storage area and I set a trigger for Pushbullet when a new file is detected . ( Spud has specific instructions in the forum on how to set this up ) . <p> While Dropbox is also categorized as an app that can take up to an hour delay , I find that my triggers are firing within a couple of minutes using IFTTT . I never got anything close to that performance using the Homeseer IFTTT channel . HS IFTTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it compared to firing events with the IFTTT plug-in . <p> IFTTT is growing faster than it can keep up . I stopped using it because it was only reasonably reliable during the day , completely useless in the evening times . I would never trust IFTTT to be used for anything time related or controlling devices like lights . <p> It 's an awesome concept , but having serious growing pains , and this is one where I do n't think you can or it fair to blame HS for . <p> IFTTT inbound to HS is working flawlessly . HS outbound to IFTTT is a disaster . <p> I have IFTTT on my wife 's phone and mine . When one of us leaves Wi-Fi range , our phone reaches through IFTTT to turn off specific things we like to have on when home . When one of us returns into Wi-Fi , our phone reaches through IFTTT and turns stuff on for us . <p> This is the IFTTT Android applet connecting to IFTTT , which connects to MYHS , which connects to my HS system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or off , representing who is home or away . This is reliable to the extent that when I see the Wi-Fi connection bubble on my phone , my things turn on if all other event conditions are met within one second . I do n't need geofencing . <p> The problem is with my empty house event . When one of us is already off Wi-Fi and the other drops off Wi-Fi , that causes both of our virtuals to be off . When we are both away , I set an additional virtual to Away . I have an event set for when that virtual changes to Away that sets a virtual for each camera to on . <p> I have an event on the camera virtuals that uses the HS IFTTT channel to reach into IFTTT to tell Netgear to arm that Arlo Q camera . Typically over the past 3 weeks this eventually succeeds about 10-15 minutes after we leave , and we 'll get immediate notifications from Arlo as the dogs pass the cameras and kindly provide us a nice system check . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . <p> HS &gt; IFTTT has recently degraded significantly . The massive slowdown seemed to be at Thanksgiving , and I wrote it off to nobody minding the servers . <p> Once one of us comes home ( connects to Wi-Fi ) , our phone gets HS ' Wi-Fi virtual set in a blink . That also sets the additional virtual to Home . I have an HS event on that virtual changing to Home that sets the camera virtuals of off . The HS IFTTT channel is configured to pick up that state change and tell IFTTT to tell Netgear to disarm my cameras . <p> Because I 'm home and moving in front of the cameras , I become painfully aware of the delay to disarm : immediate and constant phone notifications . There 's certainly no delay in Arlo sending notifications , as you would expect for a security device . The past several days , I 've had to disarm the cameras in the Arlo app . <p> While writing this message , I manually flipped the Arlo camera virtuals on at 9:29pm . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has armed a camera , at 9:52pm . I 'm using the IFTTT activity log for this proof . At Netgear 's Arlo site , the correct camera for the IFTTT applet activity entry is armed . It 's 10:14 and none of the other cameras have armed . <p> The HS IFTTT channel needs debugging . When I use Check Now on the applets at IFTTT , they fire immediately without errors , so for example the cameras arm/disarm immediately when they do n't have to wait for the HS IFTTT channel to tell them to arm/disarm . I 've got three other technologies making immediate connections to IFTTT and causing events to trigger in HomeSeer . <p> I can totally rely on HomeSeer responding to IFTTT , I can not rely on HomeSeer to command IFTTT and the downstream cameras . I need the complexity of HomeSeer 's event logic and what my devices and plugins contribute to the events . I ca n't have my phone IFTTT client arming my cameras every time I drop off Wi-Fi - I use UltraMon to check that my Wi-Fi access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider the drop off Wi-Fi to be accurate . <p> Before I did any of the testing above , I shutdown and restarted HS3 and confirmed a problem-free connection to MYHS in my log . <p> Sounds like your experience is not the norm and you should consider yourself lucky . I first noticed the problem on my Ring &gt; IFTTT &gt; HS applet , and it 's still a multiple minute delay ... I have a separate Ring &gt; IFTTT &gt; notification applet to confirm it 's not an HS issue and it has the same performance problems . <p> I am using HS3 to send a Lights on at sunset command to one of my Lutron Caseta dimmer switches . So far , I have not noticed a problem . It may be a few minutes delayed , but that is not really noticeable because the sunset time is also changing . I have never seen a delay of 30-60 minutes . <p> So what is an example of where the homeseer IFTTT integration is useful ? I am scratching my head trying to think about events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I have completely abandoned IFTTT after a couple of months of trying to do something relevant with it . Great idea but the execution is terrible . It 's not just limited to HS either . IFTTT does n't seem to have it 's act together on timely submission of events . That , combined with the kiddie interface for setting up events is just not worth the hassle IMHO . <p> I still use IFTTT extensively , but try not to for anything important . I am moving more and more of that stuff over to Tasker and autoremote . HS gets info to my phone and back a hell of a lot faster than IFTTT . <p> Zapier is much faster than IFTTT unfortunately most of the " smart devices " are n't supported . Mostly services and software , websites , etc . Zapier is also not free if you use it a lot . I am also starting to look into stringify .

DLS IV worked fine with it . <p> When people talk about multiple sensors per zone , it 's because they 're wiring the sensors in series , so if one sensor in that zone trips it trips the whole zone . That 's why in typical installs you can have an 8 zone system , but dozens of door and window sensors . <p> In my house the builder preinstalled a DSC panel ( old model ) , and wired a total of 30 door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seemingly random too , so when a zone tripped I had no idea where in the house the sensor was . On the panel I just installed I put in three zone expanders , and wired up every door and most windows to their own zone . The only time I double up sensors on a zone is when two windows are side by side . <p> Do some reading on the diyalarm forum for some other tips on wiring . One nice thing about the newer DSC panels is that you do not have to have a terminating resistor on each zone . Terminating resistors are meant to prevent someone from simply short-circuiting a sensor and bypassing the zone . If your wiring is all protected in the wall like mine is you do n't really need the resistors . Makes installation simpler . <p> Agree on the termination resistors , seems like overkill .

They will physically set it to 9-16 , 17-24 , etc . <p> Then in the DSC programming you need to turn those corresponding zones on . <p> In the HS plugin just tell it what the " maximum " zone number is . You can increase this later if you need to . Keep in mind that if you use zones 1-6 , 9 , 10 and 15 for some odd reason , you would need to tell it you have 15 zones . <p> If you decide to use wireless they can be spread out on whatever zones you wish . In the panel zone programming you have to set a flag that tells it a zone is wireless . If you do , that corresponding hardwired zone will not be used . 
@@98239309 @2439309/ <p> I found this online and it seemed to fix the problem . Depending on your system you might only need to take a few of these steps . Others will need to do it all . But it works ! Close to Serial 's suggestion ( see above posts ) . <p> I thought it worth pasting here , since possibly many people use USB-Serial converters . I have several different types , and the PL2303 ones do n't work on Win7 64-bit . Maybe they are not " genuine " PL2303 chips inside . Mine were purchased from Maplin UK . <p> Anyway , the root of the problem is that the most recent drivers are incompatible with some of the PL2303 USB Serial converters , and the older ( working ) driver can not be found on official sites ( maybe to encourage people to purchase new USB to Serial interfaces ) . <p> First step is to uninstall from Device Manager if you have already plugged in the device . The drivers that you need can be found via google ; search for a file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDIT:Here is a link to the file : LONG ... Once found , double-click to install . After installing , the PL2303 USB Serial converter may work on Windows 7 . <p> If you still get an error marker against the device in Device Manager ( and possibly an Error code 10 if you look at the properties of the device ) then the problem is , that Windows is still loading the incorrect driver . <p> The trick to getting it to operate is a little convoluted but it works : Firstly , confirm the symptom by looking at the Driver settings in the Device Manager . If the Driver Version is higher than 3.3.2.105 , then Windows is picking up a more recent driver . To solve this , you need the help of a text editor that can " Find in Files " . An example is UltraEdit . Use the editor ( or an alternate method ) to search for all *. inf files in C : Windowsinf that have the following text inside them " Prolific USB-to-Serial " . My search found two files ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The numbers will vary . Inspect the files in a text editor . In my case , the oem42.inf file was the culprit ; it contained this text on around line 12 : **31;983;TOOLONG The oem43.inf was the result of installing the **33;1016;TOOLONG software , and it had this correct text : **30;1051;TOOLONG So , I needed to disable the oem42.inf file because it refers to the more recent driver that does n't work . The easiest way to disable it is to change the filename from oem42.inf to oem42infbackup ( without the . inf suffix ) .

It was node 2 . Hs has no provision for adding back a secondary ztroller . I have erased both controllers in the main postion and then reloaded the config file and also sync 'd the 2 ztrollers . Here is the rub . Hspro see 's the second ztroller on com port 2 and loads all the info it can read about it , yet there is no associated node in the zwave devices . Starting at the beginning nodes 2 and 13 are the first empty nodes . <p> It 's not up to us - nodes can not be removed from static controllers programmatically . We asked Aeon to do the installer library on that device YEARS ago , and they failed to get one to us that worked , and eventually they gave up on it . Using the Z-Wave functionality to remove a node is the only way to remove them , other than as you stated - reset the interface and start over . <p> I then as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was establishe with a node number already exsisting . This is an error which has reported a should have been fixed in one of the recent betas . Well ... <p> I do not recall anything in the betas having to do with node numbers not being right . Node numbers are assigned by the Z-Wave primary controller - we have no control over that . If the Horstmann thermostat created node numbers that are a duplicate , then that only means that the node was removed from your primary controller , but it was done in such a way that HomeSeer was not allowed to remove the corresponding device . Deleting the device is all that should have been needed . <p> I did not get anywhere with reloading the zwave config file . yes I did clean up some of the nodes but the bigger problem is that I had deleted the device for the second ztroller on the system . It was node 2 . Hs has no provision for adding back a secondary ztroller . I have erased both controllers in the main postion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ztrollers . Here is the rub . Hspro see 's the second ztroller on com port 2 and loads all the info it can read about it , yet there is no associated node in the zwave devices . Starting at the beginning nodes 2 and 13 are the first empty nodes . <p> Stuart <p> HS2 does not create devices for controllers . Sometimes through synchronization a device may be created for a controller , but normally HS2 will not do that . When you re-load a configuration file , you must remember that there is only one main interface and the network settings are always in relation to that one , so if you are trying to fix a secondary interface , you must first make that the main interface , then save the config , edit the config , and re-load the config , then move it back to being a secondary controller . <p> In HS3 you will be able to work with each controller individually without having to move them to the main interface position . <p> Rick , Ok i 've done that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to change the zwave interface the node uses It does not work . Click on the choice and it bounces back to the main interface . There is no way to choose it . Stuart <p> Ouch - sorry , I assumed you knew what I meant - my apologies for not being clearer . <p> I mean that in your list of INTERFACES in the SETUP , that you need to temporarily make the interface you are working with the main ( first ) interface in the system . Typically this means setting interfaces to None , saving that change , then removing the remote interface and setting up the main interface to be the COM port or IP Address of the one that used to be the remote interface , then saving that config - if it does not start the interface properly ( because some COM port devices do not shut down properly ) then you have to restart HomeSeer . Remove the rogue nodes by saving the config , editing it , and reloading it , then put it all back the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote interface support has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the disadvantages is this situation which I could not rectify in HS2 without a complete rewrite of a huge chunk of the code , so I fixed it in HS3 . <p> Hi Rick , Been there done that . I understand completely . But what used to happen was I could sync installer interfaces ( 2 ztrollers ) and things worked fine . But now I had to use the secondary ztroller in the prmary com port and restore the config for it , but before I did , I had to edit the config and change the primary controller I 'd to 2 , write it to the ztroller , then return it to its other com port . If I did n't  change the I 'd of the ztroller it will not allow you to choose which one you want . Is that a change within Hs as it always worked that way ? <p> Synchronization works fine for adding nodes , and when you first synchronize a new controller to add it to the system , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is the node I 'd it has all the time . We DO use different node IDs for the controllers in a multi-controller environment . <p> Let 's say your main interface is node 1 , and one of your remote interfaces is node 50 . <p> Everything works fine except that when you synchronize , Z-Wave sometimes does not remove nodes from all of the interfaces . This is because the only way to remove a node is for Z-Wave to try to communicate with it , it finds it can not , so then it adds the node number to the " bad node " list , which it then removes from the system . If you remove a node from the main interface , it will not remove from the other interfaces because they never " talked " to it such that it appeared on the " bad node " list , OR the fact that it was removed by another controller resulted in a communication attempt by the main controller which the other controller heard and took to mean that the node is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , and now getting back to my example here is how/why it works : When you make the node 50 controller the main interface , you do a Backup Network so that the configuration file written is the one for that controller , which means that the node number shown at the top of the file should be 50 . You do NOT need to change that for purposes of removing a bad node . You simply remove the lines for the bad nodes , then RESTORE that file to the controller - it results in the nodes being removed but the controller keeping it 's node I 'd of 50 . <p> Now when you are done and you switch the controllers back , you should do another BACKUP of the network immediately so that if you ever do a restore , you restore the proper configuration to Node 1 - if you do not , then you could end up turning your Node 1 controller into a Node 50 controller , and then you would have two Node 50 's which is like crossing the beams - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind that if the bad nodes do not hurt anything , you may want to leave them alone until you get enough of them to really make it worth your while to do the clean-up work . The reason for this is that when you restore your configuration , all of the routing information is reset , and so you need to rebuild your routing table by optimizing the entire network ( use Z-Health to make it easier ) .

@@98239315 @2439315/ <p> The ACT ZIR000 Z-Wave motion sensor works quite a bit differently then X10 motion sensors . This " How To " will help you get the sensor working with HomeSeer . <p> Quick summary : <p> To program the OFF delay for this device ( this is the time that the sensor determines there is NO motion ) , use a ZTH100 remote , or click the Configure Device link in the device properties from the status page and program the required OFF delay . You can not use HomeSeer to detect when no motion is detected . <p> Details : <p> The sensor has 3 modes , use the default mode , which is the Lighting mode . <p> The sensor is normally asleep to save battery power . Because of this , HS can not communicate with it directly . When setting up the sensor , you need to make sure the sensor stays awake . To do this , remove and re-insert the batteries . This will cause the sensor to stay awake for 10 minutes . <p> At this point , you can set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install it as you do any other Z-Wave device . There is a button under the cover that you press when requested to add the sensor to your Z-Wave network . <p> After adding the sensor , it does not report motion to HS or any other device because it does not know who to communicate with . To have it notify HS or any other device you need to use the Z-Wave association feature . When you associate the sensor with another device ( or HS ) , it then knows who to send a command to . <p> To set up an association , first make sure the sensor is awake , as described above . In HomeSeer , view your devices , find the sensor , then click on its name to view its properties . You will then see buttons to add and remove associations . These buttons are for associating the sensor with HS only . See below for associating the sensor with other devices . <p> Click on the Add Association button . If successful , the sensor will now be associated with HS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON command to HS , and then the HS devicie will show " Motion " . <p> When the sensor detects motion , it will light its red led under the cover . You will notice that you can wave your hand in front of the sensor and nothing happens ! In order to conserve battery power , the sensor only sends one command , when it detects motion . It will not send any more ON commands until it first detects no motion . By default , the delay is 2 minutes . So after 2 minutes of not detecting motion , it will then send an OFF command to HS . To change the OFF delay , you can send a configuration parameter to the sensor , either with the ZTH100 remote , or click on the Configuration link under the device 's properties in HS . HS 2.1.162 or later has the configuration link that allows you to set the Off delay . <p> To associate the sensor with other devices , use the ZTH100 remote , or go into the HS Setup , Interfaces , Manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the device you want to control from the destination list . Then click " Add " . HS will set the association for you . <p> To create events in HS , use the Device Value Change event . Select the sensor , then select " No Motion " if you want to trigger when the sensor detects no motion , or select " Motion " for when it detects motion . Then set the action as desired . <p> You can not use the " Has been on for " trigger since the sensor only sends one ON command , when it first detects motion . 
@@98239316 @2439316/ <p> We are looking at a new HVAC system as our is old , inefficient ( 10 SEER ) and getting cantankerous and leaks . <p> We asked for a HA friendly thermostat and we are getting some marketing about how wonderful the carrier WWW access module is , but everything I have seen says it is meant for outside access to stuff , not necessarily to what we would want ... <p> Just like to know what is out there before we are sold a bill of goods ... <p> I have my HomeSeer system communicating with my Carrier Infinity system using the HAI RC80B ( single stage ) thermostat . This option allowed me to either use the HomeSeer thermostat plug-in or my Elk M1 Home Automation controller . I ended up using the Elk M1 to connect to the thermostat , but still controlling it using Homeseer . <p> I will be replacing by 15yo furnace soon too . Current looking at Bryant Evolution ( 90i ) , Lennox G71 , &amp; Trane XV90 . Bryant Evo is the same as Carrier Infinity . Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would benefit from using a modulating thermostat . None of which are HA friendly . The modulating stat allows most efficient use of the modulating ( variable between 40% - 100% ) gas burners . The single &amp; 2 stage stats allow the burners to run at 40% , 65% and 100% of total capacity . I do not want to loose my HA control , but would like to utilize all the tech advances in modern heat/cooling systems . Needless to say , either stat choice &amp; a new efficient HVAC system will be a much better and efficient than my current single stage system . Single stage furnace is either on 100% or Off . <p> Ultra , I am a bit worried about the noise as well . I met with a couple HVAC guys . Each one claimed that the new blower motors would be much quieter than my single stage blower . The new blowers have a soft start feature &amp; variable RPMs , which is supposed to address the noise issue . <p> I have a bearing going bad on my blowers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what prompted me to start looking for a new system . Hoping not to loose heat this week .. going to be cold here is SE Michigan the latter part oft he week . <p> I have a Carrier Infinity heat pump system ( installed in 2005 ) and it does indeed run for long periods of time ( by design ) but MOST of the time the fan is running at a really low speed and you really ca n't hear it at all . In fact , my HomeSeer server and my Infinity air handler are about 6 feet apart in my basment and the computer is louder than the air handler ( when it 's running on low speed ) ! ! <p> So , if you are concerned about noise , then single stage is NOT the way to go . <p> BTW , I would love to be able to control my Infinity with HomeSeer but in the almost 4 years that I 've had the system I 've yet to find any way to do this ( not that I 've been actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased ( not yet installed ) the Bryant Evolution ( 90i ) . I am planning on using my current tstat ( RCS TX15b ) along with a Bryant automatic humidistat that will have additional control of the blower to regulate humidity . I can not get enough moisture in the air in the winter months . Hopefully this will help . If not then I will go to a fan assisted humidifier . If that does not to the trick then a stream generator style . <p> Yup - I have a 485 interface wired into the furnace now . Am getting a lot of junk info but I know that it 's real data . I 'm not using the SAM , just hard wired to ABCD ( actually just the data lines ) . So anyways , I tried to issues some of the ASCII commands , like S1OAT ? to ask what the outside air temp was , nada .. So I 'm wondering if anyone has any experience decoding the communication protocol directly off the 485 bus vs via the RS232 connection in the SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thread and only 8 replys . Has anyone anything to add ? I 'm real close to issuing commands to the furnace via the 485 bus . Sure would like to hear from anyone else who has some reference to share . <p> Still here , still no luck . Have n't done much other than to capture the stream of info coming out . Weird , it 's coming out at 38400 8 n 1 . I would have figured the rate would be more around 9600 . Did some protocol sniffing using an old version of Bryant Home automation software , Seems as though the two protocols are not the same . Ie : Bryant HM sends out 0104 000C when it trys to establish communication yet I do n't see anything like that starting a message from the furnace now . Its more like 5001 0001 0300 . Any suggestions on how to proceed next ? <p> I had started down this path several years ago when we installed these systems at my office . I wanted to allow employees to change the temps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryant offered was their two-way pager service . The SAM was an option , but after investigating its capabilities I found that it provided very minimal access and reporting and was definitely not worth the US$1000 price tag . <p> As you have done , I hooked up an RS485 interface to one of the systems and found the 38.4K-8-N-1 comm parameters , and after looking at logs of data I decided the best way to go about decyphering the protocol was to write a logger/parser that would allow me to determine which types of data were in which fields . From there I would analyze the each of the fields and try to correlate those to events , commands , etc . <p> Unfortunately ( or fortunately depending how you look at it ) , real work " got in the way " of this project and I did not pursue it any further . <p> I hope you 're able to make some headway as I do think it is a great system and really needs an interface to HomeSeer . <p> Best regards , -Mark- <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking up too much room ! Interested in 3D maps ? Check out my company site : Solid Terrain Modeling <p> The protocol does n't appear friendly , and likely requires a man in the middle approach to decode the sender/receiver patterns . This is a bit of a stumbling block for me because it would require another RS485 to RS232 board , and I 'm too cheap to buy one at the moment . How were you going to determine the sender and receiver ? I tried to base the exchange on a time offset but had little success . <p> My rough plan was if I could n't get anywhere just analyzing the serial data , I 'd crack one of the ' stats open and log both the Data and Tx/Rx signals ( using a logic analyzer ) from within the ' stat . Issuing a bunch of different commands from the ' stat while logging these signals would give me good indication of the command format . I 'd then try issuing these back on the line using a ' 458 board on the bus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this approach has worked for me in the past . <p> It 's amazing that in this day and age , we ca n't find a good thermostat that supports HA . I just talked to RCS and confirmed that my TR40 wo n't control a dual fuel system . I am looking at the Lennox gas furnace and a heat pump . The guy at RCS suggested using HS to switch a relay that would change between the heat pump and the gas furnace . <p> Has anybody tried this ? I hate to lose my TR40 and the ability to set temperatures from HS . <p> The HVAC guy recommended a Honeywell Vision IAQ thermostat but I have n't found anything that said it can communicate . <p> typically when I crack protocols I will first try to get a handle on the handshake setup messages between master and slave .... <p> with 485 its real easy to monitor a 485 bus because by nature it is a multi-drop setup .. so first you setup your 485 adapter to your PC to not sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you activate just one end of the connection ... you disconnect the slave and see if the master sends out any codes .. and you log them ... I use procomm plus to do it ... <p> then you turn on just the slave device and see if it just waits or sends out any commands ... and you log them .... <p> then you connect both together and log a very short amount of time ... and you search through your logs and see if you find your original commands .. likely you will find some sort of handshake occurs .... at that time you write a small program in any langauge of your choice .. I use VB6 because it is easy to set up serial communications ... <p> and I try to establish the handshake with the master .... <p> if you can send and receive the handshake ... great you are 1 step into it .. <p> if not .. then you play with response timings a bit ... if no go .. you break out the logic analyzer and look at timings .. often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of messages .... <p> if I can not emulate the timings with a PC based program I will build a micro controller to do it .. <p> ( that is how i communicate with my minisplit units .. I have a micro controller that can talk the langauge and emulate the timings of the original interface well ... and then it talks to my PC via a companion program I wrote on the PC end .... ) <p> protocol cracking is a real pain ... I have cracked many protocols on lots of things over the years ... I would jump into the inifnity systems except I do n't  have access to an infinity ( nor do i want / need to spend the thousands to get one ) .. however i wish I did have access to one as it sounds like I could make a market out of an HA controllable interface device / thermostat .... <p> SOMETIMES you can get lucky and go directly to the board-set manufacturer and state your intentions of devloping a product that would make their systems more saleable and they will divulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. -Christopher <p> PerfecTemp - the Most advanced HVAC system I 've ever Built - and its in my House <p> I 'm talking to my Carrier Infinity system .

I installed version 3.0.10 . It works ! ! ! <p> I had several issues as well installing the drivers . I ended up following the instructions and using the drivers here . This worked for all of my Prolific USB-Serial adapters including current cost . I am on Windows 2008 64-bit . <p> Just checked my driver since I remembered a recent update . The version is 3.4.42.258 dated 11/12/2012 and works fine on my windows7 64 bit machine . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@98239322 @2439322/ <p> While the genesis for this " How To " is the lack of adequate documentation that Leviton provides , there are some good tips for other types of controllers in here . Also , so as to not be too specific to Leviton models since they can change faster than this post can be updated , the instructions are provided at a high level , but hopefully not too high as to be worthless ! <p> First of all , some concepts to help with the process : <p> The current Leviton MRX series controllers are either scene controllers or zone controllers , but they also have a switch or two built inside of them as well . The switch is a separate and distinct Z-Wave node(s) from the controller node , so you have to be aware of the fact that Leviton has a multi-step process for adding these devices to the network . <p> All in-wall scene and zone controllers ( Leviton , Cooper , or others ) are " static " controllers . That is , they are not designed to be portable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with network information when you make changes to your network . Static controllers , when added to the network , automatically are replicated to by your primary controller so that they have the network information . Repeating the add process at any time will result in your controller displaying the same node number ( if it is a Z-Troller ) because the device is already a part of the network , but it will also repeat the replication so that the static controller has the updated information . <p> Leviton does a good job of documenting how to add these controllers to the network using their handheld controller , but can leave you TOTALLY in the dark on how to add it to a network using ANY other kind of controller , so learn to spot the key presses and activities in their documentation to be able to apply it to the general process below . <p> When ANY new node is added to the network , you will use a controller that is physically near the node being added , then you will return the controller to its normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the controller is now in a different location that may not have direct communication with the new node , it is important to realize that the query that HomeSeer does of a new node may FAIL , resulting in child devices and other characteristics of the node being incorrect . This is normal - in this situation , take whatever root device was created and optimize it several times to establish a communication path to the node , perhaps even optimize nodes that are near the new node in your network to help , and then click the RESCAN button in the device properties of the root device to have HomeSeer try again , hopefully with successful communication . It may also be necessary to delete the bad child devices before clicking on the RESCAN button just to make sure the child devices are created properly the second time . <p> Information specific to Leviton controllers : Leviton controllers have a button sequence that you press to put them into a " programming mode " . When it is in the programming mode , it will periodically send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to add it to a network or remove it from a network . In the case of a Leviton controller that has local switches that are a part of it , there are sometimes a separate set of buttons that you hold down to get it into programming mode for the switch than the program mode for the controller . Also , if there are multiple switches , you may have to enter the program mode for the switches to add one , then go into the same programming mode again , and with the first one added successfully , the controller automatically sends the node information frame for the 2nd one to add that one . <p> Here is the process : For Leviton controllers , put the controller into programming mode - some combination of the lights on the keypad will remain lit when it is in this mode . Now , press the button or follow the sequence necessary to put your primary controller into the " Add Node " sequence . Once you have started the " Add Node " sequence , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button on the controller that will cause it to send its node information frame . In the case of the Leviton controller , it gets sent periodically so you just have to wait a few seconds . <p> Once you press the button to send the node information from from the controller you are adding , or when the Leviton controller sends its node information frame , the add process with the primary controller will start , and a node number will be assigned to the new controller . Once the add process is complete , a primary controller such as the Z-Troller still will be prompting you to hold the button down because now it immediately starts the replication process , whereby the network information in the Z-Troller is copied to the new wall static controller . <p> When the add process is complete , continue reading ... <p> If you have a Leviton controller that has additional switches that are a part of it , follow the button press and hold sequence for putting the controller into the program mode for the switch(es) , and THEN repeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary controller . When this is done , and if there is more than one switch in your Leviton controller , repeat the procedure to add the 2nd switch . <p> With all of the local switches added , now is an important part of the process : <p> If you are using a Leviton controller that has switches , repeat the procedure for adding the controller to the network as if it were a new controller . The reason for this is because you just added switches to the network , so the controller , despite being in the same body with the two switches , does not know that they exist ! Repeating the add procedure will result in the replication taking place so that the controller knows about the two switches . <p> Regardless of the type or brand of in-wall static controller that you just added , NONE of your existing static controllers are aware of it , or of any of the switches you may have just added as well . For this reason , you need to go to ALL of the in-wall static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repeat the add-new-node procedure ( in-wall static controller ) or the replicate send procedure ( handheld controllers ) so that their network information is updated . <p> One that is complete , and you are ready to re-connect your primary controller to your HomeSeer system , go back up to the top of this post and re-read the last concept ( the one in BOLD ) so that you know how to get the HomeSeer devices for the new node(s) set up properly . <p> Once you have the new nodes added to the network and existing in HomeSeer properly , your Leviton controller may or may not have automatically set up one of the buttons to control the switches that exist in the same device . To verify this , or to set it up to make sure , you would go to the " Configuration " area for the button that you want to control the switch with , and add the switch to the scene configuration for that button . This means that you do NOT have to use one of the buttons on the Leviton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a different controller control the switches , or you can have no controller control the switches and use HomeSeer to control them . Despite being in the same body as the controller buttons , the switches are completely independent Z-Wave nodes in your network . 
@@98239323 @2439323/ <p> This procedure is for people who have one copy of HomeSeer , but with one or more remote Z-Wave interfaces connected over the network to a remote location such as a 2nd home or vacation home . <p> To use remote interfaces , you must have HomeSeer PRO , and all of your interfaces must support the " Installer Library " mode - HomeSeer 's Z-Troller supports this . Your main controller can be a USB interface and the remote interface a serial device normally , but for this procedure , it is required that the interfaces be reversed , and a remote interface can not be USB , so all of the Z-Wave interfaces in the system must be serial ( RS-232 ) for this to work using this method . There are two ways , one I think is a little better than the other so I am just going to describe that one . <p> This assumes that you have successfully added a 2nd Z-Troller as a remote interface and have synchronized the interfaces at least once so that a node number was assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . After that ... <p> Either before you leave for the 2nd home , or upon your arrival at the 2nd home , go to the HomeSeer interfaces setup and REVERSE the Main and Secondary controllers . In doing this , you must FIRST remember to set them to NONE so that upon clicking the Save button , HomeSeer will properly close the serial ports . So , write down the COM port numbers ( or Ethernet addresses using Ethernet to serial adapters ) that the interfaces are on , and write down their node numbers so that if you confuse things later , you will be able to tell which is which . In case you have a problem , it is good to have a remote access solution in place that will allow you to access your HomeSeer computer remotely - if the interfaces are not shut down properly and there is a problem , restarting HomeSeer is the only way to fix it . <p> Once you set both to NONE and then click SAVE , you can then re-configure them with the COM port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAVE again . This should initialize them with the interface in the vacation home acting as the main ( primary ) interface , which means that all of the Manage Z-Wave Controller functions will now be from the perspective of the vacation home interface . <p> At this point , the procedure is the same as if you were in your main home - disconnect the Z-Troller , add or remove nodes in your vacation home , then re-connect the Z-Troller and from the Manage Z-Wave Controller page , click the Import button . HomeSeer will load the new nodes and will then communicate with them to get information from them . Remember that if there are nodes that the controller can not communicate with very well , you may have to optimize the surrounding nodes and then optimize the new node until communications are good . If bad communications caused HomeSeer to create a device that looks nothing like what you expected and does not have the features it should have , that is OK at this point - you can still go to the device properties and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete the device(s) it created and do a rescan , at which point HomeSeer should then be able to create everything correctly . <p> Because this vacation home interface is the primary , HomeSeer will even set up associations for devices in the vacation home with the vacation home interface rather than the one in your primary residence . <p> When you are done adding the nodes and everything is working properly , remember to use the interface to update any in-wall scene or zone controllers that you have so that they have the most recent network information as well . <p> When nodes are done being added/removed and the wall controllers are updated , do a " Sync Installer Interfaces " so that the node changes in the vacation home will be sent to the interface back at your primary residence . <p> Now you can either change the interfaces BACK to the way they were ( remember to set them to NONE first ) , or you can do that upon your return to your main residence ( drive carefully ! ) . <p> When you return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not done so already , then take the interface in that home and use it to update any wall scene/zone controllers that you have there . <p> Go to the properties for the devices you added in your vacation home , and make sure that the remote interface to use is set to the vacation home interface - this tells HomeSeer to communicate with those nodes using just that interface .

Have tried removing and installing the thermostat , plugin etc to no avail .

It does display Celsius and appears on the web page with Celsius readings ( at least for now ) . I already have a Wayne-Dalton therm in Celsius , and have the C setting the config file . <p> However , when I try to program an event , e.g. set a " cool " setpoint , the lowest number in the drop down list is 40 which makes this pretty useless for AC to say the least . I tried overtyping to get something like 22 to show up but you are confined to values in the list . <p> Anyway to get actual Celsius acceptable values showing so this becomes useful ? <p> UPDATE : if you go to the ZWStatstatus page , the current temp and programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the set temp has to be set in Fahrenheit . <p> smcwilliams , the ZWStatstatus page is fixed to show celsius in 2.5.0.29 ( there 's a link earlier in this thread for HSPRO to that version ) . <p> However , it also breaks the setpoint settings in the iphone hstouch gui . If you do n't use hstouch on a mobile phone for HS , then I 'd go ahead and grab 2.5.0.29 , otherwise you may want to stick to having to set it in F until a fix comes out . <p> ( As an aside , I 'm hoping that the fix will include allowing to display and set the Celsius temp in 0.5 degree increments , as the thermostat itself also alows .... ) <p> Not sure if this is the same issue , but I recently upgraded to the latest .23 release as well , and one of my Wayne-Dalton thermostats is showing up in Fahrenheit , the other Celsius .

I 'm at a loss as to how to further troubleshoot the issue . <p> After several reboots and zwave scans , my thermostat has switched back to proper operation on Fahrenheit . <p> Paul , I did open a ticket on this and as you note was sent .28 as a fix ( NB .28 not the .29 you mention ) . I have n't checked from my iTouch/iPhone yet , but although the displays on the stat and ZWstatstatus pages now show correctly in Celsius , trying on a regular PC interface to set an event setpoint temp only has the options for 13 through 19 both for the cool and heat setpoints . That range works for us if we were heating , but is n't too practical ( or cost efficient ) for us this summer on the cooling . I wrote back and suggested perhaps 19 through 25 for the cool else 16-25 if they have to have one range for heat and cool both . <p> With the Wayne Dalton ' stat I have , the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch device that showed up with this ' stat that put the system on or off if you previously had chosen cool or heat . At least with that I could write events that controlled the system based on a temp or time . The CT30 does n't show up with any such binary switch so being able to write an event with valid temp options is the only alternative to manually going in and typing the setpoint you want on the zwstatstatus page . <p> With this version , at least , the temp on the status and zwstatstatus pages displays with one decimal ( and not just .5 ) , but the setpoints as noted above are integers . <p> Yeah , via the zwstatstatus page ( via .29 which I 'm running ) I can indeed set the setpoint ( on whole integers ) . It 's only my iphone interface that seems to be broken ( though other people have commented on other mobile devices I think ) . <p> If I switch back to F , the setpoints can be set from my iphone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> Those are my two main things right now : setting the setpoint from my phone , and being able to set it in at least 0.5 degree increments . <p> I 'll probably switch back to .23 for now so that I can still see the device in Celsius but have the setpoint go back to being in F - at least in F I can ' simulate ' more granularity than 1 degree C. <p> So , I 'm just curious as a side point - I 've seen several references in this thread to teh setpoint on HS being stuck in the 13-19 range or some such . Where are you seeing this . The only place in HS that I can see that I can change the setpoint is in the Zwave Thermostat Status page , where you set the number manually ( no drop down ) ....

I 'm going to try strategically placing a beaming-capable wall module in between the two and that should do it . <p> As Rich mentioned , locks support beaming , so you do not have to wait for them to wake up . However , the security protocol in Z-Wave requires that after the node has been added to the network , there is a very short period of time in which the security key can be exchanged to complete the authorization of the device to communicate via the security command class . Without that , only non-secure command classes will work . Thus , if you add the lock with the stick disconnected , even plugging it in very quickly and starting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEFINITELY too late if there is a command - such as polling - already taking place . With 3 thermostats being polled every 5 seconds , and a thermostat having between 4 and 6 command classes that get queried when it is polling , you have your Z-Wave network tied up almost exclusively with polling . I hope you meant to say 5 minutes and not 5 seconds , because if it was 5 seconds then good luck getting anything to work very well ! <p> I have now moved from Z-Stick2 to my updated Z-Troller and pared down the amount of polling on my network . I was able to add the Yale lock with no problems and configure and control the lock with no issues when the Z-Troller was close to the lock . BUT , when I move the Z-Troller and PC back to their normal location , I can Optimize with no issues , and can see the lock with a No-Op , but can not control or query the lock . According to Z-Seer and Who-Am-I , the Yale Lock is a direct route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaming in-between , but most of my other nodes are older , pre-beaming/security . Any thoughts on making sure that communication with the Yale lock is robust ? HSPro 2.5.0.49 Z-Troller 1.15 <p> Have you done a full optimize on your network ? If not , please do so . Then optimize the lock 4 times , then do a full optimize on the lock . The full optimize will add return routes to the lock . The return routes tell the lock how to route back to the Z-Troller . <p> But here is a potential problem . The Z-Troller firmware does not know about the types of devices in your network so it may add return routes that route the packets through your non-beaming devices . If this happens , then the queries to the lock will fail . <p> There are 3 ways to fix this : <p> 1 ) Make sure all of your devices are beamining capable ( not an ideal solution ) 2 ) Power off all your non-beaming capable devices , then optimize the lock 4 times and do a full optimize on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the lock only has beaming capable neighbors and will assign the proper routes . 3 ) Add another Z-Troller to your system that is closer to the lock so routing is not required . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by brehbock <p> I have now moved from Z-Stick2 to my updated Z-Troller and pared down the amount of polling on my network .

HSPro 2.5.0.49 Z-Troller 1.15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarify - you need to optimize the nodes around the lock so that THEY know they are neighbors to the lock ( if they support beaming ) and THEN you optimize the lock so that the " return routes " get added with the knowledge of which nodes are neighbors . This is why Rich wrote " full optimize on your network " . Do it a few times . If you have version 2.5.0.49 , do " Optimize " on the whole network and then " Full Optimize " on the lock . <p> I 'd attempted first doing a Full Network Optimization and had errors establishing return routes .

Thanks for your patience . -Bill <p> You can not route through a non-beaming device at all . If its working , and its routing ( no real way to tell if its routing or not ) , then it must be using beaming devices . I would not optimize it again unless you have issues as it may assign a return route that goes through a non-beaming device . Its possible that its working because its not routing at all right now . The Z-Troller will always try a direct route first before routing . <p> There is no way to set up your own route .

Either way is legitimate , but you need to know which way the wiring has been installed to make the changes you plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently connected with other black or red wires that feed other switches . Use a voltage tester and connect one side to the white ( neutral ) or copper ( ground ) and touch the black wires . One of them will have power at all times . This is the line feed . <p> The load wire will probably be black , too , and will run to the light fixture or outlet being switched . <p> If your existing switch does not use a neitral then you will need to connect the white wire from the cable that includes the line feed to the new switch . This is usually done by adding a short white wire from the white bundle to the new switch . If there is only one switch in the box the white wire may already be connected to the white that runs to the load . <p> There are numerous basic electrical wiring tutorials on the Web . You may want to find one that has diagroms so you can determine how your hosue is wired and make the proper connections . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies . Yes , I will definitely remove the fuses and check for power before doing anything ! <p> If I 'm understanding you correctly , I will remove the fuse in the fusebox that connects to the switch , remove the switch itself , remove the wires from the switch , TURN ON THE POWER AGAIN by reconnecting the fuse , test each of the hot wires for power -- the one that has power even when everything is disconnected would be the LINE , turn off the power and then install my new switch . <p> I actually had n't thought about turning the power back on while the wires were exposed , but your method makes perfect sense . I 'll just be very , very careful while the power is on ... <p> Of course , I realize now that for me the FIRST step will be checking for neutrals in each of the switches I want to change . As I use CFLs on these lights ( and it would be cost-prohibitive to replace all of them with dimmable CFLs ) I need to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for that check , I 'll leave the power OFF . <p> Just one last question on this : you mention " multi-switches " -- is this just a broader term for the double-switch I have in my bathroom ? All the other switches in my apartment control a single light ( or set of lights ) , so those would n't be " multi-switch boxes " , right ? Or am I misunderstanding the term ? <p> Thank you again for your great advice and help , <p> Alex <p> P.S. I am using a Black and Decker Home Wiring book that has very straightforward , detailed explanations and color pictures . It just did n't make any distinction between line vs. load wires when replacing switches -- probably because if you were just replacing one switch with its ( non-electronic ) equivalent , you 'd just connect the same wires to the same terminals and be done ...

@@98239335 @2439335/ <p> Does anyone know how to " factory reset " a z-wave module . I purchased 5 of the GE z-wave modules from Radio Shack . Before incorporating them into my Homeseer setup , I used a GE45601 handheld controller to set-up 3 of them to see how they worked and how I might use the handheld controller . After learning a little about z-wave I proceeded to set them up with the Homeseer z-stick ( aeon ) . During that process I learned that I had to " remove " the modules from the handheld controller before I could " add " them to the z-stick . So I removed 2 of the 3 that I had added ; I left one alone because I thought I might use it only with the handheld controller . I got the 2 appliance modules installed and working in Homeseer - Yeah Rah ! ( this was after about 6 hours of frustrating searches for installation info etc . ) During the installation I learned it was possible to use the 45601 remote as a secondary controller . So I reset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary control . At that point I remembered the 3rd module and I attempted to " remove " it from the handheld controller . I could do nothing with it . I could not add it or remove it from the hand held or the z-stick . I even tried using a brand new 45601 controller ; it did not respond . So I searched for a way to perform a factory reset on the module ; I found nothing . <p> I returned the module to Radio Shack and got a new one . The new one worked fine . I 'm pretty sure there was nothing wrong with the original module . It just needed to be reset . <p> How can these modules be reset if the original device to which they are paired , is no longer functional or available ? ? ? <p> I am having exactly the same problem after trying to add the GE advanced remote as a secondary controller .

I was able to make it work . I 'm also running into weird problems with the devices and adding to network and dealing with primary vs secondary controllers . <p> So far , I 'm finding zwave to be the exact opposite of X10 . <p> They got the hard part right , it has been communicating flawlessly with the modules and switches . The lights go on an off as they should with no misses . Homeseer is able to get status of modules as needed . My X10 never worked properly . The phase coupler did n't fix the problem . It was very hit and miss , and got worse over time . <p> I ca n't believe z-wave messed up the network definition so bad . I never had a problem with an X10 module not being what it was set to be . If I set it to O5 , it was O5 . And anything which speaks X10 can finds it O5 . So simple . The zwave network setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my zwave for about a week or . Aeon zstick 2 and a bunch of radioshack modules . Have about 30 devices so far . Already lost my primary controller once and had to re-discover everything . Still acting weird . But having the light go on every single time I hit the buttons on the remote is pretty nice . <p> My concern is what happens if the primary controller fails ? Do all the modules become useless ? This is a big issue for me ! If one of my grandkids pulls the z-stick out of my HS box , who knows what might happen ! <p> My concern is what happens if the primary controller fails ? Do all the modules become useless ? This is a big issue for me ! If one of my grandkids pulls the z-stick out of my HS box , who knows what might happen ! <p> Steve Q <p> I do n't think so , that would be too large a flaw . People have too much money tied up into modules for a simple error to render them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Basically , I did lose my primary , and I was able to re-import all devices to it without too much issue . <p> I think if a device is added to a primary , it forgets the previous primary . <p> My concern is what happens if the primary controller fails ? Do all the modules become useless ? This is a big issue for me ! If one of my grandkids pulls the z-stick out of my HS box , who knows what might happen ! <p> Steve Q <p> You can still manually control the lights . All of the protocols are the same , if you remove the controller HomeSeer will not be able to communicate with the devices . <p> I think if a device is added to a primary , it forgets the previous primary . <p> I have tried this with 3 modules . You can not add them to a second primary controller unless they are first removed from the first controller . If the first controller is dead or missing , you can not remove them . So back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset of the modules ? <p> OK Guys , I am clearly doing something wrong . I tried the procedure below multiple times and it does not work ! <p> My primary controller is the z-stick ( Aeon ) . I have a module I want to remove from the network ( a GE appliance module ) . So I remove my z-stick from my Homeseer computer and put it in a metal box ( this simulates one of my grandkids stealing it ! ) . Now I can no longer control the module , it does not respond to Homeseer comands . I have a brand new GE handheld 45601 controller ; nothing has been programmed into . I follow the " deleting a device " procedure provided in the operating manual on page 6 . Step 5 of the procedure says " When the screen displays SUCCESS , you have successfully deleted the node/light from your network . " -----In my case , SUCCESS never appears in the display , and the device is not deleted ! ! ! ! ! <p> Slave nodes can be reset : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using your network 's Primary controller ( or an inclusion controller ) . This will also return them to factory defaults. 2 . You can reset them by " removing " them using any other Primary controller . Basically , the other Primary thinks it 's going to remove one of its own devices--but then when it starts " removing " the device from another network it just resets that device instead . Please note that you ca n't start the " remove " procedure on a primary controller unless it has at least one device in its network . <p> Controller nodes can be reset : 1 . You can remove them from your current network using your Primary controller . You can not remove a controller node using a Primary from another network . 2 . All controller nodes have a backup " reset " procedure . This may be holding two buttons for 20 seconds or executing a reset command from software , etc . <p> Rupp is correct , by the way ( as usual--great job on all the helpful info , Rupp ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for this info . There are a lot of things about z-wave that are not very intuitive . And I think a lot of people will give up on a system if they ca n't get it to work . When I purchased my z-wave stuff at Radio Shack , I remember the store manager making a comment about a guy who came in and bought $500 worth of z-wave stuff and returned it all a week later because he said it did n't work . This is the kind of stuff that really deters people from getting into home automation . I think everyone on this forum are key drivers toward making home automation a successful and fun endeavor . Thanks for helping to educate us . <p> I have two ACT ZDW103 switches that control the lights OK but I could never add to the network . I attempted to delete , then add them with my Ztroller , but they are never detected . I RMA 'd one to ACT , they said it was fine and they reset it OK and had recommended that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have thought the ZTroller would see them and allow a delete since it has on other devices I 've added in the past .

It 's really more of a player than a recorder . There 's probably some open source video recording software on the net that would work better . <p> FWIW , the API documentation does not include any call for a current image , but it does include one for a historical image stored on the Doorbell : <p> I have tried to figure out if current image capture is available but just not documented in the API . So far I have n't been able to find it and I suspect it is just not implemented right now . As a result of no image capture being available , I ca n't use it with the Netcam plugin . <p> They actually say in the documentation that they have implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exposed it via the API but may do so in the future . If they do expose the RTSP server that would solve any issues with things like image capture and would likely may the device much more friendly to 3rd party devices . <p> I am going to put in a request to Doorbird to add image capture to the API . I do n't  ' think it would be a lot of work given that that they are clearly already doing it to get the image history . <p> Guys does anyone have any idea how I can capture video and or a still image from the device .

Click on the Open file button , and nothing happens . No file selector , nothing . Anybody have any ideas ? I 've tried this on both Chrome and Edge . <p> I upgraded a long while ago from a first-generation Zee to an SEL . It was as easy as moving my Z-Stick ( which is what I was using at the time ) to the SEL , and restoring the configuration at the SEL . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have to do this when upgrading from the Z-Stick to a Z-NET . I do not recall having to move any files over manually . For the SmartStick+ issue noted above , I would therefore probably call HomeSeer on Monday to see what 's up . <p> Well it 's been fun and games here ! This did work . But this only restored the nodes . No devices and no events which I understand are stored in the Setup backup configuration file . <p> So I installed the backup configuration file from my Zee S2 into the SEL . Well guess what , now I could n't access the web interface for some reason . Not sure if something got corrupted or there was a network issue . After hours of troubleshooting and using the maintenance options 1 and 2 without success , my patience got the better of me , and I did a system restore from the Ubuntu boot screen . Discovered the factory copy of HS that was reinstalled had a very old Z-Wave plugin that does n't recognise the SmartStick+ . That confounded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shipped . Nope ! Anyway , a Z-Wave plugin update solved that . <p> Decided to give it another try . Yes , I 'm a glutton for punishment . This time I put most of the Zee S2 settings in setup back to default before backing up the Zee S2 config . Installed this new file into the SEL , watched it reboot and presto , I am back in . BUT wait , it asks me to register , then tells me I 've exceeded number of re-registrations ... ARRRRGH ! ! ! <p> Now I am really stuck ! Ca n't do much more now than wait for HS to reply to my email for a new licence . Have no idea whether my devices and events have stuck until I can get past the registration lock out . <p> Ahh , one other niggling issue that I am sure a Linux guru can help with .

Most have been elaborately tweaked to minimise the howls of protest from family members like when the lights go off while watching TV and so on . In this case , my smart TVs ( using BLLAN ) hold the motion controlled lights on while family members watch like unmoving zombies for minutes on end .

Keep the old production system running and tweak the new production system until it is running to your satisfaction . The Z-Wave nodes stuff is kept in the Z-Wave device which is the most important part of the stuff you are doing . <p> Yes ; always mention baby steps . Best to keep one box running in production if you can while concurrently working on second box or new box . <p> or <p> Start with a running HS3 configuration that is not configured yet ( with an import ) . Back that up to another directory ; call the back up directory anything you want . Then afterwards start the import . If that fails then just delete the directory and copy the original directory back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't concern yourself with the autostart of HS3 yet ; in fact disable the autostart until you have a working base ( start HS3 manually for a bit ) . <p> The above noted this does n't work well when the base OS / HS3 is using Mono 3 . X and new is using Mono 4. x . Here then it probably would be better to just downgrade the Mono from 4 . X to mono 3 . X ( which can be a bit of a PITA but it is a time saving effort ) . <p> All my nodes , events , devices , timers , counters and settings are in . No need to redo any of my events and no red text in the logs . Events all seem to be firing as normal . ...

Now go to the Z-Wave Controller Manager and select the action ' Restore a Network to this Interface ' . Now you get a drop down box to select the backup file and the list will include the Zee S2 interface backup file from Step 1 . Select that and go through the process . After that , you may need to restart the interface or turn the plugin off then on . <p> 5 . Final step . Go to Z-Wave Controller Manager and do Optimise Network and Fully Optimise . Finally , for all your battery powered devices , you 'll need to go around and wake them up one by one and do optimise and fully optimise from the respective root device . <p> That is it !

@@98239345 @2439345/ <p> I would like to be able to take the 0 to 10VAC that comes from the CT that Rupp likes and convert that to 0 to 5 vdc that SECU16 likes . How can you do this ? If possible ( and cheep ) it could be an inexpensive power monitoring system . <p> Easy . Just pickup at Radio Shack the cheapest 5 volt wall wart . That puts out DC . Plug it or wire it into your 110 V source . Get the lowest power ( amperage ) unit you can find , the lower the power , the less expensive . I do it with a little AC 5 volt unit and feed it into an analog input on my digital / analog input board ( already in place ) . If your good with electronics a bridge rectifier , and a resistor voltage divider will do the same thing . <p> I like the wall wart idea . But is there one that is linear from input of 0 to 10 ( ten ) Volt AC input with a 0 to 5 volt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linear but is consistant with the variation through the range . <p> I realize that it is not a wall wart it will have to be a transformer with input 0-10 AC and output 0-5 VDC . If anyone has an idea of where to find this cheep I would like to know . <p> I assume that the CT you are referring to is one of the CT30xx current transformers that have been batted around . If so , the burden resistor sets the current-to-voltage ratio , and correct selection of that resistor can give you 0 - 5 volts . <p> If you post which CT you want to use ( if you have a preference ) , and/or how much current you want to measure , we can come up with exactly what you need . <p> I would like to be able to take the 0 to 10VAC that comes from the CT that Rupp likes and convert that to 0 to 5 vdc that SECU16 likes . <p> I see that suggestions have been given to put a current limiting resistor inline to drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as an analog dc signal ? Seems to me , a bridge rectifier as mentioned already is needed to filter the ac to dc right ? <p> I am still concerned that this is not going to change AC current to DC current . <p> I was looking at doing the whole house . I have not looked at the panel yet to verify but I believe that it is a 300 amp service at 220V . I would be attaching to each of the 120V legs for the load reading . That would be two at 150 amps . <p> I am still concerned that this is not going to change AC current to DC current . . . Does it matter ? <p> I completely overlooked the fact that to Ocelot 's input is DC only , if it really is . I do n't have an Ocelot , and have never seen a schematic of their analog front end , so I am going to be conservative here . <p> A full-bridge rectifier , using schottky diodes , between the CR3110 and the burden resistor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistor , that is where you want to measure it . If the bridge was after the resistor , you would be measuring the voltage at the resistor MINUS two diode drops . With the diodes first , the CR3110 will be generating a current though them , not a voltage , and their effect will be less significant . To minimize the effect further , use schottky diodes for their low voltage drop . I would also put a small-value capacitor , around 1 nF , in parallel with the resistor to deal with the ripple . <p> The equation for the burden resistor value , R , is : R = 3100 * V / I where : V is the output voltage you would like , and I is the maximum current that you would then give you that voltage , V. <p> Where does that 3100 come from ? I found the same formula on the CR-3110 spec sheet , but the spec sheet also states it only has 3000 turns on the secondary . I realize the difference between 3000 and 3100 is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure I was n't making a bad assumption . <p> When I do 5VDC voltage regulation I use a 7805 regulator . The input can be pretty sloppy and it will clean it up to a nice 5VDC output . They sell for under $1 and maybe a little more at Radio Shack . The circuit can be a xfmr , full wave bridge and cap as was posted above or a half wave using a single diode and cap , and the 7805 . This puts the parts count at under 5 pieces and can easily be easily soldered with point to point wiring . <p> Other fixed voltage regulators are available in the same family and variable ones also exist if you want to add a variable resistor to tune-in a specific voltage . <p> A voltage regulator will take the voltage that comes in and regulate it down to a FIXED voltage . Then the Ocelot will read the same voltage whenever the incoming voltage is higher than ( by some amount , between .04 and 2 volts ) the setpoint of the voltage regulator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a measurement . <p> It 's clear where the misunderstanding came from : " Changing voltage 10VAC to 5VDC " does n't convey the fact that the voltage varies from 0 to 10 volts . But in reality , the CR3110 does n't put out 10 volts . It can put out UP TO 10 volts , depending on the burden resistor . You simply set that resistor to a value that will give you your desired voltage , 5 volts in this case . <p> Wayne : The 3100 comes from the equation on the bottom of their data sheet . Their equation defines voltage as a function of resistance and current . I simply reworked it to give resistance as a function of voltage and current . <p> Mario : Sorry if I was n't clear of the placement of the bridge . Here is another attempt . the output of the current transformer ( a proportional current ) goes into a full-wave bridge rectifier , thereby rectifying the AC current signal to DC . The output of the rectifier is a DC current and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then to the resistor , that gets a voltage developed across it proportional to the current , and finally to the Ocelot to measure that voltage . <p> I think when you convert a AC to DC by a full wave rectifier bridge you have to multiply by 1.41 ( or something like this I 'm not sure about this conversion factor ) so the maximum voltage at the burden resistor will be 5x1.41 = 7.05 Volts if rectifying it full wave . <p> To have 5 Volts DC we need at the input of the rectifier 5/1.41=3.54 Volts . <p> So we need to calculate a burden resistor that gives us 3.54 Volts AC and at the voltage and current we want . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by roccoThe equation for the burden resistor value , R , is : R = 3100 * V / I where : V is the output voltage you would like , and I is the maximum current that you would then give you that voltage , V. 
@@98239346 @2439346/ <p> We are seeking opinions and guidance as we consider our next step into automation . <p> So although I am new to HomeSeer and Z-Wave I have had some minor experience with X-10 several years ago . My wife and I have just purchased a new home that comes with a Qolsys / Z-Wave based alarm and automation system that runs on the 900mhz standard with services via Alarm.com . I know that this is not compatible with HomeSeer and I have no problem with that . One thing to note : we are in a gated community with security patrols so the alarm is much lower on our list of priorities . <p> We are looking to keep the interface on the Amazon Echo and/or Dot using the HomeSeer web interface only for configuration however I do have a 17 " touch computer screen at my disposal but I am not interested in using tablets/Touch panels etc only voice . <p> Questions : <p> Can 2 completely separate 900mhz z-wave networks exists in the same home ; one for the existing alarm and the other for HomeSeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not share devices ) <p> I 'm familiar with both HS3 and alarm.com ( although with the 2gig gc3 panel , as opposed to Qolsys ) , so I should be able to provide comments : <p> ( 1 ) Two separate Z-Wave networks should not be a problem , with the caveat that you understand that they will not communicate with one another . <p> ( 2 ) HomeSeer does not recommend HS3 being used as a security system , and indeed in general Z-Wave is not UL-listed for usage as a security system . This is one reason why makers like Qolsys , 2gig , and so on , use Z-Wave *just* for automation , and the security aspects are handled separately from automation . <p> If you dig around this board , one popular way to integrate HS3 with a security system is to get a DSC alarm system , and then an interface by which HS3 can receive sensor notifications from the DSC , and also arm/disarm the alarm . Envisalink is one such interface . <p> The question I would have for you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would keep any devices on the Qolsys Z-Wave ? At one old house we had we had an alarm.com 2gig gc2 panel , and I never used the Z-Wave functionality -- instead opting to do all the Z-Wave stuff with HS3 . At our new vacation home , I 'm going to try just using an alarm.com 2gig gc3 panel for all Z-Wave , although I 've already run into the limitations of alarm.com . <p> That is , HS3 is powerful . Very powerful . However , it will require some time investment to get up and running in the way you want . Once you do that , though , so long as you 're not constantly tinkering with your system ( which is an affliction that many acquire ) , it 's pretty rock solid . The question is , if you 're going to do that time investment , why even keep any Z-Wave stuff on the Qolsys ? <p> In your reply you stated " Z-Wave is not UL-listed for usage as a security system . This is one reason why makers like Qolsys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for automation , and the security aspects are handled separately from automation " This was a supersize to me ; I was under the impression ( confirmed by the Alarm.com dealer who installed the system for the developer ) that the sensors were all Z-Wave devices . I have since done a bit of reading based on your comments and now better understand the wireless security components are on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard an not on the Z-Wave standard . Thank you for opening my eyes on this subject I love learning new things <p> I do fully intend to move all of the Automation off of the Qolsys system for several reasons not the least of which is rather expensive monthly charges from Alarm.com for the automation service and more importantly the limited functionality and flexibility when compared to that of HomeSeer . <p> As I mentioned the security aspect is lower on my list of priorities and it is a simple option to continue to use the Qolsys locally with the existing sensors without the monitoring service rather than my idea to move the sensors to the HomeSeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks . <p> This is changing . In February , Sigma announced that " its new Z-Wave transceivers ( models ZM5101 , ZM5202 , and ZM5304 ) with protocol SDK version 6.60 have been evaluated to ULs standards for home security . The products feature anti-jamming and AES 128-bit encryption provisions like todays less-capable UL devices .

@@98239348 @2439348/ <p> First , thanks for taking the time to write your plugins ... they are valuable to my system . <p> I 'm running into a problem here ... I 'm on a ZeeS2 , still under the trial license right now on version 3.16 . A few days ago , I noticed that the plugin was no longer updating and decided to reboot my Zee . Everything updated on the reboot . The next morning I noticed stale information again so I disabled and re-enabled the plugin . Again , everything updated , but became stale over the next few days . I got home today and tried to open the configuration page to enable the debug log , but the page pulls up blank . <p> When I went to the Plugins -&gt; Manage page it took a long time for the page to load and I got the following message for ecobee:CRITICAL : Failed to get InterfaceStatus from Ecobee : Object reference not set to an instance of an object <p> I have a couple hundred of these lines in the log:Warning Plugin Ecobee is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a handful of these:Error Calling SetIOMulti in plugin Ecobee:Object reference not set to an instance of an object Error Getting web page from plugin page ecobeeconfig:Object reference not set to an instance of an object <p> Since I could n't re-enable the plugin , I decided to refresh the interfaces page . It took 5 minutes for the interfaces page to load this time . So I tried to update my plugin to 3.18 . <p> Now I 'm on 3.18 , but it still shows Loaded Remotely and I still get the warnings ... Ecobee does n't show up on my list of plugins any more , but at least my plugin management ( interfaces ) page loads instantly now ... I 'm at a loss . <p> if you disable the plug-in and you still see it as " loaded remotely " , the plug-in process is probably stuck but it still running . You need to kill the process manually ( process name should be something like " mono HSPIEcobee.exe " ) , if you do n't know how to do that just reboot your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Debug and next time the plug-in stops updating the devices , send me the log file ( Logs/Ecobee.txt ) <p> I 'm attaching an excerpt from my log file filtered on Ecobee and also an excerpt from the Ecobee.txt file from your plugin , filtered for Jun-07 16:40 timeframe . Would you mind taking a look at what is going on ? I had to truncate the file somehow because the main file is 57MB ... let me know if you need more . <p> I have only seen this error once before on one other system which also had mono 3.2.8 . I have never been able to replicate it on my Zee2 which runs mono 4. x , so my guess is that it is some kind of bug with mono 3.2.8 ( I could be wrong though ) <p> If you do n't have too many events already configured in your system I would advise to upgrade mono to a 4. x version because 3. x version has many incompatibility problems . Note that you will need to reconfigure all your events after the upgrade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : LONG ... <p> If you decide to go that route , make sure to backup your whole system ( i.e. backup the entire SD card ) , especially if you are not familiar with Linux . <p> I was afraid I might have to do that ... Not looking forward to it , but I 'm sure I was going to have to do the upgrade one time or another . Hopefully this will fix the plugin ... I have n't seen an update in the last 22 hours . <p> Well , I finally got a spare SD card and had some time to mess around with the system . My attempts to upgrade to mono 4 failed miserably . I deleted all of my events and re-added them , but I was getting some seriously funky behavior ... switches not responding to double taps ... switches in one room controlling lights in another . I had to roll back . However , after I rolled it back to my original image , I reauthorized the app thru the plugin config page and now it 's running stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acting funky.

@@98239353 @2439353/ <p> Ok , you have partial communication , it does n't appear that the panel is handling any incoming requests . I 'm wondering if there is a cable issue and that the Tx line from the PC to the Rx line at the panel is n't pinned correctly . <p> The reason I think the cable may be culprit is because in the log you can see the plugin sending requests for zone names but never getting a response . Also , the panel is sending the exact partition status message every couple of seconds , which means that the panel is not receiving the ' ack ' that the plugin is sending in response . <p> My run is about 75 feet via cat 5e . The red stripe should be to the outside edge of the panel , or if the panel is installed in the can , to the back . You have it correct . You pins look correct . Look at my stickey post at the top of the forum to be sure . <p> One other thought - If you did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adaptor . I always do straight through cables ( 2-2/3-3/5-5 ) and add a null adaptor if required by the device . Also make sure your modular plug orientation was correct at each end . If one gets upside down , then the one RX-TX line wire still works , which will cause your problem above . <p> Most of the communication issues with CADDX are due to either reversed pins , or panel settings . <p> What do you mean by having " the correct modular plug orientation " ? How can I tell if one is upside down ? <p> Regards , <p> Robert <p> I am assuming that you are using a RJ45 plug into a RJ45 to DB9 adaptor ? ? See my cable configuration post at the top of the forum . <p> If this is the case , make sure that you have the " tab " on the rj45 pointing down to the floor and then crimp the cable into the plug . DO the same on both ends . I have seen many people do one end backwards . <p> I too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my nx-8e , and my only suggestion is to try another serial port on your computer . My problem was finally solved by switching to my motherboards on board serial port ( com 2 ) and rebooting .

When you click panel info you should see a screen that gives you lots of info on your panel . it does n't  pop up though , check your task bar for the pop up window . hope this helps ! <p> for some reason I had to use my 16550 based UART serial port .. which is a PC SIIG add on card ... the caddx would n't talk to my motherboard or my sealevel 8 port serial card .. the UARTS are different .. it appears the PC SIIG card uses true 10 volt RS232 highs and lows as opposed to 5-7 volts on the other ports . also to figure out the cable issue and also works with all cabling issues is go to radio shack or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest cheapest tools . -christopher <p> PerfecTemp - the Most advanced HVAC system I 've ever Built - and its in my House

I ca n't seem to make it function correctly . Am I missing something ? When I go to add the range values , it does n't do anything on the web interface . Other than that , the on/off functions work well with the virtual devices now . <p> Take a look at the last part of post #6 in this thread . It explains how to set a range value . Essentially , you first remove the fixed values from a virtual device . Most dimmers have off=0 , a dim range of 1-98 , 99=on and 255=On Last Level . You create the range value of 1-98 for dim level first , then you can add the Off value , the On value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtual Device to have identical values to the dimmer you want to control . You can also add the same status graphics if you wish . While I add a On Last Level value to my virtual devices , this can be problematic when you are controlling multiple dimmers , since each could have been at a different level when they were last on . <p> The trigger on your event would be : IF The Virtual device just had its value set or changed . Then use Easy Trigger to " Set a Device to another Device " and set the dimmer(s) to the Virtual Device . The " Set or Changed Trigger , will automatically set the real dimmers to the VD any time its value is set or changed . The reason you want " Set " in the mix is it will allow you to turn the lights on or off from the Virtual Device , even if it is already at the value . This avoids the need to have separate events to set the VD to the physical device . This is easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can be very difficult if controlling several .

I suppose I could do some type of vibration sensor , but that would n't distinguish between the washer and the dryer , it would just let me know if something is happening in the laundry room . <p> I need the idiot 's version to make this work . If I can make this happen very soon after moving into our new house , the WAF will be sky high and allow me lots of latitude to implement all the other cool things I 've been wanting to do when I finally get a house . <p> The real world does n't reward perfectionists , it rewards people who get things done . <p> If you post a pic of the connector I guarantee someone across the world on here will know what it is , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current sensor ...

@@98239356 @2439356/ <p> Hi Everyone , I 've been reading quite a bit about using HSTouch on this forum and have started to setup my system . It seemed that there was n't a good place to go for HSTouch Designer basics all in one place , so I decided to start this thread to see if I can help by letting others benefit from all of the reading and trial and error I 've done . Hopefully others will chime in and we 'll all learn new/better ways to do the things we want in HSTouch . <p> Basic Project Setup : For me , understanding how to setup a project that can be rapidly copied/altered was one of the most important things . Components of the basic project setup include : backgrounds , basic frame design/button location , screen resolution choices . <p> Ill start with an overview of some useful tools : <p> GUIFX Co-Pilot ( Free here : http : **36;1746;TOOLONG ) useful for sizing backgrounds to various screen resolutions , can also make basic standardized buttons with graphics on them , and has an app called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your projects . <p> Powerpoint can create basic backgrounds by importing images , then adding draw elements on top of it to create a frame ( use 3D effects to give the frame beveled edges , shadows , etc . ) . I would recommend sizing the images in GUIFX to the exact screen resolution of your device then importing them into powerpoint , setting the image size to be 100% scaling and resizing the slide to match the image size . I had trouble converting a measured screen dimension into a Powerpoint slide dimension directlythe size never matched . Can also use Powerpoint to make basic buttons , but sizing is again an issue and required me to do a bit of trial and error to find the right size . <p> Adobe Fireworks I 'm using the trial version of this software to create buttons and will probably buy the full version to continue that and also make my frames instead of using Powerpoint . Here 's an example button I made using Fireworks and a tutorial like the one linked here : LONG ... <p> Steps I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video here : to give you basic understanding of how the interface works . Its long , but worth it to see the types of things you can do and how to do them . <p> Choose a color scheme ( Co-Pilot - Koloroo can help ) <p> Choose a background image <p> For my Galaxy Nexus I used a great wallpaper I found on the Zedge App ( free on Android Market ) <p> Resize the image using Co-Pilot into landscape and portrait versions at your desired screen resolution . <p> Setup Frame : <p> Alternative 1 : Import background image into Powerpoint , set image scaling to 100% , resize Powerpoint slide to match background image size , then use draw tools to create a frame . Adding 3D effects such as beveling , shadows , lighting effects , can give your design some extra depth . Save the slide as an image ( I use PNG format ) and put it in the Backgrounds folder for your client type or in the Default folder ( my choice ) . Here 's how this method turned out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use its drawing tools to overlay the frame . I have n't done this yet , but had good success using it to make professional looking buttons so will probably transition to this in the future . Export image with frame as PNG file and put in Backgrounds Folder . <p> Use project resizing tool to take a Homeseer provided project and resize it into your desired screen resolution ( skip this step if a default project is already offered for your screen size ) . <p> Resizing ( or directly using ) an existing default project gives you basic functionality even while you 're developing/testing your new project . Just add your new screens and create temporary buttons that take you to them on the old Homeseer provided screens . Just be sure to copy over a " home " button on the new screens so you can get back to the standard interface if you want to . <p> A note on the resizing tool : for some reason some of the fonts in the default HSTouch projects have decimals in them ( 12.13pt font for example ) . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into 1213pt font ( so it gets HUGE ! ) . This really screws up the lists in the resized default HSTouch project and makes it look like the resizing tool did n't work right . You just need to click somewhere on the huge item while in Designer and change the font size from 1213 to 12pt or whatever you want . <p> Update ( 4/22/12 ) : I 've also recently had issues with resizing to a lower resolution . I 'm getting an error when I do that , not sure why . I was able to successfully resize to a higher resolution , but am having issues going back down . <p> Open the resized project or Homeseer Default project in HSTouch Designer . Go into Project settings and make sure all the settings are correct ( I havent been able to change the project resolution in here and get it to stick after closing the dialog box , so not sure if that 's a bug or if I 'm doing something wrong ) . <p> Create a new landscape screen and name it Template L. Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen background image . <p> Start dragging in standard buttons that you want to appear on every landscape screen and set their functionality . <p> Add any RSS feeds , camera feeds , date/time , etc. you want to appear on every page <p> Save this new template screen once you think you have it complete . <p> When you want to create a new landscape screen , right click on the top of the screen window and choose " copy this screen " . A new screen will open with the name " Template L Copy " . <p> Rename this screen to your desired name and start adding your unique elements . <p> As you add things to your screens that you want to appear on every screen ( or tweak existing elements ) , be sure to go back and update your template screens so all future screens will be created correctly . <p> You can keep following these steps to create more screens as well as a portrait screen template . <p> Here 's how my final home screen turned out ( floorplan not completed yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started .

I only had to use it on battery for 3 hours during an outage but it still had plenty of battery left . <p> Personally , I run HS3 on an RPI 3 . I am running HS3 for Linux standard ( no limit on total number of plugins ) . There were a few problems I had to overcome with replacing ARM compiled executables but that was not too difficult . My configuration is relatively well suited for smaller deployments . It also reduces my overall power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dirt cheap for a 1.2 GHz quad core CPU and 1 GB OF RAM . <p> My HA network deployment is pretty small . I have some 253 total devices , 140 events , and 7 plugins . My HA network currently consists of Z-wave controlled lighting , dry contact , door , motion , HVAC control unit , and ceiling fans . I have 32 z-wave nodes , and am working on finishing out with 33 more z-wave controlled devices . I am also managing and monitoring my network devices , Kodi HT applications . I currently use only about 50% of the resources on the RPI . <p> I would like to tie a security system , sprinkler control , weather station , whole home audio , and security video monitoring system into HS3 . <p> I expect that I will need to move into a bigger system at some point . I will likely stand up a single self built miniPC platform like a multi-core Intel/AMD system or build an ESXi hypervisor VM host server and move all my server systems to VMs . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 8GB of RAM for around $220 . <p> HS3 is pretty lite on system resource requirements by itself . The thing you need to account for is growth as your HA network and plugin use expands so does the consumption of server resources resources . <p> If your goal is to buy a PC instead of build , I would look into a gigabyte or Asus mini PC on an i5 Intel CPU or a 4 core or better series AMD . I would recommend 8GB RAM . Also , go with an SSD hard drive . <p> Add me to the list of Raspberry Pi3 users running HS3 standard . I just bought HS3 last week and migrated my Openhab setup . The Pi is barely being taxed . <p> For install , I actually installed the HS3-pi3 image for evaluation , then decided to go with HS3 standard due to the plugin limit on the Pi version of the software .

I used to run on something similar to a D510 and 2 GB with a regular hard drive , but now have an I7 with 8 GB and an SSD and HS3 runs much more reliably . I would see above 80% CPU on my old system regularly , but now rarely see over 5% . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an I7 because I was thinking about running Blue Iris on the same system . <p> This is the downside of HA . Each person and house is different and requires different . I agree HS is low utilization on a computer itself , but it also depends on how big you plan to get . Plugins are the memory hogs in this arena . I have 20 plugins running roughly and that eats up a good chunk of memory . My setup also is script heavy now which has its pros and cons depending on what your goal is . <p> Do I need an i7 with 32 gigs of ram ? ? No and I doubt anyone does , strictly for HA unless the system is going to be multi purpose . But I will say I went from an older duo core with 4 gigs of ram to an 8 core AMD ( last gen and because it was cheap ) and doubled my memory to 8 gigs . I run SQL express as well capturing everything that happens in the house and it 's also my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I initially did virtualization and as stated above , the amount of physical connections was making it tough to maintain , but it was still doable .

Plus overall , my system does seem more reliable . <p> But I guess I got ta ask , does a multi core CPU really matter to HS ( I suspect the answer is no , but I could be wrong ) . <p> Agree with a multi role server , esp . the likes of blue iris which is CPU hog ( full disclosure : I run Milestone Xprotext in a VM for my house cams ) , but for most use cases the celerons are plenty powerful even for multi role . <p> Seriously ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of and has almost no IO .

I could move up to an Asus TinkerBoard ( ARM 1.8 GHz with 2 GB of RAM ) for $60 . <p> The trade off when going cheap is limited available resources as you expand plugins or tie in additional services . Examples : <p> 1 . Add a SQL DB on the system to capture all your log events , 2GB of RAM and that old 5900 RPM spinner drive is not going to be enough . <p> 2 . Stand up a blue iris NVR on the same system , the 2GB OF RAM and that old 5900 RPM spinner drive will likely not be enough . <p> 3 . Think about maintenance and security . Add A/V software , automated Backups , or implement automated patch management , CPU and RAM on low end systems are going to hit above 75% utilization for an extended period of time during maintenance operations . You could try to schedule those maintenance routines outside of normal operating times but you still have to address them in some way . A quad core CPU , 120 GB SSD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional expense if you are already spending the money on a NUC , Zotac , or Asus mini PC or laptop . <p> I have heard the hosting HS3 on a VM is difficult , but I still think it would be interesting to do . <p> 1 . Agree 4GB is a reasonable amount - Win 10 takes loads for itself now . The SQL impact is surprising . Do you have any links for this ? I 'd think a 5400-5900 ( green ) drive would have plenty of iops for HS ( mostly small writes ) . Not like it 's doing much . <p> 2. 5900 is fine ( even preferred ) for DVR use as it 's almost all large sequential writes . 7200-10k are heat and power hogs . Granted , recall can be slower but most people rarely recall or scrub through old video . <p> 3 . AV and backups etc . True , some these can also be hogs , and use as much as they can get , but again , I run AV and Acronis and a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcode 3 IP cam video ( sub ) streams using VLC on this D510 and it barely breaks a sweat ( 20% until and a few 100 MB ram ) . <p> I guess my point is , and as requested by the OP , modern hardware ( ie. any celeron you can get from the shop ) is way powerful enough for HS . Sure , buy and i5 or i7 and 16GB if you want , but it 's not needed . <p> I stuck 4 gigs of ram and a 120 gig SSD and fired it up with Win 7-32 . I 've got a DSC system linked to it as well as my older HCSII board hooked to it via the comm ports . I run Insteon and Z-Wave , have over 450 " devices " , probably some 150 events , there are 14 plug ins , iTunes and Norton . <p> The processors run at a combined average of 4% and the whole system uses 40% of the 4 gig memory . I used to run Jon00 's charting package but I rarely used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Anyways this thing pops and the beauty of it all is that it consumes about 15 watts ( but my UPS says 1% of its 780 watts ) . These things are meant to be screwed to the back of digital signage screens , so they 're small , noiseless ( no fan ) ... and best of all , many come with 2 comm ports which is a rare thing these days . <p> I see they 've now replaced the atom processor with a Celeron and the cheapest box ( XS36V5 ) goes for US$180 ( TigerD ) ... just add memory and an SSD and you 're good as gold . <p> One is running W7 64 bit ( for a Homeseer user ) and the other is running Ubuntu 16.04 for myself . <p> On the HS3 Lite ( Zee2 software ) started here with first one running on an RPi . Updated it to an RPi2 ( with GPIO Z-Wave / PiFace RTC ) . Then moved ZeeLite to testing on a Pine64 2Gb machine running Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit and circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2Gb and SSD drive ) . I changed the old RPi2 to a Z-Wave slave in the attic and it does well . <p> Newest HSTouch computer is a PipoX7 dual core Atom ( 4 pseudo cores ) with 2 Gb of RAM connected to a 17 " multitouch openframe touchscreen running W10 , Kodi , Homeseer Touch , Kinect plugin , Alexa Plugin , HDHome run streaming , et al . Fast and low power PC . Only issue with it is that it has a built in USB NIC which I can put to sleep but WOL does n't work . <p> Concurrent with said builds just built a Zoneminder CCTV server on a multicore / 32Gb 2 U Dell server . It is the fastest Zoneminder server I have built to date . Big , loud and uses much power though . It is in a rack in the basement of the two story home . Never seen or heard . That said it was purchased in an auction dirt cheap ... 100 USD with a bunch of other servers and cisco switches ( pallet of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 16Gb of RAM ) for another Homeseer user . This one is running an 8 drive NAS , HSPro in Ubuntu , WeeWx , KODI , CCTV back end stuff , HS3 Pro , W7 64 bit Oracle VB ... list goes on and on . It is doing well . <p> Future build plans are for a faster less power consuming iSeries with 32Gb of RAM running Linux and Wintel ( VBs ) . <p> All said ( above ) HS3 runs today in Linux and Windows . In Linux HS3 runs with Intel or ARM based CPUs . Computers today are faster and can multitask just fine . It really depends on how much you want to do with HS3 .

Generally speaking , I pickup RPI 3s , or cheapish equipment that is 1 generation old . <p> My wifi controller and HS3 systems are both hosted on RPI 3s . I have a HTPC system also hosted on an RPI 3 . I am considering moving it to an Asus tinkerboard or pine64 ( as Pete loves his ) .

Additionally , I am actually really glad I did over power it , as I was really impressed with everything I could host in PFsense ( Let 's encrypt ACME SSL client , reverse proxy , DDNS , WAN monitor , IDS , IP region blocking , RADIUS , VPN ) . <p> My next build out will likely be to move my old netgear 4 bay readynas over to a freenas system .

OBVIOUSLY , do n't cross wires when the breaker is closed . 2 . You will need a multimeter that works on 110V/220V AC. 3 .

Wiring can get complicated fast as some times the box a switch is in has other wires that are n't associated with your light in any way whatsoever . You need to find where your power enters the scene and then get familiar with 3-way wiring . There are only so many ways to wire a 3-way and one of them is no longer code legal ( power comes in at the fixture ) .

I am currently running with Device and Event Control with an accuracy of approximately 65% for the first time spoken trigger words . This week , I will be posting the steps I took in a Suggestion Outline Document . <p> The main problem that I have encountered is Alexa 's interpretation of the Homeseer trigger phrase " RUN EVENT " or RUN THE EVENT " . I have verified the Alexa interpretation through the Alexa Skill Settings/History and compared the recorded phrase and the Alexa interpreted phrase . Yes , I have run Alexa Voice Training and sent numerous emails to the Amazon Echo Group . <p> The problem I have run into is that Alexa interprets " Run the Event " as " run the and " , " run of the event " , " run the up at " , " run the evette " , " run the acent " , " run the avante " etc . Note that the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an device or event name that is misinterpreted , I can change it in Homeseer . But , I can not do anything about the interpretation of the Homeseer trigger phrase for " Run the Event " . <p> I think this problem could be easily resolved ( and reliability increased to 95% ) with the following change to one Homeseer HS3 Trigger Phrase : <p> " Both tags will need to show up for HomeSeer to look through the event names . " --- If I understand that means both " Run " AND " Event " are required to run a homeseer event . <p> What I was trying to stress is that the word " Event " is very unreliable with Echo Interpretation . I am Canadian and do not speak with an accent " eh " <p> Seriously , I can give you access to look at my Echo App History and with 100s of " Run the Event ... " or " Run ... Event " a high percentage of the statements are misinterpreted resulting in " .. that device was not found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the word " Run " . <p> Is there a reason why the word " Run " can not be an event trigger word ? " Dim " and " Turn " seem to work 90% of the time but " Event " is very unreliable . <p> I am using all sorts of Event trigger names such as " Retire Mode " , " Morning Mode " , " Pool Cover Close " etc which seem to get interpreted properly or if they are misinterpreted ( ie close becomes clothes ) , I can change the event name to correct the problem . <p> Thank you for the reset on my way of thinking regarding Events and Echo triggering . I am no longer using the " Run ... Event " verbal statement and I have changed over to using the " Set " trigger word in every events " Recognized Phrase " . <p> I changed all of my events to include a " recognized phrase " starting with the word " Set " . Example - " Alexa , tell Homeseer Set the family fireplace off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the trigger statement though . So if I add a number of " OR IFs " to the event , ( i.e. " Set the family fire place off " or if " Set the family room fire place off " or " Set fireplace off " etc. ) my reliability seems to go way up . Each time it does n't work I check the Echo Setup/History log and add the word combination to the events " Recognized Phases " if it 's close . <p> Question - how literal do I need to be with the Event Recognized Phrase ? Will " Alexa , tell Homeseer to Set the Fountains On " and " Alexa , tell Homeseer Set the Fountains On " both trigger an event with a " Set Fountains On " Recognized Phrase ? Or , do I need to add " to Set Fountains On " as a second trigger phrase for the event . If you could give a brief overview on how Recognized Phrases are handled at your end it would be appreciated . <p> Question - is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used both system wide and for each event ? <p> Thank you for the reset on my way of thinking regarding Events and Echo triggering .

You can also just do a whole disk copy create a new base and restore the copy from your archives which is a bit of a PITA . That said though only adding Mono to the Linux build of old and now with the Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 Mono is included in the build these days . <p> I went to max memory that my motherboard would take and here it was 16Gb . I am taking advantage of the RAM running Oracle VBs which run Wintel today on the Ubuntu Server box . <p> Mostly seeing Homeseer 3 folks doing similiar . IE : if you build new and do an import you will not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nice about Linux ( plugging Linux here ) is that you do not have to install proprietary drivers for devices . IE : a serial , usb or network connection HS driver is taken care of Homeseer and the base is the base . <p> BTW here use the R2 start up delayer with W2003 , W10 , W7 and embedded XP for touchscreens . Works great and allows you to tweak the start a bit . <p> Early in the middle 2000 's would utilize FireDaemon for use with HS services but quit after a bit of too many side programs running . <p> I mix it with an old command line script which initially checks for a network connection , then does a time sync to the mothership time computer ( PFSense ) , then finally loads HS touch / speaker ( or HS3 ) . <p> 1 - document you configuration ( I do that out of habit ) as I use 16 plus serial ports , 7 USB ports connected ( Digi wise ) to one USB port on the mothership ( a mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to JPG to PDF your web stuff ) . I lost track a bit of the 1-wire devices such that I created a separate spreadsheet for these . Old fashioned a bit while doing this virtually also kept a clipboard next to the Homeseer computer with notes and hand written stuff . 2 - shut down HS3 on old computer 3 - copy entire directory to a USB stick 4 - install HS3 same version as your laptop on to your new computer 5 - copy over your USB stick to same said directory . ( going from 32 bit to 64 bit might be a bit of a pita ) 6 - start up Homeseer ( maybe update it ? ) <p> Baby steps as it is not that time consuming . Once you have a copy of the HS3 directory you are safe from losing your stuff . <p> Some folks for ease of management would just create root Homeseer directory instead of running it in the ( x86 ) directory .

I have been staring at both manuals for the last few hours . Dimmer works fine , accessory - no effect on light . <p> I 'd say there 's a problem . The manual for the master direct from Cooper shows one thing and the manual I linked to for the accessory , also directly from Cooper state the exact opposite of one another . Then if you look at the notes in the accessory manual , it states the opposite of what the drawings show . <p> I know a family member has installed them as 3-way and 4-way installations and think he said they work by association , which is also stated in the manuals . I guess if it is Z-Wave association that makes them work , I do n't understand the traveler wire . Another area of confusion about the traveler wire is that it is used in the accessory manual drawing , but the master switch manual you linked shows no blue wire on the switch or accessory and the the red and black wires between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a blue wire . Just red , white and black . <p> Given that you have power to both and you can control it with the main switch , it sounds like you have it wired correctly . Those Cooper accessory switches communicate using RF , not with a signal on the wire like Leviton ( which is why the Leviton accessory switches are so much cheaper ) . All that those Cooper accessory switches need with the main switch that you have is a hot and a neutral . Therefore to me it sounds like a **25;1784;TOOLONG issue . From the manual : <p> Quote : <p> 4 . The RF Accessory Dimmer communicates via RF signals to control the light from more than one location . 5 . For multi-location control use RF Smart Dimmer Master direct wired to the light along with RF Accessory ( RF9542-Z ) . The RF Accessory does not require direct connection to the light ( use Association function ) . <p> The diagram for your setup just shows a hot and a neutral to each switch . Even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's connected is just a regular hot wire : <p> The master is wired like it is the only switch for the device . It has direct load wire , hot wire , neutral , and ground connections . <p> The remote is wired in its box using the neutral , and ground . Plus a the hot ( if there is one ) . <p> The traveller wire in both boxes is just capped off . The load in the remote box is also capped off . <p> Some remote boxes from an old std . wired 3-way , have no hot wire . In this case use the traveller wire as a hot wire link back to the master box to get a hot connection to the remote box . That is what the diagram is trying to illustrate in showing a traveller wire connection between switches . <p> Add the remote switch ( think of it as a 1 button controller switch ) to your system . Then associate it with the master switch . ( You are going to need to exclude your remote from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electricians do not always follow a standard color scheme in doing old 3-way box wiring .

Otherwise , a lot of trial and error . <p> Of my five wired 3-ways , they were 4 different wiring schemes ( 1999 construction ) . I had to get an electrician to figure one of them out .

Wondering if I can do something similar wth HS3 . <p> I 'll check it again , the documentation is really confusing . It starts with a table of GET requests then shows examples of how to get the status of a device . On my other systems I do POST to change a device . So I scrolled down to the POST section where it says " JSON post requests can be used to control devices .

@@98239378 @2439378/ <p> This thread is going to be a beginning to end construction of a set of events for motion controlled lighting . The goals of these events are : <p> Turning lights on when someone enters the room <p> Keeping the lights on as long as there is motion in the room <p> Turn the lights off at a predetermined length of time after the room is no longer occupied <p> Enable motion controlled lighting only during evening and night hours and disable it when there is adequate ambient light <p> Provide a simple means of disabling motion controlled lighting to : <p> Prevent the lights from automatically coming on when entering the room <p> Prevent the lights from automatically turning off when the room is no longer occupied <p> Provide a simple means of re-enabling motion control <p> These events will provide examples of the usage of : <p> Timers <p> Counters <p> Virtual Devices <p> First we need to create two virtual devices . The first " Motion Control Dusk-Dawn " , is a control to allow the motion control of lighting to be limited to times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . There is a condition of " Nighttime " which is valid from Sunset to Sunrise , but in actual use , there is a period before sunset and after sunrise where there is not enough ambient light to filter in to interior rooms . So we want to enable motion control 30-60 minutes before sunset and keep it enabled 30-60 minutes after sunrise . There are no event conditions that will handle this . Here is a list of all of the time conditions available : <p> What is missing is " The time is after this before sunset " where you could plug in your 30-60 minute dusk " buffer " in the condition . Similarly there is no condition " the time is before this after sunrise " . The absence of these two conditions make a virtual device the easiest way to implement the Dusk-Dawn timing . Once created and controlled , this one virtual device can be used in many events . <p> The second virtual device we need is used to disable motion control for a lighting group . One of these devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single motion detector . In this case the lighting group is in an exercise room , so we 'll name its control " Exercise Motion Control " . <p> Here are the step by step instructions for creating a virtual device . At the top right of the device manager page are a series of icons . As in the Event Management page the " + " symbol indicates adding a new device . <p> You are prompted to name the device . <p> I named the first of mine Interior Motion Dusk-Dawn . <p> Click on Submit and you will have a normal looking single device configuration page where you can give " Floor and " Room " assignments to the device . <p> In my installation I chose to use " Functional Group " and " Room " for my Label 2 and Label 1 respectively . In some of the following screenshots you will see that new label . <p> You can change those labels in HomeSeer Setup under the Custom tab . <p> I assigned a Functional Group " Lighting " and a Room " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions and labels to suit your own organizational requirements . I have made my decisions on how I want to be able to filter devices within the Device Manager as well as how they are represented in the HSTouch Default Projects . You can change the labels at any time and you can reorganize your devices within those labels individually or as groups of devices . <p> Then create the second device which is used to enable or disable motion control on an individual light . That device is created in the same way as the first device . Then you will see your two new devices in your Device Manager , here filtered on Motion Controls . If you notice , your virtual devices look like any other physical device , with ON-OFF controls , status text and status graphics . <p> In many cases the standard Status Graphics of a virtual device can be improved upon to more accurately show their function . A light bulb really does n't  give a good representation of a control device . Here is a screenshot of a production system , filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disable controls on all 6 of my motion controlled lights . You will notice in the screenshot , there are different Device Status graphics as well as a custom device image assigned to each of the virtual devices . This really helps identify the device type and status when looking at the Device Manager web page as well as with the HSTouch default project pictured below . <p> Virtual devices do not have a default device image . The device image is added on the Configuration tab . Use the select Device Image button and you can browse to images to select . The default location for device images is under your HomeSeer root directory then htmlimagesDevices . You can use one you find there or capture your own and store it in a folder under your HomeSeer installation . It would be good practice to create your own directory for any custom device images you use such as htmlimagesCustomDevices . The Device Image used in this example was grabbed through a Google Images search . <p> You can change the status graphics on the corresponding tab . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Disabled " or anything else instead of the standard " On " and " Off " text . The default location for Status Graphics images is under your HomeSeer root directory then htmlimagesHomeSeerstatus . You can use one of the images HomeSeer provides with the installation or you can capture your own and put them in a folder under the HomeSeer installation . Again it would be good practice to create your own directory for any custom status images you use such as **30;1839;TOOLONG . This will segregate your custom images from the default images provided by HomeSeer . The Status Graphics used for these virtual devices were already provided with the HomeSeer installation . <p> Before <p> After replacing the light bulb Status Graphics images with motion graphics that were provided with the HomeSeer installation . <p> The below screenshot shows what the custom Status Image graphics and group organization provides with the default project in HSTouch . <p> The Dusk-Dawn virtual device is controlled by two events . The purpose of the control is to enable motion control of lights before sunset as it begins to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambient light from the windows is enough to negate the need for additional lights . The events below enable that device 1 hour before sunset and disable it 1 hour after sunrise . You can change the timing to what works best for you . Our Motion controlled lights are in the basement and in outbuildings with small windows . I use this device as a condition in all of my Motion Control ON events for lighting . <p> Now well start building events . There will be a number of events to accomplish these actions and we will need one timer , one counter and the two virtual devices created above . The function will follow these rules <p> When you enter the room between dusk and dawn , the lights will come on and stay on until 15 minutes after you leave the room . <p> The motion control can be disabled in two ways <p> Turning the switch ON-OFF-ON within 2 seconds will leave the lights on with motion control suspended <p> Turning the switch ON-OFF will leave the lights off with the motion controls suspended <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motion control is restored when they are turned off <p> Let 's build the Lights ON by Motion Control event . It is a straight forward event if the motion detector in that room goes to " Motion " , the event is triggered . Then we add two conditions , the first checks to see if motion control is enabled for that zone and the second checks to make sure it is within the Dusk-Dawn time constraints created above . Both of those conditions just look at the virtual devices and makes sure they are both ON . <p> The first action is to Remove Delayed Device Actions for this lighting zone . Our off event will be creating a Delayed Device Action to turn the lights off , so this action will remove any of those that might have been created by recent entries and exits into this control zone where manual control of the lights might be used and will assure that the lights are not turned off while the room is occupied . We 'll discuss the Delayed Device action further in the next event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next is another straightforward event to turn the lights off after the room is no longer occupied after a 15 minute delay . You can adjust that delay to suit your needs , 5 minutes is probably adequate , but we like to use 15 . This event is triggered when the zones motion detector changes to No Motion . There is one condition in this event where it looks at the Motion Control virtual device for this zone to make sure it is enabled . Again in this device the first action is to Remove Delayed Device Actions for this lighting zone . This assures us that the 15 minute delay is reset when the motion detector goes to no motion . It is redundant to the same action in the ON event and the ON event should have removed any Delayed Device Actions , but it does n't  hurt to check again . The second action is what creates a new Delayed Device Action to turn the lights off after 15 minutes . When you put a delay on an action in HomeSeer , the event completes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time dictated in the delay . This new Delayed Device Action event is designed to remove itself after running . It is also placed in a dynamically created event group for Delayed Actions . The first action above to Remove Delayed Device Actions will look in that folder and delete any events referencing the referenced device . <p> Now we have two events , one to turn the light on when we enter and another to turn the lights off 15 minutes after we leave the zone . <p> Next we will create the control events that let us enable and disable the motion control . The first event will be to count the on actions of the switch . We will need a timer and a counter for this event . We will call them " Exercise Lights Timer " and " Exercise Lights Counter " . Counters and timers can be created within the event or on a separate page available under Tools &gt; Global Variables , Counters and Timers . It is easier to just create them on the fly as you are building your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be controlled within events . Timers always advance or count up . A timer has 4 controls within an event <p> Set Timer allows you to set a timer to a certain value <p> Restart Timer this will set it to 0 and start it running <p> Stop Timer this will stop it at its current value <p> Resume Timer this will start the timer running without resetting it . It will begin running from the value currently stored in the timer . If the timer is already running , it has no effect . <p> A counter has 6 controls within an event <p> Increment Counter will increase the counters value by 1 <p> Decrement Counter will decrease the counters value by 1 <p> Increment Counter by - allows you to increase the counter by a specific value <p> Decrement Counter by - allows you to decrease the counter by a specific value <p> Reset Counter sets the counter to 0 <p> Set Counter to - allows you to set the counter to a specific value <p> Well use the event to create the timer . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timers . <p> If you click on the button you will be presented with a popup allowing you to choose an existing timer , rename an existing timer or to create a new one . We created a new timer " Exercise Lights Timer " <p> Likewise we create a counter named " Exercise Lights Counter " <p> Finally we have an event that is triggered each time the lights in that zone are turned on . When it is triggered we Resume the timer and increment the counter . This event allows to count the number of times the switch is turned on and makes sure the timer is running . <p> A similar event is used for the light switch being turned off , but a condition is added to make sure motion control is enabled for this zone before it is allowed to resume the timer and increment the counter . It is the same counter as above , we are only counting switch changes , we do n't  care whether it is off or on . <p> Now we build an event to utilize the timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trigger is when the timer reaches 2 seconds . It looks at the counter to make sure it is more than 1 . If the counter is higher than 1 , meaning the switch has changed at least twice within a 2 second period . If it is triggered and the condition is met , it turns Motion Control for this zone off and it removes Delayed Device Actions for the lights . If we have turned the lights ON-OFF-ON within 2 seconds , the Motion Control is disabled and any Delayed Device Actions are removed . The result is that the lights are on and will stay on , regardless of motion or lack thereof . . If we turn the lights ON-OFF within 2 seconds , the Motion Control is disabled , with the lights off . <p> Now we need to reset the timer and counter to get them ready for the next time . Regardless of whether the light is turned off or on or how many times , we want to stop the timer and reset it if it passes 2 seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final event will restore Motion Control of the lights . It is triggered by the lights being turned off . The first condition checks to make sure the timer is not running . The second checks to see if the Motion Control virtual device is off . If both of the conditions are true , we know that the motion control has been disabled and that we are not in a counting cycle on the switch . The event will enable Motion Controls for the lights again if you turn them off as you leave the room . <p> There is the whole gamut of events . A word of caution , we have the timing on these events very tight because we know the latency of our system . If your system is slower because of the server , device control interface or any other reason , you can add 1 or 2 seconds to each of the timer values used in these events . They will still work fine . You need to add the same amount to each of the events that look at the timer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . You are free to copy them and use them exactly as they are or use elements of them to help you solve other problems . Feel free to discuss the events presented and/or offer other ways to accomplish the same goals . At the very least we hope these events will stimulate thought and conversation . <p> I was wondering what you use for the address for a virtual device . I 'm using the Insteon plugin and it wo n't allow a device to be created with a blank address field . <p> The virtual device in HomeSeer does not require an address . I arbitrarily assign an address of control1 , cotrol2 , etc. to the devices . I do n't use the Insteon plug-n , but I can not see it having anything to do with a HomeSeer virtual device as they are not created in the Insteon interface . <p> HomeSeer events and controls use the Device Reference I 'd which are created automatically as devices are created . They are unique and as such addresses and device codes have little value in HomeSeer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a column for device Reference I 'd in the device manager since the Reference I 'd is the bets way to positively identify devices for replacement variables . <p> Excellent write up ! So glad you are doing this . One suggestion though is that many ( myself included ) use x10 rf motion sensors that send both motion and no motion signals . It is a little bit of a different setup with the no-motion being sent by the motion sensor , rather than the time based switch that you have . <p> I only mention this since these x10RF MS are so popular , and following your examples exactly will cause some minor problems if the motion sensor is sending the no-motion signal . <p> Excellent write up !

Z-Wave devices also send Motion and No Motion status . Each time the Lights off by NO Motion event is triggered , it resets the 15 minute timer . The only time that event is triggered is when the motion detector changes and becomes No Motion , just as the ON event is triggered by the device changing and becoming Motion . As I understand it the X-10 devices differ in that they will continually send a set to motion ( not a change to motion ) about once every 15 seconds . If I am understanding that correctly , these events should work fine with X-10 . <p> Now we build an event to utilize the timer and counter to let the system decide what to do . The trigger is when the timer reaches 2 seconds . It looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the counter is higher than 1 , meaning the switch has changed at least twice within a 2 second period . If it is triggered and the condition is met , it turns Motion Control for this zone off and it removes Delayed Device Actions for the lights . If we have turned the lights ON-OFF-ON within 2 seconds , the Motion Control is disabled and any Delayed Device Actions are removed . The result is that the lights are on and will stay on , regardless of motion or lack thereof . . If we turn the lights ON-OFF within 2 seconds , the Motion Control is disabled , with the lights off . <p> With this your disabling manually the whole functionality of the lights ? I thought that the system would know when ligthing was needed .... <p> With this your disabling manually the whole functionality of the lights ? I thought that the system would know when ligthing was needed .... <p> It serves two purposes . If you want to disable the automatic motion controlled lighting lighting for any reason . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluorescent overhead lighting which is great for exercising , folding laundry , etc , but much too harsh and bright when I am at my desk in the corner of that room . When I am at the desk I use more direct and local lighting . Also when I am at my desk I often do n't move enough to trigger the motion detector as I am sitting in a tall backed chair with my back to the detector . If I turn the overhead lights on then off within 2 seconds , Motion will no longer turn them on . <p> If I am doing an activity like sitting at the desk and I want the overhead lights to stay on and I wont be moving enough to trigger motion , turning the light ON-OFF-ON within 2 seconds will disable the automatic OFF function after 15 minutes of no motion . <p> It just gives you more flexibility . I frequently use the ON-OFF in the exercise room so that I can work at the desk sometimes for hours , without the motion controlled lights turning on when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also frequently use the ON-OFF-ON pattern in the workshop and in the shed because I may be working just outside the doors of the buildings and out of range of the motion sensors , but I want the lights to stay on . <p> For 99% of the time we enter a room with the motion triggering the ON function , then manually turn the lights off as we leave . For the remaining 1% of the time we like having the flexibility of overriding automation . <p> Lastly , this was presented as an exercise in providing secondary control functions from primary control devices , using counters , timers and virtual devices . <p> Another use for counters and timers : We use several Aeotec Minimotes around the house . They offer 8 basic controls with 4 buttons . Each responds to a short press or a long press . Using counter and timer logic like was illustrated above each button now has 3 functions , a short press , a double press ( pressing twice within two seconds ) and a long press . Pressing a button once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button again raises the brightness . Pressing twice within 2 seconds lowers the brightness . Pressing and holding turns the light off . In our living room button 1 is my reading light , button 2 is my wife 's reading light , button 3 are the rooms track lights and button 4 is a corner pole lamp . <p> The best automation is that which provides control flexoibility in your household . The thing that will provide a high WAF is consistency of controls , so when I need override logic on one motion control , I provide the same override capabilities on all of them . <p> I do n't have X-10 , but we discussed this in another thread . Z-Wave devices also send Motion and No Motion status . Each time the Lights off by NO Motion event is triggered , it resets the 15 minute timer .

It does seem like this system would work with either type of MS . Though if the MS sends the no-motion is it not better to use that ? There are many ways to create these events , and you have some top notch examples here that really try to anticipate most problems . Most of us that have tried to create " simple " events to turn lights on based on motion quickly realize that there is nothing simple about it . <p> You have one feature that I do not have in my events , the timers to enable/disable motion sensors with mutliple taps . Though , I am making use of group conditions for events that handle lights that get turned on differently at different times of the day . For example during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a group called " lights day on " . I also have " Evening lights on " and " Night lights on " . Lights that turn on in the evening lights group are basically 30 minutes prior to sunset to 10pm and turn lights on to fully light a room . Night lighting is from 10pm to sunrise and turn on night lighting levels for most rooms to preserve sleepiness . <p> I also now have virutalized room occupancy and use that instead of motion/no motion to turn on lights . In this way I can use other connected devices in addition to motion sensors to say that a room is occupied . For example if a light is turned on prior to the motion detector sensing motion the virtual device for that room will be occupied . If the DirecTV is on then that room is considered occupied as well . Though if you do something like this you should only use devices that you do not want homeseer to turn off if you leave the room , or that do not reflect occupancy well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across many versions of HS3 ( currently on the latest beta ) is my system does not seem to reliably execute events for more than a few days .

If you want to take the time to write up how you handle room occupancy and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager audience . <p> As far as slowness in your system , that is one of the toughest things to find . You have to try to narrow it down to a specific interface or possibly one of your plug-ins is adding cumulative processes that slow down the server . Sometimes you have to watch the log in real time , disable plug-ins one at a time and/or disable event triggered scripts that might be consuming resources . In my opinion Windows HomeSeer 3 requires 2gb of ram to run so I think the minimum configuration should be 4gb . It also can consume 100% of the cycles of a single 3+ghz core , so I think the minimum configuration should be a dual core at 3ghz or more . When mine was on an Atom D510 it would get very sluggish from time to time . Now it is on a VM with 4 virtual cores of a 3.2ghz Xeon assigned and 4gb or RAM and it never gets sluggish . <p> I am a big fan of the concept of multiple taps to use any light switch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instant status is a problem .

My motion controlled lights are all on Jasco binary switches , so I chose the ON-OFF-ON pattern . I have n't tried the Cooper single button switches but in one of the other threads someone said they had success with double taps . I think it was about the time of beta .187 release . <p> Hmm , I did try on-off-on as well as double tap . The event 's fine , as I can get it to trigger by controlling the device over the HS interface , but it seems that the status is n't being updated from the switch . <p> I wonder if I need to try a newer switch ? These ones are pretty old by now ... Maybe they 're running code that 's too old . <p> I am using the most recent Zwave beta . <p> I 'd really like to get this working . It offers a load of high WAF possibilities . <p> It may be that your switches are older . Here is the thread where the fix was mentioned . Your question lead me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmer a double tap ( as fast as I was able to do it ) resulted in the light going ON then OFF , so each press changes the state , but there seems to be no way to register a double tap . What is new to me and interesting is that the Jasco switches , which are ON with the top of the paddle and OFF with he bottom , now register a new " Last Change " date and time if ON is pressed with the switch ON . The results are similar with the switch OFF . It also registers the device " had it 's value set to ON " trigger , even if the light is already on . That opens up some new possibilities that were n't there when I designed the above events . <p> Yes , for me it seems more natural to apply a double tap to one end of the paddle than going back and forth . Right when HS3 was being released I tried to implement that , using timers and counters , but gave up due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have re-motivated me to get it working ... Doug <p> Arrgh . I still ca n't see instant , or even quick status with a brand new Jasco/GE switch ... Anyone know what are the items I need to check ? <p> " Associations " , is greyed-out for this device . Is that ok ? <p> I 've got the latest Zwave Beta , Ztroller with latest firmware ... <p> doug <p> The GE/Jasco switches have worked fine for me for a while except for 3-way slaves . If you control a Jasco switch from the slave the status only updates by polling . Is this a slave ? I can post a screenshot of the node information from one of mine when I get back home . 
@@98239379 @2439379/ <p> We added a new device linking feature in HS3 recently . Here 's a little video on how it works with dimming devices .

Both are on Zigbee . I have events that turn the lamps on and off in the morning ( 5:30 am to 30 minutes past sunrise ) and then events that run in the evening . Since Zigbee does not dim , it is just on and off . No sweat . Lamp 01 and Lamp 02 are linked using the new Linked Device in HS3 . <p> Scenario : <p> The other day , one of the lamps got set to 46% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On " but HS device said 46% . Somehow this became the default ( what I am trying to figure out ) . So when my next event turned them on , they went to 46% and when the off event ran , it did not work as it looks to see if one of the lamps has a value of " On " . Since it was at 46% it had a value of " Dim " so the event did not work . <p> Today , I went in and tried to change lamp 1 to On , but lamp 2 set it back to 46% ( because they are linked ) . It took several tries to get it to go to 100% or On . <p> So the question is , where does the system hold the default value ? I do not see a field for default value . <p> I know my fix will be to remove the check to see if the lamp is " On " , but would be nice to have this run correctly , so if you set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the last value .

@@98239381 @2439381/ <p> After digging through many different message board postings , release notes , and spending an afternoon experimenting , here are some notes that may help others set up 2GIG CT30 Z-wave thermostat(s) in Homeseer . <p> Background:My goal is to remotely control a minimum of 4 ( and as many as 12 ) thermostats in a mountain home that is primarily used for ski weekends . During the week , we generally set the thermostats around 55 to 62F depending on the room ( rooms with plumbing set to 62 ) ; this is done to reduce heating costs but avoid risk of water pipe freeze . The house is heated with hot water floor heat , so it takes a few hours to raise the temperature to a comfortable level once the thermostat set points are raised . Each room in the home has its own thermostat , and all are wired with only 2 wires and it is not practical to run new wires to most thermostats . Since there is no C-wire , the 2GIG CT30 thermostat seemed to meet my needs and I ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe what I did to get two of these thermostats to work in my Homeseer system . <p> Below are the steps I took:Step 1 : Bring Homeseer to latest version . <p> 1 . Do a complete backup of the Homeseer directory.2 . Run the Homeseer Advanced Function using " **30;1871;TOOLONG Network " 3 . Run Updater in Homeseer . Found that a new version ( 2.5.0.1 ) was available so installed it.4 . Do a complete backup of the Homeseer directory5 . Run experiments and everything seems to be working as it was before . <p> Step 2 : Add the 2GIG thermostat , upgrade WDUSB-10 FW <p> 1 . Followed the thermostat instructions to install the Zwave radio module and then the batteries . At this point , I did not connect the thermostat to my house thermostat wires , but that does n't  matter since I am not using any C-wire to power the thermostat . This allowed me to physically have the thermostat next to my homeseer system for easier debug . <p> 2 . The thermostat runs in two modes : program mode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used without a zwave radio and allows the thermostat to operate like a typical programmable thermostat ( various hours of the day and days of the week setting ) . The mode required for zwave operation is " simple mode " and this is the mode I want when operating with ZWave . I will write some Homeseer events to manage my thermostats remotely . To set the 2GIG thermostat in " Simple mode " ( pg 6 of operation manual ) , press and hold the Program button for 12 seconds . There is then a new rectangular icon displayed on the right of the touch screen that says something like " controlled remotely " . If the thermostat sees the Zwave network , the word " LINK " is displayed beneath the radio tower icon . <p> 3 . Now add the thermostat to the zwave network . Using the Homeseer " **27;1903;TOOLONG Node " button , Homeseer should then display a message that says to " activate the add to network function on the node while it is close to your Homeseer interface .. " . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pg 6 of operations manual ) displayed on the thermostat touch screen , press the " menu " button on the thermostat . On the touch screen , look beneath the radio tower icon/LINK , and you will see another soft button displayed ( I do n't  recall what word it uses , but something like MATE ) . This soft button should begin to flash . Bring the thermostat within couple of feet to the Zwave interface ( in my case a Wayne Dalton WDUSB10 zwave USB stick ) and watch for the lights to rapidly flash on the WDUSB10 . If the lights do n't  flash , then press the soft LINK/MATE button on the touch screen again . I had to do this a couple of times before Homeseer recognized the thermostat . <p> 4 . Check to see how Homeseer displays the thermostat . The thermostat is shown under the Homeseer status display as a Temperature device and as a Thermostat device . <p> 5 . Now get the " ZWave Thermostat Status " button to display . To do this , I shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this button displayed along with any other add-ins that I have ( like NetCam and PowerTrigger ) . <p> 6 . Test the thermostat . Using the " ZWave Thermostat Status " add-in button , I am able to control : Heat setpoint , Fan mode , Fan State , Mode ( heat , cool , off ) , and display the mode state . During this testing I discovered that I was unable to change the heat setpoint if the thermostat had went to sleep after a couple of minutes of sitting idle ( sleep is when the little radio wave signal is no longer displayed by the antenna on the touch display ) . I could wake it up manually by pressing the program/menu buttons , and then the commands worked . The easiest thing to test was changing the heat setpoint and watching the touch screen to display a new setpoint temperature . <p> 7 . Understand why the thermostat would n't wake up . After reading the documentation , the thermostat REQUIRES A ZWAVE INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS BEAMING . Beaming is a very low power mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone has commands waiting for it . It requires an accurate clock so only new Zwave devices will likely support it and new FW from Zensys ZDK 5.02 . Since I had the thermostat next to my ZWave system interface ( a Wayne Dalton WDUSB-10 USB stick ) , I was able to rule out any relay devices that I have in my network . So searching the Homeseer website , I finally found the a table that stated this device should support " Beaming " . ( See this link : LONG ... In this table , it describes " Beaming " in the context of " Schalge compatible " . So now I went looking for a firmware upgrade for my WDUSB-10. guessed that my Wayne Dalton WDUSB zwave interface device should support . <p> 9 . Trying the various FW downloads . First I used the ( a ) as it was recommended for most users . It failed to wake up a sleeping thermostat so then I tried ( b ) . This version successfully woke up a sleeping thermostat and I thought that everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I did this I got an error for every active node in my network : <p> 10 . Debug the ZWave network optimization error related to " add return route was not attempted " . I tried everything from restarting homeseer , rebooting the computer , power cycling the computer , removing and ( re- ) adding the thermostat node in the network , reinstalling the WDUSB-10 FW , and so on . Nothing worked . Finally I stumbled across some notes on the Homeseer message board LONG ... ) : <p> If you are experiencing problems with Z-Wave and you upgraded the firmware in your HomeSeer Z-Wave controller to version 5.02 from a previous 4. x version of the Zensys library , you MUST do a restore of your network to the controller . It is OK to do the backup and restore after the upgrade , so long as the controller is ERASED and then the restore is processed so that the data is rewritten to the controller . After the restore , it will be necessary to optimize your network . <p> 11 . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ( " **30;1932;TOOLONG Network " ) I now did the following : <p> 12 . Verify network optimization works . I now used the " **32;1964;TOOLONG Network " button to run a network optimization and all of the previous messages about " Add Return Route was not attempted " disappeared and the optimization succeeded . I moved my ZWave thermostat to approximate locations in my home where it would be installed and did four more optimizations ( the apparent minimum number to get complicated network topologies optimized ) . <p> 13 . Installed a second thermostat using the steps 1-6 shown above . Everything went smoothly and I now have two operational thermostats . I will test these for several several weeks and if they look good will likely add 4-5 more thermostats . As I install more thermostats farther away from the Homeseer System interface ( WDUSB-10 ) I expect I will need to add some new relay devices that support Beaming . From what I read on various websites , it is probably the newer GE devices that will support beaming although more research is needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing some events and was able to change setpoints of both thermostats from a manual Homeseer event/script . My hope is to change all my thermostats ' heating set points with a single button push on my Android phone . <p> Here are some vitals of my system : <p> 1 . Using an old Dell laptop running Windows XP and on a UPS system . This system has run solidly for 9 months between reboots . <p> 2 . Versions before this exercise : <p> a . Homeseer 2.4. x.x ( I do n't  recall the exact version but I usually upgrade with the latest official versions ) b . Wayne Dalton WDUSB-10 ( firmware version : 2.3x --2.36 or 2.38 . I did n't  write it down ) <p> I hope this helps others also trying to install this thermostat . So far this thermostat looks like it will do everything I had hoped it would . Sorry for such a long post , but this message board has saved me significant time so hopefully this " pays it forward " for others . I may also put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if needed . <p> I have two of them and I like them , unfortunately I need to change the battery every 15 days . <p> The only problem that I have is that the 2GIG shows the " Mode State " as Heating but the boiler zone is actually off . They have been mentioned it in different posts but no resolution yet . <p> If you " mate " the unit to your Z-Wave network while it 's being powered externally , it will function as a routing node on your network and deplete the batteries very quickly . I 'm guessing that 's what is going on in your case . <p> Suggestion : delete these units from your network and then " mate " them again while under battery power only . That should fix things . 2GIG says that battery life is typically 10-12 months . Also , if you 're polling the units frequently , that will also drain the batteries pretty quickly . <p> I have a Z-Troller about 10 feet from the T-stat with no walls between . When I rescan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest firmware on the Z-Troller , do I need a different beaming device ? <p> Delete the ZStat using the same " mate " procedure and then re-add it . This time , bring the ZStat close to your HomeSeer system and use the " add node " function in the software , instead of the " add " button on the Z-Troller . That should do the trick . Then , reinstall it where it belongs and do an optimize on your network . <p> To control the unit , you 'll need to access the Z-Wave thermostat plug-in control page ( see below ) . <p> I was able to delete the T-stat and re-add it , this time it listed it as a listening device and the polling option appeared . I also connected a C wire to power it instead of batteries so I wonder if that helped ? <p> This version of HS is too old to work with this stat .

Try moving to the latest release version of HS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version is available here:https : **28;1998;TOOLONG <p> Are these stats supposed to send a signal to homeseer when the setpoint is tripped or changed on the thermostat itself ?

Will I be able to connect HStouch android app to the server on my home network simply by entereing the URL and port in Android , and configuring the router and windows firewall appropriately ? <p> I 'm trying to figure out the necessity and function of a MyHS account . If Homeseer is truly self-contained , I 'm not sure why MyHS does . <p> Do note that myhs also provides a level of security by encrypting traffic both between your HS instance and the myhs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think HS3 natively does SSL/TLS encryption . That said when you make your HS3 instance accessible to the public Internet your authentication is not encrypted and there is a chance that this could be accessible clear text . <p> There are some plugins that do require connectivity to your system via myhs . <p> There was a vulnerability in HS3 versions less than 3.0.0.313 ( or 312 I do n't remember ) . Where in users could bypass authentication and control your system . This would pose a threat to installs where the HS3 management interface was allowed public access . <p> Lastly , a brute force attack is the first method used to gain unauthorized access to systems . <p> ( HS3 can do this ) The easiest mitigation methods against this would be to , block public IP addresses after 5 bad password attempts , ( HS3 can do this ) <p> force strong password policies , and lockout user accounts after 5 bad password attempts in say 10 minutes . HS3 does not have any of this functionality built in . <p> Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my internal websites/network services . I want to minimize my open ports and port forwarding to as few as absolutely necessary . My mantra is , does this really need to be accessible to the public Internet , and if so , how do I lock it down . Currently , I am down to 2 ports open on my firewall . I am currently using a reverse proxy ( HAproxy package on pfsense ) and remote access via VPN ( openvpn package for PFsense ) only . <p> HAproxy acts as a front end and manages access for all the sites I make accessible to the public Internet . It is a hell of a tool . I have it setup to SSL encrypt all the websites I want accessible to the public Internet . Later I will also configure it to only grant access to client endpoints that have the appropriate client certificate . <p> The VPN is then used when I need remote access to something on my local LAN but do not want it to be accessible to the public Internet . <p> Interesting info , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app directly to my home network and open the port ( which port ? noob here ) the traffic would not be encrypted ? <p> I am not sure that HStouch gives that much control . I think it forces access through myhs . You can choose any port you want . Generally port 80 is non-encrypted and port 443 is reserved for encrypted traffic . Here I forward port 443 to my HAProxy then determine which sub site based on the subdomain HTTPS request . <p> Yes , without something that handles SSL encryption it would not be encrypted . <p> What about external SSL web access ? Do I need to create a server.pfx certificate in order for the browser to trust HS3 web page accessed from outside my network ? I can access it currently on port 80 , but enabling SSL access in HS3 network settings and forwarding the port through the router did n't work , browser complained about an insecure connection . <p> Personally here have always utilized my no ip dynamic DNS provider . In general the more I added to my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports on the firewall . <p> Note this was for more than HSTouch . Rather than keep playing with the firewall I went to using VPN . <p> In the middle 2000 's I had a few Windows servers and traveled out of country sometimes for a few days and sometimes for a week or two . <p> I would get bored sometimes at night and would play with my Homeseer servers ( had two then and today ) such that I would just utilize SSH ( Putty ) and port forward via an encrypted SSH tunnel . ( note this was in the EU , UK , South America and the pacific rim ) This provided me with RDP access to my windows servers , web access to any browsers et al . <p> Today have helped a few Homeseer users via SSH and tunnels within SSH and it works fine . ( and works fine without configuring a VPN server ) . <p> Basically you just open up one encrypted SSH tunnel ( open one port ) on the firewall and use it for whatever services/ports you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my Wintel HSTouch tabletop tablets , configured it with VPN access and left it on the nightstand in the Hotel we were staying at and it worked just fine 24/7 for some 3-4 days . <p> So in a recap you can utilize myhs dot com ( opening ports ) , your own dynamic DNS service ( opening ports ) , SSH tunneling ( free ) , HAProxy ( as mentioned by Kerat ) , Teamviewer and or VPN ( free ) . BTW your Windows 10 desktop has many cloud dependencies built in these days ; that is the way it is . <p> So in a recap you can utilize myhs dot com ( opening ports ) , your own dynamic DNS service ( opening ports ) , SSH tunneling ( free ) , HAProxy ( as mentioned by Kerat ) , Teamviewer and or VPN ( free ) .

I am actually somewhat familiar with my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server , VPN , Emby server and other home network functions . Opening a port in the router is not a big deal . <p> VPN has it 's strengths , but sometimes it seems like overkill when you just want to do something quick from an Android phone . And it is an addition of an extra " layer " , which usually works . But simpler is sometimes more reliable , so cutting out VPN or myhs could be a reasonable thing to do for simplification . <p> I can connect to HS3touch server using myhs , but I can not connect directly using my external URL . Port 10200 TCP + UDP has been forwarded to the windows 10 PC in the router , and HS3Touch server applied the firewall rules when I enabled it . <p> Also , my Yale YRD240 lock , although displayed in HS3Touch Android app , does not respond to lock/unlock commands . It works fine when I connect using the web interface to HS3 , whether connecting internally or externally , using HTTP on port 80 . <p> In your HSTouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the connections for remote direct access . You need to know the static IP address or a dynamic DNS address . Enter the port that you will be using which has previously been forwarded in the router .

I tried leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is supposed to be the default anyway . It wo n't direct connect . <p> I hesitate to mention this since I assume it is something unique to my setup , but it did work for me . <p> I could never get 10200 to forward to 10200 in my router . The router configured it just fine but it would not work . FWIW , it is a tplink router and exede internet . I ended up configuring it to accept incoming connections on port 8090 and forwarding them to port 10200 . That worked . I 've not taken the time to try and understand why . I 've wondered if excede has some limitation . <p> This makes me wonder if I could create another third level domain CNAME that points to my house , source another SSL cert from Let 's encrypt , and setup HAProxy to trigger handling by SNI HTTPS request to the new subdomain to deliver the new SSL and reverse proxy to my HS3 server on port 10200 on my internal server . This would allow me to not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove my last dependency for myhs. 
@@98239397 @2439397/ <p> Used to have my CM11A working nicely on an HS2 setup , then that machine crashed . Staring over with HS3 , and just getting it set up . Found the message in the subject 19 times in a row last night after an event ran that ran a speak and a couple of light actions at sundown . Speak worked , but the lights did not change . They work fine , with no messages , when switching them with the toggle on the home screen . What to do ? <p> Can you post a screen shot from one of your X-10 devices that you have created . Go into device management and click on one of the X-10 devices so that we can see the details of it , including the tabs at the top . <p> Here you go . I included both the config and advanced tabs . I got that same warning last night when the same sundown event triggered . Only two copies this time rather than 19 . Also the device actions work . So far it only happens with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . <p> Also I looked at the x10.ini in the config folder . It only contains items for debug and override . I set debug to " True " but it did n't seem to put any additional info in the log ( maybe it writes it somewhere else ) . I do n't know what override is supposed to do . <p> Sorry , I misread your original posting so misunderstood the problem you were having . I asked for the screenshots as a lot of new HS3 users do n't add info on the x-10 tab when creating a new X-10 device , so I thought you might have done that too . <p> I believe that error message is related to the serial communication between HS3 and the CM11 . Have you confirmed the connections and the serial port configuration ? Does it always work manually and never through the event ? If the latter , maybe delete the event and recreate it . Do you have any other x-10 devices that this happens with as well ? If the event is changing multiple devices at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending the commands to each device . <p> I have found this is actually worse . if an x10 command is received not via air such as via BLRF but via the powerline on my CM11a interface then the command is applied to all the units in the same house code . I have serveral motion sensors on say house code N , when one sends an ON status and its received via another x10 interface all the units in that same house code go on . I was able to confirm this several times , it does not happen with RF commands received via by BLRF interface . I even tried a different com port and a different CM11 interface , I even tried removing all the units and re-creating them . any ideas ? <p> I am using a CM11 on HS3 and I have not seen that problem . I do occasionally see a status change that appears to be spurious , but those are isolated incidents , and definitely do not affect all devices on the same house code . <p> It 's very strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you have an X10 signal analyzer or an independent way to monitor X10 PLC traffic ? <p> doing some more testing I found there were data fragments on the powerline. using my smarthome monitor I saw partial message likely sent by my plug in interface , removed it and the house code issue is gone . for now . <p> I still have the possible no response message coming up from time to time , I also have disable and enable the interface once in a while as it locks up , considering I am trying two different ones , an active home cm11a and an x10 pro cm11a and I have tried different com ports ( hard wired , not usb ) . I can only assume the plugin is unstable somehow . I did notice when this message comes up there is a delay so if the system is also sending a zwave command , its delayed . weird . <p> I still have an issue . in the middle of the night a few times I find all x10 lights on . when I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I left my testerlinc kit from smarthome on and find the issue to be a command fragment missing the actual command . it seems that there is some noise being carried over from a neighbor or something . <p> I took an old manual x10 controller and duplicated it , if I hit the on button without first clicking on the house code it sends a fragment of a command , in homeseer all the lights in the same house code go on . I confirmed there are no other interfaces on in the system so the issue is the plugin , I even disabled blrf for the wireless to be sure . any ideas ? <p> In the X10 protocol , it is perfectly legal to send only commands without an address , as you are doing using your ' old manual controller ' .

The more likely candidates are powerline noise , CM11a issues or the HS3 X10 plugin . <p> A few questions : 1 ) Are the lights that turn on in the middle of the night the last set of units commanded by HS earlier in the evening ? <p> 2 ) Are just X10 light modules turning on or are all X10 units on a housecode , including appliance modules , turning on ? <p> 3 ) How many different X10 house codes are you using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noise on the powerline ? <p> 5 ) Do you have a X10 phase coupler installed in your system ? <p> Best regards , -Mark- <p> If you 're not out on the edge , you 're taking up too much room !

@@98239398 @2439398/ <p> Following the lead of at least a couple of others I 'm in the process of migrating my ZWave network from my ZStick to a new ZWave+ UZB1 . Why ? 1 . It 's always annoyed me that the ZStick ca n't be restored from a backup , so if it fails your in a serious mess . Whilst the UZB1 supports backup and restore HS3 does n't appear to be able to restore to the UZB1 at the moment , so this may still be an issue . 2 . The UZB1 is ZWave Plus so supports all the new features and enhancements despite only costing 25 ish . No problem with keeping a spare handy at that price . 3 . I 'm a fool and have a habit of messing with what is working fine , breaking it and then spending hours/days recovering . Fear : I will wind up having to resetup my network from scratch and then have to reconfigure all my events and HSTouch screens ! <p> As it 's not possible to restore a backup of the ZStick network to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed instructions that Rick Tinkler posted some time ago to migrate a network as follows : <p> Quote : <p> With the two controllers not too far away from one another , the process is this : Send Network Information from the old controller to the new controller - do NOT transfer primary . Make sure it worked - the new controller should be able to control any of the nodes in your network . If it worked , then repeat the process , but this time use the TRANSFER PRIMARY option to make the new controller the primary . If the new controller is a handheld controller , then remove the old interface from HS3 , configure the new interface , restart the plug-in , and then repeat the process above using RECEIVE NETWORK INFORMATION on the HS3 controller to receive it from the handheld controller . If the new controller is your new HS3 controller , then just remove the old controller from HS3 , plug in the new controller and configure it in the plug-in , then restart the plug-in . <p> Regardless of how you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , so now you have to do a Rescan on all the nodes so that the associations and wake-up destinations get re-added or reset to the new controller node . With a new controller , there are no routes set up , so you may have to optimize a few nodes here and there before communication to all of the nodes is in decent enough shape that you can then use Z-Health to take care of the rest later . I would also do the rescans individually rather than on the whole network , as that way you can better track the individual status of what worked and what did not , and you can rescan your important/key nodes to get them working first . It also let 's you know exactly when to wake-up the sleeping nodes ( just before you start the rescan ! ) <p> Before I started I took a full copy of the HS3 folder and also printed PDFs of all my events . I did this for each group by using the expand all icon and then printing that group to PDF . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was well aware though that if the process messed up my ZStick and it wound up as a secondary with no primary a backup of HS3 is not going to help ! <p> I used a laptop with a trial HS3 to host the UZB1 to receive the network from my HS3 PC ( intel NUC ) . Ran the test send , without transferring primary , and it through some errors about the new node 60 ( this is the UBZ1 ) . However , all the nodes were copied across to the UBZ1 and it became a secondary controller . I swapped it with the ZStick , after installing drivers , and I was able to control devices on and off . It was n't receiving any info from sensors but that was expected . <p> I then bit the bullet and repeated the process only this time with the Make it Primary option . No errors this time . The ZStick changed to secondary but the UZB1 still showed as secondary . Heartbeat started to increase dangerously at this point . However , after shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UZB1 changed to ' Real Primary , Other Network ' . <p> All devices I have tested are controllable but I have now started the process of re-scanning and optimizing each device so it communicates through the UBZ1 ( node 60 ) to Homeseer rather than the now disconnected and removed ZStick ( node 1 ) . This should n't affect events and HSTouch although I 've noticed in HS3 that with some devices re-scans can tend to create some duplicate child devices so it 's not going to be painless . For example the Aeotec multisensor always creates a new luminance child when you rescan it . I 'm also having some issues with Associations as HS3 seems to keep setting associations and routes to the old node 1 as well as the new UZB1 node 60 . I also get the <p> PopupZwaveAssociate error ( 2 ) , Object reference not set to an instance of an object <p> every time associations are read or set . I'vehad this for sometime now and raised a bug on bugzilla sometime ago but have received no response . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes : Unless you intend to use your old stick as a secondary controller you can remove it from the network then re-optimize <p> More of a bellyflop really . The problem has been associations . In my experience HS3 has had problems with associations from day 1 and it 's still not completely resolved . In early betas I had to keep reverting to HS2 to set group 3 associations because they would n't set with HS3 . Later betas seemed to cure the problem but there are still issues . Basically most of my devices still have associations to node 1 , my old Z-stick , even though it is now removed and the node deleted . I ca n't seem to get these to go and in the case of group 3 I ca n't remove them or overwrite them with a new association to node 60 , the UZB1 . I 've rescanned devices many times with or without deleting the node but ca n't get rid of the node 1 associations . Perhaps I should have left node 1 in as a secondary until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has varying effects . When you do a full optimize on the root it mostly sets up routes to node 1 and node 60 . When you audit the device it shows the node 1 as invalid . The display for setting associations does n't necessarily show the same associations as the audit . This is obviously wrong . I get ' PopupZwaveAssociate error ( 2 ) ' errors every time I read or try to set associations . For most of the devices it does n't seem to matter they work anyway . However some devices do n't report any info when there is an invalid node in the list of associations . In particular my Fibaro Universal Sensors of which I have 3 , each with 4 temperature sensors , stopped reporting . In the end I found that the only way I could get rid of associations to the old node 1 was to exclude and re-include the device . Not something I 'd wanted to do , for obvious reasons , but at least it showed how well network wide inclusion works with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ StellaZ is working either . I will probably have to remove and re-include this as some point . Interestingly my temperamental Aeon multisensor in the garage is still reporting after a few hours . It 's early days but perhaps routing is working better . Steve <p> Not sure how many nodes you have and what make / model etc . I have a mix of Fibaro and Aeon devices which are all 4.5x or later . <p> Funny you should mention the association thing because earlier today I had some strange behaviour in that department with an Aeon smart energy switch G2 which I put down to a faulty module even though it is brand new . <p> I 've never had an issue removing associations even when the associated node is no longer present and I 've never seen the PopupZwaveAssociate error you mention , however with this problem Aeon device , HS3 just would n't retrieve or set the association info . <p> I have a few more of these Aeon modules and they do n't exhibit this issue so I decided to investigate further . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the controller and the problem unit was n't . I brought the problem node closer to the controller and hey-presto association info was working again . <p> I 've not had time to investigate this further to establish if it 's a HS issue or there is a problem with this particular device if it 's not in direct contact with the controller . I doubt it 's a Homeseer issue because I have plenty of other ( Non-Aeon ) devices that are not in direct contact with the controller and they work fine . <p> I 've just had a look through a few of my devices and association info appears to be in sync between audit and association config . I 'm not 100% sure but I think the audit gets the info from the database not directly from the device . <p> I have 2 of the Fibaro universal sensors , both with 3 temp sensors attached and they are working fine . For these devices I have all 3 groups associated with HS but for others like FGD/FGS-211 etc I only have group 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A typical example is our bathroom . The main lights are controlled by an FGD-211 dimmer with momentary switches connected to S1 and S2 . The extractor fan is controlled by relay 2 of an FGS-221 without any local control due to the location of the fan unit . <p> On the FGS I only have G3 associated with HS and on the FGD I have G3 associated to HS and G2 associated to Endpoint 2 of the FGS . This all works fine and fan status is correctly shown in HS . <p> Paul , I have 30 nodes a lot of which are Fibaro and Aeon but also others . Not all 4.5 . <p> The association problem I am having seems to be unique to my system so I feel something has got corrupted along the way . Over the last year as I moved from HS2 to HS3 I have been steadily adding devices so they have been imported in various versions of the ZWave beta . I did n't notice when the PopupZwaveAssociate error started but it is now ingrained in my system . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it must be some corruption . It was n't causing me any problems because most associations had been set up when I included each device and the odd one I wanted to change was successful despite the error message . It has only become a real problem due to me migrating from the ZStick ( node 1 ) to rhe UBZ1 ( node 60 ) . There are lots of associations stuck on node 1 and I ca n't change them . Out of interest I installed a clean HS3 on another computer with my ZStick ( now as a secondary ) and imported the nodes . It succeeded in importing all the nodes from the current network and it stayed as node 1 . However , this system exhibited the same issue with the PopupZwaveAssociate error and even though node 1 no longer showed up as invalid in associations I was n't able to delete or change the node 1 entries . The only way I can successfully remove the associations to node 1 is to exclude and re-include the device . Associations are then set by HS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still get the PopupZwaveAssociate error . I had a good working system before changing sticks and I went into it in the full knowledge that I would probably break things . It 's almost fun Most of the system is working ok now that I have excluded and re-included the problem devices . However , all my fibaro switches have group 3 set to the invalid node 1 . Groups 1 and 2 are set to node 60 end points 1 and 2 respectively . I 'm not sure yet whether this is a problem as it 's difficult to test the local control on most of then . Certainly remote control works fine . I have tested the one v2.1 2x1.5 switch I have that is wired up for local control of both relays . This had been working fine for despite others having problems with this version . I tested only the other week after following a thread on the forum . However , the local control is now not working on input 1 , presumably due to group 3 not being set properly . I 'm probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I will be away from home for a week and do n't want to mess things up before I leave . It 's not a bad idea to take a step back at this point and let the dust settle . <p> The new beta 3.0.0.208 has a very interesting new feature showing the last successful route and also the ability to force a route . It 's a shame I did n't have this a week ago as it would have been interesting to compare the routes before and after migrating sticks .

@@98239399 @2439399/ <p> As far as I know there is no ' repeater ' for the Philips Hue , other then the lights themselves . I did some testing here in the past and as long you have the lights closer then approximate 7 meters ( 21 feet ? ) from each other , inside the house they will communicate with each other . I guess that reachability of lights outside the house will be better , but never tested it from here . <p> So if you want lights at 50 meters from a bridge , you would need to add more or less 7 lights in between to extend the signal . This is most probably not what you wanted ? <p> Another possible solution might be adding another bridge near to the other lights . The plugin can handle and combine multiple bridges fine . The only challenge then is that you need to be able to access this bridge from the same network as where the plugin is residing , either with a wifi end , or a standard network line . I do not know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate your feedback . I had hoped that a zigbee repeater could be added .... I had hoped someone here had cracked this repeater story ... I find the users of Homeseer are above average types that can do almost anything ... <p> **28;2104;TOOLONG <p> I spent some time searching the IOT ..... my goal was to simply add a repeater ( w/o lan connection ) outside the house that would be linked to the Philips Bridge . To my dismay Hue requires Zigbee ZLL ( light Link ) repeaters which do not yet exist ... you can find Zigbee HA ( home automation ) repeaters which are not Hue compatable . <p> ====For those who wish to read further ======== <p> According to Hue the lamps : These use the Zigbee Light Link ( ZLL ) standard . <p> Lights This is the output of the system . These smart bulbs contain 3 types of LED specially chosen to produce a range of colors and intensities . Lights create a mesh network with each other which enables each light to pass on messages to the next extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bridge via an open standards protocol called ZigBee Light Link . If you 'd like to start a project which talks directly to the bulbs that 's possible but you 'll need to enroll in the ZigBee developers program for more info see www.zigbee.org . <p> It appears that Samsung has a Zigbee Hub for ZLL lights while they specifically show it can control Hue devices and connect with the Hue Hub . SmartThings Philips Hue integration requires use of the Philips Hue Ethernet Bridge . <p> The problem as I read it you are controlling the lights thru the Samsung Zigbee device and Home seer does n't have a Zigbee or Samsung SmartThing plug-in . <p> At the Cost of Samsung $96 vs Hue Bridge $69 both require network Lan connection on same lan . **45;2134;TOOLONG <p> We can only hope a repeater is developed ..... I wo n't hold my breath so I guess I will have to figure out how to get a bridge outside my house mounted in a weather proof box and connected to the same Lan as the existing Hue Bridge .... 
@@98239400 @2439400/ <p> I recently purchased a Cooper 5 scene controller ( " Cooper RFWC5DW Decorator Z-Wave 5-Scene Controller " ) , installed it by my front door along with an Enerwave ZWN-RSM2SMART DUAL RELAY SWITCH MODULE and added both to my network . The idea was to replace two standard switches with one scene controller , using the first two scene buttons as toggle buttons for the two lights previously controlled by the switches , leaving 3 scene buttons for other uses . <p> Both the scene controller and the Enerwave module appeared to add ok . I could control the lights manually via the HS3 web interface , so I went about configuring two scenes . First I went to Plugins -&gt; ZWAVE -&gt; Scene Management , and created a simple scene for each of the lights I wanted to control . For example : <p> Then I went to View -&gt; Device Management and clicked on Scene Controller Button 1 to edit it . I changed the device name to " Front Door Overhead Lights " and then clicked on the Z-Wave tab , then the yellow arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene Name I chose the Front Door Overhead Lights scene I created earlier and clicked Save and Test Scene . The web interface responded with Programming of the saved Z-Wave scene ( Front Door Overhead Lights ) was successful . <p> However , when I press scene button 1 , nothing happens other than the scene button light turns on . I press it again and the scene button light turns off . In the HS3 logs I see : <p> The actual overhead lights I intended to control never change state . Any idea what 's going on here ? <p> Also , if I try to set the button one scene setting to Manually Configure Scene Here I can not add any non-scene capable devices to the scene . I *thought* that the Cooper scene controllers could still send commands to non-scene capable devices and assumed that one of these two methods would work , but it seems that neither does . <p> Interestingly , I had also attempted manual scene configuration using different scene numbers on each button , thinking it might be some sort of conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at one point I had : <p> Perhaps when I press button 1 , it actually sends a " scene 24 ON " command , but HS3 , since it currently thinks that button one is scene 5 , records it in the logs as scene 5 being activated ? Thus , since scene 24 does n't have device 15 in it , the lights do n't turn on , even though the HS logs appear to show the appropriate scene being activated ? ? ? <p> Then again , I just tried scene button 3 . At first when I pressed it nothing showed up in the logs , nor did anything happen other than the button 3 light turning on at the controller . Pressing button 3 again toggled the controller indicator light back off again but yielded nothing in HS3 logs . Then I realized I had no devices ( including HS3 ) in the scene 22 manual configuration , so I added it . Again , programming is ' successful ' , but when I ' audit this node ' , button 3 shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controller thinks it is programmed for scene 23 . <p> When I press the scene 1 button on the controller , its local indicator light turns on , followed by the rest of the lights on the controller spastically flashing in different patterns for about 10 seconds , until it settles into indicators 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 being on with indicator 2 being off . The HS3 web interface shows all 5 scenes as being on . Still no actual change in the overhead light I want to activate . What in the heck ? ? ? <p> OK , so I removed ( excluded ) the Cooper Scene controller from the network , reset it to factory defaults per the instructions from the manufacturer ( hold buttons 1 , 3 , and 5 for 5 seconds , release , press all off ) , and re-included it : <p> Went to Plug-Ins , Zwave , Scene management . Tried each of Save changes , save &amp; Deploy Scene , and Save &amp; Test Deployed Scene , performing " audit nodes " between each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , on the " save &amp; test deployed scene " , the overhead light itself turned on . I turned it back on and tried pressing scene button 1 ( no result other than the light turning on ) and pressing it again to turn the indicator back off . Tried also using the HS3 web interface on the " scene 1 " HS3 device with no change in the light 's actual status . Controlled the light 's device in HS3 web interface and the light responded appropriately . Tried the scene controller again and nothing . Here are the logs : <p> I started with Homeseer a few years ago and this Cooper switch was about the 5th Zwave switch I installed . Like you I wasted a lot of time and I could never get it to work properly . <p> I got so frustrated with this switch that I pulled out all of my other Zwave switches and installed about 30 UPB devices along with the UPBSPUD plugin and everything runs error free . You do n't see many postings on the UPB threads because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homeseer or if Homeseer goes down the scenes still work great . <p> I do have Zwave thermostats , wall plugs and now installing Zwave locks with a new Zstick plus . I am hopeful things have improved . <p> I know the switch is a lot of money but I have mine sitting in a box , I 'm sure smarter guys than me have it working fine . <p> I ca n't even get this to work right with HS3 Events . To be clear , I really want this to work as an actual scene controller , i.e. to have the cooper controller directly request the enerwave module turn on and off , so that no matter what happens to HS3 , I ( and more importantly , my wife ) need to know that we can press a button and a light comes on , press again and the light goes off , regardless of the status of our network , the homeseer process , etc . HomeSeer in my view adds the " automation " part which we can easily live without . ( turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I go to bed , etc. ) but should not be required for minimum basic functionality in the house . To get this I may need to either ( as suggested ) consider non-zwave tech , or stick with devices that have local load control for normal loads and supplement with other types of devices ( scene controllers , touch interfaces , etc ) . But really , this should work . The Cooper is supposed to be able to have " scenes " with " non scene capable " devices in them with the obvious caveat that they ca n't do " scene " things like set the fade rate to x seconds . <p> Anyway back to my attempted HS3 event workaround . I created 4 events per button in hopes of mimicking what I believe the scene controller should be able to do . <p> My thinking is that if the scene controller button is set to either on or off , whether that be by the homeseer web/touch interfaces or the physical controller buttons , HS3 events will check to see if the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct state or not , and if not , make it so . The second pair of events is intended to do the reverse -- if the lights are turned on or off either via local control or via HS3 , make sure the indicator lights on the scene controller match the light status . <p> This sort of works . I can press button 1 . Its indicator light and light 1 turn on . Press button 1 again and indicator light 1 and light 1 turn off . Yay ! Same goes for button 2 . The problems arise when more than one button is on at once . Here 's a recent example : I turned both lights on by pressing each controller button once . Their indicator lights turned on and so did the relays ( and thus the lights ) in the enerwave . Then I pressed button 2 to turn off light 2 . Its indicator light turned off , and BOTH lights turned off , leaving indicator light 1 on , while homeseer indicates button 1 is off . Whaaat ? Press button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logs for that second press of button 2 that turned off both devices : <p> As you can see Homeseer believes it has received both button 2 off ( which I did press ) and button 1 off ( which I did not press ) . Thus it turns off both devices in HS3 and my event to turn off indicator 1 never fires because it believes it is already off . <p> Is there a way to turn up the logging level so that instead of the " friendly " log display , I see the actual zwave command received , non-translated ? I suspect there 's something going on related to the fact that HS3 does n't seem to be able to program the actual scenes into the controller , but have no way to prove that . <p> In the z-wave settings for each button , I had created an empty scene . I created one for each button : empty1 , empty2 , etc and then saved them . It took me about 15 attempts , my button 3 was especially problematic . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the buttons to respond to homeseer events , both scene on and scene off . <p> I had shared this with HS support , I 'm not sure of how much help it will be . I added/removed the scene controller 5 times , went through each button and noticed the following : <p> I must have gone through the settings on button 3 about 15 times . I created a scene name , empty3 , but it was always associated with scene number 1 ( current ) -- I 'm not sure what that piece of information meant . But as I looked at the information of each button , 3 stood out as it had scene number 1 set and not a larger number : <p> Anyway , I had created a new scene , empty3 and it still had the same association with scene number 1 though the audit on the node showed everything was ok . I rescanned the node , optimized it and then created yet another scene and saved the changes . This time , the scene number changed to 2 and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button along with an audit <p> Thanks for your addition macrho . I have n't found any bugzillas specifically for this but I think it 's probably time to open one . <p> I decided to create 5 new dummy scenes . I call them " Front Door Button 1 " through " Front Door Button 5 " , and assigned them to scenes 11-15 , respectively . Thus an audit of the controller should return " configuration from the controller " matching button 1 to scene 11 , button 2 to scene 12 , etc : <p> Note that I 'm leaving the buttons in the order returned from the audit report . <p> I tried saving button 5 to a new scene repeatedly and re-auditing between attempts to apparently no effect . Eventually I went through and assigned each button to the matching scene name ( through the button 's zwave tab , settings area ) in order ( button 1 through button 5 ) and then repeated that -- resaving button 1 to the front door button 1 scene - scene 11 , then button 2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did an audit and got the following " configuration from the controller " mappings : <p> I think you may have attached the wrong image ? But here is my root ( after clicking update in the associations area ) <p> I 've been messing with going to different buttons and assigning different groups to monitor what they do . I feel like I 'm playing with a Rubix cube and have n't figured out the pattern of moves yet needed to get that last square right I got as close as : <p> I just did some more testing and identified at least a partial pattern -- when you run an audit of the device it returns the buttons in the order : 4 , 2 , 5 , 3 , 1 . If you change the scene assigned to button 4 in HS3 and press save , then audit , both buttons 4 and 2 are assigned whatever scene number you set on button 4 . For every other button , it sets only the next button in line 's scene number on the device . I.e. if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button 5 . Save and change button 5 and it modifies button 3 . Save and change button 3 and it modifies button 1 . Save and modify button 1 ... nothing happens . ( Though I did have in my notes that once , it edited button 4 ... I do n't know whether that was bad note taking or if it actually happened and I just ca n't get it to repeat that now . Okay , actually now that I 'm looking at my notes for the 100th time , I 'm seeing a couple of cases where I noted changing one button 's settings and it changing two other devices to different values . So , I guess I still have no idea ! ) <p> I still ca n't get the scene controller to return any associations with my devices . <p> Thought this line in particular was interesting : " Manufacturer information does NOT match any certified or known products .

@@98239405 @2439405/ <p> Hi . I am setting up my HS server in Ubuntu and I am looking into how to automate startup and shutdown of homeseer . <p> Startup : <p> Startup is taking a REALLY long time It goes well until this command : 1/24/2014 10:37:47 AM : Startup-&gt;Starting DDNS service ... and then it stops for about 2 min before this messages shows up : wapiconnect : error looking up socket handle 0xe Then another 2 minute delay and this message appears 1/24/2014 10:41:47 AM : Startup-&gt;Running the startup script Startup.vb After that everything is fast again Any hints what might cause this ? It is behind a very restrictive firewall that may not let it access the internet on non-standard ports ? Would that cause it ? Is there a way to disable the DDNS service since I do n't need it ? <p> Shutdown : <p> The only way I can see to shut it down safely is : 1 ) run the . /go script using screen so I can connect to it later and issue the shutdown command 2 ) use the web interface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something or are there other ways to shut HS down once it has been started ? I have a good Ubuntu script to automate reconnecting to screen and issuing the shutdown command . If that is the best way , I will get it running and post it later . <p> The slow startup is caused by HS not being able to communicate to port 8245 at checkip-lax.dyndns.com . As soon as I allowed my HS server access to outgoing communication on that port , the startup was very fast . <p> It would be nice to be able to disable that service if you do n't need it so systems with limited or no internet access do n't pay the 4 minute startup penalty <p> The spelling out shutdown part is because for whatever reason , homeseer wont take the characters that fast . The sleeps make it work . You can use screen -r -S HomeSeer from another ssh shell to see it happen . Note the D is created by hitting Ctrl-V then Enter in vi in insert mode . It is not just a and D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gets added to auto startup by issuing the command sudo update-rc.d homeseer defaults After that Homeseer will start and stop automatically when the server starts and stops <p> I kept it as root because in the linux installation instructions LONG ... Rich says you need to be root for the webserver to function . Is it working correctly as a non-root user ? Can we get any clarification on the requirement to run as root ? <p> By the way , thanks for the for loop thing ... my bash scripting skills are lacking <p> If you change the webserver port to 8080 ( gWebSvrPort setting in settings.ini or use the setup gui when started as root ) the homeseer webserver will run as non-root user . ( you may choose a value from 1024 or higher ) <p> Great info guys . Have you had problems with mono crashing ? I 've had it crash a couple of times now and I 've thought about writing a standalone watchdog to ensure mono is running by restarting if the mono pid is not found . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac OS/X , but a novice when it comes to Linux . Up until yesterday , I had a windows PC for the sole purpose of running HS3 Pro . I finally took the plunge and installed Ubuntu on that workstation and I actually have HS3 up and running with a couple of devices added to my AEON usb stick . <p> Now I want to make sure that HS3 runs when my machine starts up . I am assuming that the scripts in MSG #3 or MSG #5 would be installed under /etc/inet.d/homeseer . As I am relatively new to Linux , I have what may be silly questions : <p> For MSG #3 , can I assume that my homeseer directory be copied to " /homeseer " ? For MSG #5 , can I assume that my homeseer directory be copied to " /usr/local/Homeseer " ? <p> Can I also assume that if I really wanted to , I can just change the DIR variable to the location where my files are located now ? <p> One of the hardest things for me to grasp is the chmod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other directories , what CHMOD statement would I use . <p> trying to get HS3 to start automatically after booting my Fit-PC2i running Ubuntu 14 , ca n't get the script from post #3 working . I must say I 'm a novice at Linux , do n't know under what name I have to save the script from post #3 and in which folder . Maybe it 's because of the path where Homeseer is placed by me : /home/emk/HomeSeer em is my homedir , I can start Homeseer by using the following commands right after login ( as by default ) : cd HomeSeersu root &lt;shows password prompt , have to type in password&gt;. /go <p> Homeseer starts up as expected . What do I need to change in the script to get this working , what name do I have to use for the script file and where do I save it ? Do I need to change the path where Homeseer is " installed " ? Thanks ! <p> Thanks for the contribution . I was able to implement your script with a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . During startup , HomeSeer starts up but the screen is not found using : sudo screen -r -S HomeSeer . <p> If I restart the service it works fine .

During startup , HomeSeer starts up but the screen is not found using : sudo screen -r -S HomeSeer . <p> If I restart the service it works fine . Seems like it may be some timing issue at startup . <p> Are there any suggestions as to what to change to resolve this ? <p> Thanks , <p> Kirby <p> Kirby , I do n't know if you got this resolved ( I thought I saw some post the fix ) but this should work on the Raspberry Pi , Ubuntu and Debian : <p> sudo apt-get install screen <p> On other versions of Linux the package manager will differ so a different command will be needed . 
@@98239406 @2439406/ <p> I was using the old Homeseer HAI plug-in but have moved to HS3 . Just wanted to confirm that the new HAI plug-in works with Amazon Echo voice commands before I end up repurchasing the plug-in . Basically I want to be able to control my Z-Wave devices ( lights , locks , thermostats , ... ) connected to my HAI Omni by voice . <p> Yes , I do understand that your plug-in does not directly interface with an Echo , your plug-in provides connectivity between Homeseer and HAI Omni . I was looking for assurance that a device that is connected to the HAI system , is visible to Homeseer with the HAI plug-in , is controllable with an Echo . I do not want to trigger an event , I just want to say to Echo " Tell Homeseer to turn living room light on " and it will turn on the living room light controlled by the HAI box 's Z-Wave . <p> My main issue is that the echo almost always hears " tell homeseer " as " tell home seer " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but HS promises a new version soon that works better ..... the holdup is that amazon is slow to respond . <p> In any case , I 'm sure it will all eventually work . For now , though , I am able to run buttons by going from the echo to IFTTT to HS3 and through the HAI plugin to the OP2 . <p> As an example I have a button in OP2 called " floods " that toggles my outside flood lights on or off . That button appears in the HS3 . I built a recipe in IFTTT that says if I say to the echo " trigger floods " it sends that to the HS3 and my floods turn on or off . It 's kludgy , but until the plug-in is further advanced I ca n't issue commands directly to individual units , and until the HS3 echo skill is fixed I ca n't go directly from echo to HS3 . <p> Thanks for the preview .

Reason : New Information <p> Unlike the Z-Troller , the Z-Stick being USB requires that HomeSeer be shut down prior to the stick being removed , and then restarted after the stick is re-inserted . <p> The error is because HomeSeer is trying to communicate with the Z-Stick on the same USB object that it was communicating with it previously on , but removing and re-inserting the stick requires that the communication object be re-created . <p> It sounds like you did not set the COM port perhaps ? Understand that the USB interface that Aeon Labs uses is not your typical USB interface ... It actually creates a serial port on the computer that you have to find ( e.g. which COM port number is it ) and then enter in the COM port box where you configured the interface . If you did configure the COM port , then when you enabled the interface , see what displays in the log . When you enable it ( or at the startup of HomeSeer ) it initializes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been written into the log . <p> Is the Z-Stick a secondary controller or a primary controller for your network ? <p> Actually , I 'm not using Aeon Labs Z-Wave , but the ControlThink ThinkStick . I piled on to this thread because I was seeing the same behavior listed in the first post . <p> In the Interfaces tab , it shows the controller and shows the home I 'd with the right number of nodes . Because of this , I 'm assuming it 's communicating with the USB ThinkStick at least of some level . Also , I can see the nodes enumerated when I click the " Node Info " button . <p> Not sure then - firmware in the ThinkStick might be an issue . When the Z-Wave interface starts , the log will also list some version information . What is the version information that shows there ? <p> Reloading HomeSeer wo n't do a thing - HomeSeer does not have " drivers " . The code to read from two types of USB interfaces and a serial port is built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times it is loaded . However , the USB device driver for the ThinkStick is like any other driver install - sometimes you have to reboot the computer to get it to work , sometimes you have to install a different version of the driver , or sometimes you have the wrong OS for the driver version that you have . <p> I know that if the ThinkStick is using the standard Zensys serial API that it should work , and I am fairly certain that we have other users using it , so I suspect there is a driver issue at play here . However , if in recent updates to the firmware Leviton made some changes , then all bets are off . It has been a long time since we tested that device and it was working fine when we last tested it . <p> Actually I was looking at the Zensys library - it has 4.30 in it , which was released October 5th of 2007 , so it is quite old , but we have users with our Z-Troller still using library 4.27 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log entries you provided , it said it found 8 nodes . The Import function loads that node information , then it tries to talk to the 8 nodes ( or however many NEW nodes there are ) to find out specific information about them . Since it can not talk to them , then there is something wrong with the way the interface is responding ( that works for all of the other interfaces we support ) or it is legitimately out of range of the nodes . Are you by chance dramatically changing the location of the USB controller between the time you used it with mControl and HomeSeer ? You did n't happen to surround it with a steel or Kryptonite shield did you ? <p> Two ways to proceed - 1 . Try something else and then 2 . Capture some debug logs to see what the interface is responding with . <p> For 1 ( try something ) we can do this : Import gets the node info and then does the scan process . At startup , HomeSeer got the node info because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import , click the Rescan Devices button just to see if it being called separately produces any different results . <p> If it does n't , then for 2 ( debug logs ) , either write a quick script if you know how to issue the hs.DebugMode=64 command , or do this instead : Go to the control panel - if you do not have a navigation button showing for it , then point your browser to : http : // ( homeseername ) port ) /ctrl At the bottom of the page there is an area for entering an immediate script command . Type this in the box : &amp;hs.DebugMode=64 And then execute that command . The log should have a line saying that the current debug mode is set to Z-Wave . Use Rescan Devices or Import to reproduce the error , then repeat the DebugMode procedure except this time set it to 0 ( &amp;hs.DebugMode=0 ) to turn it off . Then , go to your root folder where you installed HomeSeer and you should now have a Debug Logs directory . Zip up the files that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My email address should be in my profile or you can send me a message and I will respond so you have it . ) <p> I wish you had almost any other interface as Rich said that one in particular has some problems , but we 'll see if we ca n't get it going with a few more kicks in the pants . <p> Afraid I have an almost identical problem .

@@98239418 @2439418/ <p> Edit - Current version is attached to message #241 of this thread ( page 13 ) <p> If anybody is interested I 've written a Health Plugin to monitor Z-Wave battery powered devices and report when they lose contact . It 'll be free as it 's primarily written for my own use , but if anyone thinks it might be useful then reply here and I will post the plugin . <p> I find battery reporting pretty hit and miss for Z-Wave devices and the level at which they die is inconsistent . Up until now I had been using a log monitor plugin to check for wakeup calls but this required 2 events and a timer setting up for each device , with each configured for the particular wakeup period of that device . The purpose of the Health plugin is to automate the process and only require 1 event in total for all notifications whilst adapting automatically to any additions or changes to devices . <p> When it first runs , the plugin creates a Parent device for monitoring . The plugin then monitors wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device wakes up a child device is created and added to the group . The sleep period is set by subsequent wakeups of the device and from then on the plugin can watch for missed wakeups . There is no user intervention required although there are various parameters that can be tweaked . <p> Any failed wakeups are reported to the parent device so all devices found can be monitored by a single event triggered by the Parent device . The Parent Device string shows the device that has failed so this can be reported in say an email or pushover message . I 've replaced 11 timers and 22 events by a single event in my system . <p> The attached screen shot shows part of my group with a failed device shown . <p> *UPDATE* 11/03/17 More advanced beta version added at message #192 of this thread <p> *UPDATE* 13/02/17 Latest version ( 3.0.2.8 ) Bug Fix - Error message in log when more than one wakeup message within refresh interval . <p> *UPDATE* 12/02/17 Latest version ( 3.0.2.7 ) attached to this message . Now can handle devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be polled but send a Heartbeat . I say ' such as ZSmokes ' but so far these are the only devices I have come across that send a Heartbeat so it may or may not work with similar devices . Thanks to TechFan for testing and feedback on this feature . <p> Release notes for 3.0.2.7 ( since 3.0.2.1 ) -Minor and major bug swatting. -Heartbeat monitoring added . Plugin now supports three methods of monitoring that a ZWave battery device is alive or dead&gt; a ) Monitoring wakeup messages - Automatic b ) Polling of battery devices that do n't send wakeups - Devices need to be selected from a list of Available Devices c ) Monitoring Heartbeats - Automatic ( if option set to True ) -Location and/or Location2 can optionally be included in the displayed name of monitored devices to make them easier to identify , depending on your naming convention . -The Location and/or Location2 defaults can be set to blank in which case when a monitoring child is created it will adopt the locations of the device it is monitoring rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child devices so that ones that have already been created can be relocated . -The displayed information in the Health Root device can be configured by control buttons to Status Only , Short Report or Full Report . Anything other than Status Only may not fit in the web page display but work well when included in an email , notification message or HSTouch textbox . I have updated the instructions in this message below . I am now working on a more fully featured version of the plug-in which should add battery level , discharge rate and life monitoring as well as adding the ability to override settings for individual monitoring devices where required . <p> *UPDATE* 13/01/17 Update - Latest version ( 3.0.2.1 ) now attached to this message , handles multiple networks and can monitor listening ( non sleeping ) battery devices by simulating wake-ups. *UPDATE* 02/01/17 Multiple network version coming soon . *UPDATE* 31/12/16 NOTE the current version only works with single networks . It wo n't work with multiple networks with duplicate node numbers at the moment . *UPDATED* 30/12/16 OK . Ive attached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This should be treated as a beta so backup your full HS3 installation before installing it . There should n't be any damage it can do but its always wise to be safe. ** <p> Installation only requires HSPISDJHealth.exe putting in the root folder of your HS3 installation . You should then be able to enable the plugin from the Plug-Ins&gt;Manage page . No other files are required . It will create an INI file in the Config folder but there is also a Config page in the plugin for tweaking parameters . To update , disable the plugin then replace the HSPISDJHealth.exe file with the new version and re-enable the plugin . <p> IMPORTANT It is also necessary to have Log Poll and Wake-up Messages checked in **27;2336;TOOLONG Network and Options . I have n't found anyway of detecting Z-Wave wakeups other than by monitoring the log . <p> Shortly after enabling , the plugin will create a parent device called Health Root . This is the device to use as a trigger for any notification events you want to create . <p> For ZWave battery powered devices that normally sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reported child devices are created , grouped with the Health Root parent . Initially the status of the device will show as Waiting . The second time a device wakes the sleep period will be set and the status will change to Ok . Over time a full set of child devices will be created corresponding to all Z-Wave devices in your system that report wake-ups . If you add devices to your system the plugin will pick them up the first time they wake . If you remove a device from your system the corresponding child will be removed on a restart of the plugin or you can delete the child manually . <p> The sleep period is updated on every wakeup , so if you change the sleep settings for a device the plugin will adapt . <p> At regular intervals the plugin checks the status of all the child devices and if any have missed a wakeup , by more than a set amount , the status of the child will change to Wakeup Missed ! The status of the parent Health Root will also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status string . The information that is displayed in the Root Device can be changed by the control buttons on the root device : Status Only - This just gives the number of devices monitored and how many are in each state . Short Report - Global Status plus a report on each device that is showing an alert . Full Report - Global Status plus a report on each monitored device . <p> To report , trigger an event on the Health Root device using This device has a value set to .. Missed Wakeup . If you include the replacement variable $$DTR : ### : ( change ### to the Ref of your Health Root device ) the full text string of the root device , formatted as Status Only , Short Report or Full Report can be included in an email or pushover notification . You can also display this information in an HSTouch scrolling textbox . Remember that you can swap between the different formats of report from event actions as well as manually . <p> The plugin can also monitor battery devices that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't therefore send wake-up notifications . These devices have to be manually selected but the plugin will then poll them at regular intervals and log a simulated wake-up notification if they are alive . They will then be monitored the same way as ' Non Listening ' devices . <p> The plugin can also monitor battery devices that do n't send wakeups , are n't pollable but send Heartbeats , e.g. ZSmokes . Note this has only been tested on ZSmokes . You need to set MonitorHeartbeats to True to start this . The plugin will monitor device changes and if it detects an ' Alarm Heartbeat ' it will create a monitoring child device . Device Callback are such that HS3 only notifies the plugin if a devices value changes , not if it is set to the same value . The ZSmokes do n't reset the ' Alarm Heartbeat ' value and therefore the plugin creates a new Status Pair ( 11.355 , Heartbeat Acknowledged ) as long as there is not already a status pair set for this value . Each time the plugin detects an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acknowledged ' so that it will get a callback when the ZSmoke sends the next ' Alarm heartbeat ' . <p> Parameters that can be set from the Config page of the plugin : <p> RefreshInterval ( default 120 seconds , i.e. 2 minutes ) The interval in seconds that the plugin runs a check on the status of all the monitored devices . The plugin does n't  have much overhead but there is little point in setting this very short . <p> MissedWakeFactor - ( default 0 ) If you want to allow 1 or more missed wakeups set this to 1 or more . <p> OverRun ( default 60 minutes ) The time in minutes beyond a scheduled wakeup before a Missed Wakeup is triggered . If MissedWakeFactor&gt;0 then the actual time allowed before a ' Missed Wakeup ' is triggered is ( The Last Sleep Period ) x ( MissedWakeupFactor+1 ) + Overrun . <p> NameDeviceBy - Use the name of the ' Root ' or ' Battery ' child device when reporting on and naming monitoring devices . <p> Location and Location2 defaults used when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these values if you want the monitoring child to adopt the Location and or Location2 of the devices it is monitoring . <p> There are buttons to Rebuild and Rename any child monitoring devices that have already been created . <p> IncludeLocInNames - Ticking this will include the Location of the monitored device in the **26;2365;TOOLONG - Ticking this will include the Location2 of the monitored device in the reports . <p> ShowDeviceAddress - Controls whether the device Technology Address is shown in addition to the name in the reports . Depending on your particular naming convention and use of floors , rooms , etc it may or may not be helpful to display the address as well . Originally this was On but now that you can incorporate Location and or Location2 in the name it is n't usually necessary . <p> MinWakePeriod ( default 10 secs ) It maybe a bug in HS3 but I sometimes get multiple wakeups reported in the log for a device , usually all on the same second . This ignores them otherwise the plugin will think the device has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH CAUTIONForceBackToRoot ( default False ) I find that for some devices the root loses its Parent status which is changed to Standalone on reboots of HS3 ( or restarts of the ZWave plugin ) . This may be an HS3 bug or a device firmware issue . I used to notice it on my StellaZ radiator valves but I have noticed it on one or two other devices as well . Normally the only effect is that the parent does n't  show grouped with its children in the Device Management page . This plugin monitors root devices even if they have incorrectly had their status set to ' Standalone ' so there is no need to use this parameter . However , if you set ForceBackToRoot to true then once a device is being monitored the Plugin will change its relationship status to ParentRoot even if HS3 reboots and changes it back to Standalone . The benefit is that the Parent and Child devices will show correctly grouped in the ' Device Management ' window . HOWEVER , I do n't know whether there are any other implications with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Devices Require Polling - This section is used if you need/want to monitor battery devices that are always listening and do n't therefore raise wake-up notifications . An example is my Everspring Siren and many locks . Click on the ' Select Devices ' button and a selector widget opens with a list of devices on the left which can be added . This list is made up of all root devices which have a battery child that claims to be pollable . ' Non Listening ' devices should n't appear in the list as they should report as non-pollable . You definitely do n't want to add a ' Non Listening ' device to be polled by the plug-in . There are many devices that can be battery powered or usb powered and these will be in the list even if they are running from usb power . You do n't want to add these to ' selected devices ' , although you can if you like and they will be monitored . I ca n't determine whether they are running on batteries or not so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Selected Items ' list that you want to monitor by polling , then press the ' Submit ' button . The devices should then show in a list next to the ' Select Devices ' button . This is all a bit clunky and I 've struggled with some issues with the HS jQuery controls but it works of a fashion . One day I will revisit this and clean it all up . <p> PollingInterval - This is affectively the simulated wake-up period . From my experience polling with Z-Wave takes a couple of seconds , if a device is awake , or up to 10 seconds if the device is dead . I do n't know what the impact is on the system but it 's best to keep polling fairly infrequent . If you have selected several devices their polling will be spread out over the polling interval so they are n't all polled at the same time . For example if the PolingInterval is 60 minutes and you have 4 devices selected each will be staggered by 15 minutes . <p> When a device is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar way to a wakeup . <p> NOTE A child monitoring device will not be created until the first successful poll so if you select 1 device and a PollingInterval of 60 minutes it will be 60 minutes before the device is polled and a monitoring child created . Be patient . <p> MonitorHeartbeats - If you tick this then the plugin will register with HS3 for callbacks on device value changes . Firstly it checks through all ZWave devices for any that have a status of " Alarm Heartbeat " . For any that are found the value is changed so that when the device sets a new ' Alarm Heartbeat ' a devicevalue change is called . The Plugin then watches for devicevalue changes to ' Alarm Heartbeat ' and these are processed in a similar way to a wakeup . A child monitoring device will not be created until after the first Heartbeat is received . On ZSmokes the value for Alarm heartbeat ' is 11.255 . After detecting as heartbeat the plugin sets the displayed value to 11.355 so it can detect the next Heartbeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't intefear with any events you may have set up for your device which alert you when a real alarm event has ended . As long as there is no existing status pair for 11.355 then the plugin will set one up with a status of ' Heartbeat Acknowledged ' . <p> My system is windows 10 based but I briefly tested the plugin on linux and it appears to run with no problems .

Thanks ! <p> You can already do this , except hat the day of the week portion can not be the first condition .

HSTouch Desigenr is the software that allows you to make custom screens for HSTouch . <p> MyHomeSeer is a service offered with every HS3 installation . It uses a HomeSeer Technologies cloud server so no port forwarding or anything like that is necessary . You do n't need to use MYHS though . You can forward ports and tell HSTouch to connect to your HS3 server directly . You 'd probably need a dynamic DNS service or a static IP address . This latter scenario is what folks were describing earlier in this thread . <p> Yeah , myHS is basically a dynamic DNS service . Every so often , your HS3 software will tell myHS 's servers what your IP address is . And then when you start HS3Touch on your phone , it 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But , if you have a static IP , or use another dynamic DNS service ( such as through your router ) , myHS is not needed . You can set up HSTouch/HS3Touch to connect to your IP address directly . <p> 10200 is the port that HSTouch/HS3Touch uses ( I 'm not sure if that 's reconfigurable ) . 80 is the default port for the web interface of HS3 , but that is configurable . I recommend changing it in HS3 , or opening up a different port at your router and having it forward to port 80 on HS3 , since port 80 is so well known ( " security through obsecurity " ) . <p> There also may be a port for speaker clients , but I 've never used any , so I ca n't help there . <p> Basically , then , at least two ports have to be forwarded : 10200 for the mobile applications ( Android , IOS , etc. ) , and whatever port you 're using for the web interface -- although the latter , if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , is optional . <p> If you have a dynamic IP , and if you have anything else on your network that has to be accessed remotely ( network cameras , etc . ) , I 'd recommend foregoing myHS . Further , myHS seems to go down every so often , whereas the services offered by dyn.com and others never do . This assumes that your router has the ability to do DDNS , but most modern routers do I think .

@@98239432 @2439432/ <p> I 'm new to this plugin but I have some experience with Arduino , the application I would like to realise is a specific one for my house 's lighting . I would like to use Arduino as a more flexible ( and much cheaper ) alternative to those Z-Wave light switches . That means using an existing light switch or button as an input to Arduno to turn on/off the lights ( using a relay board ) and at the same time allowing home automation control to that . Basically like one of those existing Z-Wave module with input for an external switch , but with the possibilities of an Arduino ( for example 8 or more light controllable with one unit ) . <p> What I need is this device to work even if the HS server is not reachable . That would imply implementing the logic of the input/output control into the Arduino 's sketch instead of using HS Events . <p> What 's the best way to realize this ? I 've seen there 's an API mode in the plugin , is this the way to follow ? 
@@98239433 @2439433/ <p> After fooling around a while during the trial period , I was able to determine that this plug-in , running in API mode , is exactly what I needed . I was so wrapped up adding I2C sensors and building I2C bus extenders , I lost track of when I first added the plug-in . So now , unsurprisingly , it wo n't start because , as per HomeSeer log , there 's no license . <p> In fact , the plug-in is gone from the list of installed plug-ins . I was wondering how , once HomeSeer finally sends me the licensing info ( bought June 10 ) , am I going to enter the licensing info . I tried re-installing the plug-in ( HomeSeer reports version 0.0.0.0 is already installed ) but it fails . Any guidance ? <p> Thanks for your response . I just now received the licensing info ( after I replied to the order confirmation ) . I 'm running HomeSeer on Windows Server 2K12R2 and I could not delete the Arduino executable ( lacking permissions or whatever ) . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , lo and behold , the Arduino plug-in ( v1.0.0.131 ) was back . I was able to successfully enter my licensing info . <p> Btw , does the plug-in 's beta version require updates to the Arduino sketch ? I ask because I 've heavily modified the sketch ( removed serial connectivity ) to fit in more of my own code and I 'd be reluctant to have to do it again . <p> Yes you need to change the sketch if upgrading to the .142 beta but you should not need to remove any code from them . Can I ask why you removed the code as if the board is set to be IP then the serial code is not loaded to the boards anyway . Also what custom code did you use and would it help others ? When updating the API it should be a copy and paste exercise . <p> I removed code to simplify what I see while working with the Arduino IDE . Since I 'll never operate the plug-in using a serial connection between an Arduino and HomeSeer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . I do use serial to monitor Arduino activity , echoing data sent to and from HomeSeer over IP to the Arduino IDE serial monitor . While most of the sketch contains conditionally compiled code , depending on whether an IP or serial connection is being used , I found its presence in the sketch distracting . <p> As things stand now , I 'm using 68% program space and 66% dynamic memory on an Arduino Uno and I 'm barely half done . Much of the memory is filled by specific device libraries for the particular I2C sensors I 'm using or plan to use . I still have to add code and variables for inputs from HomeSeer , add some averaging routines for some of the sensors and , if space permits , some logic so as to simplify or eliminate future HomeSeer event processing that may be required .

@@98239440 @2439440/ <p> How to Create a Weather Page- Note : this is in the HSTouch Designer Help File HSTouch is designed to import RSS data from a variety of sources including headline news , sports scores , stock quotes , weather and much more . In this ' how-to ' , we 'll build a simple weather page that will display the current temperature and 5-day forcast . <p> The following procedure shows you how to create a weather screen using the default URL provided by HSTouch . The default weather source is **26;2737;TOOLONG . You can use other services such as weatherbug or weather underground . <p> IMPORTANT : For this feed to work , you must obtain a weather API key from **26;2765;TOOLONG . The key is free . After you get your key you need to enter it in the HomeSeer HSTouch settings . Go to **33;2793;TOOLONG then click on the Config button for the HSTouch Server plugin . <p> The steps below are for your information , luckily we have already created this screen for you as a template . To use the template select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then select the " Custom " tab . From there you can drag the Weather5DayRSS to your screen and have the complete forecast screen done . <p> If you would like to learn how to create your own weather screen , follow the steps below <p> Step 1 - Create a new project or add a new screen to an existing project . <p> Step 4 - Select the text element by clicking on it and change the following properties in the Properties Pane . <p> ColorNormal - Set this to transparent ( as shown below ) . <p> FontColorNormal - Set this to white . <p> FontNormal - Set this 16 pt , Arial Black . <p> The text element should now look like this : <p> Step 5 - With the text element still selected , move back to the Properties Pane and open the settings for the ' StatusTrackingNormal ' property ( as shown below ) : <p> Step 6 - At this point , the Control Associations window will open ( as shown below ) . Since the text element is for display only , check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , open the Normal Association Type menu and choose RSS Data . Then select the radio button for ' Use Status Text ' at the right and click the ' Edit ' button . <p> Step 7 - The next window to appear is the RSS Data Browser ( shown below ) . Select ' Weather Forecast ' from the ' Common RSS Feeds ' . Note that the feed uses Longitude and Latitude variables to note your location . These variables are automatically replaced with the Latitude and Longitude that are set in HomeSeer . If the weather information looks incorrect , check the Location setting in HomeSeer Setup . Now , click the ' Get Data ' button and use the arrow buttons near the right of the window to advance the table named " weather " . The table name is display toward the bottom right of the screen . This will display the current 5 day forecast . Each row in this table is a different day . We want to display the day for the first day of the forecast . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as 2012-02-25 . You can simply select that and it will be displayed as the current day , or we can modify that value with some script and get the current day name , such as " Sat " . For now we will leave it as is , select the first date in the first row as shown . <p> At this point , the design area will once again appear and the text element will now display the first column day as shown below . Note that it is displaying the current date and the text is too large . You can change the text size to fit , or change this date to a day . We will change it to display the day . <p> To change the display to a day we need to run a script . The script is a single command that takes the date and extracts the current day . The script command we will be using is the VBScript command : <p> WeekDayName <p> To use this script command we need to pass it the current date as seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use some variable substitution get the RSS data . See the Replacement Variables section for details on these commands . The entire command we construct will need to placed in the text elelment " Text " property . Looking at the RSS data in the properties pane we see the following information that denotes this particular piece of RSS data ( first day of forecast date ) : <p> We can now take this information and create a replacement variable that we insert into the elements Text property . Here are the parts we will be using : <p> The following is an RSS replacement variable that simply accesses the one piece of information from the RSS feed that we need . In this case , the following line simply returns the date as " 2010-02-25 " LONG ... <p> If we assigned the above line to the elements Text property , we only get the date ( as we do now ) . To get the day , we need to pass this date to our WeekDayName function . The total like looks like this : <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a script and the script is named $WeekDayName . The " &amp; " in front of the script command tells HomeSeer that is a single command and not a script file . <p> Now we assign that entire line to the Elements Text property like so : <p> Before the new day will show up , we need to remove the RSS association from the StatusTrackingNormal property , set the tracking to None . The RSS overrides the Element 's Text property . <p> Now the Text element looks like this and displays just the day : <p> Step 8 - Now , repeat this procedure for all the other columns and all of the other data fields ( and graphics fields ) for the weather screen . Your finished screen should look something like this :

@@98239443 @2439443/ <p> I 'm still pretty new to HA and HS . I 've just installed my first set of Insteon Switchlincs and a 6 button Keypadlinc . I 've got the Keypadlinc ( A dual band #2487S ) installed at the top of the basement stairs and successfully configured such that the " On " button and the " Off " button turn on/off all the basement lights . Switchlincs for the different basement light circuits are a mix of dual band and non dual band dimming switches . ( #2476DAL &amp; 2477DAL ) <p> I 'm struggling to get the individual A , B , C , D buttons programmed . I want them to allow me to control the individual lighting circuits that I 've installed Switchlincs to control . According to the product manual , linking the buttons seems to be the same process as linking any other switch . . . hold the " A " button down for 10 seconds , hear the " beep " , now you have 4 minutes to go link a switch to it . Set the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the " A " button is pushed and hold the " On " side of the Switchlinc paddle ' til it beeps and viola , it should now be linked . To verify , go press the " A " button a few times to see the corresponding light circuit turns on and off , right ? <p> This is where my problem is . The linking steps all seem to go normally but then the " A " button does n't do anything . Wo n't turn the lights on or off . <p> I 've tried making the association through HS using the Insteon plug-in as well ( Mark 's latest 1.7.2.5 ) . I was successful in using the plug-in to create the " All on/All off " scenario but when I tried to then program button " A " to control one particular circuit , individually , it removed that circuit from the overall " On/Off " group I had created and still did n't add the functionality to button " A " . <p> I started to set up an event in HS to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading up on this to try to find a solution that if you can set up the links with the manual Insteon linking method or the plug-in that this is a more efficient ( faster execution of the action ) method than having HS run an event on a button push trigger . Seems like I should be able to make something this simple happen without HS having to run some commands . Am I overestimating the abilities of the Keypadlinc ? <p> Can anybody tell this neophyte what I 'm doing wrong ? And just for knowledge 's sake , all of the Switchlincs and the Keypadlincs are fed from the same power line , traceable back to a single breaker in the panel so I do n't believe there is any phase leg issues . All devices registered in HS ok and I 'm using the PLM 2413U controller with the Homeseer Hometroller SE-PRO running HomeSeer Pro Edition v2.5.0.23 <p> dave , if you are trying to get the A btn to control the load attached to the same kpl , then you need to link the A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with the plugin . See the kpl manual about doing this . <p> if you are trying to control a separate switchlinc with the A btn , they you should be able to create a link from the kpl edit links page . select the A btn and then choose the responder device that you want to control and click Create Link . The ' cross link devices ' creates a link where the responder would also control the kpl a btn . <p> The stairway lights are actually wired to the kpl directly as the kpl serves as the load switch for that particular circuit . <p> Since the On/Off buttons on the kpl are linked to all 4 circuits , will linking the A btn to the On btn of the kpl cause the A btn to control all 4 circuits as well or can I break out the A btn to control just the stairway lights ? <p> What I 'm trying to achieve is to have the ABCD buttons control all 4 circuits individually and have the On/Off btns control them all as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but after editing the link in HS to make the B btn control the living room lights , that worked great but now the living room lights do n't turn on and off with the kpl on/off btns anymore . So I 'm wondering if I 'm approaching the logic of how to set up these switches incorrectly . . . Would this be how I should approach this : <p> Tried linking the living room lights load switch to the kpl On button by editing the links through the living room . It did n't seem to change any functionality at the kpl but now when I turn on the living room lights from the living room light load switch , the stairway lights come on as well . I suspect this is because the kpl is also the load switch for the stairway lights . I was tempted to delete what I thought was the right link in the edit links page but decided that maybe I 'd better look at wiping the slate clean and starting over . There seems to be a lot of links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters . <p> Is there an easy way to return devices back to factory settings through HS ? <p> No , I 'm not looking to turn on the stairway lights with any of the A-D buttons . <p> I want : A btn to control the stairway lights B btn to control the living room lights C btn to control the game room lights D btn to control the pool table light <p> On btn to turn all 4 circuits on Off btn to turn all 4 circuits off . <p> I have started to learn that there is a lot of cross linking that needs to be done with Insteon devices . When I was manually setting up the two switchlincs for the 3-way circuit that controls the living room lights I figured out that I have to link the load switch to the line switch and then link the line switch to the load switch . When doing this through HS , is seems all I have to do is check the " Cross Link devices " box to achieve the same thing , correct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it . I think what I 've learned is that Insteon devices are smart and dumb at the same time . They 're smart enough to do what you want them to do with very minimal user input but at the same time they assume nothing . They only do exactly what you tell them to do . You 've got to link and cross link the heck out of stuff . <p> I got everything to work and was disappointed that the lights on the ABCD keys of the kpl did n't turn off when I turned everything off with the Off btn . In a bumbled attempt to link the A btn to the On btn ( for the stairway lights ) it did n't work because I did it backwards . While the stairway lights did n't come on when I pressed the A btn , I did notice that the on/off status of the light behind the A btn now matched the overall large On/Off btns . Ah ha ! ! By repeating the linking of the B , C &amp; D buttons the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons indicate whether the circuits are lit or not . ( I reversed the linking process with the A btn and the On btn and now the A btn indeed controls the stairway lights ! ) <p> From a theory standpoint I 've learned that the lights behind the ABCD btns will show an on status with the circuit when individually pressed and *won't* show an off status ( no light ) if the circuit has been turned off with the kpl Off button , in which case the A btn , for example , will stay illuminated even through the stairway lights are off because the lighted A btn itself was n't linked to the kpl On/Off btns . Once linked to those as well , the ABCD buttons show the actual light circuit status accurately . Some lights down there you ca n't see from the top of the stairs so this was a good thing to learn how to do ! ! This , of course , assumes that you 've linked everything else to the On button to begin with . <p> It 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally going to be but I think I understand the whole process much better now . I am far better prepared for future projects . <p> I have been using HS Pro for several years and have successfully installed several Insteon devices without a hitch ( also use Zwave and a few X10 devices ) . <p> My problem lies with my new SwitchLinc . First I tap linked my two new appliancelincs and the Access Point into the the system and they were all recognized and operate as you would expect . <p> The Switchlinc Switch did not register properly . The plugin reports a new " unknown device " with a designation of " 022c " . It only recognizes the main ON and OFF switches but NOT the A , B , C or D buttons . <p> When looking at the HS log file , the two ON and OFF switches can be seen sending the proper commands , but the other buttons do not show up on the log ( as would be expected since they are not listed in the plugin either ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done a hard reset on the device and the results were the same . <p> I have a older KeypadLinc Dimmer that has worked flawlessly for the last few years . <p> Is there a way to make the KPL execute an event ? For example , if I 'd like to have the A scene button execute one event , and the B scene button another , etc . I ca n't seem to figure out how to link events to the buttons on the KPL . <p> Let me add that the problem I 'm having is that the keypad link does n't show the individual keys in the Insteon configuration page , nor do they show up as devices . I can only seem to toggle the main ON of OFF of the KPL . The ABCD buttons are n't available in HS as far as I can tell . <p> I have a smaller , battery operated keypad insteon device that shows all 8 buttons in the insteon configuration page . This new in wall mounted one does n't seem to show the same info @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I deleted the device , tap added it and again the individual keypad buttons do n't show up in the plugin . This is a picture of the box the unit came in . Maybe this particular unit ca n't be configured as I want it to ?

@@98239452 @2439452/ <p> I have created a playlist called " 1 " In that playlist are Radio stations A ... F <p> I have set up a command such that when I send command " 1 ON " It is supposed to play Station A , the next " 1 On " Station B and so on . <p> I press " 1 On " and it fires up ITunes fine , ITunes then goes to the first radio station BUT here is where the problem <p> It scrolls through the list of stations automatically in the blink of the eye . The log data during this time is below . <p> My sense is it does not wait long enough to connect to the stream and moves to the next . You can see each station going by in the display window of ITunes . Sometimes it does stop at a station and will play but its rare . <p> Is their a way to throttle this action or some other ideas on how to approach this ? <p> My solution was to create seperate playlists for each radio station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something like " Radio " . So you would have RadioA , RadioB , etc . This would allow you to scroll throught the playlists collection in a script and filter out the non-radio playlists . <p> This solution may not be helpful for you as you may have different requirements . <p> I 'm trying to nail down this problem but have so far been unable to recreate it . Could you please provide some exact instructions that consistently recreate this problem . I have tried creating a play list with several radio stations but so far all the behavior appears normal . <p> Benjamin , this i believe was related to the problem with all playlists that a few people saw - it just skips through . I do n't think it matters whether it is a regular song playlist or a radio playlist . <p> Funily enough with this new build mine is no longer doing this ( so far ) . I just can not get the damn thing to play more than one song at a time . Even if i put it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Skip forward and back just restart the song . <p> There 's a new build up today ( .05 ) which address the issue of not being able to skip to another track when playing a playlist as well as minor user interface issues . As far as the radio station issues go , we have not yet been able to recreate that . Give the new build a try and we 'll recompile the list of bugs for this latest build . <p> This is certainly odd ! To make sure the latest build was operational , I completely removed HomeSeer from my test system , installed the newest version of HS from the site , and then installed the beta iTunes plugin . Everything worked fine . <p> Now I can expect you would n't want to trash your system just to help debug this beta but I can guarantee you that everything seems to be working fine on a fresh install . What I can recommend is that you delete the following files and re-obtain the plugin from the updater . It is possible that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the " it 's all working over here " type response , I can assure you I tested everything on a new build without problem . <p> So here are the files you could delete ( all relative to the HomeSeer 2 directory , make sure HS is not running ) : <p> So after these files have been deleted I would make sure iTunes is not running , start HomeSeer , install iTunes beta plugin from updater , and restart to finish the install . You will then have to enable the plugin and let it finish before navigating to the music page . I ca n't think of a reason why this would not work , unless perhaps there is a problem with your installation of iTunes . That reminds me , what version of iTunes ( the apple application itself ) are you using ? <p> Ok i did as you suggested . But it still does the same . I am using the very latest version of Itunes . <p> Forgive my little rant here but i have had this plugin for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used plugin , but it has never worked since day one . In the meantime i have wiped out and reinstalled my hard drive . Wiped out my HS configuration and built it up again from scratch . Deleted my Itunes Library and re-loaded it ( 3 times ) moved to a Hometroller , returned to a PC and in all this time this single plugin has never worked . <p> fwiw i am also running Maestro Music , and before you ask YES i have tried disabling it , removing it , reinstalling it . Maestro Music works flawlessly , The HS Itunes Plugin does not . Unfortunately Maestro music does not do everything that i want to do , things that if the HS Itunes plugin worked i would be able to do e.g. scripted itunes control , VR etc . <p> I know i am not the only one with these issues so it can not be just my setup .

@@98239455 @2439455/ <p> I 'd like to have various HS3 speaker clients around my home , so I 'm thinking it would be cool to use a Raspberry Pi 3 to host them . I could buy a small cheap USB-powered speaker and plug it into the Pi , and it would n't cost me a fortune in power . I 'd preferably like to run the client on Win10 IoT . I 'm a developer at Microsoft , so I 'm partial to their products . Plus , Win10 IoT on the RPi3 is pretty sweet and easy to use , and I 'm guessing the Speaker client code is probably already written in . NET so I 'd hope it would n't be too hard to port it over to a Universal project so that it could run on IoT . <p> Anyway , a few questions . First , is there already a speaker client for the Pi ( Linux , Windows , or otherwise ) ? Second , is there reference code available for making a speaker client , or would it be possible for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to both those questions . I found some references to using Squeezebox on Linux but I was hoping for something more direct . <p> What a great idea ! Win 10 IoT based pi speaker clients would great ! I bet you need to contact Rich directly for the code though . I 'm not sure how open it is currently , but perhaps something could be done to change that . There is a chance he wo n't see this post so you should pm , email or ( gasp ) call him directly . <p> Thanks guys . I spent some time yesterday and created a proof-of-concept UWP speaker client app that is capable of receiving speech text messages from HS3 . I probably should have verified that W10 IoT has some kind of Text-to-speech capabilities before I did any of this . I 'm hoping it does , but if it does n't then ... I suppose I 'll have to lobby to get it added . <p> At any rate , I probably wo n't have time to pick it up again until late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping this will be possible . At this point it rests on the capabilities built into the IoT platform . <p> I had a few minutes tonight so I did some more research and coding . Turns out W10 UWP has all the TTS libraries built in . It was about 6 lines of code to make it start talking the messages it got from HS3 . I 've been running my proof-of-concept app for about an hour , sending it messages to speak every now and then . Seems to be working . So yeah , that 's a good sign . <p> Last step is to actually try to deploy it to a Pi and see if it works on there . I 'll grab a Pi when I get a minute ( probably in the next week or so ) and give it a shot . <p> I have n't had a chance yet , but the latest designer that Rich made includes an update Linux version of the client . I know the older one would n't allow speaker to work , I do have hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list right now . <p> I decided to build a prototype Pi Speaker client ( TTS only , no VR ) on the Pi Zero , intention was to have something to go in the garden or be portable and cheap and able to speak TTS ( I have no use for VR ) . Now this may look like two hacked up lunch containers because that is exactly what they are . For a mix between cheapness and ability to withstand a bit of rain I use them a bit in prototype projects - I might look at mounting it in a little waterproof box in the future . <p> I used the Adafruit I2S MAX98357 LONG ... breakout board which combines both mono channels and can output a reasonable amount of volume . It is basically a Pi-Zero , this I2S amp , two LED 's ( one power , one run from the script for status ) , RTL1988 WiFi adaptor and a 1 power bank . I already had the waterproof speaker and other bits of wiring and stuff from some years ago . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and took me a couple of lines of code to add a speech proxy , then it broadcasts the TTS around the network by UDP broadcast . There is a Python script running on the Pi that is listening on the same port for broadcast , if it gets data in a format it is expecting then it 'll speak the TTS using the Pico TTS Engine ( think this is the default with the HS Zee anyway ) . My Python is a little patchy but it looks to do the job at the minute , I 'm also tempted to be able to point web radio streams at it so that I can use it as a music player that I can control from HS . <p> Awesome keep up the good work ! I would love to get TTS , music , and TTS wav file streaming working too . Also .. If your planning on commercializing this as a plugin , perhaps you can bake into your speech proxy the zoning functions and perhaps solve the remote speaker/whole house audio challenge . <p> Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the windows server to be ready . <p> So what 's the latest on this project ? I 'm sure lot of people would love to start building them , I know I would especially if it work for command input too . The only thing that would be better is the MATRIX Voice Wi-Fi/BT/MCU module communicating back to the server . <p> So what 's the latest on this project ?

@@98239457 @2439457/ <p> How To use the ViziaRF and Cooper Aspire multi-button controllers with HomeSeer <p> Here are some tips on using the Z-Wave ViziaRF 4 button scene and zone controllers as well as the Copper Aspire 5 button in-wall controller with HomeSeer . Support for these products were added in HomeSeer 2.2.0.3 . Cooper support was added in 2.2.0.66 . If you want to use the controller to trigger events in HomeSeer , the ViziaRF zone controller or AspireRF controller might be the better choice . The ViziaRF zone controller has an On/Off rocker for each button so you can trigger an event by hitting the ON side . The ViziaRF scene controllers use toggle buttons , so you would need to hit the button twice if the led was on , same with the AspireRF controller . Hitting the ViziaRF scene controller button while the LED is on will cause the controller to send a single OFF command to HomeSeer . HS does not know which button was pressed in this case , so all the button devices will go off . The Cooper AspireRF 5 button controller does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . With the ViziaRF Zone controllers that we have seen shipping since 2010 , there has been other strange behavior if a ViziaRF device is not a part of the scene being configured - e.g. you may not be able to have multiple buttons be " ON " at the same time . <p> 1 ) To add the LEVITON controller , hold down buton 1 and 3 until all LEDS are amber . Now hold down the ADD button on the Z-Troller . The Z-Troller will display " HOLD " until it is done with the add procedure , then when you release the button it will display the node i 'd . If you are using a different remote , use the copy remote feature and send the data to the controller . For the COOPER controller , holding down the " all off " button for a few seconds after putting the remote in the add mode will cause the controller start the add procedure , and the remainder of the procedure is the same as for the Leviton controller . Some of the newer Leviton controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 4 buttons AND a light switch in one device . For these units , the controller and the device(s) act as separate nodes and must be added separately . Follow the instructions CAREFULLY to determine how to put the device into the add mode for each device . You will get a separate node I 'd for each device plus the controller . <p> 2 ) Once you have added a controller , and if you have other wall controllers in the home , you must update the network information in those controllers so that they are aware of the new nodes . As of this writing , this information is not updated in the controllers automatically in any of the controllers shipping since February 2011 . To update the other controllers , simply follow the procedure for adding them to the network . DO NOT remove them from the network , but go through the motions as if you were adding them to the network . The end result is that the same node I 'd that the device already had will be displayed , but your primary controller ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller before it displays the node I 'd . The copy/update procedure should be done when nodes are removed from the network as well.NOTE : Since these are controllers , they need to know about all of your devices so they can route commands to your devices properly . If you add the controller first , it wo n't have the knowledge of any devices . Try adding the controller last , or , after you add all of your devices re-add the Scene/Zone controller to your Z-Troller/Remote . It will keep its same node I 'd but will updated with new node information . <p> 3 ) In HomeSeer , in the Manage Z-Wave Controllers page , click on " Import " . The controller will then be added and up to 5 new devices will be created ; one button device for each button on the controller . <p> 4 ) Click on the name of the button on the HS status page to open its properties . You will see a new " Config " button . Click this to open the scene config . From here , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that only devices that support the scene class can be added to the scene with the Leviton controller , but any Z-Wave switch can be added to a scene for a Cooper controller . IMPORTANT : Even if you do not have any devices to add to the scene , because you wish to use the controller button to launch a HomeSeer event , it is still necessary that you click " Save Scene " at the bottom of the page . When you click " Save Scene " and there are no devices in the scene , HomeSeer will still add itself to the scene so that it will know when you press the button and activate the scene . The reason this is not done automatically when the controller is added to HomeSeer is because this screen is also where you can assign a custom Scene I 'd number to the scene , or you can leave the scene I 'd as the next unused scene I 'd that HomeSeer will have already determined for you . <p> NOTE : Do NOT do any device associations as part of setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable devices support the association command class , this command class is used during the programming of the scene , and so it is not necessary to do any manual operations with the associations . In fact , changing the associations after a scene has been programmed can adversely affect the scene operations and you may not get the desired result . <p> 5 ) When you press a button on the controller , the LED will go on and the scene command will be sent to HS as well as any other devices associated with the button . You can create triggers in HS when the button device goes ON . <p> 6 ) When you turn off a button , it simply sends an OFF command to HomeSeer and all devices associated with the button . All button devices in HS will go off ( since they are all part of the same device ) . So its not possible to trigger on a button going off with the Leviton controllers . While the Cooper controllers operate the same way and only send an OFF signal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use to determine which button was turned off . Because of this , HomeSeer can be used to trigger on any of the buttons turning OFF with a Cooper controller . <p> 7 ) To control devices that do not support scenes , there are two ways depending upon the controller you are using : For Cooper controllers , there is nothing special to note - Cooper controllers allow non-scene devices to be added to a scene , and they will control the device similar to how a scene capable device is controlled . However , since the device is not scene capable , they can be set to go to a specific dim level , but the period of time ( ramp rate ) is not supported , and each non-scene device is turned on separately - they do not react together like scene devices do . For Leviton controllers , it is necessary to save the scene with no devices in it ( or just the scene capable devices ) , and then set up an event in HomeSeer to be triggered when the scene button is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the event add your non-scene devices and set them to the desired level . <p> A Note about Scene I 'd 's <p> When you create a scene a unique scene I 'd is assigned to the scene . This scene I 'd is used to enable the scene in all of the devices that are part of the scene . There is a max of 255 scenes . If the same scene I 'd is used in multiple scenes , you may see unpredictable results . HomeSeer ensures that it will not re-use scene I 'd 's , however , if you use a remote to set up scenes , then HomeSeer has no knowledge of exitsing scene I 'd 's . To check your scenes , click on each scene button and retrieve the scene configuration . You can then check that all your scene I 'd 's are unique . <p> An Important Update : With the Leviton Zone Controllers shipped in the past few years , we have noticed that the same behavior takes place on these as with the Scene controllers in that after a button is turned on , pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on to turn off . <p> The only way you can get full control/status of the button LEDs with a Leviton controller is to use a Leviton handheld controller , as they keep the ability to control the LEDs in the MANUFACTURER PROPRIETARY command class , which by definition prevents other Z-Wave manufacturers from having access to that information . Without a Leviton handheld controller , it should be noted that the LEDs turn off when more than one button have the same node in the associated scenes . Since HomeSeer , by default , adds itself to all of the scenes so that the corresponding button devices in HomeSeer can be updated , this causes all other LEDs to turn off when any one button is activated , just like how the scene controllers operate . <p> The Cooper Wiring controllers do not have this limitation , have an additional button as well as an " All Off " button , and can control non-Scene devices in addition to scene devices .

@@98239463 @2439463/ <p> We have two homes ; we split our time between the houses ( six months/six months ) . At each home I have HS3 running . I have some events that run only when we 're at a house , and other events that run only when we 're not at a house ( and still other events that run all the time ) . <p> So I wanted to disable/enable events . My initial thought was to set up an event trigger that looks at the value of a global variable , and to set up an event action that then disables/enables events accordingly . However , HS3 does not permit event triggers off global variable triggers , and also does not permit event actions that disable/enable other events . <p> But there 's an easy way to do this with the capabilities that HS3 does provide . First , create a new virtual device . I called it occupancy . For the value of zero , I set the text to " away , " and for the value of 255 , I set the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event that you want to run only when you 're here , add another trigger ( joined via AND with the other existing trigger(s) ) . This trigger is whether the occupancy virtual device is equal to " here . " Voila -- you 've in effect enabled this event to run only when you 're here . You do the same for events that only should run when you 're away , adding another trigger ( joined via AND with the existing trigger(s) ) that is whether the occupancy virtual device has a value equal to " away . " <p> I 've attached a couple of screenshots that show what I did . I defined two event types , away and here , so I can easily find events that are triggered accordingly , across event groups . <p> I 'm missing something here , I guess . First as far as I know you CAN indeed disable/enable an other event from within an other event . And two : i have some 60 virtual devices that keep notes of all kinds of things in my house : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awake ? Is it a weekend-day tomorrow or a working day ? Etc etc . Almost every event I make depends on the value of a virtual device at the time it is executed or indeed starts when such a virtual device changes it 's value . <p> Very true . I do that as well . Also , I enable/ disable events based in schedule of other events ( i.e. Workday , school break , etc ) . His execution simply uses two virtual devices to auto-enable and disable a wide range of events . Just another clean way of doing things . <p> Yes , virtual devices are your friend . Take a look as this thread from last month that goes step by step on creating virtual devices , changing the status text and graphics , controlling virtual devices and using the devices in events . <p> I would find it hard to believe there was n't a way to disable an event with the scripting features but from a quick look I could n't find a reference to it . However I agree that using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see where you might want to do other things in an event regardless of the virtual device status and I would think keeping track of that in the script and disabling at the right levels would be more difficult than simply checking a VD status . <p> I would find it hard to believe there was n't a way to disable an event with the scripting features but from a quick look I could n't find a reference to it .

I can see where you might want to do other things in an event regardless of the virtual device status and I would think keeping track of that in the script and disabling at the right levels would be more difficult than simply checking a VD status . <p> Like Rupp said , there is a command , but like you said virtual devices make it much easier to see the status of the devices through HSTouch and the Device manager . Careful organization of devices using the floor and room labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check whether groups of events are enabled or not by looking at the status of the controlling virtual devices . <p> Thanks for the reference Rupp .

It would be nice to have a stand alone searchable document that I can use offline but I will get used to it . <p> I 'm feeling the general spirit of this thread and must say that virtual devices are the way to go for occurrences that occur more often than not . That said , the insanely simple script function to enable/disable an event is very useful for the occasion where you do n't need an entire virtual device cluttering up your virtual HS space . This is so easy that even I ( my high tech abilities end somewhere around the place that my off the shelf Dell desktop power button begins ) can copy and paste into an event . <p> I 'm feeling the general spirit of this thread and must say that virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than not .

Maybe there is an easy way , I just do n't know it . And the " $h1t$t0rM " can be somewhat mitigated by hiding devices that are rarely used . <p> I do n't disagree , but just to play devil 's advocate , how do you tell at a glance which events have been disabled by script , without going to a browser and expanding the entire screen ?

I just looked at the HS3 help , and did n't see anything that explained this . Will need to do some digging . <p> But you seem to suggest that for any event of a group to be triggered , the group condition first has to be satisfied . Are group actions , then , actions performed when any event in the group is performed ? <p> I was thinking that group conditions/group actions were tied together ( i.e. , if the group conditions are met , then the group actions are performed ) , and did n't really understand how this differed from , say , a regular event . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group conditions ( or group actions ) , and for the events in that group , you then effectively reference them . Presumably , the idea here is that if you have a lot of conditions , you are saved the trouble from having to add them into each desired event . And if you modify a condition , you do n't have to go to each event to modify them . <p> In my case , then , rather than doing the " AND IF " virtual device is Here or Away at each event , I would instead create this as a group condition , and then in each desired event , reference that group condition . Wonderful -- I like it !

All of that works fine in that I can control the Sonos system ( as well as my lights ) through the Homeseer system on the PC . I have just now added an Amazon Echo to the mix . The Echo let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Echo does not or can not see any of the five Sonos speakers that are available ; therefore , the Echo can NOT control any of the Sonos Speakers . What else do I need to know , or do , in order to get my Echo to Sonos integration to work ? <p> This question is probably better posted on the Echo related threads . As far I can tell , if you use the " direct " way ( ie you did n't create your own skills ) , you can only control lights and thermostats so most of the Sonos commands would n't fit there . Someone asked whether we could " fake " for example a volume control to be like a dim control and I 'm not sure how HS3 really implements that . I think it is a setting somewhere but again , better asked on the Echo related threads . <p> I added the ability to have Alexa/Echo control the volume of my wife 's Sonos using a Virtual Device and a script . I 'll try to provide all the " lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HomeSeer Echo API , not the skills . <p> First , as you may have read in other forums , the Amazon system severely limits the HomeSeer devices it " recognizes " ; Alexa did not recognize any of the Sonos devices . So in many cases you 'll need to create Virtual devices that Alexa ( the Amazon software ) will recognize . That pretty much means , from what I 've experienced , devices that are straight on/off or look like a light dimmer . I created a virtual device named " Sonos Loudness " with Status text of : on , off and range of 1 to 99 ( again , just like a light dimmer ) . <p> Why " Sonos Loudness " instead of " Sonos Volume " as the name of the Virtual Device ? Because no matter what I tried that had " volume " as part of the device name , Alexa would associate my voice command to its ' own internal music player volume ( it would also say if I tried to command a volume setting greater than 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10 ) . With that figured out , the command I speak is " Alexa , set Sonos Volume to 40 " , or any other value between 0 and 100 . <p> The next thing is to tie the change in the value of the Virtual Device to the actual Sonos Volume . For this you need an Event and a script that is called by the Event . <p> The Event looks for any change in the value of the " Sonos Volume " Virtual Device - if that change does it occur , then it runs the script ' SetSonosVolume.cs ' . The script does n't get passed any parameters - it just gets the current value of the Virtual Device and sets the REAL Sonos Volume to that value . Here 's the script code , written in C# : <p> vasrc - I 'm a newbie . Can you explain how you set this up as an event that works with Echo ? <p> Which part , the virtual device part , the Event part or the EasyTrigger part ? <p> For EasyTrigger you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 ? days then you would need to purchase it ) . It 's like the swiss army knife of Event actions <p> If the virtual device part : Create a new device from the Home page ( Green + ) Goto the Status Graphics tab and delete the two existing On/Off items Create a new range and set it to 0 - 100 Set the Control Use : to " Dim " The " Voice Command " should already be set for new devices . <p> Create a new Event It will contain a simple Trigger of : IF " new virtual device name " had it 's Value set or changed and the Action : EasyTrigger Set Device to another Device " new virtual device name " to " Sonos Volume name " <p> Then you let Echo discover the new device ( Alexa discover new devices ) <p> You should then be able to say : Alexa , set " New device name " to X % <p> I did get Sonos Volume to work , but as BBB said , it 's probably best to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial to for itself . <p> There should be several more detailed explanations available about setting up devices and events .

@@98239474 @2439474/ <p> I 'm currently on the 30-day trial for HS3 to test out how it links to my Echo and just overall how it works . <p> My question here is related to how I can query a device . What I 'd like to be able to do is say " Alexa , is the garage door open ? " or " Alexa , is the front door locked ? " In the short term I 'd like something like " Alexa , what is the temperature in X 's room ? " ( assuming I have an Aeotec MultiSensor in there . <p> Is anything like that possible ? I 'm assuming anything 's possible with Homeseer , so the question would be , how would I do that ? <p> If I had to do " Alexa , ask Homeseer is the garage door open " that would n't be the end of the world , but obviously less ideal . <p> Additionally , it would be nice to be able to ask " Alexa , is the house ready for bed " and have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , windows closed , etc . <p> I use this helper script and can query devices such as T-stat ( temp , set points , humidity ) , temp sensors , garage doors and I even have it to read Environment Canada weather forecasts etc .

But anyway ... that poor decision has passed . <p> how can I find out what is telling HS3 to shut down ?

The older models at least required you to include it when powered in the manner that you plan on using it . e.g. if you include it when externally powered and then install it with battery only , it will not operate reliably as HS would be expecting it to act as a repeating device , which does n't happen when it 's on battery power . <p> If you did include it when on external power , then I expect that you will need to exclude it then re-add it on batteries to resolve . <p> It does n't matter how they are powered when included .

I thought I 'd read that the newer ones required same , but I only have one of the older ones , that requires the inclusion to be in the final power mode . <p> As always YMMV when it comes to Aeotec , but the results I get are consistent with what is stated in the manual : <p> " Your MultiSensor can be powered by battery or by USB with an appropriate adaptor . For the purposes of installation and setup , even if you intend to power your sensor with batteries , we recommend utilizing the provided USB cable for setup " . <p> I will say that I am generally much happier with these sensors than any of the previous Aeotec sensors as well as my original HSM 100s . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . I did get one where the luminance was miles off from one mounted 10 feet away . The parameters let you correct the reported values for all 4 sensors , but the one that is inaccurate is not off by a set value across the range , it is about twice the value of the other outside sensors . I have yet to take a light meter outside , but these sensors seem to have a much greater range to luminance , providing a greater ability to trigger luminance related events . They report well above 1000 lux as compared to the predecessors that stop at 1000 lux and seem to transition from 0-1000 very quickly . <p> I also should add that with the beta Z-Wave 3.0.1.30 parameters 3 , 4 , 101-103 and 111-113 are now part of the settings page .

( via some DSP routine in the hardware ? ) <p> It would seem more useful if there was an accelerometer providing real values back .

Hopefully as z-wave adds features Insteon also will pick those up and vice versa . While I understand having too many " standards " can be a bad thing , having a few in this space where at least we have controllers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad thing . <p> I feel an ideological battle coming on ... but hope not . Most new technologies improve the overall level of HA sophistication . <p> I 'll position myself right off the bat : I 've invested in Insteon since I looked into HA in 2006 and have never regretted it since . Why ? <p> Faster protocol <p> Simpler protocol <p> Plugin support ( thanks to Mark S. ) <p> Cost of devices <p> But I 'm always attracted to new technologies . So why have n't I embarked on the Zwave bandwagon ? Answer - It 's network topology and compatibility issues many have reported time and time again . <p> Insteon is , and always has been , a mesh network , dual band at that ( RF and power line ) . Look at the Insteon forums : how many pet peeves ? <p> What makes me wonder about the future of Insteon ? Evolution . One example : I need for our new house a 2017 era thermostat ; what are my choices for an Insteon protocol supported devices ? 2441TH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KeypadLincs ; great device , tons of functionality , but looks ? again from the 2000 era . Why have we not seen a programmable phone size display that can lodge in an electrical box , enabled with the Insteon protocol , at a consumer price point ? I can buy a small factor tablet ( 7 " ) for 80$ CDN ( 65$ US ) : where 's the problem you think ? <p> Vision ... All of the current HA suppliers have a very narrow scope of their offering , sad . I think we need one of the big ones ( Google , Amazon , ? ? ? ) to move into HA territory , and they are , but slowly , apparently with ( still ) no wide vision of HA . <p> I have zero Insteon and zero Zwave issues in my 3 level - having 2 different Veras , a Wink , and now SmartStick+ ... all placed in the basement . But frequently hae Zigbee issues , it is just way slower than Zwave - at least the 36 zigbee lights across all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Insteon since BEFORE they had RF and , other than poor quality PLMs ( 3 died in 10ish years ) very few issues . I 've had about 5 dimmers , or 25 or so , die in 10 years . <p> I got rid of my Keypadlincs a long time ago and only have dimmers ... many are still old Powerline only versions . I use ISY as the interface . <p> I 've always said ISY dimmers were best-of-breed - only in the past few months has any dimmer rivaled it , now with the brand new Leviton &amp; Homeseer switches finally catching up feature wise - though , I do n't  have any so no idea on quality . <p> I 'm not getting rid of my Insteon but once my reserve supply runs out I wont be buying any more - probably every . Zwave is king of HA and that will not likely change anytime soon . <p> A while back I thought Apple ( I do n't own any apple devices ) might buy Insteon - that would be the best thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , I feel that unless a big company ( Google , Amazon , Apple , etc ) buy them - Insteon will in the archives just like X10 of HA in 5 years from now ... there will still be a small set of users but no new ones jumping on , only old ones jumping off . <p> I have to say that my continued support of Insteon is largely due to Mark 's work . I came to the HS game late but with an already installed based of Insteon devices . They all migrated just as expected to HS3 with the plugin . It is solid and reliable .

@@98239485 @2439485/ <p> Hello , I 'm hoping someone can help me out . I have an AirScape House Fan that can receive htttp commands . For example , you can send something like http : **25;2898;TOOLONG ? dir=4 to the fan controller to turn it off . I 'm sure I 'll have to create virtual devices and/or events for this but I ca n't figure out what else I would need to do . I 've never gotten into script writing with HS3 . I went through a lot fo the User Documentation but I do n't even know where to start with this . <p> You 're welcome ! I 've also been looking at whole house fans since we typically get cool nights in Calgary in the summer . Are you happy with the Airscape fan ? Which optional components are needed to allow the http commands to be sent to it ? <p> Al , I believe all AirScape fans after 2013 have a newer controller board that do n't require anything else to use Web Controls . I have been around a lot of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever heard . I am in Southern California and I often sleep with the fan on low speed all night instead of running the AC . It has probably paid for itself in air conditioning / electrical savings within 2-3 years . I have the model LONG ... and I 've had it for probably 8-10 years . I have had no problems with it but I sent the whole unit in a couple years ago to have the updated controller board installed so I could access it over the web . They also installed a newer door motor and some other upgrades . AirScape fans are a lot more money than the simple house fans you can get ( $950 vs. $200 ) but I would do it again in a second . Plus , the one that I got was sized so I did n't have to do any framing . I installed through to the attic in a couple hours . My parents have a typical $200 house fan that they almost never use because it is so loud . Hope that helps a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I followed your link to the whole house fans and found all the articles claiming attic vent fans are a waste but the whole house fans are great . Throw that on top of the $200 vs $900 trade ( that 's for one of the smaller AirScape setups ) and the fact that I ca n't get anyone to actually show up to give me an estimate has really delayed that project . I wanted it for the summer heat . I was going to have the attic fan installed because I did n't want to cut a big hole in my roof myself . I 've never done that one before . <p> There is a definite lack of rigor in the attic vent arguments and some of their assumptions about heat transfer are wrong so I 'm a little iffy on the theory . There does appear to be empirical evidence that the attic vent fan does n't reduce electric bills as expected . If it is a whole house fan instead I could install myself . I 'll cut holes in my ceilings all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one argument they have that makes sense is the attic vent will draw humid air into the house causing the air conditioning to work harder . Not really applicable here in SoCal though . <p> Hello , I 'm not sure about all the heat transfer theories but I can tell you this ; <p> I have an AirScape house fan , a high power attic gable vent/ventilator fan , and a solar powered rooftop ventilator . The solar roof ventilator does almost nothing . I never noticed any difference in attic temperature or house cooling . It 's solar powered though so I just leave it alone and let it run during daylight . If I was to do the rooftop ventilator again I would not get a solar one , I would hard wire it so it could run after the sun goes down . The high powered gable vent fan that I installed is very loud and vibrates a lot , even with the vibration dampers installed . I rarely use it and I never see any benefit from it . I turn it on 3 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house fan on the other hand , does more to cool the house and attic than the other two fans combined . I 'm guessing this is because it is pushing the slightly cooler house air through the attic and eventually outside . The house fan I installed myself in an afternoon , assuming some basic carpentry skills and power in the attic that you can tie into . I do n't only use it during the summer either . I use it any time I want fresh air and a breeze through the house . Think cooking smoke or stagnant air after being gone a while . It is in the middle of the second story of the house and when I turn it on high , any door that is open inside the house , with a window open in that room , the fan will pull the doors closed . The basic theory of a house fan it to use your AC ( if needed ) during the day . Then in the evening when the outside temperature is cool enough to be pleasant you turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not work if you live in an area that does not cool down much at night . <p> The real short version , I have a roof fan , a gable fan , and a house fan .

Keep the noise in mind though when shopping , if mine was as loud as other house fans I 've heard I would never use it . <p> how did you get it to work ? where did you put the command ? i am new at this and know what i should do but do n't know where to put it in the program , can you show some screen shots how to set it up . i am trying to do same thing . <p> 3 .

@@98239487 @2439487/ <p> In order to expand my wireless coverage I would love to add a new router to the far side of my house . The easiest why to do this would be to simply run a cat5 wire to the attic and connect it to a router . Would/could a router survive the extreme conditions in an attic ? ( 110-F summer to 20-F during winter ) TIA <p> Rupp , I hope so . I have two routers in my attic . The Buffalo has been up there almost a year , but the D-Link just a few days . They have not complained , and it gets so hot up there that I can only go up at night . It never gets cold , though . <p> I just went to the Linksys site and the wireless router I use says operating temperature is 32F to 104F . I know my attic gets hotter than that . So If you want to try it , you could , but in the summer it might not work on hot days . I guess , just try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a router in the cold , but I run a PC at our cottage that goes all winter long without heat . I live in Canada and it 's below freezing for extended periods of time . Even when it gets down to -30C it 's fine . I 'd be surprised if a router would have any more difficulty than my current setup . Now heat , that 's another thing ! But 110 does n't sound too bad ! And Rupp , I just know that you have a temperature gauge up in the attic so that you can monitor it .... <p> radio waves propogate at a 90degree angle from the antenna usually . when you induce the radio wave in a straight wire ( antenna ) , it comes off as a sine wave . So , I usually have the two antennas on my AP tilted in a V pattern . So , the area directly above , and directly below the antenna usually are the worst for transmission and reception . This of course is all thrown off when you start coiling the etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiving attenna 's are parallel to each other . This way the maximum sine wave coming off the transmitter cuts across the receiver antenna and induces the best voltage which is passed to the amplifier . There are some exceptions because I have heard of antenna that are fabricated to radiate slightly off 90 degrees for mounting on top of high towers etc . But this theory applies most fo the time . <p> I assume you mean a second WAP ? I imagine it would run cooler than a router at it does less . <p> I have been quite shocked at the range I get with my WAP and laptop . I have a 3300 sft house- and put the WAP in one corner on the first floor and it covers the whole house . I even got wifi from the guy two house down from me. 2 acres lots in my subdivision . I think the laptops with the built in wifi have good antennas . <p> I have to agree with Sdanks . If you are running a CAT5 cable up there , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will keep the router easily accessable , and in a comftorable climate It will also aleviate the need for running power to it as well . Just get some standard coax cable with a bayonette connector and relocate the routers antenae up there . The Dlink router I have ( Dlink 614+ ) has 2 antennae 's on it . Both are connected with " Push and turn " bayonette connectors . Theoretically you could run one cable one way and one the other and cover the entire house with it . <p> I may be off the board for a while , Frances is more than likely going to knock out the power here for some time as it is headed DIRRECTLY at us of of this afternoons update . <p> Coax instead of Cat5 sounds like a great plan , but it isn't. 802.11b &amp; g runs at 2.4 GHz , and at that freq. , typical cable attenuation is about 3 dB every 3 feet . That means you 'll be radiating more signal out the cable than out the antenna . ( That is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Instead , forget the cable and just use a repeater . Many AP 's can do this function out of the box , or you can get a dedicated repeater . The negative is that it cuts your datarate in half , because it has to both transmit and receive , but chances are you 'll never tell the difference . Or you could just add a bigger antenna or raise it higher on your original AP . <p> If your not sure how to find a repeater , read the box carefully , and it will say . Apple 's new Air Port Express can be a repeater . You just plug it in an outlet , and your just about done . Many D-Link Access Points ( but not Access Point Routers ) can be a repeater . I have the DWL-2100AP with good results . <p> if you have the $$$$ , D-LINK and Cisco and others make wide temperature range APs and bridges . Some are waterproof . Like the CIsco AP1200 indoor and AP1300 outdoor D-LINK has similar , less capable but cheaper . 
@@98239488 @2439488/ <p> I own the Pioneer VSX-1123-K and a VSX-1121-K Receivers . I have them connected to one network switch and they are all on the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 . I have had this setup for several years and it has been very stable . However , I recently purchased and installed several Amazon Echo devices ( sold by Amazon ) and started experiencing issues with all my Pioneer receivers . In particular , I started to notice Apple Airplay cuts out about every 20-30 minutes . I also noticed HomeSeer was being disconnected by the Pioneer receivers when I lost Airplay connectivity . <p> In a nutshell , the Ethernet interfaces on all of my Pioneer Receivers are resetting ( at exactly the same time ) as a result of a UPnP/SSDP packet being sent by the Amazon Echo . I can duplicate the issue 100% of the time by simply asking my Amazon Echo to " discover devices " . This results in a UPnP/SSDP packet to be broadcast on my local LAN ( its part of the UPnP/SSDP protocol ) . Unfortunately , the UPnP/SSDP packet sent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset . I was able to prove this by purchasing a switch that sends an SNMP trap whenever a switch port changes state . Packet captures also shows the Pioneer Receiver resets the Ethernet interface because the first packet sent after it comes back online is a DHCPDISCOVER . I tried setting a static IP , but that did n't  help ( cause the Pioneer Receiver is resetting the Ethernet Interface which causes all connected devices to disconnect ) . I was also able to prove this by capturing packets to see the Pioneer Receiver is sending a TCP RST packet to any connected TCP client ( e.g. my home automation system ) prior to the Interface resetting . <p> If you are also experiencing this issue , please contact Pioneer support . <p> Possible work-around : <p> Purchase a network switch that can block UDP traffic by source IP ( e.g. Netgear GS108T currently $72 at Amazon ) . <p> Connect your Pioneer Receivers to the new switch and connect the new switch to your existing network via port 1 . <p> Assign a static IP address to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rule to block all UDP traffic from the IP address you assigned to your Amazon Echo and assign that rule to port 1 . <p> Thanks for the investigation ! I do n't use Airplay with my Pioneer receive too often , however the past couple of uses I could n't understand why my receiver was disconnecting , alas I now have an Echo . Great , something else to work on . <p> Having the same issues with my 4 receivers since adding the Echo , having to unplug all receivers and repower is not fun . I put zwave plugs on each for now so resets are easy enough until a fix surfaces . <p> Question - is it JUST when the Echo discovers devices ? Does that mean that if I do not tell it to discover devices I do not have to worry about it ? <p> I have a ton of Z-Wave modules , so I am thinking of trying John 's solution and have it kill the power to the receiver if the plug-in reports it disconnected for a period of time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send the sequence of packets that kills the Pioneer Ethernet interface at least once every 20-30 minutes . The only solution I am aware of is to isolate the Amazon Echo devices from the network the Pioneer receivers are connected to . <p> I tried really hard to contact Pioneer to let them know what I found , but they never responded to the many e-mails I sent to them . <p> With a Permit/True at the end . I 've bound the rules to all ports and it shows up in the Binding Table - but to no avail . <p> Any ideas ? ( By the way , I do n't need any DLNA access to my receivers ... the only control I need is your port:23 stuff ) . <p> Thanks . <p> Hello skavan , <p> Can you check out the screenshot to see if rule 6 looks like the one you added ? I think you may need to change the source from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.0 . I have not yet tested rule 6 , but I assume the source mask 0.0.0.255 is appropriate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way -- filtering each specific alexa -- it works ... but only if I bind the rule to the incoming port , rather then the port the receiver is connected to . This seems illogical to me . Perhaps I 'm misunderstanding quite how the ACL stuff works . <p> Thank you all for both discovering this and solving it ! About six months ago my pioneer sc-71 stopped responding to any network commands , and only worked again after unplugging and plugging it back in . Randomly I was looking through devices that were having connectivity issues and noticed the date of the last time the pioneer responded . Then several minutes later , on an unrelated search , I saw the date I purchased my first echo while browsing amazon . *click* Go to google , find this thread , giant sigh of relief . I bought the netgear , and now after some tweaking I have my pioneer control back . ( Plus some other nifty network filters ) . I found the same thing of needing to bind to the incoming traffic port . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch that was being connected to by one of the echos so I had to assign the rules to multiple ports . <p> I wish pioneer would address some of these , but at least it is possible to work around ! Thanks ! <p> Although I do n't use Amazon Echos . I have a Pioneer VSX-2020 ( With UltraPioneerAVR 3 plugin ) set with a static IP address . And quite a few Netgear switches . Now I ca n't say that feel your pain or neither can I recreate the Echo problem . All that I can suggest is update switch firmware and always restart the switch after any configurations in the switch ! I say this from experience that I once even tried to replace network cards after updating software for cards on the server The switch knocks them off line until it 's restarted ! This here unrelated but may also help : LONG ... <p> Hi everyone . I have a Yamaha RX-V675 and have been having problems with my Amazon Echo for over a year now . I tried isolating the Echo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . My receiver would completely lose connectivity after a few minutes of being on the network . Very frustrating ! ! <p> I captured traffic via wireshark and found the same problem reported by Ultrajones : SSDP broadcasts from the Echo appeared to be causing network problems on my receiver . <p> Since I am running DD-WRT on my router , I was in the process of nailing down the syntax to block port 1900 on the receiver when I noticed that I had n't installed the latest firmware ( 7/2016 ) update available for my Yamaha . After installing it , It 's been up and running for several days now with no issues . <p> I just wanted to let everyone know that this is n't a problem exclusive to the Pioneers . Perhaps these receivers run a common kernel that 's susceptible to SSDP broadcast problems ? <p> I hope this is resolved for my receiver and wish you all resolution soon too . If it continues , I will renew my iptables approach . <p> I have not had much time to bother trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I thought would work was to use the plug-in 's connection status . When it said it was disconnected , I would kill the power to the receiver with a module , turn it back on after a few seconds , then force the plug-in to re-connect . Unfortunately , while this worked before , the current version of the plug-in does not have it working . It never re-connects on command . Even if I use the Pioneer app on my phone and that can re-connect , the plug-in can not . If , on the other hand , I completely turn off/disable the plug-in and then restart it , then it connects just fine . So something about the re-connect is not working right . <p> I am not a homeseer customer so my posts ( if allowed ) will technically be illegal , but maybe my input on this issue could help others or myself . I am having the same issue with my Pioneer VSX-1123 . It started right after getting Alexa . At first I thought maybe it was a coincidence and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thread . I am an irule user for my home theater stuff so I need the receiver to be operable . I do not use airplay or any other internet streaming music stuff that may have been mentioned in previous posts . <p> Here 's what I 've found so-far ... The 1123 's ( receiver ) ethernet connection is randomly dropping . I do n't stream music with it so the only way I know that it died is when I can not power it up using irule . I need to do a power plug cycle , then turn the 1123 on manually before irule can resume control of it . It will work normally until it drops again . Drops are random , but usually occur only after hours , not minutes like others have reported . Asking Alexa to execute a discovery of devices does not create the problem . I have tried this several times and it has yet to knock the 1123 off-line . <p> My network consists of a Cox modem going to a D-Link wifi dual-band router , which outputs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried creating a guest SSID and unticked the " enable routing between zones " box . This did not work . I also tried various settings on the router . None of these worked , however I have no-idea what I 'm doing with this stuff . <p> I tried wireshark for several days to try to find an offending packet but I 've since given-up because I 'm not seeing packets that I know are being sent , etc . I have no experience with this app . <p> Anyhow , just wanted to relay my experience of device discovery not causing the problem , and see if there 's anything new on this topic .

Perfectly stable network for over 2 years and suddenly two Pioneers kept dropping from the network within hours of being reset . Thanks to you all for this thread as I 've tried Merlin firmware , static IP 's , removing a DAP-1522 , reboot after reboot , etc , all to no avail . It was Alexa all along . Found an alternative , easier solution , also . I just relegated Alexa to a guest wifi network separate from the receivers and the Pioneer 's have stayed on the network for over 24 hrs now ( for the first time since November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subnet will solve it-I know , not complicated , but effective . As long as your router ( I have an Asus RT-AC66R ) supports a guest network , you should be good to go .

One to turn on the light with motion and delete delayed event , another to create the delayed event if no motion and have it set the time ( a few minutes forward from current ) that will turn off the light if the time is reached ( reason you have it deleted in the first event is again to keep the lights on if people are in the room ) . <p> One of the most interesting aspects of HA - and HS - is that there are many ways to solve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular situation can be a challenging problem that , if you are so inclined , can be fun to solve . <p> For a closet , I think you could have a pretty simple solution .

A second event to turn the light off if it is on and no motion has been detected for a specified amount of time . <p> For a basement , that gets a bit more complicated if you need several motion detectors to cover the space , but it 's basically the same scheme .

@@98239491 @2439491/ <p> I have an awning over my deck that opens and closes with an electric switch . I was wondering if anyone else has an electric awning , and if so , do you have it hooked up to homeseer to open and close under certain conditions ? I would like to know the type of switch I would need to buy to make this happen . I use x10 in the house . Thanks . <p> Well , it was just installed , and they did not install the switch yet . Since I am basically an electrician , I can see that there are 5 wires hanging that need to be hooked up . Red , black , white , green and copper . My curiousity led me to hook up the red and white to a regular hot light switch , and the awning opened ! Then I hooked up the black and white to the light switch , and , as I assumed , the awning closed . I do n't know what kind of switch they will install , so that 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awning because maybe they could tell me what switch I can use for automation . <p> It sounds like the white is Neutral , and the black and red are hots for closed and open . Does the motor stop on it 's own when it reaches the end ? If so , it sounds like a regular 3-way wall switch will work . The power comes to the switch common , and the red and black connect to the two ( mutually exclusive ) sides of the switch . I do n't know what the green might be , but the copper should be earth ground . <p> Off the top of my head , you could just use a SPDT relay with a 120 VAC coil and " toggle " that relay with an appliance module ( connect the coil to the appliance module ) . Then wire the " NC " contact to the Black , the " NO " to the Red , and the " C " ( Swinger ) to the " Hot " AC . Just make sure you put the relay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for the responses , guys . The motor does stop on its own when it opens and closes . I misspoke before . There are only 4 wires . The green is the ground . There is no copper . Is there a 3-way x10 switch ? I was thinking of two x10 switches together , but I ca n't do that because if you forget to turn the power off in one position , and turn it on in the other position , that would not be good ! <p> Let me throw this schematic up for review so others can confirm if this will work . You can use a relay such as THIS ( its a DPDT , just do n't use one of the poles ) . <p> I might have the NO and NC nomenclature wrong , but you get the idea ( just follow the labeling ) . <p> When the appliance module is " OFF " 120 VAC is fed to the Black wire and nothing to the Red wire so the awning will close . <p> When the appliance module @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinger will move from the NC to the NO position ) 120 VAC is fed to the Red wire and nothing to the Black wire so the awning will open . You can just leave the appliance module on since you said the awning will stop on its own . <p> I 'm trying to understand , but I have some questions . I still want to be able to manually control the awning with a switch , so I guess I can use an x10 slimline wall switch and set it to the code of the appliance module . I 'm not sure how you are hooking up the appliance module to the whole thing though . What is powering the motor ? The x10 appliance module ? If so , where are the black , red and white wires going to in your diagram with the arrows ? My other concern is that although the awning does stop on its own , is it ok to have constant power running to it ? <p> Paul H , I know you suggested this , but you said to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? What if I did this : I want to keep this hidden , so I would install a 110 receptacle outlet in my attic near the awning wires . I would attach the red wire to the Normally Open spot and the black wire to the Normally Closed spot on the universal module . I 'm not sure what I would do with the green ground , maybe attach it to the receptacle box . I would plug in the universal module to the new outlet I just installed , and set the house and unit codes . Then , if I use a remote to turn x10 on , it would close , and x10 off it would open , or vice versa , depending . Would this work ? I 'm not sure of the voltage the motor takes , but the wires are very thin . <p> So Brave Sir Robbin , you have the right idea . From reading I am assuming that the x10 appliance module does not power the awning motor at all , but merely provides the charge to toggle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have to hook up another live feed and tie the white wires and ground wires together , and hook the black ( hot ) wire to the relay . The relay will determine which wire ( black or red ) will get power to either open or close the awning , and the appliance module will set this in motion . Am I on the right track ? I would like to pick one of these up at Radio Shack and give it a try . Thanks a lot for all of your help . I learned a lot today . <p> I am going to try this tomorrow . Does anyone know exactly where the wires should be connected ? There are 8 positions on the relay . I think the x10 module connects to #7 and #8 , but I 'm not sure where the black and red wires from the awning motor go , as well as the hot wire from the electric feed . I need to know position # 's . Thanks . <p> There should be a diagram on the package showing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect to the coil and which ones are NO and NC . It also might be printed right on the relay . <p> Well I did it . I went to home depot and bought a 3 gang box , a single gang box , a 15 amp outlet , 5 1 ' runs of stranded 14 ga wire . I got the dpdt relay from Radio Shack . In my attic I installed the single gand box and attached the 15 amp outlet . Under the single gand I installed the 3 gang box where I ran a live 14-2 feed from the outlet , the lamp wire plugged into the x10 appliance module , and the awning motor wire . I soldered the 5 14 ga wires to the relay . Then I put the relay in the 3 gang box and attached everything together . I hit x10 4 on , and what do you know , the awning opened . I hit x10 off , and it closed . Thank God , and thank you guys for all the help , especially brave sir robin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close it based on certain circumstances . I will start another thread for that . I have a few concerns . <p> 1 . Was I correct in using stranded 14 ga wire to solder to the relay ? I just stuck the wire through the hole , bent it , and soldered it . It seems fine . Then , I taped around each connection to insulate them . <p> 2 . The attic where I installed all of this is extremely hot in the summer and cold in the winter . Will this have an effect on the wiring or the circuit ? <p> 3 . I 'm not 100% certain that the awning motor does not need a stop switch . What I mean is I 'm not sure if running constant power to it is ok . I think it is though . It seems like the motor shuts off when it is fully open or fully closed . I called an electric supply house , and the guy said it probably has a special switch inside the motor to shut it off when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great about this board ! People who actually KNOW how to do things HELP others - and take their time to do so ! It 's fantastic .... <p> Regarding your question of whether the motor can be connected to power constantly .... I had a similar situation with my homemade " rotocam " where I used a transformer and 2 relays . I burned out a transformer even though it did n't seem to have a problem with constant power . Now , I am not sure that was the problem , so I replaced the transformer for $8 and added an appliance module to the power so it only came on when it was required . I have n't had a problem in over a year . <p> I am certainly no wizard at this stuff , so I hope someone can pipe to definitely help . I have found a product called " liquid electrical tape " that is great as a replacement for the real tape . It allows you to cover a connection and be sure that it 's not going to " touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't come off that easy when you need to work on it again . <p> The cold will be fine ( and I think the heat will be too ) .

Though I would have used spade connectors to connect to the relay , soldering and taping should be fine . <p> 2 . The temperature will not hurt the relay , and the appliance module should be fine as well , though I have seen nothing published about temperature from X10 . <p> 3 . I would bet that the motor is an induction motor with two out-of-phase windings ( the red and black wires ) coupled with a capacitor ( phase shift for direction control ) and a separate limit switch on each lead . Simple and reliable . No problems leaving the power on it , as the appropriate limit switch will turn the motor off once it reaches it 's end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only other thing I was going to try to say is to use the Octal socket that should come with that relay ( I believe it has screw terminals so it would be easier to wire and mount ) . <p> I could n't get on to this board until today ( details on that saga HERE )

Just need to do the programming , but need to wait until I can afford the time to mess something up . I will continue to post updates . <p> I am using ST30 Sonesse 24 Volt hardwired . Each motor is homerun to a power supply on a DIN rail . The homeruns make programming each individual motor much easier . <p> Very quier , most of the noise is from the blinds rolling up/down , not the motor . <p> So far it is a bit limited , using the Virtual Node an " On " Command on the Virtural Node Binary moves the blind Up and an " Off " command down . There may be more advanced settings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't figured out a stop command which might be important . The Up and Down commands use the preset limits and the remote works as well . <p> The programing is a bit different than described in the ZRTSI instructions linked in another thread . I simply added the virtual node and then linked the node to the blind the same way you would add another remote . <p> The process is described in the video here : <p> I suspect that the Somfy TaHomA can do more that I have figured out with HS so far but I am pretty psyched with plain old Up and down . There is probably a HS plug in to be developed for the more advanced comtrol . <p> Time to add a button on HST and add the rest of the nodes for my other blinds . <p> Actually , I have shades not blinds . Only action is up/down to limits and preferred position in between . I will take a look at the Somfy interfaces for blinds with tilt and let you know if I think these might work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working ! So how do they work in homeseer and/or hstouch exactly ? Does each press of " on " raise the shade by a small amount and you have to repeatedly press the button to get the shade to move all the way up ? <p> I saw that in the video that for the Tahoma interface you could press and hold to move the shades . To implement that in HSTouch would probably require the zrtsi to have separate commands to start and stop moving that could be attached to on press and on release actions . In that video it also showed that the shade icon displayed a real time status for the window , so that leads me to hope that it is possible to do in homeseer as well . Though they did n't show it , the fact that the icon displays status also makes me hopeful that the zrtsi can report back when you adjust the shade through the shade 's remote instead of through your zwave system . <p> I really hope the Homeseer guys see this thread . Some official support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be wonderful . My system wo n't achieve maximum WAF until the windows are taken care of . Homeseer really needs a good window shade integration solution . <p> Good to hear you 've got things working ! So how do they work in homeseer and/or hstouch exactly ? Does each press of " on " raise the shade by a small amount and you have to repeatedly press the button to get the shade to move all the way up ? <p> Each child virtual binary swich device On moves the shade up to the preset upper limit and each device Down to the preset lower limit . This is perfect for HST , you just send a device On for up and a device Off for down . You do n't need to toggle back to Off , the ZRTSI just sends one command . It is the same as pressing the corresponding button on the hand held remote . Another nice feature , is that if the HomeSeer device is " On " , you should expect the shade to be Up ( unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below ) . <p> I have n't figured out how to send a " My Buttton " ( same as stop on hand held remote ) yet . This is useful to either move the blind to a favorite position or stop movement . I can live without it on HST for now . <p> The virtual node child multilevel switch does n't seem to anything yet and I wonder if this is used for variable tilt commands . I am also not sure what the Base node does . <p> I will associate some more shades to ZRTSI channels tonight and program the binary swith to HST . <p> Quote : <p> Though they did n't show it , the fact that the icon displays status also makes me hopeful that the zrtsi can report back when you adjust the shade through the shade 's remote instead of through your zwave system . <p> I was hoping for that as well , but I think that the ZRTSI is one-way .

Homeseer really needs a good window shade integration solution . <p> This would be a great HS hardware and plugin combo . I have the contact information for the Somfy technical rep , who expressed interest in my set-up . As is right now the shades go up and down nicely on HS or HST commands , which should have great WAF ! <p> The Modulis remote has a wheel on it that will adjust the tilt on the blinds to whatever opening you want . The Sonesse 30 RTS is compatible with that remote . <p> On the dry contact motor version , there are two modes for the remote to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be discrete Zwave commands for lift/tilt up/down as well as " my " button . <p> I bet the multilevel switch you see is for tilt control . What else would it be ? <p> I 've decided to go ahead and start this project . I have 6 wood blinds I 'd like to automate. 2 are on doors , so they will have to be battery operated and will tilt only . Somfy has an RTS version of this . The other 4 are on the wall so I will get the Sonesse 30 RTS motors , but I 'm going to just start with one room and see how it goes . I will be retrofitting the existing blinds and I think I can get the hard wired blinds done for around 350$ each . The Modulis remote and the ZRTSI are a gon na be more . I do n't  need the modular rails , etc , just power plugs in the attic . <p> I met with the SOMFY guys at CES this year ( Sad that HS was not there this year as the Somfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that their Z-wave binary ( Up/Down ) is only on and off . On blinds , you can tilt by using a digital motor that handles variables . Those variables respond like lights in the Somfy Zwave module . The module interprets dimming as a percentage of open where 100 is full open and 0 is closed . You can also set it up were 100 is full tilt up , 0 is full tilt down and 50 is open . <p> This is what we expected . The virtual child nodes have two switches . One is binary- On= Up , Off= Down . The second switch is multilevel 0-100 like a light dim . <p> I guess that there is n't a stop command for the Up/Down . That would be nice , but livable without it . <p> I have n't figured out what the " Bridge Node " does . I think that it may be for the TaHomA interface . It is a secondary Z Wave controller , so I wonder if I add it using Replicate Recieve if it would enable two way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Base node is as below , if someone can translate : <p> My project has completely stalled . I wanted to retrofit my blinds to add the motors for automation , but my gutter rails are 1 3/4 " x 2 1/4 " . According to the Somfy documents I need to have the 2 1/4 " x 2 1/4 " rails to fit the motors appropriately . I thought great , no problem , I 'll just order some of these gutter rails and be good to go . NO CIGAR . One must be licensed to sell these gutters and licensed to buy them as well . I struck out on the internet and locally . I was told I had to buy all new blinds . All this over a small U-shaped piece of steel ... ridiculous . <p> I can do the battery operated motors , though . They can be used with the smaller rails . And I 'm thinking of trying to squeeze the motors into the existing smaller rails . They would stick out at the top , but I have window coverings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . <p> i added channel 2 node and got same thing ... so what am i missing ? i can control the shades up/down manually from the Setup button on the ZRTSI so i know i did that right just cant get it set up in HS ...

@@98239497 @2439497/ <p> Following a previous thread . While increasing my skills on HS3 script ( I think about a year ago ) , I was struggling with memory leaks which overcame all my attempts to obtain a stable solid system let 's say 2 weeks ( my longest holliday ) without being necessary to return to HS3 server management ( I think its better now with last beta 's ) . In my quest to memory leaks , garbage collector , the release of the objects , ... I found that the problem was related to the behavior of the . NET environment in HS3 . At this point came the idea of ? ? keeping HS3 to its native work , event management , and other technological ZWave links , ... and transfer scripts to a more reliable engine . Since I had grown Javascript in my pages , I started working with nodejs . At that time , the HS3 guys released a gold coin aka JSON API . Bingo ! The last piece of the puzzle was a front-end server to cope securely with the World Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are chased at random or by systematic hunting . This front-end server would of course serve HS3 and nodejs applications . In the following messages , I will describe the general scheme and the centerpiece of the configuration of nginx which is a file named " nginx.conf " <p> Remember , I am not involved in computers , or not even working in the sector . All this is stuf without government guarantee , its all your responsibility to put your system down if you make some attempts , even after my example as tips . This is not advise this is experience , the one stuff that do not transfer between people . I am sure my system is not perfect , hides holes , thus enhanceme " nt and criticism are very welcome . <p> And last I get no responsabilities for headache you catch reading my english . <p> Stateof the art : today I am running fine with a front end NGINX server , serving HS3 , JSON HS3 API , my own express server api . Basic auth is fully implemented , as for SSL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an external certificate provider ... <p> My server is a W10 system on a cheap laptop . A few watts consumption , an included battery , access with microsoft distant connexion . Node js , Nginx at their last versions . Coming with nodejs and Nginx you get fancy addons like PM2 that I use for processes management , monitoring , relaunch of faulty process , easy logging of server errors ... And tons of scripts to help , on the central bank of the system called NPM , and much more for people who get time . I lack ! <p> First came the Wild WAN First funnel is the router which allows only ports 80 and 443 only 2 ports remain open to my fixed ip 80 443 ports are transfered to nginx server by port management in the router . Second funnel is in first block of code from nginx . conf which rewrites http to https 443 only remains .

I use Jon00s Quick page builder ( with the ASP option as it uses much less RAM ) . If I set it up as as the loading page , then it is displayed without problems . <p> Very well written post .

Would you confirm that you are running scripts within node.js outside of NGINX ? <p> Hi Kerat As soon as you can build a running server you can proxy it with nginx . Could be Python , Ruby on rails and nowadays of course node js . <p> Here after , code for a node js server on port 1000 , which answers for several metrics in parallel with HS3 . My lib for file and error management is lacking , this is to give a glance of easy scripting <p> Of course you can embed HS3 and nodejs through Json hs3 api calls . At this time all my csv files are built with nodejs ( json calling HS3 ) and no longer HS3 . net , no more memory trouble and system is stable . Node js is easy to debug . I am using pm2 for app management . <p> Hi folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . 2 questions for those more knowledgeable on Nginx config than I am : <p> 1 . Are you able to pass the original source IP to HS3 so that it knows whether to authenticate or not ? All my efforts seem to pass the proxy address to HS3 so it thinks all request come from the local network and does not try to authenticate . <p> 2 . Could this be run on on a different server ? I see the " root C : ... " setting , which obviously would need to be different if nginx was running elsewhere ? <p> I know that in HAproxy for PFsense the options exist for IP pass through , but I still have n't worked it out yet either . <p> Edit : in my settings there is an option for " forward for " which appears to indicate that it adjusts the header to load the endpoint 's IP address .

While ( by code ) neutral and ground serve two different functions , they are bonded together at one point , usually at the breaker panel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential . Neutrals and grounds are never switched or controlled by breakers . <p> Yep , that 's just what the meter said . <p> Since ground and neutral end up being the same thing in the long run , does that mean the Insteon commands could be seen on the ground ? <p> Actually , I might be operating on a wrong assumption . Is the neutral required for Insteon messaging and control ? <p> I have not used Insteon , but it is a dual mesh system . It combines power line and RF transmissions . The power line component is 131.65khz on one of the high legs . Some systems can employ phase bridging to get the carrier on both legs . In the absence of power line communication , an Insteon device will use RF as a backup - in the absence of RF the device will use power line communication . I would imagine that the communication would work fine without a neutral , but that would depend on how the phase coupler works or if one is used as well as the RF environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more robust than X10 , so it should work just fine . <p> Most of my Insteon devices are around 10 years old and do n't have the radio feature which was added later . The 4030A devices that I have do not have the radio network . I have added a few newer switches which have the dual band feature . I used to need phase couplers but since installing the dual band devices I find that they are no longer needed . The comm stats did improve after installing the newer switches . <p> I 'm happy to report that the 4030 is working well controlling the water heater . <p> On the input from the main box it has two 10g 120v legs and a ground . The hot water heater has two 10g 120v legs and a ground screw . <p> I connected the input L1 and L2 to the 4030 . Then the water heater L1 to the 4030 L1 NC on the 4030 and the L2 to the L2 NC . I then connected the ground wire to one of the neutrals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either Normally Open ( NC ) or Normally Closed ( NC ) . I wanted NC . <p> The 4030 light was on when the circuit was brought back online . Good . Then I metered the input legs on the 4030 . Both at about 126v . Good . Then metered the output legs on the 4030 . Both at about 125V . Good . The output legs were expected to be ON since I used the NC terminals . Then went to the plugin and added the 4030 device . Worked first time . Reset the comm stats on all devices and ran a comm test on all . Heater looks OK . Changed the status graphics . ( OFF now says ON ) Turned the 4030 off via the web interface . Metered the output legs and they are now @ 0v . Good . <p> The added the water heater to my HSTouch app so I can see status and turn it off and on . Got to think a bit more before adding events based on overall house status ( ie. OFF when AWAY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other 4030 I have for my water well pump . I expect it to work the same .

@@98239506 @2439506/ <p> I 'm trying to figure out the best way to turn a device " on " using a script . I had thought that setting the DeviceValue to 100 would be the best way until I read the following in the scripting documentation : <p> " for example , an X-10 device may have an " On " value of 100 , but a Z-Wave device is " On " at values 99 ( dimmable device ) or 255 ( non-dimmable ) . " <p> I also see that the " ExecX10 " type functions are no longer supported . This is what I had used in HS2 to turn devices on . I 'd like my script to be able to turn on both X10 and Z-Wave devices , preferrably without needing to know ahead of time which type of device it is ... <p> Have I missed a simple function to do this ? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated . <p> Chrisgo - I had read through the CAPI stuff in the scripting manual and was hoping to avoid it . Looks like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thread . I will have to take the time to incorporate that CAPI logic into my scripts . <p> It looks like with increased functionality comes increased complexity . <p> Hopefully everyone creating controllable devices will use " On " , " Off " , and " Dim XX% " for the CAPIControl.Label when appropriate ... <p> Thanks to the pointer above to the sample CAPI scripts by bdickhaus , I was able to muddle through and " blink " an outside light which is what I did in HS2 as an indicator when I armed or disarmed the security system from the car . <p> I 'm just converting from hs2 to hs3 and working on some scripts . I have a script that turns on a virtual indicator ( so I know its running ) and the code looked like this : hs.ExecX10 ( " A2 " , " On " , 0 ) . Apparently that no longer works . What do I put in its place ? <p> Thank you sparkman , it worked . Could I trouble you for an explanation of the parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? <p> Since the help file is a bit cryptic for CAPIGetSingleControl command and no examples are shown , here 's a bit of an explanation based on how I understand it . The command will return the proper CAPI command to be executed by the CAPIControlHandler command . The parameters are to find the matching value for the device . <p> 1 . dvRef : The device 's reference i 'd . Pass it as an integer . 2 . SingleRangeEntry : If the value you are looking for is not in a range , then set this to True . If it is in a range , such as a dim value , set it to False . 3 . Label : This is a string that contains the value you are looking for . Examples are " on " , " off " , " 50 " , etc. 4 . ExactCase : Set this to True to only find the CAPI command that matches the exact case of the label provided . So if the value is " On " but you have the label parameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , then it wo n't return the command . I usually leave this as False . 5 . Contains : Set this to True if the label provided only has the partial value and set it to False if it matches exactly . Be careful with this one , especially with ranges . As an example if the label parameter you provide is " 10 " , and Contains is set to True , then it could return the command for " 100 " rather than ' " 10 " . Therefore for ranges , it 's best to provide the complete label parameter and set this to False . <p> For help determining how to code CAPI functions ( or any device related script functions ) , I 've developed a simple utility that displays a lot of info about the selected HS3 Device , including the available CAPI commands , and generates the script code to access these functions , placing the code on the clipboard so you can paste it into your code .

My personal view is that Sigma 's commercial goals may outweigh consumer friendliness . <p> Unless they changed the rules , a manufacturer is allowed to purchase a number of SOC 's and use them to create a number of test devices which do n't need to be certified .

@@98239517 @2439517/ <p> I have &gt;100 nodes in HS3 Plus running on Win7 Ultimate , SP1 , 64 bit and will keep using HS3 .

I thought the home i 'd ( or network i 'd ) was tied to the z-wave device during inclusion . So , for example , if you included a node on hs , you would n't be able to include it to the vera controller . <p> Wow I never thought I would see a thread like this . I left vera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edge , plus at two houses ) and have never been happier . <p> I would be really curious to see what you think will get better or worse when moving . <p> First the Vera stock Geofence does n't work worth beans . You need the android app " Vera Proximity " to do good geofencing on an android . I currently use tasker and autolocation here on HS . Being able to chaning polling intervals ( save battery ) when you further or closer to home is possible along with alot of other features that most stock apps do n't do . <p> Also the VERA app is just a list of unorganized data . Most use Imperihome for andriod and Homewave for ios for vera . I also use Imperihome with HS . <p> I 'm not sure about IP camera motion activation as I have always had Blueiris and have the same results with both VERA and HS . I do n't see anything different in either system on camera control .

I use tasker and tasker Autolocation apps on the phone to slow down polling when I get further from the fence and check more frequently as I get closer to the fence . ( fence is made in Autolocation , and Tasker does the logic ) I then flip on a virtual switch when I enter the fence and flip off when I leave . <p> I also use wifi to help this out . If i 'm connected to wifi ( i must not have left ) stop checking my location ( saves battery ) and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So If I leave home and wifi cuts off it check location sees I exit fence and flips off the virtual switch . Then as I get miles out from home start slowing the gps polling rate . <p> I then use Events based on the home or away virtual switch to send notifications and such on when all of use are not home . Or auto-lock everything when it says the last person has left . <p> There is other ways of making this work too , but that 's what I setup when I moved from vera to HS . I was doing something similer with " Vera Proximity " app before . It would also just flip a virtual switch in vera on or off . <p> I also have a Guest home virtual switch and an " Anyone Home " switch to make events easier . Guest home I manually use the HS touch or Imperihome app to turn it on if I have someone at the house that is n't a regular or have their phone setup for geofencing . I can kick that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't home and motion or doors were opening . I have that reset to off when I arrive home so I do n't forget and leave it on for days . <p> Anyways if you have ideas or need help getting something working I 'm sure everyone will jump in with different solutions until you find one that fits your needs . <p> Thanks for the virtual geofencing tip . I have a new electronic deadbolt lock that will be just as easy to either type in the code on the lock or open my HS Touch App and use the door open button instead of saying that I am HOME and let some events do the work . I was interested in just walking close to home and let the door unlock but I also learned that the Vera geofence min radius is 100 meters and that is ridiculousness . My android phone GPS can tell where in my house I am at and it would be cool to exploit that to do stuff . <p> Thanks for the virtual geofencing tip .

My android phone GPS can tell where in my house I am at and it would be cool to exploit that to do stuff . <p> I have two houses and one has a driveway gate that opens before I drive up . <p> Both houses if it 's night exterior lights ( not just low voltage lights ) come on before I drive up or get to the house . <p> Front door unlocks If I just got home in the last 3 min , I 'm still home and there is motion outside the door . <p> Both houses have outdoor cameras and if there is any motion in front yard , driveway or porch with no one home I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting alerts of myself walking up . So The door lock idea works for some basic things . The other problem with only a door lock is it does n't know who 's home how many are home or after 2 come in and one leaves it does n't know anyone is still home . <p> Without geofencing conditions are limited to just running an event . If you leave home but your wife is home and you want to lock the front door you ca n't base much of an event off that since the door lock scene does n't know if your just locking the door with someone else home or your the last to leave . This could be like in my case locking all the doors , alerting me if I left a door or window open after I 'm leaving , setting the house alarm , sending my roomba vaccum out to clean or many other tasks I have the house do when everyone leaves . <p> No one to geofencing limitations . Yes the vera app does n't allow much control and the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the greatest . High Accuracy uses Cell tower triangulation , Gps satellites and wifi . When you go inside the house your cell and GPS signal diminish and accuracy goes down . Depending on your house , location , phone and to many other factors its different for everyone but it goes down . Room to Room Geofencing is no good . Location around the house to small an it could also be no good . With a better app you have some features to try and help limit false alerts . Like in Tasker I can say that is current accuracy is above 5 meters then ignore the current location and recheck in 10 sec or something . This will try and help prevent false alerts if my phones reception drops . Tasker you can also use phones internal sensors to help prevent false by saying if the phones accelerometer or such shows the phones not moving ignore a fence exit . <p> But after all this geofences are made to be somewhat big like size of your house . To small and you 'll have problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geofences is polling or how often it checks . To often you drain battery to slow you cross the fence and it does n't know until 5 min later . This is where better apps allow more control to adjust when you want to be looking for the fence change and when you want to save battery . I want close to home super fast checking but as soon as I make it home stop everything until I leave then check again . Normal geofencing apps limit how you can do that . If you set fast close to home that 's great but it does n't know when you fully home and to stop and if it stops it does n't know when to start to check again to say you left home . Tasker allows wifi to help me with that . Others just poll every so many min even when I 'm at home asleep . And every few min also means that you can leave home and be far away before the house arms and locks itself . I wanted quicker but not while I 'm asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your in house knowing location would throw a wrench in my current plans and probley lead me to running high accuracy all night long just incase I needed it . Most days I 'm home from 6pm to 7am and that 's a long time of running high accuracy for battery drain . <p> 100 meters or 300 feet is some what high but when you get below that size you better have some other checks in place or you will get false alerts and that 's probley why they set it that big . Basic users now tying their alarm to it setting the fence to 25 meters , your phone bouncing you out and everything arms and while you walk around you trip it yourself . <p> I can say that my property sizes are somewhat decent size and I would have to look but I do n't think many if any of my fences are set smaller then 100 meters . That gives just enough time when I 'm driving up from the time the phone knows I crossed the line to the time it sends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the gate I 'm in the driveway . Also If I do it to close to home my pohone picks up wifi and there is a brief 10 sec hand off from cell to wifi that my phone has no internet and fails to send the http . So I do like to have this happen before I 'm in wifi range and the ping sensor will back all this up ( flip the virtual switch ) if I get connected to wifi and it still does n't know that I 'm home . <p> @integlikewhoa , any chance you can post some of your tasker configuration for doing the GeoFence w/autolocation ?

Most are 4.54.2 and above ( Cooper/Eaton ) . My dimmers are 4.55 ( firmware updated them but I had real issues that were fixed that the switches did n't have ) .

In fact there is one device which is really close and no obstacles and routes in an insane way . Anyway , one of these devices is located below a dimmer that already gets a direct connection and keeps redefining its own route through other equipment when direct should be fine . In fact , I set the route , test it by changing the light color and the route is still there . Some time later it has another wack route in there . Now this happens a lot and I would like it to be static so I set it and it stays and only when there is a true outage that it trys another route . My power is stable so that is not an issue . This happens to devices all over the house with a very open floor plan ( 4500sqft. approximately ) . Something is wrong and I am not sure what it is.

@@98239521 @2439521/ <p> The Problem Automating lighting in a small room using Z-Wave is fairly easy and can be done by associating the Z-Wave motion sensor directly with the Z-Wave light switch , and then configuring the motion timeout command to turn the light off after an interval of your choice . Alternately ( and for less money ) , you can purchase non-Z-Wave wall switches with motion sensors built into them at your local home improvement store . These sensor/switches are often installed in bathrooms . <p> However , automating lighting in larger areas usually requires the use of multiple motion sensors for best coverage . In these situations , it is no longer desirable to associate the sensors directly with the switch as this will generate multiple " on " and " off " commands from each sensor as people move about the area . You 'll need to use HomeSeer to manage this ! <p> Logic : <p> Turn light on when motion is sensed by any motion sensor <p> Turn light off when no motion has been sensed by any motion sensor for interval of your choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room lights on directly .

Event #2 provides the necessary buffer by only sending a Z-Wave " On " command when the virtual device CHANGES and becomes On . <p> IF motion 1 has been no motion for at least 10 minutes AND IF motion 2 has been no motion for at least 10 minutes AND IF the light is on THEN turn the light off <p> I have a bunch of events like this . <p> Did you see the note in red at the bottom of my post ? The problem with your first event is that you 're generating useless Z-Wave traffic ( noise ) by sending On commands to devices that are already on . The problem with the second event is this : If your light switches do n't support instant status and were turned on manually ... and HomeSeer was not updated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You 're right about the Z-Wave traffic . I have an AND IF light is off for all such events . Forgot to put it in .

So ... while my solution is a bit more complicated to set up , it should work with better precision . <p> Note also that if you 're using Jasco switches , we can only support quasi-instant status for those switches that are directly within range of your Z-NET . If routing is involved , instant status wo n't work . <p> I do mine with a pair of events and a delayed device action to turn them off , coupled with short ( 60 second ) motion timeout on the multi-sensors . <p> It will send an ON command to a light that is already ON , but I am really not worried about Z-Wave traffic any more . Each motion detector is already generating Z-Wave traffic every time it changes state , so one more to the switch is of little concern . It will also send an OFF command to the switch even if it has already been turned OFF locally , but so will Mark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turned off locally . <p> Mine also has other events that let me enable and disable motion controlled lighting from the local switch . <p> The bottom line is that Mark has illustrated one way to do it , S-F another and I have presented a third . None is measurably " better " than the other , they just illustrate that there are often many different ways to accomplish the same goal . <p> Again , same problem with the first event even with the IF statement . If the switch was turned OFF manually but HomeSeer thought it was ON , the first event would n't fire until the the device was updated .

If routing is involved , instant status wo n't work . <p> Glad you 're happy with your Z-NET ! ! ! <p> Yes butt ... <p> Your event structure would be subject to the same problem . Your first event wo n't have any effect on the light until the Master Motion Device is set to OFF . <p> If you walk out of the room , turning the light off , then walk back in you would enter a dark room . Yours would have to wait for the timer to elapse , set the master device back to OFF , readying it to trigger event 2 again . You could add a 4th event that would reset the timer and master device if the light was set to OFF , hopefully it is not a device that fails to send instant status <p> The same problem exists with any motion event that waits for the Motion Timeout of the sensors . In my pair of events that window is only the 60 seconds I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slitting hairs here .

@@98239523 @2439523/ <p> I am in the Houston Texas area and am looking to get an idea of how long you guys in other very hot areas are seeing your AC 's run on a daily basis ? My electric bill shows what I consider to be a very large amount of power usage , and the only thing I can think of is that my AC 's are running more than they used too to account for it . They are really the only device in the house that draws a significant amount of power , and changing the thermostats on them over the winter is really the only thing that has changed since last summer . <p> I live in south MS and it is unbearably hot lately . The outside temperature has been in the upper nineties for a few weeks now . During the day , the setpoint is higher , but on weekends it 's set a couple of degrees lower . I monitor both HVAC 's runtimes and show a graph on my quickview page : <p> We 've noticed what appears to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ' ve not seen this since the 90 's . I have two sets of air filters which I 've cleaning / swapping out about once every 2-3 weeks and outside I 've been spraying off any vegetation sticking near the air compressor . Inside I just alway keep the fan running 24/7 . It seems to even out the temperatures some . The cycling from what I can tell is a bit less looking at the Omnistat 2 . Typically during the summer months the electrical usage is higher ( along with the monthly bills ) . Not gon na say more other than my wife likes the temperature of the MB and Family where its at ... 67 F ... which is a bit too cool for me and " comfortable " for her . My neigbor is currently having an issue and I think its more related to the design of his AC ; as his home is about the same age as mine . He 's having problems keeping a 78 F even temperature in his home ; and his AC is working just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper 90 's . Today its overcast a bit so we are having a cool spell . With even these temps she wants the MB / Family room fan on 24/7 . In the previous home in the midwest ; I had two zones ( one for the second floor and one for the first ) ; typically the main floor stayed cooler . We had a finished basement and mostly used that for watching television during the evening as it remained the coolest in the home . <p> Since no one is home during the day , I set the main thermostat at around 80 F and I get about 2-4 hours runtime between 8h00 am and 5 pm . <p> Before I get home at night , I lower the setting a bit ( 75 F ) and I estimate that the AC runs for roughly 6-8 hours between 5 pm and 8 am the next day when the night is cool and much longer if the night is warm . <p> OK , so these kinds of answers are the reason I asked the question . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our streak of +100 degree temps with little cloud cover/rain and higher humidity seems reasonable . <p> My concern is my downstairs AC seems to be showing itself as running about 15 hours a day , which makes me think something is wrong . At 7 AM the temp bumps from 74 to 79 and then the AC usually does not run at all untill noon . This means that during the remaining 19 hours of the day I am using this AC 15 of those hours . <p> Here is another interesting tidbit , the graphs in BLstat show both of my stats hovering between 10 and 12 hours of usage per day , whereas the built in usage meter on the downstairs stat shows 15 hours per day instead . The upstairs stat shows about what BLstat shows . Hmm ... <p> With new construction insulation R values are very high now ; such that you do n't require the same energy for cooling or heating than years ago . Think I 've seen R values now into the 40 's where I think standards used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of an electronic air cleaner . I have three sets that I rotate of aluminum and charcoal filters ; and use the dishwasher to wash them ( wife hates me doing that ) . I also run the electronic cleaner thru the dishwasher about once every couple of months . <p> I have a friend that has an HVAC company and did her computer " stuff " ; I learned enough from her to be self sufficient . If I need hardware she just orders it from a supplier and I just pick the parts up using her company name ; as if I was working for her . If I have a major issue ; its a phone conference and my jumpering parts of the motherboard of the furnace to do some diagnostics . The LED codes on the boards help a lot these days though . <p> So far I 've had good luck with my furnace . In the old house just replaced the blower motor once in 30 years on one of the two furnace/AC 's that I had ( zoned ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just basic stuff ; clogged filters and outside debris around the compressor . <p> Another thing I did though was manage CRAC unit installations for some computer server room expansion projects . Got to some really interesting details about flow and air pressure type stuff . These were multiple 20 ton units . We had three and an old 16 ton in the last computer server room . Not very large though , very cold . <p> I would be happy with a 20 ton ac unit for the house ; but not with the electric bill ... <p> I noticed my 5 year old 4 ton AC unit had run non-stop for 6 hours the other night ( which is very unusual ) . I checked the temperature at the primary register and found it was 60 degrees ! I called for service and they determined my AC unit was .75 lbs low of Puron . The temperature at the primary register is now about 15 degrees colder . My AC on time now is about 10-15 minutes each run ( instead of 6 hours ) <p> Definitely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the load on the AC so high , having the system running at peak efficiency is likely to save you money in the long run . <p> Obviously , the duty cycle of any system will depend on its capacity versus the load . If your AC is under sized it will run more of the time . Duct work is also a critical issue . If the ducting is too small , cold air may not be able to reach the rooms that need it , so they will continue to call for more even if the compressor is turning out more than enough . <p> Personally and relating to commercial endeavors I noticed that 's its all about the ductwork ( tin cutting and really the most difficult part of an installation ) mostly and having a right sized and efficiently running AC for the square footage of the home . <p> 8 years ago when " attempting " to build a new home ; I added a zoned system ( as I had one in the old home ) , high R-Values for insulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do zoned systems a certain way ( sans the ducting that I requested ) . Eventually after about 8 months and into constuction ; the endeavor was cancelled and I got my deposit back for the home . <p> In FL I asked about using Drivit finish for the stucco exterior ( on cement ) and the contractor did n't know what that was . <p> Here is another interesting tidbit , the graphs in BLstat show both of my stats hovering between 10 and 12 hours of usage per day , whereas the built in usage meter on the downstairs stat shows 15 hours per day instead . The upstairs stat shows about what BLstat shows . Hmm ... <p> How new is the house ? <p> Maybe you 've got an issue like I did ... <p> We found that the kitchen was getting " too " warm in summer and " too " cold in winter . After getting the builder to come back to repair what I claimed was a hole in the wall ... they said they would look into it . The guy took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found a hole 1/2 " x1/2 " ... I was happy there WAS a hole and went inside . <p> A while later , I went out to see that the repair guy had taken off almost 6 more feet of siding . I asked why . He told me he cut another 2-3 " of wrap to proper seal the hole , and saw that when they built that wall , two boards were warped ... and I had a triangle-hole in my kitchen wall ... it was 3-4 " on the bottom and went up about 5 ' along the wall . <p> So ... I was not crazy . I never caught it on the original build , since the INSTANT the walls went up , they wrapped the house ... I did not see the outside . I did make them fix the outside walls , at least what I could see from the inside . I asked what about other walls " they must be ok , you did not notice anything " . <p> yeah ... <p> I did bring someone in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between inside and out , you can really see problem areas . I did not notice any further issues , and my heating bill was quite a bit less than last year ( which was still Energy Star levels ... even with the hole ) . The furnace the first year we lived there , ran almost every 15 min. on the dot . This last year , it only did that when the TEMP outside was below my design temp . We were more on the 30-60min. heating cycle last year . <p> --Dan <p> Tasker , to a person who does Homeautomation ... is like walking up to a Crack Treatment facility with a truck full of 3lb bags of crack .

@@98239524 @2439524/ <p> Let me look into it this weekend . I do n't want to answer off the top of my head without looking at the code . Thanks for confirming which thermostat you have . There are slight differences between them so knowing helps . <p> The thermostat it 's set to use Celsius and does display in celsius. the HS is configured in Celsius but your plugin is displays in F. I ca n't find where can I change it in your plugin ? <p> if i go into the config in the plugin and under insteon flags i change from F to C i get this : Invalid Insteon Flags . Must be HEX numeric format ( 0-F ) Conversion from string " C " to type ' Byte ' is not valid . <p> Specific to the 2441ZTH ( Smarthome Wireless ) the plugin relies on the thermostat to tell it which units are being used so that it can correctly interpret the reply from the polling commands used at startup . I found a bug in the interpretation of the flag byte so Celsius vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an updated 3.0.0.9 . Please give that a try . It was interesting to see , that the initial startup showed as F due to this bug but if I waited for an actual temp change , it would come across correctly in Celsius . Different command/broadcast that did n't need the F vs C interpretation . <p> You 'll also want to adjust your bounds to more appropriate settings for Celsius . For the 2441ZTH I use 35 to 97 F as testing showed those were the maximum values supported by the thermostat itself . That translates roughly into 2 to 36 for Celsius . <p> On your other points - the Insteon flags value has nothing to do with F vs C. That has to do with the number of hops the command can take represented by a hex value . Generally you do n't want to mess with that although I need to look at why it did n't accept C as that is a valid hex value . <p> No , I do n't specifically pay attention to the HomeSeer configured F vs . C. Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rely on the values from the thermostats themselves . This is similar to how the Sage plugin also worked as I recall . <p> Please be sure to turn on debug logging then stop and restart the plugin from the Managed-&gt;Plugins page . Let the plugin run for a while so temp updates are made , in addition to the plugin startup polling . Then take a look in C : Program Files ( x86 ) HomeSeer **33;3066;TOOLONG and upload the log file . <p> On the config page , thermostats tab , can you also let me know what it says in the Name column , specifically the values in the square brackets <p> The config page info tells me that it has n't figured out what device category and firmware your thermostat is yet . Without that it ca n't tell what type of thermostat it 's talking to . <p> ? ? ? , FFFFFFFF , 2 <p> The snip of your log below shows the commands to determine devcat and firmware were sent out ( the 2 transmit commands ) but I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ? Did you leave it running for a while ? <p> Here 's an example from my dev system where I 've started up the v3.0.0.9 plugin talking to one wireless 2441ZTH . You can see once the response from the first two commands comes back that it then polls for additional information and that 's where the Celsius bug came up . I still have this 2441ZTH in Celsius mode <p> The fan mode on the thermostat is either Auto or On . In auto mode the HVAC hardware ( not virtual in plug-in ) turns on the fan when call for cool/heat is made but the Fan mode in the plug-in remains showing as Auto . Unfortunately I 'm guessing this does n't give you the control you 'd want to turn a ceiling fan on/off along with the thermostat . <p> A better option is probably to track the device value of the HVAC Mode in the plug-in . When the thermostat calls for either cool or heat , the HVAC Mode device will change state to that value . You could setup a HomeSeer event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control a FanLinc like you suggest . <p> Back to your wireless 2441ZTH . Are you using this on batteries ? Assuming so , there is a known behavior with this specific thermostat that it " goes to sleep " and will not accept commands from external sources . It does this to conserve battery power . There 's a thread under the Sage plugin for HS2 where both Tom and I have posted . If possible , using an external power source is the best option , especially during initial setup . What I have found to be the best is one of the small Apple 5V wall transformer plugs for an iPhone ( genuine Apple , not sure about knock offs ) and a USB cable . Cut the opposite end off the USB cable and you have the +/- connections to use for your 5V external power source for the thermostat . The 2441ZTH seems very picky about the input voltage , too high or low and you can get a very jumpy ( rapid changing ) humidity reading or if using the external sensor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are using batteries , Tom would push the time/sensor button every few seconds to keep the 2441ZTH awake . This is critically important during the initial link setup where the plugin has to link the PLM and the 2441ZTH together for status reporting . <p> I 'm guessing you are using this on batteries and that likely explains why in the log we see the send Insteon commands but no reply and the config page shows ? ? ? , FFFFFFFF , instead of valid values . <p> Good deal . I would suggest first you go into the web config page thermostats tab , then press the time/sensor on the 2441ZTH and then press the update links button on the config page . Every few seconds press that time/sensor to keep the 2441ZTH awake . <p> I highly recommend the external power source option , at least for initial setup , but for long term use also . <p> For longer term use on batteries , you will be able to get values from the thermostat as it detects changes in temp/humidity and any manual setpoint changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes or any other commands to it due to this sleep mode . I wish there was a way to turn it off but there is n't . Using the external power option is the only way to make this thermostat fully functional .

Where should I look ? <p> Thanks for your time : -/ <p> Scott . <p> Right now you probably have you Vivint system as the Master controller for your ZWave network . You would therefore need to include your Aeon ZWave stick into your Vivint ZWave network as a secondary controller . <p> I 'm not familiar with Vivint , but I imagine you would have to go through the following two steps : 1 ) Put your Vivint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal ( do this from the Tools/Manage ZWave Controller page ) . This will include HS in the overall ZWave network <p> 2 ) Do a Replicate Send from Vivint and a corresponding Replicate Receive from HS ( same page ) . This will let HS know about the devices in the Vivint network and they shoudl start appearing in HS . <p> Using HomeSeers " Include " function within the interface menu for the Z-Stick would n't evoke *ANY* response on the Vivint panel . BUT ... if I went to " add device " on the Vivint panel , and tried a " Replicate Receive " within HS , the panel suddenly saw it and added it as a STATICCONTROLLER ! ! ! <p> so ... once again , I am making progress . <p> I 'm not sold on HS/HSPRO yet ... but I have 20 some days left to try and figure this all out ! <p> I think I managed to get the Z-Stick included !

Hi , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WD zwave stick i used to use . the aeon labs stick has never been used before and i was not using it with HS2. is there any way to copie the zwave data to my WD smartstick so i can test that for a bit instead ? thanks Dave <p> Sorry -- I should have put that in an attachment . I want to add that the only way to get the system working again is a complete powerdown and cold start . Rebooting the HomeTroller SE alone does not fix the problem . <p> The Aeon sticks have been shipping with the Static Library , which just means that there is no way to copy the network information EXCEPT through replication . You can use replication , but it will involve a 3rd handheld device which can act like a primary controller . Do you have any handheld Z-Wave controllers ? I am using a Z-Stick and a WD in my testing , so I do not believe that the issue is with one of those . From the time you were using HS2 to when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your operating system or hardware ? This seems to be an issue with the USB port , but since your HS3 is kinda useless right now anyway , you can try the beta version of the Z-Wave plug-in in the updater ( it is in the last category at the bottom of the list of plug-ins ) . That one may have other issues as it is beta , but the timeout parameter for some of the interfaces was increased a little , so perhaps it will help . Is your hardware struggling ? What kind of CPU and RAM do you have , and are you running other applications alongside HomeSeer ? <p> The only thing running is HS3 on the HomeTroller SE . I 'll try the beta . If that does n't work then it 's back to HS2 until this gets resolved . The stick stops responding every couple days until I unplug and replug it , and that 's a home security risk with my system . <p> Rick , Same issues over here , Sometimes my stick hangs and do not respond anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the server ( asus eepc 1505p ) stick was also used in hs2 , no issues there .. I also sometimes see the timouts . Regards Bart <p> There is no programming of the interface that goes on , so I suspect it is due to something else . Performance was a problem in the 3.0.0.64 through 3.0.0.98 versions of the Z-Wave plug-in , so you may want to go to the 3.0.0.100 version that was just posted in the BETA section of the updater ( at the bottom of the list ) and see if that helps this . <p> ( In reply to raptordemon from comment #13 ) &gt; but i have been using ztool with hs3 and it works . &gt; &gt; what should i be using ? OK , Z-Tool is standalone more than being associated with HS2 or HS3 , but still this is a bug ticket about an interface disconnecting on the Z-Wave plug-in for HS3 , and you hijacked the bug report with your Z-Tool question . You can use HS3 and the Z-Wave plug-in to make your controller a primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or make the GE primary ( Send Network Information to Another Controller and make it Primary ) . If you are still having an issue with Z-Tool , visit helpdesk.homeseer.com and open a ticket there . <p> Hi Rick , with respect , my ztool question is related to the bug as i am trying to debug the interface by swapping it with a different one to see if we have the same result . as mentioned i was using a wd smartstick on hs2 and moved to the Aeon with hs3. it looks like updating to 3.0.0.102 may have helped as the log is clear of disconnect errors after the upgrade . <p> spoke too soon : Mar-20 3:47:18 PM Z-Wave Warning A Z-Wave interface on the system is being restarted - some Z-Wave signals could be missed .

@@98239531 @2439531/ <p> Figured out a complex but reliable way to control LIFX bulbs , without having to wait 15 minutes for IFTTT to update to a DropBox change . Since my system already uses an android device ( with a Kinect ) to listen to certain commands and pass them along via Tasker , I added the Tasker plugin to Homeseer so it can send commands back . And then the free LIFX plugins that are available can actually trigger the lighting ( Homeseer sends a command as a toast notification containing specific code words to the android device , Tasker responds to the notification and changes the bulb ) . So no more waiting , and no more grabbing my phone or tablet to change the lighting . 
@@98239532 @2439532/ <p> I was planning to pick up one of the Insteon Hubs for my interface as I plan to SLOWLY move from X-10 lighting to Insteon . I can get a V2 Version of the hub alone ( 2244-222 ) for $39.99 , or the starter kit with either a V1 ( 2244-234 ) or V2 ( 2244-224 ) for $100 . Since the kit comes with 2 lamp modules , I think that 's the better buy . <p> But , other that they V1 being square , and the V2 being rectangular , is there any other differences ? Have firmware upgrades for the V1 made it almost the same as a V2 ? Or possibly the V1 is better maybe since it could have better parts/build quality ? Or the V2 left some things out in the change ? Just wondering . Or am I splitting hairs ? <p> rschildt , I do not think the v2 hub works with X10 . If you are wanting the Hub to also operate your X10 devices , then you should get the 2242-222 Hub , as the 2245-222 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2413U for USB or the 2413S for serial Powerlink modem . Both support X10 . <p> Well I picked up what I thought was the older V1 starter kit . I got the 2244-234 kit which included a square hub 2245-222 . After opening it up , the hub is actually the V2 version . It does seem to work for controlling my X-10 stuff as well as the 2 Insteon lamp modules included in the kit . <p> I am intrigued since I just got the 2245-222 and it can not find anything , even the switchlink I/O module that is insteon . I was on hold for over an hour only to be told that it did not work with x10 and I needed more insteon modules because there was probably line interference . In the instructions it says something about pressing the set button to where it is blinking and setting the find devices on the smartphone . I did that with my insteon iolink and nothing . How did you do it with your X-10 devices ? <p> I am intrigued since I just got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switchlink I/O module that is insteon . I was on hold for over an hour only to be told that it did not work with x10 and I needed more insteon modules because there was probably line interference . In the instructions it says something about pressing the set button to where it is blinking and setting the find devices on the smartphone . I did that with my insteon iolink and nothing . How did you do it with your X-10 devices ? <p> Well what started out pretty easy quickly became quite quirky . I started out using the Android app on my tablet to originally add just one of my X10 devices to see if the hub worked with X10 , before I went too far in case I needed to return it . Low and behold , when I went to add a new device in the Android app , there was an icon to add an X10 device . I added my Great Room Lights ( 5 X-10 Lamp/Appliance modules ) . I added them fine , and tested with the Android app , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included Insteon lamp modules out and figured I 'd add them using Mark 's plug-in ( using the 30 day demo ) , but even with adding the 6 digit I 'd 's , the plug-in could n't find the modules in Homeseer . So then I tried to add them in the Android app , and after pressing the set button to make the module light flash , the hub and the modules still did n't find each other ( only about 10 feet apart in the basement right by the fuse box ) . While trying to add them I noticed I needed to press the set button a couple of times after it started flashing to get the hub and the modules to " sync " , then they started to talk to each other and the Android app found them . So at this point I re-tried to add them into Mark 's plug-in , and now they were found . So I guess if your Insteon devices show up in the app , then the Homeseer plug-in can find them as well . <p> So now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-10 codes ( A-1 ) working , I assumed everything was going to be okay . Well after seeing your problems posted , I grabbed my iPhone ( not the Android tablet ) , and checked if the devices were there and still worked . They did , so I decided to try and add another of my X-10 device codes ( A-15 for my outdoor lights ) . However I could n't find the same icon that showed up in the Android app on my tablet to add any more X-10 devices . So I went back into the Android app on the tablet , and the icon to add X-10 devices was still there . Added the outdoor lights , and tested in the Android App , and they work . Fire up the iPhone app , and after updating / polling all devices show up and work . <p> Quite quirky , but working . I do n't plan to use the Android or iPhone apps in the long run . I want to use Mark 's plug-in for both the Insteon and X-10 devices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated using the app and his plug-in at the same time is not supported , but for initial setup of the V2 hub , it may be required from what my experience has been so far . <p> I 'll be setting up everything in Homeseer this week . Getting the X-10 devices in the Android/iOS app is really not needed to have them work in Homeseer . I just wanted them to be in there as a backup way to control if I can . <p> Thanks ! So what you 're saying is that the ability to add X10 devices is found in the android app but not the ios or wp8 app . So the x10 functionality exists in the hub , it is just hidden ! I 'd end up using marks plugin if this works for initial setup.Thanks ! <p> So I did what you said and my android device did have the ability to add X10 devices through the hub app . However , whenever I turn them on or off nothing happens . I can go to my ipad and see the devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the hub 2 , but it has to be picked up by a controller on the line . When you tested it did you have your CM11a plugged in ? Thanks , TBG

So just put something in the required fields and click save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a little customization of the " sample utterances " section which I will go into below . <p> You now can say things like : tell home seer to turn on second floor hallway light tell home seer to turn second floor hallway light off tell home seer to dim first floor den light to 30 tell home seer to dim first floor den light to 10 percent tell home seer to run my event <p> For device names you can say just the name of the device , or room and device , or the whole " floor room device " name . If you have multiple devices with the same names and you just say the name it will run that command for all of them . <p> On success Alexa just responds " done " . In the echo app you will see a card with the command . <p> Note on sample utterances : The sample utterances serve as generic examples that the Echo will try to match up whatever you say to . They also serve as specific examples of exact phrases that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to add anything , it helps . <p> You can start with just the basics listed in the example and speak some typical commands to the Echo and see how it responds . For any event or device names it seems to have trouble with , add utterances for them . If you have an event name that overlaps with the device grammar , such as " turn on all lights " , definitely enter that as a specific utterance otherwise it will parse it out as a device named " all lights " . <p> You can also add your own grammar . In my example to run an event I have a few variations . I can say " tell home seer to run event name " or " tell home seer to run event event name " or just " tell home seer to event name " . You can add your own if you want to say something other than " run " . <p> So , if for example you have an event name " Movie Time " , and you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " make it movie Time " . You can add the following : RunEventIntent Run Movie TimeEventName RunEventIntent Make it Movie TimeEventName <p> Or say you have an event " Set Alarm " and you do n't need an extra verb in your phrase you can make it just " Set Alarm " . RunEventIntent Set AlarmEventName <p> Edits : 8/15/15(again) Added mappings for both event and device names . Meaning you can set aliases for your devices and events . You can use this if you want to have a different spoken name for your device or event , or if you want to have multiple names for it . <p> 8/15/15 Made the function easily customizable . Now by changing a few more variable at the top you can control the various messages that the echo responds with on . For fun I also added the ability to set multiple success messages one of which will be picked at random . A fix was made to account for devices with unsettable children , like a light switch that has an energy useage child . Those should no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For anyone with the issue where the command works , but it says " allfailed " you can fix that as well with a small edit . <p> 7/15/15 Now you can ask your Echo for the status of devices ! Update your lambda function and intent schema from the updated code , and some the " DeviceStatusIntent " sample utterances based on the examples . There is one catch that can be fixed with a find a replace in the HS3 REST API . Please see this post in the thread about the rest API . <p> 7/14/15 Updated Lambda function to improve the error responses and remove a lot of debug logging . The Echo will re-prompt if it ca n't find the event or device it heard . Remember that you do n't need to say the " tell home seer to " on re-prompts . <p> I realized that the rest API set device by name function will take not only the full " floor room name " function but any combination and if what you say matches multiple devices , it will set them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , name all the overhead lights " lights " in each room you can control them all by just saying " lights " or specific ones by just room and light " garage lights " , " office lights " etc . This might also be bad if it causes devices you did n't intend to activate like maybe a garage door . So take care naming your devices . <p> To answer a question from the thread : Yes , you can just leave this running indefinitely in developer mode and never publish it . <p> This is a simple proxy that translates commands given to the Amazon Echo to calls to the HS3 REST API . It allows you to run events or control devices by saying things like : <p> Alexa , tell home seer to turn off second floor hallway light Alexa , tell home seer to run event goodnight <p> Security note : This works by making a http request to your homeseer machine that originates on Amazon 's servers . Your HS3 system must be accessible to the web via http . So for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ https this wo n't work until I can figure out how to get a Lambda function to do https to a server with a self signed cert . For you non-technical people , if you can log in to your home seer web interface from outside of home without having to type " https " ( the " s " being the important part ) at the start , you are good to go . <p> If you do not have it as part of your HS3 system already , you will need to install the HS3 REST API script . It can be found through this forum post this thread . Just follow the links there to download the script and drop in it your homeseer install . <p> First we must set up a function on Amazon 's Lambda service that will serve as the translator between the Echo and your home seer system . Go to https : **32;3238;TOOLONG . You will be prompted to sign in . Use your Amazon login . It must be the same one that your echo is registered under . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is registration form you will need to fill out . <p> Once signed in you should be on a page that had the heading " Lambda &gt; Functions " . From here : 1 . Click the big blue " Create a New Lambda Function " button . 2 . On the next screen click the box marked " **29;3272;TOOLONG " 3 . For the step 2 screen , it should already say " alexa skills kit " so just click next . 4 . Now you are on the " configure function " screen . Give you function a name . Any name . For example " HS3Proxy " . 5 . In the " Code " box , replace everything in there with the code below under Lambda Function . 6 . Then in the code box replace the placeholders for username , password , and URL with what you use to log in to your homeseer system over the web ( i.e. the external URL , not internal ip ) . 7 . Click the drop down box marked " Role " and select " lambdabasicexecution " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review screen select " enable " and then click the " create function " button . <p> You now have a Lambda function ! On the right hand side of the screen you should see something like " ARN - LONG ... This is your function 's I 'd that we 'll need in a moment . Select and copy it . <p> Now we need to set up an Alexa Skill to use this function . To get to where we do that first log into the Amazon Developer LONG ... You 'll be prompted to log in again . As above use the Amazon login associated with your Echo and you might need to fill in some extra registration info . <p> Once into the console do the following . 1 . In the bar at the top click " Apps and Services " . 2 . In the bar that appears below that , click " Alexa " 3 . Click " Add a new skill " and you 'll get to a form with four fields 4 .

" or " Ask name to ... " . So if you call it " home seer " to and say " tell home seer to run goodnight " or " tell home seer to dim second floor hallway light to 30 percent " . You can have the phrase be " the house " for " tell the house to ... " or if you want a sci-fi feel , put in " HAL " or " Computer " . It 's up to you and you can change it at any time . 6 .

@@98239535 @2439535/ <p> I am trying to trigger an event if a device changes , but only if it was changed manually ( as in someone physically hit the light switch , or manually changed the value in home seer , and not triggered via some HS3 event ) . <p> Basically i 'm trying to control lights via motion sensor , and I created a virtual device for occupancy light status , that is either set to auto , or override . When events are triggered based on motion , the lights will only turn on / off if the status is set to auto . If it is set to override , then those automatic events will not run . I will then have a timer when the status gets set to override , that will change it back to auto after a certain period of time . <p> I really hope there is an easier way to accomplish this . I have been using vera ( micasaverde ) for years , and someone over there created a wonderful plugin called " smart switch " . You basically told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , and it did all the rest for you . I 'm hoping to achieve something similar here .

I am using the GE jasco dimmer switches and on/off switches . <p> Somehow the creator of the plugin for micasaverde was able to do it regardless of the switch used , but I have no clue what was done . Maybe there is a temporary tag that tells the event which changes auto/override to ignore the following commands . <p> Thanks ! <p> EDIT <p> Oh i think i see what you are asking .

A binary ( on-off ) switch that is on , is still " set " if you press the ON paddle . For a device to " change " its value needs to become something different . Both of these triggers require that a device is set or changed to a specific value . <p> " this device had a value that just changed " vs " this device just had its value set or changed " <p> Just like above the key is in the word " set " .

When the switch is off the HUE bulbs are no longer powered and as a result they are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating that the switch will be turned off , you have to turn the switch back on in order to send commands to the HUE bulbs . Since there is likely a delay after they are powered up before they will accept commands , the solution would likely give a short blip of light as everything gets synchronized . Also understand that the event would be triggered if you sent a device control to the switch from HomeSeer as well as if you controlled it locally . The event would look something like this : <p> IF the light switch changes and becomes OFF <p> THEN set light switch to ON <p> THEN Wait 1 second ( fine tune this delay to only be as long as needed for the HUE devices to accept commands after power is restored ) <p> THEN set the HUE light(s) to OFF <p> THEN set the light switch to OFF <p> You would need to set the event to " Can not Re-run for " at least a second or two longer than the wait time in the event . 
@@98239536 @2439536/ <p> OK , so switch lincs require a neutral . In two of my switch boxes I have no neutral . Just the load wire comming in and out . So , I connected the switchlinc neutral to the copper ground wire . It works just fine . <p> The copper grounds and the neutrals are both terminated to the same bus in my breaker box , so it does not seem like a bad idea ? Seems like a hack , but how dangerous is it really ? <p> Chadg , It is quite dangerous . If the ground wire were disconnected somewhere between the switch and the breaker panel ( like when you are installing another switch or perhaps a poor connection or other fault ) all of the grounded outlet boxes and terminals on the switch side will be connected to the hot side through the switch . Yes , the ground and common wires are terminated in the same place in the panel , but they have entirely different functions . The common wire is a current carrier and is insulated . The ground wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a failure . <p> So , it will work , but you have set the stage for a potentially serious accident . <p> I completely agree - using the ground is a VERY BAD idea and completely unsafe . But this brings up another question that applies to those of us moving to , say , Insteon and having certain types of 3-way switches . I do n't mean to hijack this thread , but I think most everyone would agree on not using the ground as a neutral . So ... <p> IF : One needs a neutral at each switch ( as is the case with all Insteon devices currently in production ) AND Conversion of existing 3-way circuits results in the switch that carries the load ( i.e. , the " second " switch ) having a white-color " hot " wire and a black-color return ( a fairly common situation ) AND the traveler wire ( often red-color ) is now essentially doing nothing <p> THEN <p> Why could n't the red traveler wire ( which runs directly from switch box one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It seems logical to me , but I fried a new Insteon switch doing it , and ca n't figure out how . I ended up using an RX PLC X10 switch , one of the few that requires no neutral . I would rather go with Insteon on this circuit , however ... <p> Humm ... I see what you mean . Anyone have an easy way to correct this then ? Looks like power goes to the light then just one two pair wire down to my switch . Do I have to run a new three wire from the light to my switch to get the neutral ? Or can I run a wire from the socket below it , even though it is on a different circuit ? <p> As for using the red traveler for a neutral , I do n't see why not . You should label it as such though . Why I blew out your switch does not make sense . Are you sure you hooked the other end up to a neutral ? <p> Chadq , Using the neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say someone trips the breaker on the second circuit , then opens the circuit to install a device . Once again , since the switch has active components , the HOT from the light circuit will energize the neutral lead through the switch . You or the unsuspecting electrician will be at risk . It is also against any electrical code . Your best bet is to run a new three wire cable from the light switch . <p> I know it stinks to have to go to so much trouble , but shortcuts can put you and your family at risk , and that just is n't worth it . <p> Humm ... I see what you mean . Anyone have an easy way to correct this then ? Looks like power goes to the light then just one two pair wire down to my switch .

Why I blew out your switch does not make sense . Are you sure you hooked the other end up to a neutral ? <p> Well , there 's always the chance that I goofed on something , but I 'm normally very careful and I remember triple checking it with the meter . This one really has me stumped . I 've done a lot or wiring over the years and I 've never run into something that seems so simple yet just does n't  ' seem to work . And I completely agree on the labeling - it 's a pet peeve of mine when people do n't do it . The hot wire coming into the second switch in question was NOT labeled as such , and gave me a fit for a minute or two because of it . There 's some electrician out there that needs a thumping ! <p> I 'm so glad I stumbled upon this thread since I have like four of these switches and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wiring is " old " - no neutrals in the switch boxes . But before I go buying the switches that do n't need a neutral ... <p> In several cases there is a switch with no neutral sharing a junction box with an outlet that DOES have a neutral . However , the outlet and switch are on different circuits . It would seem to me that , like bonding the ground and neutral , using the neutral from another circuit would work but be a bad idea . However , I can not seem to figure why this would cause a problem . <p> The only problem I can see is if I trip the breaker for the switch circuit in order to do some wiring , I 'd have to know to trip the other as well . But in the case of multiple circuits in one junction box , I 'd never work in the box without all breakers off anyway . <p> From what I have learned when I installed a sub panel , you can not bond neutral and ground in more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main panel . <p> Erm , you can not bond neutral , also know as return or the black wire , to groud or earth in any place . <p> The neutral can carry the full mains voltage , the point of the earth or ground is the should an appliance go faulty it will cause it to blow the fuse . The other miner afterthought about having an earth is so you do n't electricute yourself . where should we send flowers . <p> NEVER USE THE EARTH/GROUND AS A RETURN it do n't pay off in the end Mate . <p> Then the other wire to the light(s) connect to the white Neutral wire from the wall . <p> The way I remember it is , if you open up a wall or outlet box , the bare , white , or green wires are safe . All others can carry electricity and can hurt you . Provided that the outlet was wired right in the first place . You can buy a plugn device at most home improvement stores that will tell you if your wiring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have 3 wires , Black , White , and Bare , you should be able to use the Insteon switches . Most newer homes in my area ( like since the 70 's ) have been wired with Romex . Most have this wiring as standard in my area . Your mileage may vary . <p> A computer 's attention span is as long as it 's powercord . <p> Just another note . If there are ground fault devices in either circuit , they will probably trip if you use the wrong wires . What could be worse , maybe they would n't when they should . Another thing to consider is electrical code . Failure to comply cauld cause problems collecting insurance in the event of a resulting fire . <p> And even another situation , if the two circuits are on different phases in the panel which results in 220 volt differential between the two hot leads , or possably the hot and neutral in a box along the miswired circuit . <p> I understand the temptation , and I have done some pretty dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back correct it as soon as possable . I 'm in no way suggesting you do the same ( small print fast talking disclaimer ) <p> Chiba , I do n't know about the code , but I believe you are OK with this electrically . I 'm not licensed to provide this advice so you are on you own . <p> n essence what you have done is run two hot lines with a single neutral . You will derate your two breakers so that either will trip on 50% of the expected load so not to overload the neutral . The next owner will be upset with the breakers tripping and will install a full-rated breaker unknowing that your wiring is not up to snuff on the two circuits . <p> If you started with 12Gauge/20Amp then you will need to change your breaker to 10Amp . Of course if you are using near 10 Amps on either of these circuits then you will be tripping breakers . <p> What makes more sense is to carry both the hot and neutral rather than just the neutral from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) share the neutral with two hot wires if the two hot circuits are on different phases . I had an inspector out and he caught me on this . Fortunately that was not what he was there to inspect , so he just mentioned it to me and let it go ( after I promised to fix it ) . <p> This is actually not an uncommon situation . In my situation I was running 12/3 with ground - a red hot , a black hot , a shared white return , and ground . I had both hot wires terminating into 20 amp breakers on the same phase -- potentially subjecting the return to 40 amps of current . I guess derating the breakers would reduce the risk , but it would still violate the code . <p> Michael , You are correct in the fact that it will work . The issue is the safety of anyone working on the electrical system and potential hazards . If you ignore the electrical code you introduce conditions that may put people at risk of shock or even death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the new person ( maybe your wifes new boyfriend ? ) could be seriously injured by the unpredictable design . ( maybe you would approve of that ) However , The main concern is that the built in safety of GFI circuits , etc could be compromised . I would hate to hear that one of your children was injured due to a failure of a GFI circuit , say in the bathroom . The final lesson here is , do n't fool around with the safety of your family for something as unimportant as home automation . <p> I know , I sound like I am preaching here , but i am fully aware of the consequences of ignoring published safety standards , and it is n't worth the consequences . <p> Well , it all depends . Most electricians only run what need to be run . So a basic switch does n't  require a Neutral so to a switchbox that is not a junction point , you very well might not get a neutral . My brother had a house built last year and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell his electrician to run neutrals to every box in the house . They did do this and it was really pennies to do .

The device is about 3 years old and is operating the Insteon devices controlled by my PRO100 . I can get to my user interface but all Insteon devices are non-responsive . Suggestions ?

@@98239541 @2439541/ <p> Hi , I am trying to setup a low battery level notification event in HS3 . I can think of 2 ways to do this ( 1 ) trigger the event when a battery hits low battery and send an email or ( 2 ) trigger the event each day at a specified time and only send an email if there is a low battery . I am trying to do more or less the second unless there is a way to do both ( I want to be reminded as to not to forget to change the battery ) . Attached is an example of what I setup in a HS3 event . <p> I am looking for any advice as well as examples of what others have done to track low batteries . <p> If you could post screen prints of your event examples that would be very appreciated as it will let me and others see exactly how you are setting up your events in HS3 . <p> Also , I never used a " Battery Low Warning " device status before . Any comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly ignorance , I suppose , but I do something similar in HS2 with a script . I call an event once a day to check batteries on all devices and set a virtual device to On if one of the batteries is low . <p> Given the added abilities of HS3 events , it makes sense to use an event , but I do n't understand why you are entering the battery state conditions as group conditions rather than event conditions . It 's also not clear how using OR 'd conditions interacts with the requirement that all group conditions must be true . <p> Given the added abilities of HS3 events , it makes sense to use an event , but I do n't understand why you are entering the battery state conditions as group conditions rather than event conditions . <p> I tried that but it did n't seem possible in HS3 to do a if it is 8:00 am AND a bunch of OR statements within the event itself . I seemed to achieve the same thing by putting all the OR 's in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Uncle Michael <p> It 's also not clear how using OR 'd conditions interacts with the requirement that all group conditions must be true . <p> Agreed . Lack of documentation on HS3 leaves one doing a bunch of trial and error to reverse engineer what HS3 is doing behinds the scene . I know it slows down programming , etc. and takes extra resources but it would be great if there was a good description of every selectable trigger , action , etc. and how it worked but that does not exist at this point . So I am hoping to get some other people 's learnings . <p> It would seem to me the logic is flawed , The event would be true at 8:00AM , but it would also be true if all of the group conditions are true . I also do n't know how it is evaluated if all of the Group Conditions consist of OR IF conditions , but that also seems problematic . I would think that for the event to trigger at 8:00AM if any of the battery levels are low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHOULD be : <p> IF the time is at 8:00:00AM <p> AND IF The group Conditions Are All TRUE <p> The events that I use are below and I have confirmed that they work . I have one for my Multi-sensors and another for my thermostats . <p> Did n't notice that thanks for pointing out that I used an or statement . I think probably what happened is HS3 seems to be a little finicky when you try to pick OR or AND . if you do n't check you sometimes get the wrong setting . <p> I will correct and update the image I posted when I get chance . Thanks again . <p> If I 'm right in the way I 've set things up , however , it seems using the group conditions might be a little more efficient than setting up the 8 AM condition for every or statement ... assuming it works the same in either set up . <p> ... If I 'm right in the way I 've set things up , however , it seems using the group conditions might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition for every or statement ... assuming it works the same in either set up . <p> If it works , it is one less step for each device and a little more ' efficient ' to create , but it is no more or less efficient in execution as the event engine would still have to evaluate the trigger and a condition on each device . In my case it would also require creating two groups , a thermostat group and a multi-sensor group . That is the main problem I have with group actions - the fragmentation of my current group arrangement . <p> Another thought .

The manually triggered event would still have to have stacked OR IF/AND IF groups like mine above because the low battery is not a trigger , but a condition . It would have to be : <p> I still have had some instances where conditions in a manually triggered event are ignored , despite having checked the box " Run Only If Other Event Conditions are TRUE " , though I have not gone back and tried since updating to 3.0.0.96 . <p> You could also have an event that was based upon an IF the device changes to Battery Low Warning , OR IF the second device changes and becomes Battery Low Warning , etc. , but that event would only trigger and run once as each battery in the event changed to that state .

There may be some benefit to having multiple " groups " because then you can at least narrow down which type of device triggered the alert . Would be great if this could somehow be identified in the notification email . At the very least I am looking into substitution variables . Not sure if this is available in HS3 but it was in HS2 although I did n't use them ever . The idea would be to list the device value for every one of the devices in the condition as part of the email ... kind of like a battery status report in the email . That way I can see which device needs batteries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected conditions in the manually triggered event . The manually triggered event would still have to have stacked OR IF/AND IF groups like mine above because the low battery is not a trigger , but a condition . <p> That 's a bummer ! Of all the things HST could have fixed in HS3 , grouped OR 'd conditions linked by an AND seemed like a obvious one . <p> You might as well make each test its own event , and have the event action of each one call a manual event that sends the email . <p> I use the attached script to track battery levels once they drop to a specific level . Just change the battLevel constant to whatever clip-level you wish , and create an event for each battery child that you wish to monitor . The event should provide the battery child 's full address ( as specified in the Address column on the Homeseer home page ) in the event 's Parameter field . <p> The email sent will contain specific device information and current battery level for the given device so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes that the battery level change generates a notification on it 's own of course .... thx . <p> It is going to take a while for people to realize just how powerful the event engine is in HS3 , how different the logic is from HS2 and to break the habit some have of writing a script when an event would do . It would be better if the help file did n't make the statement : " Events use simple " IF " " THEN " " ELSE " logic " , because there is no " ELSE " , either implicit or explicit . Once one gets a clear understanding of a trigger vs a condition and that an " OR IF " begins a fresh trigger/condition group that has no relationship to to prior triggers/conditions in the event , it all becomes a lot easier . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by Uncle Michael <p> That was my impression as well , but this seems to be incredibly difficult with events . We must be missing something . Can you help explain how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the granularity of a specific message referencing the specific device , I just needed to be notified if a battery was low . I can then filter on device manager to look at all of the batteries . The two events I posted screenshots of in a post above , took all of 60 seconds to create . They function reliably and as expected just using events . I only broke it into two groups , one for thermostats and the other for multi-sensors . I built the first event , then used the copy function to create the second , then edited the title , devices and Pushover message . I read thoughts that an event like that is not as " elegant " as a script , but to me it is really easy to look at a stacked IF/AND - OR IF/AND statements in an event and see exactly what is going to happen . I realize that having to repeat the trigger *feels* a little redundant , but it is also very flexible . It allows different triggers and/or conditions resulting in the same actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger eight times , each with different conditions . . <p> If I wanted or needed the granularity of a customized Pushover message for every device it would take very little time to build a single event , triggered at a time , conditioned by a single device and sending a Pushover message specifying that specific device . Then use the copy event icon , edit the title , the device and the body of the Pushover message . Repeating this for thirteen different devices and creating thirteen additional events . While some would call this inelegant or cluttered , it actually makes it very easy to look at events and see what is intended in their design . With careful thought to event grouping and naming HS3 presents a well organized view of events . <p> I guess I just do n't understand some of the aversion to using events . Some of the people who became script centric under HS2 would rather write five lines of script than to see five lines of conditions or a couple of different events . There are certainly some things that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to use a script for anything that can be accomplished within a normally structured event . <p> Actually , I figured out how to do this in HS3 . This is working nicely ... the email now contains the status of the devices . Attached is a screen print of the email part of the event . Replace ADDRESS with the device address in the HS3 device management page . <p> For what it is worth , I totally agree that if you can , use events . The added grouping organization of events has made events much more organized and having the full event on one page ( trigger , action , etc. ) also aids in setting these up . The only things I wish you could do in 1 event are : IF , THEN , ELSE , somehow capture which trigger/condition actually triggered the actions to fire and use this variable within the action . <p> Actually , I figured out how to do this in HS3 .

The discussions in this thread gave me several ideas of what I would like to do and I changed everything yesterday after giving it some thought . I decided granularity would n't be very hard to achieve with events . It took less than thirty minutes to to create a new group dedicated to battery reminders . I use Pushover rather than email for my alerts and the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that constraint I still split my monthly status alerts into two groups - thermostats and multi-sensors . Building this on a laptop would take a little more time , but the real estate on my desktop made it a breeze . I opened device manager , filtered on batteries in one browser window . I opened events in another . I created a new group for battery warnings and an event for a single device battery alert . Then it was copy event , cut and paste changes , repeat for sixteen additional events . Then I created my two monthly reminders . Below it shown the structure of the events . I put the letter " A " in front of the battery group status events just for the purpose of sorting . <p> Click on image to launch a larger version . <p> When people talk about events and how tedious and complicated they are and how much more elegant a script is I just do n't understand . Certainly a script and variables could reduce the event count , but once I was done , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status on all 17 devices . If I add a device , then I add an event . Events work reliably , building an event is easy , copy and paste saves a lot of typing . Below is a screenshot of the events . Sure , it is a lot of events , but once they are done , the group is collapsed and I do n't look at them again unless I need to change them . I get a monthly status alert at 9:00am the first Saturday of every month and a specific device low battery warning at 8:00am each day . <p> Actually , I figured out how to do this in HS3 .

Apologies , I did n't have time to respond from the office further today . I use Pushover like Randy , but also drive all sensors off one event . <p> I 'm fairly new to HS , but thought I 'd weigh in on the events/script conversation relating to battery status . I debated doing this via events only or with a script and ultimately , I went with a script for this solution . The deciding factor was that I wanted a hands off way of managing battery levels . I did n't want to have to touch or update any events if I removed or added devices in the future . Since I also support other HomeSeer systems , having a script that would work on any install seemed the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single virtual device that always reflected the device name and battery value of the device with the lowest battery . I also wanted to be alerted when this battery level dropped too low . <p> After reading through various threads and the scripting documentation , I came up with the following script that does all of the above . In order to get this working , you 'll need to do the following : <p> Copy the script to the HS scripts folder <p> Create a virtual device like in the attachments . The name is not important . <p> Create a timed event that runs the script every day . You need to pass in the reference I 'd of the virtual device you created in step 2 . <p> Create an event that is triggered when the virtual device drops below a certain value and alerts/emails you . This can be an email , pushover , change the color of a lightbulb , etc . <p> That 's it . I now have one event that triggers the script every morning . Whenever the script runs , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual device created with the level and name of the device with the lowest battery and then another event that does something based upon the value of this virtual device .

A domain name and a real signed SSL cert is very cheap these days . You could get both for $10-15 total with Namecheap or similar services . I currently have four webserver certs setup within my own domain : HomeSeer , Plex , Zoneminder , and my router . It takes a little head scratching the first time through . After that Easy Peasy . Install nginx . SFTP 3-4 config files from your last installation . Generate Certificate Signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to localhost in my setup . <p> In addition I set up my machines with pre-shared key authentication for SSH . I use SecPanel for dual pane file transfers between machines - it provides easy access to SFTP using Filezilla . My home workstation has one powerful desktop machine driving three displays . I can SSL to my web pages or SSH/SFTP to all my computers with a few keystrokes . I have n't opened any of this up to the internet as of yet but it works beautifully within my home network , which includes subnets . <p> All said and done I could have remote access with secure protocols but it would still require opening some ports in my firewall . I could add a VPN but that requires allowing VPN passthrough in your router , still opening ports but more judiciously . Or I can continue what I have been doing - utilizing Myhomeseer , which does n't require opening any ports . It does require trusting HomeSeer and maintaining a phone home link from my machine to Myhomeseer . Which way is most secure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details on your setup . Unfortunately I only understood like half of that haha ... I wish the maker lab near me would host a networking seminar or something , too much of this is over my head right now . <p> I got it all working locally , but when I switch to force remote connection it can not connect .

I 'll probably have to stick with HSTouch and see if I can make it look at least a little better with the designer . <p> Actually I was wrong there , there are a few free Dynamic DNS services out there , so will look into that

I have HS3 on windows 10 machine with running speaker.exe <p> What version of the Sonos plugin are you running ?

Check your log file , do you see errors when the Sonos PI starts-up ? Just restart HS and check your log for errors or see if the PI created the missing directories after the restart . <p> Indeed after re-start new folder appeared . Most importantly in task scheduler I included homeseer but not speaker.exe I thought it would start automatically with homeseer and apparently that is not case ..

I do have a 3rd event that warns me 10 seconds before the timer expires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My normal motion event was the first screenshot below . The problem with that event is that the lights would always turn off after five minutes . My motion sensors will report NO motion only after two minutes of not detecting motion .

In this configuration with my motion sensors the only way the lights would stay on is if there was no motion for two minutes , followed by motion within the next three minutes . <p> Because of the characteristics of my motion detectors , I needed to split the event . That is shown in the second event . The Motion event turns the light on . I do n't worry about " banging " the switch with ON commands since my motion detectors will only report a change of state at two minutes or more . <p> The single event uses a virtual device " Lighting Controls Exercise Motion Control " which allows me to disable motion control for those lights . It also uses " nighttime " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair use a couple of virtual devices . It uses the same virtual device for enabling motion control for that light . I replaced " nighttime " with another virtual device " Lighting Controls Interior Motion Dusk-Dawn " . I found we needed lights a little before sunset and a little after sunrise in most of the interior rooms , so this virtual device is turned on at thirty minutes before sunset and off at 30 minutes after sunrise with a pair of events . Another advantage of the split event is that the OFF command is not dependent on the time of day , so it will act as a lighting " watchdog " in case someone turns the light on outside of the Dusk-Dawn time constraints and turn it off five minutes after they leave the room . Actually the lights will turn off sevenminutes after someone leaves the room - two minutes for the multi-sensor to report " no motion " plus five minutes for the delayed off .

@@98239550 @2439550/ <p> We get calls daily from folks looking to integrate their Z-Wave enabled alarm systems with HomeSeer . Usually , these calls are prompted by users who 've outgrown the basic automation capabilities of those systems and they 're looking features they do n't currently have . These calls are not fun to field as we usually end up being the bearer of bad news . The problem , in a nutshell , is that these systems are not built with integration in mind . <p> In a typical HomeSeer system , HomeSeer functions as the primary controller for the home and the alarm system is a sub-system . HomeSeer controls the lighting , thermostats ( and other sub-systems ) and also can monitor and control the alarm panel .

Take some time to evaluate the automation functions of the system and be sure it meets your present and future needs . If you 're not sure about that , we recommend looking at HomeSeer compatible alarm systems instead ( DSC PowerSeries , Ademco Vista , Elk M1 ) . <p> For those who 've already invested in a Z-Wave alarm system but now wish to integrate with HomeSeer , all is not lost . In many cases , it 's possible to replace the main alarm panel with a HomeSeer compatible system and use a " translator " module ( like those by Resolution Products ) to allow the new panel to work with existing sensors . <p> This is great example where " dumb " security system is better .

I ca n't tell what order they are sorted in . <p> Fair comment , as I did not use Location2 ( small house ) I never gave it a thought but it is something I should have catered for . I have gone for a test to see if Location2 is nothing first because it is possible to have a Location2 string in the DB with the Location2 disabled in the settings page . If it is nothing then it just does ( Location1 ) ( Name ) , if not it is ( Location2 ) ( Location1 ) ( Name ) .

Go near your tablets to check out signals where they are physically placed . BTW typically wireless devices do not throttle their bandwidth ( IE : wireless cameras ) .

I have seen a weird thing a couple of weeks ago relating to HSTouch server . The clients could see HS3 Pro fine but did n't connect to HSTouch server ( V.68 ) . None of the wired and wireless clients connected to HSTouch server . Never saw that before . I restarted HSTouch server and all was well .

The wife 's laptop ( very low-end ASUS ) has known issues documented on various forums that is usually fixed with a reboot .

I would generally cut that in half for reliable real-world scenarios . <p> Note : I use a UAP-AC-Lite in a 1586 SQ FT ranch style house . I get great coverage through all of my next door neighbor 's houses/lots and great signal into my basement . <p> If you continue to run 2 APs make sure that they are 60 ' away from each other . then you will need to adjust transmit power in order to reduce the foot print of each such that they do n't completely overlap . <p> I personally think the out of the box W10 is way too chatty .

I 've performed multiple rescans and optimisations again no difference . <p> I 've studied the log in real time when triggering motion , all events occur within the same second motion is detected . The time in homeseer updates in 2 second intervals and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion zone but it is within a second the sensor lights up and the event log shows the time stamp of the events within a second accuracy I would say . <p> The weird thing for me is the bottom stairs motion sensor will always see me before the upstairs one as there is a slight offset wall ( where the sensor is ) before the stairs so when the upstairs light comes on before the bottom one it 's baffling as the event log shows different . This only happens on occasion but shows me there is a clear delay issue with the downstairs sensor . <p> All of my sensors are 1.07 firmware . Try the parameter 5 change to 2 and see if that does anything for you on those new sensors . <p> If you see a large lag between the time that you trip the sensor and the time the log reports it , and you definitely know that polling or routing are not the culprit , look for a rouge device . It does n't take but one device chattering to screw up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I find the sensor reports right away . But throws this error every time it trips and resets on both new sensors . " SetNewLevel ( BASIC ) Exception : Public member ' DeviceName ' on type ' Util ' not found . " <p> So I ran some logging and I find the sensor reports right away . But throws this error every time it trips and resets on both new sensors . " SetNewLevel ( BASIC ) Exception : Public member ' DeviceName ' on type ' Util ' not found . " <p> I wish I knew the answer to that . I stumbled across that when I noticed the long light on the sensor itself and realized it had to be attempting to send data so I went through the manual and decided to flip that parameter . <p> Here 's the odd thing - my sensors ran with P5=1 for over a year and until I went to 116 I never saw that issue . <p> I wish I knew the answer to that .

I concluded that something must be set up differently during the inclusion process than in earlier ZWave versions .

Last night was also the first time that I actually noticed a significant delay ( after the update ) . I did n't even think to pull logs to see what was going on at the time since it was late , or take note of the time , so I will watch it closer to see if there is any correlation . <p> I am still getting delays showing up here and there on my test event , but in the past week , this is the first time I actually noticed the delay . <p> I am still on .128 of the plugin , and I too am curious what is up with 129 and what was changed .

I believe that Nginx has a windows port . once setup you would open and forward port 443 to your server and set Nginx to listen on port 443 . The only other services and resources you would need are : 1 . A registered domain ( namecheap and google domains are cheap ) , 2 . A DDNS client Namecheap gives you one if you purchase a registered domain from them . Google Domains offers an integrated API that allows you to pickup a free client and configure to work with it . 3 . An SSL Certificate . Personally , you could try to setup a Let 's Encrypt Acme client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSL certificate down to $0 . Alternatively , you could purchase a signed SSL certificate ( namecheap uses komodo and they are a solid paid version that is pretty cheap ) . <p> I ca n't recommend PFSense enough . It is the batman utility belt of firewalls and it does all of it well . The PFSense user community is well developed and the package creators do a really great job of supporting their products . The forum is n't on tapatalk yet would be my only gripe. you can load it on just about any old PC you have laying around , install to network cards , and run through the initial setup . There is a little setup necessary but once it is up it works flawlessly . I have my reverse proxy , Let 's encrypt Acme client for SSL management and provisioning , Dynamic DNS client to keep my DDNS and CNAME subdomains up to date , and my VPN hosted on my PFsense firewall . <p> How are you implementing HS3 authentication using the RP ? Does n't HS3 see all connections as local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone using Tapatalk <p> HAproxy has two places that this can be done . The first is a setting ( forward for ) in the global settings that allows the system to overwrite the header with the end point 's IP address . The second is a setting named " transparent client IP " in the back end configuration for the HS3 server . This passes the client IP address in place of the firewall 's IP . <p> I found setting the " forwarded for " header has no effect in HomeSeer , it does n't read this header . <p> Using a " tranparent ip " setting would require the Homeseer box to use the reverse proxy as its default gateway making for some really complex routing and IP networking . <p> Agreed the forward for did n't seem to work for me . I have enabled the transparent client IP setting on my network and confirmed when I login from work the HS3 log and filter by web server events I see my work public IP address . I will have to check reverse proxy functionality while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this to work would be a separate DMZ subnet where all back end servers access non DMZ resources through the reverse proxy . <p> I found setting the " forwarded for " header has no effect in HomeSeer , it does n't read this header . <p> Using a " tranparent ip " setting would require the Homeseer box to use the reverse proxy as its default gateway making for some really complex routing and IP networking . <p> I have a handful of subdomains that I use for different back end resources . <p> I have a backend setup to access my HS3 server on port 80 using transparent client IP ( The backend is named : hs380-external ) . I was already using ACL rules on my front end to determine when the HTTPS request was for my HS3 subdomain . ( Ex : Name : hs3acl Expression : host starts with Value : homeseer <p> I then tied an action to the backend HS3 resource using an action ( ex : Action : use backend Condition : hs3acl Backend hs380-external <p> Let 's Encrypt does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNI request to determine which SSL cert to match on . If the request is for HS3 then I hand them the HS3 subdomain SSL Cert . <p> I did notice that with this setup my HAProxy system would work appropriately from the public Internet but would not work internally . <p> My local network is pretty locked down . Guest access is locked down to a separate VLAN and wifi and runs on a changing WPA2 key . The guest wifi network is only available during daylight hours , and there are ACL rules that block communication between the guest net and my local LANs . I do n't necessarily care to lockout internal clients using the anti-hack tool in HS3 . My workaround to get HAProxy to work with HS3 internally was to : 1 . copy the existing backend configuration for HS3 and deselect transparent client IP . I named this backend : hs380-internal. 2 . Add a new ACL in my port 443 front end that denotes my local intranet subnet ( ex : name : locallan , Expression : source IP matches IP or Alias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action above my external HS3 action . ( Ex : Action : use backend Condition ACL names : locallan hs3acl Backend : hs380-internal ) This action will capture internal network requests for my HS3 subdomain and forward them to the " hs380-internal " backend instead . <p> I duplicated the work around for both my internal subnets and found it to work well . Internal network logons to my HS3 environment appear to come from my router 's IP address and not from the actual client 's ip . Public Internet sourced logons display the public source IP address . <p> https is impossible to set up on your own system as you need a certifcate to use properly .

( Browser errors , port forwarding , SSL certs , etc . ) <p> That being said , I understand the concern of many of our core users . The next build of HS3 has a new " Labs " section in Setup where we can add things that we would only support on the forum . If SSL was added there , that solves the support issue and gets you the feature . The Labs section will allow us to roll out features without calling the entire build a " Beta " . <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by Moskus <p> The only legitimate reason I can think of is " it will take too much of our time to make a proper web server to HS " .

@@98239564 @2439564/ <p> Hi all - I have used Oregon sensors with this plugin for some time and all works perfectly but I have never been able to add Lightwave RF relays to the system . If I go into the RFXCOM output devices I ca n't find any Lightwave devices but have tried the 2 relay devices listed there ( as well as a bunch of others ) but when I put the relay into learning mode and turn the created device in HS3 to ' On ' it is n't recognised . I 've combed through the forums but ca n't find any guidance on this other than the RFXCOM user guide says that Lightwave RF devices are supported . I must be missing something obvious - can anyone advise please ? <p> Thank you for your reply but this is still not working . The AD protocol is already selected in the RFXtrx433 . There is no AD-RELAY device option shown in the output device list so I have tried with AD-Module but without success . I am assuming that when I add an output device I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these codes are then used later when adding a new device to HS3 but there is no direct correlation between the RFXCOM creation page and the HS device creation page so not really clear on this . I have read various guides relating this ( as well as forum postings ) but cant find an RFXCOM HS3 User guide ( I 'm running HS3 on a Raspberry ) . This worked perfectly on a Vera installation so I am quite sure that the core setup is valid and as I said it works fine with 4 Oregon sensors ( these were all immediately detected when I first set up ) . Any further ideas please ? <p> Appreciate your help but I am still confused by this . Apparently there was a newer version of this plug-in so I have updated my version and also located the user guide and read the section you refer to . The RFXCOM ADRELAY option now appears . The RFXCOM output device screen is not laid out the same as the user guide as the ' House Code ' and ' Device Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' Not used ' I assume that this does not matter . Once I have completed the fields that are present and selected done I go back to the HS Device Management page and select Device Status and RFXCOM . A new device is shown which HS seems to think is a window shutter ( Open/Close/Stop ) . If I put the LW device into learning mode and click on Open nothing happens . I had 3 of these devices working with the RFXtrx433E and a Vera controller but so far can only get HS3 to work with this plugin and Oregon sensors . Any more ideas please ? <p> You can use the same I 'd - Unit code as used in RFXmngr or VERA . Did you select the right transmitter ? What is displayed in the HS Log with Debug Level 2 for the Transmitters enabled on the RFXCOM - General config page ? <p> If it does not operate reset the LightwaveRF relay to remove all remotes and try again . <p> Finally tracked it down to the Lightwave Relay device itself . I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I have swapped it out for another LW relay and that works perfectly so I guess the relay I was testing is faulty . Pleased to have reached a solution and appreciate your patience and help . 
@@98239565 @2439565/ <p> I just got these in from China after waiting almost 3 months for them . Glad I ordered 4 as I set up one on a breadboard with a few LED 's , a relay and a PIR sensor to test inputs and outputs ... I easily set up the configuration within the plugin , programmed the NodeMCU ( this was probably the hardest part ) , and once that was done wrote a few dummy events to test inputs and outputs . The fact that you can plug in a device anywhere in range of your wifi network and have it control outputs or transmit the status of inputs for $4-5/ea ... absolutely insane ! <p> For example I have a MimoLite that cost nearly $80 in my shed on a solar/battery setup that controls a LED strip as well as has a DSC motion sensor as an input . That way I can have quality lighting in my shed when I need it ( Homeseer limits it to 30 minutes of use a day , so I do n't overly discharge the battery ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All for the low price of $80 + $15 for the motion sensor .

I was able to communicate to HS3 via the update Mqtt plugin , which is very nice . I was unable to test the communication to HS3 very extensively , because of issues with the Nodemcu .

The firmware would determine that it was connected , when it was not . Therefore , it would not try to reconnect and the " reconnect " coding in the firmware was useless . I have started writing my own program and I have the program initial try and connect . If it fails after 15 times , it sends a disconnect command , even though it is not connected . It then tries to reconnect . I repeats this process until it connects , usually during the second loop . I am now trying to finalize my sensor configurations . I hope it works . <p> I 've been seriously considering a Roomba . I 'm curious , why would you want to control it ? I thought it had a schedule it would follow .

I do n't need much else in terms of features , battery capacity , if it 's stuck etc ... I could care less about . I 'm using PHLocation and BLLAN for occupancy , once I get the DSC motions sensors up and tied to a mega then I can monitor the status of the door and if there is any motion in the house as well to toggle motion occupancy . That way if my phone goes dead and I enter the house after unlocking the door it 'll know that I 'm home . <p> This arduino plugin could take a bite into Roomba control quite easily .

Without a plugin or direct control you have no options on volume or switching the input back if someone changes it say for music . I would think for the few bucks you save it 's not worth it vs. sonos . <p> A wired Russound system with BLRussound / BLSpeech is the gold standard but way overkill just for announcements .

@@98239568 @2439568/ <p> I have a room that the wife is using as an office . It 's the longest run of the ductwork , and it faces west with two large windows , and it gets warm and stuffy in the afternoons . It 's a Lennox system , and does n't have any zone capabilities , and I also ca n't use any Zwave thermostats due to the proprietary digital communications between the thermostat and the units . I had a HVAC guy who poo-pood on putting a booster fan on this run . Of course his suggestion was to install inline dampers on the 10 runs and do a flow survey with an airflow meter and ' balance ' the system . That sounds like a few thousand dollars . I like my idea of installing an inline Fan and controlling it with Homeseer to be on when the room is occupied , and operating independent of the HVAC , and scavenging air from the other cooler rooms when the HVAC is off . His main complaint was that the fans are noisy . Well , maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on here installed an inline Fan ? What would be needed to install a variable speed Fan that could be controlled by Homeseer ? <p> I have a room like that and have installed two booster fans . ( There are two runs to the room . ) I 'd listen to your HVAC guy . <p> The booster fan will not be very effective if the duct that it 's in does not receive enough input air to allow the fan to increase air flow . Instead , the fan will just get very noisy from the turbulence it creates , and airflow could end up being unchanged or even impeded . <p> I had to go to some length to assure that my fans run only when there is sufficient air coming from the air handler . I have a two-zone system , and HS needs to know when only the one zone is calling , and then it has to wait for a couple of minutes for the main fan to get to full speed to be sure there is sufficient air supply to accommodate the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone calls for AC while the fans are on , HS has to shut them off or they get very noisy . It was not a simple task . <p> Does the room have its own air return duct ? If not , part of the problem could be getting air back to the air handler . <p> I also have a room like that and had installed one of those booster fans in the duct leading to it . It does n't run all the time , just when it 's cold mostly . I can manually turn it on when it 's hot too , to help with cooling - but generally not because I do find it somewhat noisy . For winter use , I have it turn on a couple of minutes after the furnace calls for heat , then turn off when the furnace ends it 's cycle . I have it tied to an event for my s-z-wave stat . <p> I would recommend having the HVAC tech balance the system . You can have a giant fan in a system but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't get to the appropriate air-flow or static pressure level . Leave this too long and you kill your furnace/AC system . <p> I had to go to some length to assure that my fans run only when there is sufficient air coming from the air handler . <p> It sounds like you had issues because you had two ducts feeding the room , and the two fans kinda fought each other . But , you would think the fans would n't have to be running full tilt to make good airflow , and I 'd want a variable speed unit . Why does the main unit have to be running at all ? Would n't the fans just suck air from the other rooms ? I would n't think the main unit would have dampers that close when the fan is n't running , but even if it did the booster would just scavenge air from the adjacent room that Y 's off from the main duct which this room stays cool because it is n't west facing . I just ca n't believe they have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Robert , How noisy is the booster ? What size is the unit ? What happens when the booster is on but the main unit is off ? Can you feel a breeze coming out of the vent ? For the record it 's hard to feel a breeze coming out of the vent in this room . <p> Kerat , I can understand running into issues if i shut off all the vents except this one room which would cause over-pressurization and stuff which would definitely cause issues . I do n't see a booster fan sucking air into this room as problematic . The returns are huge , so I do n't think the returns ( Plural ) is the issue . I think most of the problem is the thermostat is located where 75% of the air vents are located which is at the opposite side of the house from this room . And frankly , the duct work and insulation is immaculate in that attic , I 'm not sure I want a bunch of yahoos installing 10 dampeners everywhere up there when if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't measured the noise level , but when it 's on you can hear it especially when the furnace is running low speed . It does provide a good push to the air out though . I forgot to mention that I have it controlled by a z-wave appliance module . Also did n't mention that the room it services is the only room in the house which does n't have a cold air return . I 'm thinking on sacrificing part of a linen closet and running a return to the adjacent room . <p> Listen to the advice here and your tech . Balance the system . Static pressure is a key thing on hvac systems , and if it 's wrong , you are n't running efficiently and over time , decreasing the usable age of your equipment . <p> I had a new system put in about 3 years ago and went with a variable speed blower because of static pressure issues . It was the cheap way of dealing with the problem VS adding in more returns . It 's still not right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls to add in more returns , I would do it . <p> You either have a leaking duct , or not a big enough return . Air is like water , it will flow to the path of least resistance , if it does n't have a path , you wo n't get flow and just a pretty spiny thing . Adding a blower will do very little if the air does n't have a place to go . Think of it like an air traffic jam . <p> Oh and balancing a system has nothing to do with adding dampers . It 's making sure airflow is as perfect as it can be . Most spec houses are built wrong when it comes to hvac because it is the last thing to be installed and rarely considered . So what we thing of big returns , really are n't . I have 2 big returns on my house and it 's not enough for the square footage . <p> It sounds like you had issues because you had two ducts feeding the room , and the two fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fans would n't have to be running full tilt to make good airflow , and I 'd want a variable speed unit . Why does the main unit have to be running at all ? Would n't the fans just suck air from the other rooms ?

I just ca n't believe they have to be spun up to high db levels to get decent airflow . <p> Inline fans are axial fans . The main fan in the air handler is usually a squirrel cage fan . Squirrel cage fans are typically much quieter for a given air flow compared to axial . Also , residential HVAC units rarely have back flow prevention dampers that close when the air handler shuts down .

You may be right about what your system needs . But you are also taking a risk by not heeding the advice of a trained tech and people who have had personal experience . ( As a mental exercise , imagine someone with no practical experience in your area of expertise , concluding that something you think is risky is the obvious best course of action . ) Will Rogers expressed it a bit more graphically . <p> He did have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that link as a put down . I am one of those who insists on trying things that others tell me is a bad idea or a waste of time . I 'm usually wrong , but I often learn something important that way , and occasionally I turn out to be right . <p> Nothing wrong with the road less traveled . I ca n't find anything to control the speed with . There 's 3 speed wall switches for ceiling fans which means I would have to have a larger switch box and wiring if I was to mount it in the wall . I guess i could just Ieave the switch in the attic . I do n't think I would need full tilt , maybe low or medium . <p> I am not an HVAC guy but I have done a lot of remodeling of older houses which included room reconfigurations . It is not easy to change duct work . Most people opt not to spend money to change ducts . In my opinion , there are very few houses that have HVAC systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes vents in rooms that are not used . I think the risk of damage to your HVAC system from using a booster fan is extremely low . <p> However , the fan you are considering seems a bit extreme ! Maybe something smaller to start with ? <p> Go big or go home ? That 's why I need a controller to probably operate it on low or medium . To be honest , I do n't know what the duct size is . It looks 12 " with the insulation . After I find a satisfactorary Zwave controller , I 'll delve into what size Fan I need . This model comes in 6 " , 8 , and 10 " . The question now is will a 3 speed ( Zwave ) ceiling fan wall switch work ? I presume yes . Anything better to use as a speed controller ?
