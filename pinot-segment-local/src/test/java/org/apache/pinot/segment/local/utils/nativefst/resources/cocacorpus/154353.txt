Her strong reputation in the financial arena has resulted in requests from County Commissioners for financial analyses and trend reports necessary for effective decision-making and from other constitutional officers , the courts and community leaders for objective financial and performance audits . <p> Her financial reports have consistently received top honors from the Government Finance Officers Association . The Fiscal Year 2012 edition of Checks &amp; Balances : Your Guide to County Finances placed 35th in its category of the " Top 50 Annual Reports Worldwide " by the League of American Communications Professionals ( LACP ) . <p> Among Clerk Bock 's most important duties as Clerk &amp; Comptroller is identifying fraud , waste and government inefficiencies through her Division of Inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government finance through her award-winning County Financial Reports . <p> Under Clerk Bock 's leadership , the Division of Inspector General launched its Guardianship Fraud Hotline in 2010 which led to the development of her cutting-edge Guardianship Fraud Program. - To date , the program has identified over $4 million in unsubstantiated disbursements , missing assets and fraud . <p> In 2014 , Clerk Bock successfully advocated the Florida Legislature for changes in state laws which empowered all 67 Florida Clerks to investigate questionable activity in court-appointed guardianships and create a broad guardianship program .

Recipient of the Governor 's Sterling Award for Organizational Performance Excellence , the Clerk &amp; Comptroller 's office merges solid business strategies with government to deliver outstanding service with the highest level of integrity . <p> The Florida Constitution establishes the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court . Directly elected by the public to operate independently of the County Commission , the Clerk of the Court serves three major functions : as the financial watchdog for county expenditures , as the repository of and custodian for all legal records and as the service and support center for the county 's court system . The Clerk &amp; Comptroller 's Office performs more than 1,000 different functions in carrying out these duties . <h> HISTORY <p> The court system of the American Colonies was patterned after that of England . When the colonies declared their independence and became a union of states , these states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the courts were being developed in England , the clergymen were among the few who were literate . Consequently , the judges and subordinate officers of the courts were selected from that group . Thus , the title of the Office of Clerk comes to us from the Latin , Clericus , meaning clergyman . <p> The Constitution of the State of Florida authorizes and provides for a Clerk of the Circuit Court in each county . The Constitution prescribes that the clerk shall also be Clerk of the County Court , and of the Board of County Commissioners , as well as County Recorder . The Constitution also makes the Clerk Ex Officio Auditor of the county . It provides that the Clerk 's duties and compensation shall be as prescribed by law . <p> The Clerks of the Circuit Court are elected for a term of four years at a general election held for the purpose of electing all county officers . The first election in the state of Florida to such office , under the Constitution of 1885 , was held in 1888 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On July 1 , 1909 , the state Legislature established Palm Beach County as the 47th county in Florida , with West Palm Beach named as the county seat . Before then , the county had been a part of Dade County . The county 's population was approximately 5,500 in 1909 , compared to 1.3 million today . Not counting Lake Okeechobee , Palm Beach County is the second largest of Florida 's 67 counties and has 1,977 square miles of land . <p> Fred E. Fenno was the first elected Palm Beach County Circuit Court Clerk . He took his post in 1909 for the first Palm Beach County commission meeting on July 6 of that year . Commissioners approved his salary of $75 per month . Fenno was known for his excellent penmanship , which certainly aided in the recording of commission minutes , done in longhand at that time . <p> Commissioners determined that the temporary and first courthouse for Palm Beach County would be housed in an old school building located at the corner of Clematis and Poinsettia streets ( now known as Dixie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach County until the construction of a new building a few blocks north in 1916 . Wings were added to the building in 1927 , followed by additions in 1955 . In 1972 , the original building was completely encased in a wrap-around expansion . A new judicial complex opened across from the original building on Dixie Highway in 1995 . <p> James Alexander Arnette and John B. Dunkle served the longest terms as Clerk of Courts , with 22 and 28 years respectively . When he was voted into office in 1958 , John B. Dunkle , at the age of 30 , was the youngest elected official in Palm Beach County . Retiring in 1991 at age 63 , Clerk Dunkle noted his discontent with advancing technology and how computers and telephone machines had impersonalized the office . In his years of service , he had perhaps witnessed the most technological advances and had seen his office expand from a staff of seven employees to more than 670 . His salary grew , too , from $10,000 in 1959 to $87,500 in 1991 . <p> Rapid and progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The county 's first female Clerk , Wilken took office in 1993 with the primary objective of operating the office using a strong business model . Clerk Wilken implemented Total Quality Management to incorporate teamwork and sound problem-solving methods into the office and created a Management Operating System to measure department productivity and performance . <p> In 1999 , the office adopted the Florida Sterling framework as its organizational model . A series of best business practices in areas such as leadership , customer service , process improvement , employee satisfaction and strategic planning led to the office earning the prestigious Governor 's Sterling Award for organizational performance excellence in 2003 . Based on the well-known national Baldrige Award , the Sterling is the highest honor for business excellence in the State of Florida . <p> The office 's tradition of excellence continued following Clerk Wilken 's retirement .

Through community outreach , she has effectively balanced emerging privacy concerns with the public 's right to access public records . This has been a key area of focus in the early part of her first term in office , along with an increased emphasis on the office 's constitutional duties as county accountant , treasurer and auditor . <p> Operating on a set of seven values , employees of the Clerk &amp; Comptroller 's office strive to be the world-class leader in customer service , employee satisfaction , and standards of excellence .
