Get there around that time as tea was at 7 and I had loads of time to get unpacked and settled in to the accom ready for the trial by fire during the week . Food was cracking all week - one thing I 'd say is stuff in as much as you can - - because the rest of the week the timings are ridiculously tight and we hardly had time to scran bar the evenings after all the details were completed . 17 due to start the course , 2 no shows . <p> Monday : Sweat and dread . It was ridiculously humid all week and even the warm ups were causing a bit of cramp all round . BFT was decent - fairly flat course but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 7:37 and slowest was 9:40 something . I was somewhere in the front of the middle of the pack with 8:23 . What I 'd probably advise is doing the BFT when your legs are already fatigued . We ran the first 1.5 miles way quicker than 12 minutes as well . We were n't allowed watches but I could just tell we were gassing it on the running sections . Group presentation was pretty standard - make sure everybody contributes equally and you get around each other if you have gaps in your knowledge . Again essay pretty straightforward , although I got marked down with mine because my handwriting is like a chimpanzee with epilepsy has been given a pen so make it legible ! <p> Afternoon : lightning change into gym kit for the RMFA . Bleep was in the drill shed and everyone passed - lowest was 11:7 and highest was 14:8 . Again I was top 5ish with 13:3 . Onto the gym tests sweating like men posessed . All the standard stuff - no fidgeting , no scratching , no farting . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratching and said he was dizzy after doing the last set of tuck jumps . PTI obviously took sympathy . Everyone passed bar a couple of lads who were borderline . I was disappointed with my stats with 57 press ups , 58 sit ups and 10 pull ups - again front of the middle grouping with some ninjas almost maxing everything . <p> Black Tuesday : The label says it all . Was the single hardest thing I 've ever done in my life . We had to be on bottom field for 15 minutes after breakfast was being served . Did a cheeky chunder in the long grass . Started with some confidence at height doing the commando crawl across the ropes probably about 15ft up along with running along planks before the ' warm up ' - all part of 4 hours of disgusting phys which being fit can only partly prepare you for . We had a timed run around the assault course which we all did pretty well in . If you have opportunity , practice all the drags and carries which you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by uphill leopard crawls and take cover drills . Log phys was pretty grim but you 've just got to follow instruction with a bit of urgency and you 'll make it through . We lost one bloke on the bottom field pretty early on . Finished off with leadership tasks which were pretty straightforward although we made an absolute hash of the leaderless ones . Then 200m fireman 's carry which we had 70 seconds to complete . I managed 65 seconds which I was pretty pleased with - my partner was a godsend here making himself into a little rucksack on my back . We followed that with a final attempt at 5 pull ups on the rope followed by a regain , with many of us flopping to the delight of the PTIs and assembled crowd in the Exe Cafe . <p> 3 minute interest lectures on a topic of our choice followed this after a 5 minute window to shower and change . They 're marking your powers of communication here as well as your content , but I wish I 'd have picked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lectures are more informal than you 'd expect so have fun with it ! <p> We then tried to stomach some lunch before the inevitable ' extra phys ' on the endurance course . We drove out to Woodbury common and the bus was dead silent . After a cramp-inducing warm up we were kindly reminded that the next 4 hours would be ' leg heavy ' by the colour sergeant who took us . Brilliant . We set off at lightning pace to Peter 's pool and onwards through a plethora of mud and seemingly constant uphill trudges . A lot of the lads agree with my here when they say that their CV was there to do the task but muscular endurance is paramount . Many many pays to be a winner runs where it 's so important to fight to be at the front and avoid that cramp that 's always nagging at you . This goes for every aspect of the course ! For me the mental aspect was massive on the second half of the day . There were moments where I was wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and my mind started drifting , but you just have to bring yourself back to focusing on the task in hand and attempting to have a laugh . We lost another 2 lads on a gopping circuit round a triangle of the DS with massive 30-40m hills . By the end I was cramping up so badly in every area of my legs and the hare and hounds was one of the biggest mental struggles I 've ever had - we all made it back writhin 42 seconds of the DS however , and were allowed to get back into warmers . Just dig out and try not to let people lag behind - come in as a team ! Also of the two biggest lads on the course , one got pulled off the endurance course and the other struggled to keep up with the pack due to the volume of running . I 've tried to stay as wiry as possible and the lads who were smashing everyone on Tuesday were ninjas with a decent set of legs and lungs on them - bulking up just is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current affairs debate is to make sure you contribute . It made a massive difference when we had the final debrief ! A wide knowledge of current affairs is easily do-able by reading a daily paper with a good opinion column . <p> Wednesday : Cramp and pasties . The sniper got me front and centre in the officer 's mess whilst we were having breakfast , although luckily our only details for the morning were controlled drowning and cleaning the accom before final debrief . Scran as much as you can to replace what you 've burned off as I was feeling pretty dicey before we got in the pool ! Swimming assessment was a hangout . Jump into the pool off the 3m board with rifle and webbing , swim a full length and then tread water whilst handing your kit off to the side , then treading water for 3 minutes . 3 lengths of front crawl and 3 lengths of breast stroke and duck diving twice for bricks , long with hypoxic widths pushing the bricks along the floor and a full length underwater all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class opportunity to pick the brains of the DS on their careers as officers and AIB so take it ! We unfortunately lost 2 lads who got PRMC passes , but in total 9/15 passed - a pretty strong showing ! <p> Absolutely over the moon and equally knackered . <p> If there 's anything I 'll pin point out of the whole week it is go down to the NAAFI and get yourself some pasties , nuts and flapjack to stuff in at any and every moment you have . Salt all your food to help with cramp and drink enough water to have you up 2-3 times in the night for a wee . <p> If anyone 's got any questions then feel free to crack on , hopefully this was a bit of help for anyone chasing the same thing as me ! <p> PS . Best of luck to the PRMC boys who we saw whilst we were handing your kit back , you 'll smash it . <p> I wo n't write a full diary since it would mostly just be repetition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads of snacks for in your room . 2 towels because there is n't always time for them to dry Running fitness is the main helper on Tuesdays physical tasks Being at or near the front on the endurance course and bottom field for all the general running and circuits is noticed and got me good kudos Get decent socks to wear with the boots , to give yourself one fewer sources of pain on Tuesday ( and Wednesday ) I 'd recommend disagreeing with the general consensus of the group in the group discussion . I took the opposite view to what most people thought even though it was n't my own view , because then people address their points and arguments to you which gives you more opportunities to speak . If you use your own boots then be aware they will probably get trashed , and also that they need to be high up the calf . Be funny and outgoing if you can , the main criticism I was given is that I was very cold and could do with being more " exuberant " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Passed ) when you were putting your kits away . I thought what I had to do was hard , but reading yours looked murder , especially that swimming assessment . Congrats on passing <p> Well done on the pass and good luck on the AIB !

I 've played a decent level of sport so talked about the values I 've gained from it ( **26;0;TOOLONG opposition etc ) and why I think it 's important !

The whole week was a hangout but massively enjoyed it <p> I was on this POC with IronandGrit aka Yorkshire Warrior , and by far the hardest part for me was Log PT on bottom field ( do n't think you do it on PRMC ) It 's where I nearly broke . Depending on how many candidates are still around you 'll have around 6 or 7 people on a log were you press the log above your head on command and move it from shoulder to shoulder . You 'll do something like 15 log presses , then 15 log curls then 10 log presses then 10 curls . Colours really did n't know how close we all were to breaking . If asked for another set I think a few would have walked . We also sat down with the log and did log sit ups which was actually a good breather from the presses to be honest . If you want to suffer less on the log presses , you MUST work as a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , personalities will come out under the log and you must exert the SAME EFFORT or you all suffer . Oh , and you 'll also push the log up a hill with your elbows . <p> Log PT was a regular element during my time in RT . It was really gruelling and took its toll on us . <p> Alan 92991 @qwx292991 <p> Although never a Royal myself . Log PT was also a regular during RT , and a massive part of my JNCO cadre ! ! it certainly exposes jack blokes in double quick time ! ! And as has been mentioned , a true test of team work ! ! Section log races were emotional to say the least ! Disgusting phys ! ! <p> Although never a Royal myself .

The shouts of ' you did n't seriously think you 'd just be pushing it along the flat did you you mongs ? ! ' Are still ringing in my ears <p> I forgot about that part ! I remember on my POC we only had 4 or 5 on the log we struggled to even hold it then the PTI told us to do 10 overhead squats , a lot of sore heads after that ! 92991 @qwx292991 <p> Similarly for my POC , by the time we got to logs there were just 9 of us so 4 and 5 on each log . Absolute mental game at that point no doubt ! I actually preferred pushing it up a hill with our elbows vs doing squats and presses with it ! <p> I have n't seen it for a while , but you would often see a group of guys carrying one up to the Endurance Course . My former son in law had the pleasure of that one and he reckons it was a minging experience . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would have floated through there !

@@27478348 @1178348/ <p> I 'm ( conditionally ) off to university in Newcastle in September , and have been thinking about the RMR detachment up there . My aim has always been the regulars . My question is kind of two fold , 1 ) How do the attitudes or culture differ between the RMR and the regular trained strength ? 2 ) How are the RMR/RMR transfers perceived amongst the lads ?

I tend to use Deep Freeze at the moment ' cause I like the smell : smile1 : <p> I believe that Deep Heat is applied to warm the muscles , particularly in areas that have been causing problems and need extra warm up , or the gel version is good when massaged into the muscles to relax and recover . <p> Deep Freeze is akin to applying ice to an injury/sprain .. <p> Having said that , heat wraps are good for stiffness and ice packs good for sprains/shins .

And warming the muscle is usually done before an exercise ( to loosen the muscle ) and also as a part of an active recovery because it increases blood supply , thus increasing oxygen and nutrients to the muscle . <p> Both treatments will aid in pain releif and anti-inflammatry . But as said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have troubles with my achillies and my usual routine would be to heat the muscle , then stretch , then exercise , then ice . And then heat later on to help increase blood supply . <p> Ps . I forgot to say . It is essential that you ice and not heat immediately after the injury occurs . <p> Because of the fact that heat increases blood supply and ice decreases blood supply . Therefore if there is any internal bleeding around the injury site then ice will restrict the amount of blood supply to the area and prevent further injury or inflammation . Obviously heating the area would have the opposite ( unwanted ) effect .

Many villages and towns have basic roadside outlets where one may ' try before you buy ' . Always worth taking a look into the local mahoosive hypermarkets too .

If anyone could help me out with this I would be extremely grateful . : amuse : <p> The UCAS website will advise the points awarded for the qualification , however the only way of checking whether the HND is recognised as being accepted with regard academic content in lieu of the required A levels is to take your certificates to your AFCO so that copies maybe taken and forwarded to the Admiralty Interview Board for verification . <p> It 's well worth taking the secondary certificates also to confirm their relevance and to double check the degree is accepted as an accredited computing qualification . <p> Thanks for the advice and have forwarded on all my qualifications and modules that I have covered and they have been accepted .

@@27478439 @1178439/ <p> Forget the half marathon . The most you want to be aiming for is around 8 miles . As @arny01 points out you will need a distance like that to get you through the Thursday of PRMC . The EC and the run back , will use a good 6 miles of that , added to which you will need more in your legs for all the " pays to be a winner " phys that you will be doing . <p> So stick with your 5 and 10k . Do the 9 miler and start doing hills , as Devon does n't do flat . <p> Aye . I support the advice above . You do n't need to be an ironman athlete but you need the mileage in your legs . When I say mileage I do n't mean long big runs . I mean building the mileage over time into your legs . Get to know your body , know your pace , your breathing , your rhythm , your foot placement . <p> Your PJFT works out about 3 miles in 22 mins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the pace , rhythm , breath and mindset squared . <p> Add your 5k ( 3miles = 4.8k ) and add some 6 milers and the occasional 9miler . Do n't really need doing much further than that . <p> You say should you get fit in training ? No . You need the basics first , RT is hard enough without having to play catch up . You want to comfortably get the required standards . After that , then RT will do its stuff to get you fit . <p> Add doing a bleep test the afternoon after doing a PJFT in the morning . Or do a 5k in the morning , and a 5k in the afternoon . Or . 5k and a 10k etc. mix and match . Try and build your " endurance " . <p> When training for PRMC I did n't actually run distances of 5+ miles as a straight and direct run . My longer distance run which Increased both my endurance and speed , was a workout I did which was 2 miles out 10 long hillsprints 2 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also made it easier on the mind as it was broken down into 3 sections . I 'd usually get back from this and smash a bodyweight circuit or something along those lines . <p> I also trained with RMR , the PTI used to take us on a run which would amount to around 5 miles involving sprints , obstacles , stopping for circuits , fireman 's carries and drags . This was all done in boots too , so by the time I got to PRMC , I felt very acquainted with running in wet , heavy boots and it paid off massively . That being said , I would n't recommend running in boots unless they 're the same as PRMC ones and also do n't do it all too often , make it more of an acquaint . <p> These are the Targets my lad aimed to achieve during his Prmc prep , they were goals I set him .

Since starting university I have been interested in broadcasting , information ? s systems and communication technology . After spotting the position of Information Systems Engineering Officer I have decided that this is the job for me . However , after looking at the qualifications requirements I do not know if I have what is required . It asks for <p> ? A recognised first degree in a computing-based subject , 180 UCAS points and five GCSEs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which must include English and maths. ? <p> I have the equivalent of 5 GCSEs and expecting to achieve a minimum of a 2.1(honours) . However , I do not know if HND ? s are acceptable and if so how many ucas points are awarded . If anyone could help me out with this I would be extremely grateful . : amuse : <p> The UCAS website will advise the points awarded for the qualification , however the only way of checking whether the HND is recognised as being accepted with regard academic content in lieu of the required A levels is to take your certificates to your AFCO so that copies maybe taken and forwarded to the Admiralty Interview Board for verification . <p> It 's well worth taking the secondary certificates also to confirm their relevance and to double check the degree is accepted as an accredited computing qualification . <p> Thanks for the advice and have forwarded on all my qualifications and modules that I have covered and they have been accepted .

In the following October , Gibraltar was besieged by the French and Spanish .

I appreciate you are only training for PJFT , but I 'm from a running background and have never ran twice a day , unless the second time was for a bus ! <p> Stick to training 5 days a week if possible . Spread the training over a number of days as your body needs to recover ! <p> You 'll get more from putting everything you have in once than 70% twice .
