The aircraft lost about 9000 feet before the crew was able to regain control . Two passengers received serious , one member of the crew as well as two other passengers minor injuries . The aircraft diverted to Muscat . As the occurrence happened over international waters the BFU is responsible for the investigation assisted by the investigation bodies of Oman , India , United Arab Emirates , Canada , USA and France . <p> The BFU reported the Challenger had departed Male at 06:52Z , reached cruise flight level 340 at 07:20Z and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew reported passing waypoint GOLEM . <p> An Airbus A380-800 , serial number 224 , ( Editorial note : although the BFU is not permitted by German law to identify aircraft , the narrative is consistent with Emirates A388 A6-EUL ) had departed Dubai at 06:55Z for Sydney ( Australia ) .

Both pilots were wearing their lap belts and crotch belts , the first officer was also wearing his shoulder harness . The captain lost his head set , the quick reference manual lifted off in the cockpit and was distributed over the cockpit with single pages around the cockpit . Using external horizont reference the captain identified their attitude and was able to stabilize the aircraft again at FL240 , he observed the left hand engine 's N1 and N2 separated with the N1 reducing , the ITT reached 1000 degrees C and flashed red , the engine was shut down .

No leakages were observed . The manufacturer however stated , that it was impossible to return the aircraft into airworthy conditions due to accelerations that were beyond the design limits of the aircraft structure . The aircraft was therefore rated substantially damaged . <p> The BFU reported that ICAO introduced a work group in 2003 to develop safety recommendations to reduce the effects of wake turbulence by A380 aircraft to an acceptable level . The work group focussed on aircraft flying on parallel tracks and advised that wake turbulence could occur as far as 20nm behind and 1000 feet below an A388 or other heavy aircraft ( including B744 and A346 specifically being mentioned by the work group ) .

@@47788707 @1288707/ <p> On Apr 24th 2017 Singapore 's AAIB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were : <p> - The Door 3L failure was traced to a crack passing through a number of rivet holes on the door skin . The crack was probably caused by high cycle fatigue under varying amplitude loading due to the fluttering of the Batch 1 CP that was initially installed on the aircraft . Once the crack was initiated , the stiffer Batch 3 CP could not prevent further propagation of the crack . <p> - There were traces of sealant and paint in the crack surfaces as well as on the countersunk surfaces of two rivet holes , meaning that the crack was present when CP was replaced in August 2012 . <p> - As regards the PSUs in the bunks in the CCRC , some cabin crew members did not seem to be aware that a conscious effort is needed to pull on the mask , when lying down , in order to release the lanyard pin to allow oxygen to flow to the mask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at an aerodrome of Category X can be significantly different from that required of a Category X-1 aerodrome . The smaller amount of water available at the Category X-1 aerodrome could compromise the desired RFFS protection level . ICAO guidance material does not seem to offer a methodology for airline operators to evaluate the extent of the compromise in fire protection level when an aerodrome of a lower category than the aeroplane category is used . <p> The SAAIB reported that loud noise had been observed from door 3L already on the previous day during the flight from Singapore to London but did not notice anything unusual except for the noise . Maintenance personnel had checked the door already on Dec 23rd 2013 due to noises , no anomaly except for a slightly worn seal was found , the defect was put into the log for deferred defects to be monitored ( ADD log ) . This log permitted the defect to be deferred for 120 days . <p> After arrival in London the door was checked again by maintenance , who did not find any anomaly except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ADD log . <p> After departure from London the noise was again heard , a cabin crew member checked the door but did not detect any air leak or vibration . The aircraft continued the climb to FL370 while cabin crew supervisor rechecked the door again without detecting any leak or vibration . Flight crew checked the cabin pressure after levelling off at FL370 , the cabin pressure was stable at 6000 feet . The flight crew was aware of the ADD log entry and decided that it was safe to continue the flight . <p> About 5 hours into the flight the flight crew was alerted to increasing cabin altitude by an ECAM warning and disappeared again . Flight crew continued to closely monitor cabin pressure and noticed the cabin altitude began to climb again about 30 minutes later , which resulted in a cabin excess altitude warning . The flight crew therefore initiated an emergency descent and declared Mayday with Kabul ( Afghanistan ) Center , however , did not receive a reply . Another aircraft in the vicinity heard the Mayday Call and relayed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn around into the direction of Ashgabat ( Turkmenistan ) and informed Kabul about their decision to divert to Ashgabat . Turkmenistan 's ATC subsequently informed the crew that Ashgabat was not suitable for A380s . The crew consulted with dispatch and decided to divert to Baku ( Azerbaijan ) , which was the next nearest airport , where the aircraft landed without further incident . <p> The SAAIB described the damage to the door : " The skin of Door 3L was found torn and bent outwards at the top left hand corner of the door . As a result , the aircraft was unable to maintain pressurisation . The Door 3L window shade was found collapsed . " The manufactrer indicated that there had been no other similiar case of a door skin failure . <p> The damaged door was sent to the manufacturer for laboratory analysis , a crack was found at the door coverplate ( CP ) , which was identified to be a fatigue crask as result of high cycle fatigue failure under varying amplitude loading . The crack likely originated at rivet 4 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The SAAIB analysed : <p> Traces of sealant and paint were found on the crack surfaces as well as on the countersunk surfaces of two of the rivet holes with missing rivet heads . This means the crack was already present in August 2012 during the CP replacement and subsequent painting work . The rivet heads could also have been missing by then . <p> When the CP is in place , the lower edge of the CP would almost cover the row of rivets in question and a fillet of sealant is applied to seal the lower edge of the CP . The sealant application job does not include an inspection of the row of rivets . Anyway , it is doubtful if maintenance personnel focusing on the sealant application job would notice any such missing rivet heads , especially if the cavity left by the missing rivet heads had been filled with sealant . <p> When the CP was removed during maintenance work , one might get to inspect the condition of the row of rivets . However , if the cavity left by the rivet heads had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been possible for maintenance personnel to notice the missing rivet heads . After the CP replacement in August 2012 , there was no further work done in that area and thus no opportunity to inspect the condition of the row of rivets in the area . <p> The SAAIB analysed that the level of fire protection by an ICAO category 9 ( category X-1/X minus 1 ) and category 10 ( category X , required by aircraft ) aerodrome could make a difference . One or two more minutes of fire protection might result in a different , successful or unsuccessful outcome of an evacuation . There had been risk assessments by ICAO which permitted a category 10 aircraft to use a category 9 aerodrome , which provides about 70-80% of water supplies needed . However , the SAAIB asked : " Put another way , if a flight crew needs to choose between landing at a Category X aerodrome and a Category X-1 aerodrome , would the crew know what the difference in fire protection levels offered by these aerodromes ? " <p> The SAAIB analysed that ICAO regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided shall be not less than one category below the determined category " is ambiguous , in particular on first read by an unprepared person who might conclude from this sentence , that the provided category should not be less than one category below the determined category resulting in two categories below .

The plan gave a ground distance for the flight of 1,611 nm and a trip fuel requirement of 8,658 kg . <p> The only other fuel requirement submitted to create the plan was for a taxi fuel requirement of 200 kg . This gave a total fuel requirement for the flight of 8,858 kg , but with no allowance for diversion , holding or contingency fuel requirements . <p> The plan was created using a cruising flight level of FL300 and an aircraft takeoff weight of 32,991 kg .

Estimating the checked baggage at 488kg ( as measured after recovery from the wreckage site ) the GRIAA estimated the minimum takeoff weight at 41,610kg . Measurements of the baggage during the flight from Sao Paulo to Santa Cruz showed the baggage at 1026kg , which increased the minimum takeoff weight to 42,148kg ( MTOW 41,800kg according to AOM ) . <p> With respect to the filed flight plan the GRIAA wrote : <p> The dispatcher accompanying the flight submitted a flight plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan office at Santa Cruz Airport .

The aircraft is going to undergo maintenance over night , the flight is being continued on Tuesday morning and is estimated to arrive in Singapore with a delay of 20 hours . <p> The occurrence aircraft was able to continue the flight as JQ-7D after about 22 hours on the ground and reached Singapore with a delay of 24 hours . <p> Australia 's Transportation Safety Board ( ATSB ) rated the occurrence a serious incident and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuations and difficulties to maintain the assigned altitude followed by faulty flight instruments . The crew dumped fuel and diverted to Darwin for a safe landing . The ATSB is reading out the black boxes in order to " determine the factors that contributed to the airspeed fluctuations " . The final report is estimated for December 2016 . <p> On Jun 14th 2017 the ATSB released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were : <p> Contributing factors <p> - The aircraft entered a region of high ice water content which caused icing of the three independent pitot sources and anomalous airspeed indications . <p> - Short duration anomalous airspeed indications caused the flight control computer to transition to secondary mode . In secondary mode , the autopilot and some auto-flight protections were unavailable to the flight crew . <p> The ATSB summarized the sequence of events : <p> On 21 December 2015 , a Boeing 787-8 ( B787 ) aircraft , registered VH-VKE , departed Melbourne , Australia on a scheduled passenger transport service to Singapore . The flight , operating as Jetstar Flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1 . At 0550 UTC , the aircraft was in cruise , being operated at flight level2 ( FL ) 400 . The first officer was the pilot flying ( PF ) and autopilot and autothrottle were engaged . <p> At the date of this occurrence an airworthiness directive ( AD/B787/2013-24-01 ) relating to reducing the risk of engine icing was in effect , requiring avoidance of ice crystal icing3 conditions . As such , weather information with relevant en route icing conditions was used by the operator for the purposes of flight planning . In accordance with the AD , the crew manoeuvred around any observed weather conditions that had potential to cause icing to the engines . <p> Approaching waypoint CURLY , about 250 NM north of Darwin , Australia , the crew reported that a green coloured4 area , with magenta5 patches appeared ahead on their weather radar . This area was too close to avoid . <p> As a precaution the crew activated the seat-belt light . The aircraft entered an area of light turbulence which then increased to moderate . Concurrently with the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PFDs , the autopilot disconnected and multiple EICAS6 messages were displayed including AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE and FLIGHT CONTROL MODE . The FLIGHT CONTROL MODE annunciation indicated that the aircraft flight control system had reverted to secondary mode . <p> Shortly after the event , the captain took over the pilot flying role and the crew conducted the AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE checklist . The captain reported that this was a high workload situation and effective communication and coordination with the first officer greatly assisted the procedure . <p> The crew maintained an airspeed by setting a pitch angle and thrust level , as indicated in the applicable quick reference handbook table . Through comparison with this table , the crew were also able to identify the most accurate airspeed indication . The crew reported that at this stage it appeared that all indications had returned to normal . <p> The aircraft was 4 hours into an 8 hour journey , latched in secondary mode and could only be flown manually . Based on this , a decision was made to divert to Darwin , Northern Territory . <p> After jettisoning fuel to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested a straight-in approach and made an uneventful landing at Darwin airport . <p> The ATSB analysed : <p> Reasons for erratic airspeed indications <p> The weather analysis provided by the aircraft manufacturers meteorological specialists found that the erratic airspeed values likely resulted from ice crystal icing of the pitot-static systems . In this instance the icing affected the voted airspeed values for approximately 17 seconds . <p> Although there are three independent pitot-static systems for determining computed airspeed , adverse environmental conditions , as encountered during this flight , can affect all three simultaneously . On the B787 , the synthetic AOA speed allows an independent source of airspeed as a comparison in order to validate the voted airspeed . <p> Once the airspeed values returned to normal , the ongoing flight was affected by the reversion and latching of the flight control computer to secondary mode . <p> Secondary mode reversion <p> A drop in recorded airspeed to , or below , a threshold level is referred to as a No Computed Data ( NCD ) state . Throughout the recorded airspeed fluctuations , there were two occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient time to revert the flight control system to secondary mode . <p> Boeing has taken action to revise the software in the flight control computer related to the secondary mode reversion .

Later into the flight , already in the descent towards Hyderabd , the captain experienced partial loss of hearing and blurred vision . He instructed the first officer ( 26 , CPL , 1627 hours on type ) to take control of the aircraft and perform an auto-land into Hyderabad , inform ATC and request a doctor to meet the aircraft on arrival and request a tow tractor to tow the aircraft to the apron . The captain believed , his condition was an allergic reaction to the pain killer and decided to take an " over the counter " anti-allergic tablet , the captain 's condition improved within 10 minutes . The first officer performed a safe auto-land into Hyderabad , ATC was informed the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's condition had improved sufficiently , that the captain took control and taxied the aircraft to the stand . <p> India 's DGCA reported an airport doctor attended to the captain and confirmed the symptoms shown were an allergic reaction to the pain killer . The doctor issued a " fit to fly " certificate to the captain . The airline however instructed the captain to discontinue his schedule and insisted the captain should undergo a thorough medical examination before being rostered again . <p> The DGCA released their final report concluding the probable causes of the serious incident were : <p> The most probable cause of the PIC getting incapacitated was due to side effect of a pain killer which was taken by the PIC without any prescription / consultation by a doctor . <p> The DGCA analysed the testimony by the captain : <p> The PIC in his statement had stated that , on the day of occurrence he woke up early in the morning with neck pain . However , as the pain was reducing he decided to continue with his flight schedule and reported for duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated stretching of arms to operate controls and overhead panels the neck pain got aggravated . To get relief from neck pain he decided to take a pain killer from his flight bag in which he used to carry over the counter ( OTC ) medicine like pain killer and anti-allergic medicine . However , during descent into Hyderabad he experienced partial loss of hearing and a blurred vision . To counter the existing reaction of the pain killer he took an anti-allergic tablet , the symptoms improved after 10 min of taking antiallergic medicine . <p> Te DGCA summarized the results of the medical examination of the captain : <p> After the incidence , the PIC was taken off flying at Hyderabad and subjected to medical examination to ascertain into the cause of incapacitation . The PIC underwent all the medical tests including blood hemogram , blood biochemistry , urinalysis , TMT and X-ray cervical spine as directed by the CMO of M/s Spicejet . All the test results were found normal . The opinion of cardiologist and Orthopedic were taken and same were also reviewed by M/s Spicejet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subsequently on 11.01.2014 , after three days the PIC was cleared to resume his flying duties by CMO with a condition that he will not take any self-medication and avoid any medicine at least 12 hrs prior to his flying schedule . <p> Further the DGCA class-I medical records of the PIC for last three years were also scrutinised and no such limitation or observation was recorded on his medical assessments . The PIC underwent his last Class-I renewal medical examination on 04/02/13 , and was assessed fit by DGCA . After the incident of incapacitation , the PIC had undergone his renewal of class-I medical assessment at AFCME , New Delhi and the same was found to be satisfactory with no limitations . <p> The DGCA analysed that neither aircraft nor weather played any role in the occurrence . <p> The DGCA analysed the actions in case of inflight incapacitation : <p> In case of flight crew incapacitation , M/s Spicejet Operational manual defines the procedure wherein the other crew is advised to take over control and establish a safe flight path and engage the auto pilot whenever possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incapacitated crew member should be restrained so that he does not interfere with essential controls . Also administer oxygen at 100% to revive the crew and move the incapacitated crew member out of cockpit area , if possible . Declare an emergency and inform ATC of the situation . <p> Further , flight/cabin crew to enquire if there is a medical doctor On-board for immediate assistance and do not allow the incapacitated crew member to take any further part in the conduct of the flight , even if he feels fully fit after the incapacitation . <p> If the PIC is incapacitated , the Co-Pilot shall land the aeroplane from the right seat . The operation manual also defines that in the event of incapacitation/death of the Commander , the order of succession in Command of the aircraft will be an Examiner/Instructor/Line Training Captain type rated on aircraft travelling as Accompanied Crew Member ( ACM ) in the aircraft . Then Line Captain rated on aircraft travelling as ACM , Trainee Captain rated as co-pilot travelling as ACM on aircraft shall occupy the left seat and the Co-Pilot shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin crew was not informed about the PIC incapacitation by the first officer . Also the first officer did not call the cabin crew in the cockpit for assistance in removing the PIC from the controls as per the procedures outlined in their operations manual . The ATC was informed for medical assistance , however the emergency was not declared by the first officer this action prevented the ATC from alerting all the safety services to be ready in case of any emergency situation encountered during landing . The cabin in-charge was not aware of the situation hence the cabin could not be prepared for any emergency condition occurring post landing . <p> From the above it is inferred that the first officer actions were not in line with their own company approved procedures in case of flight crew incapacitation. 104202 @qwx514202 104201 @qwx514201 104203 @qwx514203 104200 @qwx514200 104203 @qwx514203 104200
