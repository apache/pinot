Although Seattle was already a place known for its writers and bookstores , no central " hub " existed for writers and readers to meet and build audiences for new work .

They were committed to an entrepreneurial vision ; they wanted to use business-like practices to build a strong institution that would remain flexible and risk-taking in its programming . <p> The writers center was named for Richard Hugo , a poet who attained national recognition .

Hugo House remained in an old building that served its needs until May of 2016 , when it moved to a temporary location on Capitol Hill . <p> Since then , Hugo House has seen thousands of writers and readers come through its doors for classes and events , to meet with writers-in-residence or to simply hole up somewhere with a book or laptop .

We also offer fellowships and opportunities for writers to work within their craft , such as Made at Hugo House , our two writers-in-residence , and instructorship . <p> But do n't  listen to us : one student said , " Rare places can offer an uncomplicated and human experience like this ! " We hope you agree . <p> Where can I find you ? <p> Weve moved to a new location on First Hill while a new building in our old location is being built .

We ask that you please do not park in The Fryes or ODea High Schools parking lots , which are reserved for their staff and guests . <p> Public transportation : The First Hill Streetcar stops by our new location and connects to the Broadway Streetcar and South Lake Union Streetcar via downtown . You may also take the light rail to Capitol Hill , and from there , the Broadway Streetcar . <p> If you 're coming from up north , there is the bus line 12 from Interlaken Park , the 64 from Lake City , the 303 from Shoreline Park &amp; Ride , and the 309 from Kenmore Park &amp; Ride .

Accessible bathroom facilities are available next door at The Frye art museum during their open hours and our front desk will be happy to work with you on accessing them . <p> Writing groups are composed of fellow writers in a fairly serious relationship together " a relationship that is rarely formed via a blind date , and one that may be much more complex than any romantic relationship . We have n't found a good way to facilitate these matches . You 're looking for a small group of people who read your work in a critical , respectful way with exciting insight . You 'll typically find these people in a classroom . When someone understands or challenges your work in a constructive way , you wo n't want to let go of them . And hopefully theyll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these special writer friends , have coffee , take it slow . <p> Can you help me get published ? <p> We cant , but our writers-in-residence are very helpful in advising writers on how to find an agent or send out manuscripts to various publishers .

Were always willing to answer questions about classes via email or over the phone . Just tell us a bit about your writing background ( or tell us if you 're just getting started ! ) and about what kind of class experience you 'd like , and we can assist you from there . <p> What is a " generative " class ?

This weeks post comes from writer Anne Liu Kellor . Her ten-session course , Memoir as Collage , will explore personal narratives as told in a lyrical , fragmented , nonlinear fashion through in-class writing exercises , discussion , and workshopping. - <h> 1 . You do n't  need to know what kind of memoir you are writing . <p> But you may want to ask yourself : is your memoir plot-driven , with a narrative arc , like most traditionally-published novels and memoirs ? Does your character ( a.k.a. you ) have a problem to overcome or a quest to go on ; does she reach a climax in understanding and is redeemed/healed/changed ? Or is your memoir more driven by themes , a series of interconnecting storylines , layers , questions , and more subtle transformations ? Maybe you are not sure yet ; maybe it is something in between . You might not know which themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoir until you are further along . Maybe all you need to do is keep asking the questions for now , and keep writing . Its form will eventually reveal itself . <h> 2 . You want to collect many images . <p> Striking moments . Searing memories . Recollections of places , scenes , or objects that function as symbols . You 'll want to free-write often in order to keep collecting these jewels of memory . Do n't worry too much yet about which ones are " worthy " of keeping . Just keep writing , sifting through old journals and photos , taking walks , letting the past and present sink in . Trust that whatever arises may have meaning ; do n't discriminate or judge . Patricia Hampl writes , " We only store in memory images of value . " Do you believe her ? Why , for instance , do you recall this memory from childhood , and not thousands of others ? Maybe there is something there for you to untangle , discover , mine . <p> Which of these will you explore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story of your life .

Later , the distance of time and good editors can help you weed out what does n't belong , and what might be best saved for a future project . <h> 4 . At some point , try writing an outline . <p> A list of all the fragments you have in mind , whether full-blown chapters with mini-arcs of their own ; small snapshots of memory/vignettes ; or poems , lists , images , letters , research , dialogues , fictions , or other scraps that you do n't know what to do with .

Or does it feel right to tell your story non-linearly in cycles , or to weave in flashbacks ? Ask your story what structure suits it best . <p> At some point , you might also notice which chapters convey which themes ( or which ones follow certain forms or point of views ) by literally highlighting those aspects in different colors on your outline or with colored sticky notes on the page , then seeing how those colors interweave . How can you balance out those different strands , create a flow of rhythm , form , and meaning ? Keep outlining at different stages , seeing how your vision changes . Keep moving fragments and chapters around to see how they converse and connect . <h> 5 . Experiment with different points of view . <p> If past tense feels like it 's dragging or you fall into the reflective voice too much , try changing it to present tense .

Give yourself permission to play with the writing . Trust that even if the experiment does n't yield " results " for the memoir , it might still teach you something , or give you a piece of writing you can publish elsewhere . <h> 6 . Finally , seek out community . <p> Solitary creating is wonderful , but at some point you will need dialogue . You might need others to write with in person when your own generating sessions leave you bored or stuck , or you might need others to give you feedback on where the energy lies in your work , or how you can best draw it out .
