They are so tiny that they are slipping through water filtration systems . A leading force in the fight against microbeads has been the 5 Gyres Institute , who launched a 2013 study which revealed that 600,000 microbeads per square kilometer were found in the Great Lakes ( Lake Superior , Lake Huron , and Lake Erie in the midwest ) . 5 Gyres also estimates that one single beauty product could contain over 300,000 microbeads , as such with Neutrogenas " Deep Clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are microbeads polluting our bodies of water with plastic , but marine life are consequently consuming them- the same marine life we harvest for food .

Okay , maybe a slight exaggeration , but it has dramatically stepped up my eye makeup game for sure . <p> If you 're not in the loop , the art of tightlining consists of applying eyeliner to your upper waterline , which is the part of your eyelid underneath your eyelashes . While it may seem like such a minimal step , it can actually give your eyes a more professional and pulled together look . <p> Tightlining gets rid of the space between your lashes and the whites of your eyes . This ends up making your lashes look much fuller , and your eyeliner look more precisely applied . In the photos above , literally the only difference between the two pictures is that I had tightlined in the bottom version .

Since I learnt not to flinch , blink excessively and hold still while doing my eye makeup , it really helped .

Mixed in are color filter pigments and polymers to help the texture of your skin look even and healthy underneath a strong dose of color , while protecting from sun damage . <p> The packaging for the BB Sticks made me laugh at first , since they look so much like deodorant , no ? But the slim tube does make it easy to apply in one swipe . As you can see , the color goes on with bold , nearly opaque color . Once you start blending , though , you can get it to look super diffused and natural on the skin . The color is buildable , so whether you 're going for a fresh-faced no makeup look or a statement contour , these perform . <p> Although , I 've really been liking them for the no-makeup makeup look , because of how they just meld into the skin . Sometimes I just use the BB Stick in Bronze Trio to add a bit of color and shape to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips going on , the contour , sculpt and highlight shades in the trio add just enough on the face to give me a healthy skin glow without overpowering the look . If I do want a little bit of pink on the cheeks , though , I 'll apply the Bronze Trio first , then work the Blush Trio shades in using the very edge of the stick . <p> All I need is a little blending with my fingers and I 've got this beautiful natural look . On my combo skin , the shades last about 4-5 hours on me , although they can hold out a little longer if I set them with powder . If you have normal to dry skin , I can see these probably lasting all day for you . For summer , I love how they do n't feel heavy despite being cream products , and as with the rest of Physicians Formula products they 're non-comedogenic , hypoallergenic and fragrance free so I do n't have to worry about my skin feeling masked .

But , I do n't have to be bitter any longer because they just landed here in the US and they 're everything I dreamed they 'd be ! <p> The Only 1 Matte lipsticks may be , well , the only matte drugstore lipsticks you 'll ever want to use . With ten shades in the collection , Rimmel served us a range of neutrals , reds , pinks and even a punch of purple . You can see the shade on the outside of the tube , which is very convenient when searching through your collection . You can spot the difference between these and the original The Only 1 Lipsticks because of their matte red tube . <p> Let 's look at the shades : <h> Trendsetter <p> Trendsetter is a beautiful neutral your-lips-but-better shade . <h> High Flyer <p> High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salute is a ballet slipper pink . <h> Leader of the Pink <p> Leader of the Pink is a spring-ready baby pink . <h> Keep it Coral <p> Keep it Coral is a true coral a yellow toned , bright pink that makes a statement . <h> Call the Shots <p> Call the Shots is a punch pink . <h> The Matte Factor <p> The Matte Factor is a pinky red that 's almost berry . <h> Take the Stage <p> Take the Stage is a classic hot red . <h> Run the Show <p> Run the Show is a beautiful and unique lilac shade . <h> Look Whos Talking <p> Look Who 's Talking is a warm terra-cotta brown . <p> The Only 1 Matte lipsticks boast high color payoff with a velvet matte finish and long lasting wear .

It 's also a thinner formula , which I have n't found in a lot of other matte lipsticks before . It truly feels weightless on the lips like I 'm not wearing anything at all . Because of that , it dries down pretty fast ( you can help it look matte faster by blotting once on a tissue ) and you 're left with a velvet matte finish very close to flat matte . Some shades look more " flat " than others , but these are the closest to a true matte finish that I 've found in all of the latest matte lip releases at the drugstore that are n't  liquid . <p> The wear time on these lipsticks are pretty good " I can get through one meal without having to reapply as long as it 's not too oily . There 's hardly any transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid 6-7 hours of wear with no touchups . These are also incredibly comfortable to wear all day . As I mentioned , they 're weightless but also moisturizing and I did n't  even have to exfoliate my lips prior to application to make them look and feel amazing . I will say though , that they are heavily perfumed . Its bearable for me , but still pretty strong so if that 's something you 're sensitive to , I might suggest passing . <p> Rimmel The Only 1 Matte lipsticks are starting to roll out to drugstores near you for about $7 each .

Please welcome Mai from Portrait of Mai , who 's taking over today with a topic that she knows a lot more about than I do ! Do n't  forget to show her love . xoxo Miranda <p> If you 're not familiar , hooded eyelids are an eye shape where the top of the eyelid folds over and acts as a " hood " , either partially or completely obscuring the eyelid . For me specifically , my eyes are also considered as having a " double eyelid " , a term generally associated with Asian eye shapes which refers to an eye shape that has a defined crease ( to differentiate against monolids ) . <p> These makeup tips for hooded eyes will be useful no matter what shape you have . I know my main issue with eye makeup in the past was that I was always trying to directly translate eye makeup done on other eye shapes onto mine without taking into consideration the differences . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye shape . <p> 1 <h> Tip 1 : Eyeshadow Primer is a Must for Longevity <p> Incorporating an eyeshadow primer into your routine will go a long way towards improving the longevity of your makeup . My eyeshadow has a tendency to crease if I do n't  wear an eye primer , so its been a staple in my makeup routine for years . My personal favorite budget primer pick is Milanis Eyeshadow Primer . It performs just as well as the Too Faced Shadow Insurance but does n't  separate the way that the Too Faced primer can . <h> Tip 3 : Apply Eyeshadow with your Eyes Open <p> One problem I used to have was that when I applied eyeshadow with my eyes closed , it would n't show with my eyes open . The solution ? Applying eyeshadow with my eyes open so I know exactly where my eyeshadow would actually appear . This let 's me make sure that I apply it exactly as high as I want it to show up . This is especially important when doing smokey eyes or cut-crease looks . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crease <p> To add dimension to your eyes , you can fake a crease by adding eyeshadow towards the top of your eyelid for a more dramatic look . I prefer applying a transition shade between my eyelid and brow bone and creating the " crease " with a smaller pencil brush , then blending it out . There are a lot of tutorials out there for how to create a cut crease look that you can follow . <p> 5 <h> Tip 5 : Set Eyeliner with Powder/Eyeshadow <p> When it comes to eyeliners and hooded eyelids , sometimes the eyeliner can transfer , or it wont last on your lower lash line . Setting your eyeliner with an eyeshadow can help stave off the breakdown off your eyeliner , and can prevent any transfer onto the eyelid . You can use any color eyeshadow you like and can even mix and match liners with shadow colors . <p> 6 <h> Tip 6 : Do n't  Forget Mascara on Your Lower Lashes <p> Though everyone always remembers applying mascara to the top lashes , applying mascara to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye makeup does n't  look too top-heavy . You can use any mascara you like , and use a fan brush for more control when you want to gradually build up product for more intense lashes.

It does a great job at prepping the skin for the rest of your makeup . When applying over makeup as a setting product , I suggest only using a tiny bit and applying it a patting motion as opposed to dragging over the face , which might pick up some of your foundation . I prefer using it under my makeup because it helps my face products last longer . I notice that my face stays matte all day without feeling dry , and I do n't find that I need to reapply this at all throughout the day . <p> There are only a few things that I do n't like about the mattifying balm . One thing I 've noticed is that it can sometimes crumble off of the sponge during application , so you 'll end up with little chunks of primer in your lap . You can use your fingers to avoid this happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands before using them to pick up makeup straight from the compact . Also , you 'll want to avoid opening the compact in dusty areas . The white surface is n't forgiving to any particles that get caught in the balm . Lastly , I usually like my primers to have SPF in them . <p> Overall , I think this balm is a really handy beauty product that works very well as a primer . It feels smooth on the face , and very lightweight . My makeup looks great on top of it and the mattifying effect lasts all day , keeping my face products in place . For just $6 , this is a steal compared to similar products from different brands . I packed it with me during my trip this weekend since it 's also very travel friendly .

How did your skin react to it ? <p> I have n't broken out which is a good sign . I also have combo skin with a rather oily t-zone and visible pores around my nose .

Which shapes are for which application techniques ? HOW MANY DO I NEED ? To be honest , there are only a handful of brushes that I would consider essentials , though my personal collection has taken over nearly three large brush holders from e.l.f . Cosmetics . <p> Even still , the brushes I reach for on a daily basis are pretty much your basic must-haves . <p> In this guide , I 'll go over the types of brushes you can start your collection with to cover all your bases , and suggestions for my personal favorites that are affordable to get you going . <p> Click on the picture of the brush to enlarge . <h> 1Flat Eyeshadow Brush ( aka Shader Brush ) <p> Use this brush to pack color onto your lid .

I typically like stiffer shader brushes that make it easy to pick up color . <h> 2Blending Brush <p> This is one of the most important eye brushes in my opinion ! The blending brush will blend out harsh lines and help your colors integrate flawlessly . Smaller versions of blending brushes are often referred to as crease brushes , and sometimes have a more tapered shape to work color into the socket . <h> 4Stippling Brush <p> This is my favorite brush to use with liquid foundation . Stippling on your foundation , which basically consists of patting the product onto the skin using the thin bristles , creates a pixel-perfect look . <h> 6Powder Brush <p> A round fluffy face brush is nice to have for applying powders or blending out face makeup . I often use a powder brush for applying translucent powder to set my look .. You could always use this for blush as well . <h> 7Lip/Concealer Brush <p> The great thing about a lip brush is that it doubles as a concealer brush , and vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I 'm sporting a dark or otherwise bold lip shade , I find applying with a brush a lot easier than using the stick itself because you can get right up to your lips ' outline . <h> 8Liner Brush <p> Eyeliner brushes are very thin and tapered so you can apply gel or cream eyeshadows with a lot of control . You can more commonly find them with normal bristles , but my favorite are actually made of silicone , since they give you a straight line every time and do n't fray after continued use ( they 're also way easier to clean ) . <h> 9Fan Brush <p> This one is the most recent addition in my collection , but it 's seriously a goof-proof way to apply powder highlight . Its flat shape keeps your application precise while the typically fluffy and flexible bristles blend the product out for a smooth finish . You can also use it for translucent powder or subtle applications of other face products . <h> 10Smudge Brush <p> These come in a variety of shapes but are typically short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them most for blending shadow along my lash lines for a smoky look , but use the ones that have more of an edge to them for creating my cut crease eyeshadow looks . <h> 11Blending Sponge <p> To get the most flawless foundation application , you 'll want to use a damp sponge for seamless blending . No , you do n't need the Original Beauty Blender to get the job done " there are plenty of affordable ones on the market which work just as well that are a better value , especially when you want to be replacing them every four months or so . <p> If you 're starting your brush collection from scratch , buying a set is a better value than buying brushes individually .

I could n't resist the gorgeous clean , foiled packaging , and still wanted to judge for myself . <p> At $12.50 , the Illuminate by Ashley Tisdale Night Goddess Palette is an awesome value with 9 eyeshadows , a bronzer , highlight and blush . There 's a mix of shimmers , satins and mattes to create a full eye look , and you can finish it off with the face powders that give you a luminous look . <p> Out of the nine shadows , there is a balance between deeper sultry shades and light delicate shades . You can mix and match to create gorgeous nighttime smoky eyes , or subtle every day looks . <p> Everything 's housed in a sturdy cardboard palette with magnetic closure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly . <p> I 'll say off the bat : the texture of the shades are a bit inconsistent .

As for the face powders , they all have great pigmentation and blend easily . It 's important to note that they are all shimmery ( the bronzer a little less so ) but enough for a pretty glow " no tacky sparkles here ! Each of the swatches you see above are about two swipes of each shade . <p> Now usually , I do n't really make time to build up sheer shadows , but this palette still stands out to me a lot .

I used After Dark as a transition shade and Twilight on the brow bone . I lined my upper lid with 4AM using a small angled brush , and the whole eye look was effortless . <p> The Illuminate by Ashley Tisdale Night Goddess Palette is a great option for those who like to experiment but need a palette a little more fool-proof .

Right around that time , the brand released the much anticipated sequel : Revealed 2 . The first collection of 20 eyeshadows quickly became popular , not only for the low price point , but the close resemblance to shades from Urban Decay 's Naked 1 &amp; 2 palettes . You can probably guess where the inspiration may have come from for Revealed 2 at first glance . <p> The general theme of Revealed 2 is warmer browns and pinks . The 20 new shades come in the same cardboard packaging with a magnetic closure . Again , I really wish there was a mirror on the inside , purely for travel purposes . <p> Overall , the pigmentation of the shadows has improved since the first Revealed palette . While the lighter shadows are still somewhat powdery , they do lay down more color . The improvement of the matte black shade is most noticeable between the two palettes ; this one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we see a better balance between matte and satin finishes ( 2 more mattes ! ) , but with the addition of a few sparkle shades . While I appreciate the added variety , the glitter in the sparkle shadows is chunky and makes application patchy ; they need a few layers to look smooth . Hopefully they will improve upon these as they did with the other shades , which are silky soft . <p> After browsing what seemed like hundreds of swatches , I 've identified a dupe , or very similar shade , for each shadow in the Naked 3 palette to exist in Revealed 2 . To be honest , I think the variety in Revealed 2 is better than Naked 3 , with the presence of a couple taupes to relieve us from too many rosy colors .

The price ranges from $13-$15 online and in beauty supply stores such as Sallys . Using this once a week will still save you a TON of moolah if you 're used to getting regular treatments at the salon . It claims to last for 46 applications but if you have thinner hair , you 'll be able to stretch it even farther . <p> I will definitely continue to use this until I 'm scraping the bottom of the humungous jar .

@@9946436 @3146436/ <h> REVIEW : Pixi Glow Tonic <p> If you 've been following my journey to clear skin , you might be familiar with some of the products I 've been using religiously . This is the first time that I 've stuck to a pretty regular routine , with the exception of a couple products I 'm testing for the blog . In my last skin care update video , I mentioned that I 've started using the highly acclaimed Pixi Glow Tonic . <p> The Pixi Glow Tonic is an alcohol-free toner that exfoliates and helps to tone , firm and tighten the skin . It contains ingredients that are notorious for their super skin benefits , such as : <p> aloe vera ( moisturizes , anti-aging ) <p> witch hazel ( treats acne ) <p> glycolic acid ( exfoliates ) <p> ginseng extract ( skin regeneration ) <p> Before anything else , let me quickly go over the difference between toner and astringent . Both used to cleanse the skin , toners are typically milder and omit alcohol , which is what makes astringents so drying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to know the difference so you can use what is best for your skin . Astringents always feel too harsh for my combo skin , making my dry patches drier and leaving my face feeling parched . I had given up on them , without knowing that toners are completely different and more geared toward my skin type . <p> With that being said , the Pixi Glow Tonic gently removes excess oil and dirt , but also helps maintain and balance the natural oil and acidity in my skin . It actually makes my combo skin feel normal , and I do n't need to use as heavy a moisturizer for my face to feel hydrated . Since my face is n't stripped , I do maintain a natural looking glow that makes my skin look healthy . <p> Because I 'm using it alongside my prescription topical , I ca n't speak to the effect this toner has had on my acne . However , I have noticed one difference that makes this product godsend for me . <p> Within a matter of weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would n't budge " even after my acne healed completely " started to lighten ! Those spots had caused me so much grief , because they made my skin look blemished even though there was no acne in that area anymore . I was so pleased with how even my skin was looking , and I do n't have to pile on the concealer in that area anymore . I think the Glow Tonic has also played a big part in the prevention of dark spots forming where I still have some problem areas , which is half the battle when dealing with acne . <p> Even though I am hooked on this toner , there 's one characteristic that took me a long time to get used to : the smell . Oh dear , does this have a very strong fragrance . It smells heavily of rose perfume , and it lingers . I would n't say that I 'm particularly sensitive to fragrances , but it took me about a month to stop wincing at the scent . If you shy away from scented skin care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Pixi made an unscented version , I would hoard the stuff . <p> I 've just been using witch hazel since all the toners I 've tried are either greasy or drying . I love witch hazel . However hyperpigmentation has always been the bane of my existence I might have to give this stuff a try ! ! Thanks for the tip ! ! = <p> I want this product HARD , and though my Target carries Pixi , I 've never seen the toner Glow Tonic on the shelf . I guess I should order online . Glycolic acid is legit and I suspect it could help my hyper pigmentation and post-blemish scars too ! Oh-and thanks for the heads up on the smell !

Lipclick Matte Full Cover Lipsticks . This little tubes won me over immediately with their small , purse friendly size and how bold the shades seemed . Do n't be fooled , though , you 're getting an average amount of lipstick , just without excess packaging that makes all your other tubes taller . Another pro about the tubes is that the tops close with a magnetic *click* to keep them secure . <p> The shades available currently are Siren : a classic cool red , Vixen : a deep purple-toned berry , and Starlet : a hot fuchsia pink .

When I apply at a diagonal angle , the colors are blurred slightly into each other for a holographic appearance when the light hits your cheek . If you 're not looking closely , it could just seem like a really nice dramatic highlight , but the color appears at just the right moment for a complimentary pop . <p> You can find the Bitzy rainbow highlighter at Sally Beauty for $5.75 I 'm still waiting for it to pop back up on the website , but they had a stack of them at my local store in Los Angeles .

Beautifully Bare Foundation Serum ( $8 ) is the first foundation from the brand that I 've tried . It 's important to me that my face makeup not only makes my skin look great , but also protects it . That 's why I 'm really glad that they included SPF 25 sunscreen in this foundation . The consistency is extremely liquidy " it will run off the back of your hand pretty quickly if you 're not careful . I find applying with the brands own Stipple Brush to be the most effective .

Overall , I like this foundation for light days where I just want to even things out and get moving . <p> There are two new mascaras in this collection . The Beautifully Bare Lash Tint Mascara ( $4 ) has a very small , skinny brush with short bristles . It reminds me very much of the It Cosmetics Tightline ( I will probably compare the two in a dupe post soon ) . The small brush let 's you get extremely close to your lash line and essentially tightline while applying a thin coat of mascara to your lashes . This would be great for those with lighter lashes who want to darken them without adding much length or volume , or if you just want a little definition to look more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defining Mascara ( $4 ) is a great go-to , and I consider it a hybrid between a comb and brush wand . The bristles are hard , yet flexible and dense .

These thin cream blushes are rather sheer but buildable , and give a very natural sheen of color to the cheeks . There are currently two shades , Rose Royalty ( left swatch ) and Peach Perfection ( right swatch ) . They dry with a powder finish which still offers a healthy glow to the face and forgoes having to set them with extra product . They blend very easily and last as long as the foundation does when applied on top . <p> Lastly we have the new Beautifully Bare Blending Brush ( $6 ) , which can be used with liquids , powders or creams . It is wide and fluffy with flexible bristles that are shaped flat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush more suitable for blush or bronzer than foundations .

Studio Eyebrow Kit and the Studio Matte Lip Color in Praline . They create the absolute perfect no-makeup makeup look for me , and will be often reached for this season . <p> Check out the e.l.f .

Case in point : cushion foundation . It 's been a thing in Asia forever , but we 're only just starting to see it in the mainstream here recently .

While Light/Medium is a close match to me , it 's still a little too pink . <p> Another thing that sort of disappointed me was the fact that Physicians Formula wo n't be selling cushion refills of this product .

Personally , I like the NYX one even a bit better because of its consistency , and how it layers nicely when putting more product over it . I also prefer the wand applicator to the MUFE squeeze tube , because you can be more precise about how much product you 're using . Overall , I 'd definitely recommend trying the NYX HD Concealer first if you can find your shade . <h> Foundations : <p> As far as packaging goes , the foundation tells a different story as I prefer the MUFE pump style rather than the NYX squeeze tube .

The MUFE foundation is a drier formula than the NYX one , and kept oil away much more effectively , while I started to feel a little bit of oil in my T-Zone on the NYX side when testing side-by-side . However , they both maintained their finish and coverage throughout the day . <p> I also felt that while the NYX side held on to blush and bronzer longer than the MUFE foundation , it was also harder to blend product on top of , since it takes a while to dry down . <p> As I mentioned in the video , I would definitely classify these as dupes .

I experienced only slight fading throughout the day . <p> The TruBlend Bronzer was more of a puzzle . When I hear the word " bronzer " I think of a product that will add color to the face , perhaps even something I can use to contour with . To be honest , this is something I can only use as a highlight at least in the medium shade . Do n't  get me wrong , the shade is really pretty and again adds a soft glow without turning you into a disco ball . The gold sheen looks particularly great paired with the TruBlend blush , too . But yeah , not enough color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronzer unless I was super pale . <p> Regardless of the name faux-pas with the " bronzer , " both of these products have made their way into my everyday routines . I love that I can just pat on the blush lightly for some natural-looking color , or go all out and make it the statement of my look . I 'll continue to use the bronzer as a highlight because I really like the more natural glow it gives off , rather than a strobing look . <p> I am always sucked in by the marbled beauty of baked products , but not all of them perform . And , i do n't  want to be applying a baked blush or bronzer wet ! These look great , and I love the " bronzed " highlight ! 
@@9946462 @3146462/ <h> Drugstore Must-Haves : Physicians Formula Bronze Booster Palettes <p> This post has been sponsored by Physicians Formula . All opinions are my own . <p> I 'm pretty critical of contour and highlighting palettes . I think it takes a lot to make them great " you need the right shades , the right amount of blendability , and of course pigmentation . When the Physicians Formula Bronze Booster Highlight &amp; Contour palettes were revealed earlier this year , I got to see them up close and personal right before launch . If you did n't catch me on the brand 's Instagram story , I was literally squealing with excitement because these , my friends , are drugstore gems . When I first posted about them on Instagram back in March , it seemed you all were just as stoked . So let 's take a closer look , shall we ? <p> The palettes , available on the Physicians Formula site and in stores at Rite Aid , come in two versions : Shimmer Glow and Matte Sculpting . As the name suggests , one has entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones while the other is solely for contouring and adding dimension to the face . I think both are must-haves , as they work very well together to create a spotlight-ready look . <p> The Bronze Booster Palette in Matte Sculpting has three shades : a warm , deep brown , a cool medium brown and a light eggshell shade . I typically mix the two contour options to get my perfect sculpting shade . The deep shade brings the pigmentation while the cool shade neutralizes it for a more natural look . Or , use them separately depending on your skin tone and the result you 're looking for . If you want to do a subtle highlight , or want to set luminizing concealer , the eggshell shade will come in clutch . <p> Then , we have the Bronze Booster Palette in Shimmer Glow . My oh my , was this exciting when I first laid eyes on it . Again , we have three shades : a warm bronze with gold shimmer , a champagne shimmer , and a straight up white glowy shade . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and knew I 'd be reaching for it when I want a show-stopping glow . <p> How I use the palettes : <p> First , I mix the two contour shades in the Matte Sculpting palette together , and blend them into the hollows of my cheeks using the included brush . <p> Next , I apply my blush of choice . For this look , I used the Physicians Formula Butter Blush in Rosy Pink . <p> For glam looks , I 'll top off the look using the lightest highlight shade in the Shimmer Glow palette . For more natural or everyday looks , I 'll use the middle champagne shade . <p> Both palettes have knockout formulas . The Matte Sculpting palette has the texture similar to the brand 's Butter Blush : smooth , soft and blendable . Shimmer Glow has a little bit more of a creamier feel to it , but the brush still picks up and blends the shades easily . <p> While the palettes can be used for everyday subtle face contouring , I find myself going all out with them because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contouring that I love for glam looks that I 've been able to achieve with drugstore products . Side note : the brush included with the palettes ( which is stored in a hidden compartment under the pans ) is actually decent !

I already hit pan on the eggshell highlighting and the middle cool medium brown contour shades . That middle contour shade is THE ONE Ive been searching for . Its just perfect for fair to light skinned girls . Not too muddy and not too orange .

Today , I 'm going to show you the brand new Pressed Mineral Bronzers that were just released online today ! <p> The bronzers come in sleek , black compact packaging " exactly like the new Mineral Pressed Blushes . They contain .14 oz of product and there are four shades currently available . <p> Baked Peach is definitely a highlight shade , and gives off a champagne-pink , shimmery glow . <p> Tan Toffee is aptly named , because that is exactly what the shade resembles . It has warm undertones , and is the only matte bronzer of the bunch . <p> Caramel Cabana is a warm gingerbread color with shimmer that gives it a golden sheen .

Compared to the Contouring Blush &amp; Bronzer duo , one of my favorites from e.l.f. , these are like butter . <p> The bronzers are lightweight , and you can build up the color to get stronger color payoff and longer wear time . With a heavy hand at bronzing , I did experience some fading throughout the day , so I 'd suggest using a setting spray . <p> I really hope that e.l.f . expands this line with more matte shades , since I tend to favor matte bronzer for contouring although they probably contain the same amount of shimmer as the Contouring Blush &amp; Bronzer duo , so I ca n't complain too much . At least the glitter in these bronzers is fine and give Baked Peach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These would be fantastic for adding color and radiance to the face . <p> The e.l.f .

Shades 1-6 are more neutral tones , while 7-12 are all about the drama . <p> Believe it or not , I 've been reaching for these more than the new Milani Color Statement Matte Lipsticks , because the formula is so comfortable ( even though I realize they 're sister companies ) .

Very little touching up is required , even with eating ! I find myself only needing to dab a little bit towards the center of my lips after a meal , and I 'm good to go with strong color . The shade selection is on point in my opinion , with the classic lip wardrobe staples , as well as the brighter spring colors that are hot this season .

Plus , as long as you take care of them and make it a point to wash them regularly , they can last you years . However , it 's always an awesome feeling to score high quality brushes at a drugstore price . <p> I first came across SOHO brushes at Walgreens a couple years ago , when I was in desperate need for a new blending brush . Their Pro Crease Brush became my favorite eye brush that I still use daily . <p> SOHO just released their Naturals line of brushes that are soft , high-performing , and most importantly : affordable . They all have a fashionable bamboo handle with super soft , cruelty-free nylon bristles that wo n't soak up much product and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from recycled materials . <p> First up we have the SOHO Naturals Blush Brush ( $10 ) and Powder Brush ( $10 ) . These are both dense brushes that can pick up a bunch of product and diffuse it across the face easily . The Powder Brush has a large , round shape that can cover a lot of surface area at once . The Blush Brush comes to a very subtle taper for more precise application of blush . <p> The Naturals line includes two new kabuki brushes that are both unique . The SOHO Naturals Kabuki Brush ( $13 ) is a large standard kabuki with fluorescent pink bristles that are incredibly soft . The wide base makes it easy to grip and , again , the bristles are dense but flexible . The SOHO Retractable Kabuki Brush ( $15 ) has a slightly smaller brush head that will slide into its handle and fit into the matching bamboo cap . This is a great way to carry a brush with you on the go without worrying about damage or getting it dirty . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOHO Naturals 3-Piece Smoky Eye Set ( $12 ) includes three must-have eye brushes for every look : a wide all over eyeshadow brush , a thin angled eyeliner brush ( which can also be used to fill in and define your brows ) , and a stiffer smudge brush to really smoke out your shadows and eyeliner . The SOHO Naturals 6-Piece Fresh Face Set ( $17 ) is the best value , as it has all the basics for a full face of makeup . It includes the same three brushes from the Smoky Eye set , as well as a flat foundation brush , a loose stipple brush for powders , plus an orange brush pouch for traveling . You might as well pay the extra $5 for this bundle instead of the Smoky Eye Set , since it comes with those same three eye brushes plus the two for the face and a case . <p> Each brush and brush set come with a tutorial on the back showing you how to use the brushes for the best application . They all pick up so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly soft .

Since I 've had luck with so many other Milani products , I dove in , eager to find my next go-to . <p> The Milani Conceal + Perfect 2-in-1 Foundation + Concealer claims to be a multitasking product , offering both spot concealing and/or a full face base , however you choose to use it . It 's currently available in fourteen shades , which is quite a large range for a drugstore line ! <p> The bottle has a really convenient pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much product you 're using and you definitely do n't need a lot with this foundation . It has a pretty thick formula that 's very creamy , but still blends into the skin easily with a buffing brush ( I 've been using the Sigma 3DHD Kabuki for a while now ) . <p> So right off the bat , this is the most full-coverage drugstore foundation I 've ever tried ! Two pumps covers my blemishes , lightens my dark under-eyes , conceals redness and gives me a super even complexion to build my look on . I still occasionally use my NYX HD Concealer in Green to color correct underneath , but even on its own , this foundation packs a punch . On days I do n't need as much coverage , a lighter application is possible with a damp sponge , but either way you 'll never get a cakey look . <p> Now , you may know that I have combination skin . Dry patches around my chin , but I can get pretty oily in my t-zone ( even moreso when we battle 90+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) . The finish of this foundation is slightly dewy , so I do have to set it with translucent powder after application . I still end up getting moderately oily by the end of the day in my t-zone while wearing this , but surprisingly the coverage holds up for almost a full eight hours , with only a little breakdown on my forehead and around the nose . If I blot during the day , the breakdown is less . Because of the dewy finish , I do n't tend to highlight very much when wearing this foundation since it maintains a visible glow . <p> For just around $10 , the Milani Conceal + Perfect 2-in-1 Foundation + Concealer is a great option when you 've got a lot to cover but still want a natural skin finish look . If you have normal/dry skin , or you do n't mind blotting throughout the day , it 's definitely worth the try .

In the past ten years , my naturally loose waves have blossomed into full blown frizzy curls , and my once dreadfully oily locks now constantly beg for moisture . One friend recommended that I start co-washing , or conditioner washing , solely using conditioner to wash my hair . Since most conditioners contain some type of cleansing agent in them already , this method has been popular in the curly hair community to clean while keeping hair hydrated with minimum frizz . <p> I wanted to find out more , so I spoke to Taryn Devlin , hairstylist and cosmetologist at Best Face Forward Makeup Studio in Brooklyn , NY , who told me all I needed to know about the hair care regimen . Read on to discover if you , too , should start co-washing your hair . <h> What is co-washing ? <p> Taryn : Co-Washing is a method of cleansing your hair with a cleansing conditioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound absurd to most , but this method of cleansing if done correctly can be beneficial to your hair ! Adding co-washing to your hair regimen is perfect if you have locks that tangle and/or dry out after a shampoo . <h> Should I be co-washing my hair ? <p> Co-washing is ultimately meant to cure dry and damaged hair , so if your hair is dry in general or from chemical treatments like relaxers or colors , co-washing can restore the moisture you 're looking for . If you have oily hair , co-washing is not for you . Oily hair types require shampooing to get your hair back from stringy to fluffy , and co-washing simply wont cut it . If you have any abnormal skin conditions on your scalp , co-washing may irritate or even worsen it . If you 're prescribed any shampoo by a dermatologist , never eliminate it to co-wash ! <h> What types of conditioners can I use ? <p> While there are tons of cleansing conditioners popping up in salons and drugstores , you can always use a regular one , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients , as these will actually build up on your scalp instead of cleanse it . Silicone or synthetic ingredients usually end in -cone . Also , deep conditioners are not for co-washing . Deep conditioners contain more ingredients that stick to your hair and are meant to treat freshly shampooed tresses . Whether you use cleansing conditioner or a regular one , the majority of the conditioner should always be rinsed out of your hair . <h> How frequently should I co-wash my hair ? <p> The idea in co-washing is to add moisture to your hair and cleanse , whereas shampooing is primarily to cleanse only .

In the past ten years , my naturally loose waves have blossomed into full blown frizzy curls , and my once dreadfully oily locks now constantly beg for moisture . One friend recommended that I start co-washing , or conditioner washing , solely using conditioner to wash my hair . Since most conditioners contain some type of cleansing agent in them already , this method has been popular in the curly hair community to clean while keeping hair hydrated with minimum frizz . <p> I wanted to find out more , so I spoke to Taryn Devlin , hairstylist and cosmetologist at Best Face Forward Makeup Studio in Brooklyn , NY , who told me all I needed to know about the hair care regimen . Read on to discover if you , too , should start co-washing your hair . <h> What is co-washing ? <p> Taryn : Co-Washing is a method of cleansing your hair with a cleansing conditioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound absurd to most , but this method of cleansing if done correctly can be beneficial to your hair ! Adding co-washing to your hair regimen is perfect if you have locks that tangle and/or dry out after a shampoo . <h> Should I be co-washing my hair ? <p> Co-washing is ultimately meant to cure dry and damaged hair , so if your hair is dry in general or from chemical treatments like relaxers or colors , co-washing can restore the moisture you 're looking for . If you have oily hair , co-washing is not for you . Oily hair types require shampooing to get your hair back from stringy to fluffy , and co-washing simply wont cut it . If you have any abnormal skin conditions on your scalp , co-washing may irritate or even worsen it . If you 're prescribed any shampoo by a dermatologist , never eliminate it to co-wash ! <h> What types of conditioners can I use ? <p> While there are tons of cleansing conditioners popping up in salons and drugstores , you can always use a regular one , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients , as these will actually build up on your scalp instead of cleanse it . Silicone or synthetic ingredients usually end in -cone . Also , deep conditioners are not for co-washing . Deep conditioners contain more ingredients that stick to your hair and are meant to treat freshly shampooed tresses . Whether you use cleansing conditioner or a regular one , the majority of the conditioner should always be rinsed out of your hair . <h> How frequently should I co-wash my hair ? <p> The idea in co-washing is to add moisture to your hair and cleanse , whereas shampooing is primarily to cleanse only . So anyone who co-washes should do so in relation to how dry your hair is after its been a few days since the last co-wash .

You get full coverage color with just one swipe . One thing you 'll notice that I do n't  particularly like is the scent .

Because it just proves yet again that you do n't  have to splurge to get a powerhouse of a product . The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is n't just an anti-aging cream . It helps with moisture , skin texture and tone , and protection and will give you instant gratification while also keeping you proactive about anti-aging , proving itself later down the line .

@@9946499 @3146499/ <h> 5 Hair Hacks to Make Curls Last <p> Putting big , bouncy curls in my hair is one of my favorite style go-tos for special events and parties . They 're flirty , fun , and versatile for all sorts of occasions when you want a little more liveliness to your hairstyle . However , as easy as they can be to put in with the right curling iron , it can be a struggle to make curls last throughout the day . <p> Unless you 're blessed with naturally textured hair , you 're probably going to need a little extra help to make your hair hold its curl . Here are five hair hacks that can help curls last longer so you can show off your hair from day to night . <h> 1 . Curl on Second-Day Hair <p> When your hair is freshly washed , it tends to have more slip to it and can have a little more trouble holding styles . Second day hair usually takes to style more quickly and holds on to it longer . If there 's a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wash your hair one to two days ahead of time so that you have some texture to it by the time you 're curling . <h> 2 . Pin While Cooling <p> Here 's a classic technique that still works wonders ! After releasing a new curl from the iron , catch it in your hand and pin it against your head with a bobby pin or duckbill clips . Keep the curl coiled " you can use your finger to get it wrapped tightly . Let your curls set while pinned and let down only once they 're completely cool . Depending on the look you 're going for , you can shake or comb them out for a looser bounce . <h> 3 . Let Curls Cool Before Styling <p> Before you take your curls and manipulate them into whatever final style you 'll be wearing , let them cool completely . When you pin or tie it up while the hair is still warm , you risk stretching or denting the curls , which will just take more time to correct later . I personally curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then go back to do final touches . <h> 4 . Curl in Smaller Sections <p> Working your iron in smaller sections ( with whatever size iron you normally use ) will help create longer lasting curls . You might start out looking a little like Shirley Temple , but no fear " wait for the curls to completely cool , then shake out your hair by running your fingers through it . You can also run a wide-tooth comb through the curls to transform them into larger , voluminous curls that you wo n't have to worry about falling flat . <h> 5 . Use Styling Sprays <p> The right combination of styling sprays can help prolong your style without the crunchy feel or plastic appearance . I would suggest starting out with a heat protection spray and a light mist of texturizing spray ( dry shampoo works , too ) before curling . Once the curls are cool and your hair is styled , a medium-strong hold hairspray that still leaves a natural feel is perfect for finishing the look and making your curls last .

They support your look and can really make all the difference in how your makeup comes together . So I 'm pretty happy with how much attention brows are getting among the latest makeup releases . <p> Most recently , I 've been playing around with the new e.l.f . Lock On Liner &amp; Brow Cream . As the name hints , they can be used as both a cream liner and brow product and are supposed to really last . I was excited but unsure how theyd work on me , since the Lock On Gel Liner pencils did n't really wow me last year . But , these showed up on my doorstep just as I ran out of my previous brow pencil , so I gave them a shot . <p> There are four shades currently available , going lightest to darkest they are : Taupe Blonde , Light Brown , Medium Brown , and Espresso . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practical when doubling as liner , but all are neutral enough to work with many different hair colors for filling in brows . I 've personally been using Medium Brown which , despite the name , I find to be a cool toned dark brown . <p> Left to right : Taupe Blonde , Medium Brown , Light Brown , Espresso <p> The formula of the Lock On Liner &amp; Brow Cream is soft but thin , but has enough substance to stay put precisely where you apply . They are similar to the wax you get in the e.l.f . Eyebrow Kit but definitely creamier . The cream is really easy to blend through the brow hairs and fill in sparse space , and is also rather pigmented " a light hand can go a long way with this product . I personally use the e.l.f . Eyebrow Duo Brush , applying the cream with the small angled side and brushing it through for a more natural look with the spoolie . <p> You can go natural or super bold with this product , depending on your mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looks . I 've found it to last all day on myself , living up to its Lock On name , with only very minimal fading after 8 hours ( but still nothing that compromises how on point my brows look ) . I 've also caught myself wiping or scratching my brow during the day after applying the cream , and there 's very little transfer . <p> I have n't used it as a liner yet , partially because I 'm hesitant to use a potted product on both my eyelids and my brow area , but perhaps I 'm worried over nothing . Either way , the e.l.f . Lock On Liner &amp; Brow Cream is a definite hit with my brows and something I can see myself purchasing again and again in the future especially since its only $4 ! <h> 27 COMMENTS <p> One , my favorite , is the e.l.f . eyebrow duo brush which is only $3 .

I wish there were a bigger selection . No shades for redheads , and the medium is pretty dark . I still get it to work . I actually think this holds up better on my oily skin than ABH Dipbrow .

I know I 'm not the only one out there battling a stubborn head of hair on a daily basis , so I 'm excited to introduce you to a brand I 've only just discovered , myself . <p> Hask is a hair care brand that will wow you with their quality and double wow you with their low prices . Their products are made without parabens , sulfates , phthalates , gluten , alcohol or artificial colors . They are color-safe , and they are not tested on animals . So much good news ! <p> I 've been testing the Hask Argan Oil form Morocco collection , and I feel like the line was made for me . All of the products performed well with my thick , dry hair and had a citrus scent that was light and refreshing . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles that are thin and sleek , great for tight spaces ( believe me , with all of the products in my shower and the lack of ledges , this is important ! ) . The shampoo offers some suds to help spread it around , and absorbs quickly into the hair shafts . It 's lightweight and gentle , suitable for even the most sensitive scalps . The conditioner , though , holy cow . This conditioner is thiiiiick , which I love . It has the consistency of cake icing which is so perfect for people with a lot of thick hair , just like me . It seriously feels like you 're getting a deep condition each time you use it , and you do n't need a lot . This duo left my hair hydrated , soft and glossy . <p> The Intense Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment- has the same thick consistency as the Repairing Conditioner . It comes in a packet that contains 1.75 oz , which holds about two uses for me . This treatment really revitalized my hair , which has been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my split ends looked almost nonexistent after using this . The packet is not resealable , which is a bit of a bummer . I think Hask should package this treatment in larger quantities , perhaps in bottles or jars . <p> Last , but certainly not least , is the Healing Shine Hair Treatment. - This oil tames frizz , hydrates and protects the hair , leaving it silky smooth without adding residue or heaviness . I have used it on my wet hair , which helped add a beautiful shine once dried . It 's also great to use before heat styling or to revive second day hair . <p> Overall , this collection performed like a high-end line but without the high-end price tag . The products worked well together to really tame my unruly hair . Usually after brushing my curls out of second day hair , its frizz city up in here ! The Argan Oil collection helped make my hair manageable . I definitely need to hunt these down in stores , although it 's comforting to know I can also order Hask products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Walmart , Walgreens , Rite Aid , CVS and KMart . Learn more about Hask and browse their other collections on HaskBeauty.com . <p> I just saw this at walmart and i have shoulder length very dry dull hair that is not color treated but has a TON of frizz and flyaways and my salon has had me try different salon top price products that work for a about n hr that 's it i am wondering if this might work ? ? ? ? and and suggestions thanks so much . i bought the hask argan oil intensive treatment package . <p> Just in case there are some Canadians reading , you can get the whole line at Shoppers Drug Mart , Sobeys grocery stores ( random ) and Rexall , if you do n't  live in the East/dont have a SDM nearby . The more you know , eh ? = <p> I think the shampoo and hair treatment oil would work fine for you , because they 're lightweight and gentle ! I 'd just be very light handed with the conditioners because they 're thicker . The packet that lasted me 2 uses might last you 5 !

@@9946515 @3146515/ <h> e.l.f . Studio Blending Brush vs. e.l.f . Studio Crease Brush <p> In the past few months , e.l.f . finally added a couple new brushes to their studio line : the blending brush and crease brush . I 've talked about the blending brush in a previous video , but I specifically wanted to compare these two . Depending on your makeup routine , you may want one over the other or both ! <p> Let 's start with the Studio Blending Brush . This is a particularly unique blending brush to e.l.f . in that it has a pinched barrel to flatten out the bristles . The shape allows it to place color easily into your crease or onto your lid . It 's still pretty dense and fluffy , but basically resembles a huge shader brush . It has enough flexibility to blend well , mostly in a side-to-side motion . <p> I originally said that while this brush has a specific job in my routine ( mostly placing color directly into the crease and softening that line ) , I prefer something a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A couple weeks ago , e.l.f . followed up with the new Studio Crease Brush . This is a thin brush with long bristles that taper to a slight point at the end . The barrel of the brush is round and the bristles are flexible , which makes for easy circular blending to achieve a diffused look . Since it 's rather small , you 're able to place color exactly where you want it . This brush , to me , is what I consider to be a blending brush just a bit narrower . <p> So which brush should you get ? Well , in theory , you could really purchase both for different uses since they 're so affordable . But if you 're really trying to narrow it down , here 's my overview : <p> You 'll like the Studio Blending Brush if you tend to blend in a windshield wiper motion . It can also double as a large shader brush for applying shadow to the lid . Because of the flat shape , this brush does n't stop at eyeshadow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , too . If you want a multi-purpose brush , this is it ! <p> You 'll like the Studio Crease Brush if you blend in circular motions like I do . It 's small and tapered enough to blend color precisely into your crease , as well as the lower lash line . This one is easier for me to work with when blending out transition and crease shades because of the shape . <h> 28 COMMENTS <p> Ive been really liking the shape of the Coastal Scents Classic Blender Crease brush with natural bristles for blending in and around my crease . But , I like using my Classic Blender ( shaped like ELFs Blending Brush ) for doing my highlight shade and blending shadow above the crease . The only thing Ive really liked using my ELF Blending Brush for is blending and softening cream eyeshadows up thru and above the crease . <p> I spoke with someone at e.l.f . and it seems that they had to pull some items off the website because they were out of stock and backordered , theyll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconvenience ! <p> I 've never tried the MAC brushes but I have heard that the elf Studio blending brush is a good dupe for the 217 ! Overall the Studio line has some great high performing brushes . The essentials line can be hit or miss . <p> I just bought the blending brush , and I have used it only a few times , but I like it ! I tend to blend in a wiping motion , and this brush is surprisingly soft ! I have a Bdellium brush for blending that is awfully scratchy compared to this inexpensive one . I will pick up the crease brush at the next sale !

Its been a while since I 've branched out into lesser-known brands , and I always love discovering hidden gems in the beauty world . Recently , I was introduced to Glamour Dolls Makeup , a relatively new brand created by makeup artist Jessica Romano , best known as part of the Glam Fairy team on the Style Network series . What made her collection of products stand out to me , aside from the ultra-cute packaging , was that each item was under $5 ! <p> My first experience with the brand has been their tubes of Gloss Snob . The name is just perfect for me , because you all know how picky I am about lip gloss . I rarely wear it because there are so few formulas that I can actually stand . I am definitely a self proclaimed #GlossSnob . <p> The glosses come in squeze tubes with a slanted plastic applicator . I would not suggest applying straight to your lips from the tube you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . A lip brush was mandatory for me in order to get even application ; it was like night and day compared to when I applied straight from the tube . If you apply too much , the excess product will slide and gather around your lips . With that being said , the Gloss Snobs are surprisingly pigmented . You hardly need a pea-sized amount to get full coverage color , even with the two light shades I have : Dollicious and Topless . <p> Dollicious is a baby doll pink that I can see working for a variety of skin tones . Its a very wearable shade while still offering that pop of color to play up a look . <p> Topless is a unique shade in my personal collection ! A light beige shade with pink undertones , this nude makes a statement all its own . I think it would compliment a dramatic eye look very well . <p> Gloss Snobs have a very comfortable formula that is not sticky in the least bit . When they set , they feel balmy . Even still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack so much color , pigment will bunch around dry patches if you have them . To get the best application , use a lip scrub prior to wearing , and do n't  forget to apply with your favorite lip brush . This will lend for smooth and even coverage . Ive been carrying my Real Techniques Retractable Lip Brush around with me when I wear the Gloss Snobs for easy on-the-go touch ups . Since they are a gloss , after all , transferring is inevitable . However , while sipping on a cup of water ( but without eating ) , I get three to four hours out of the color not bad at all ! I was even left with a lip stain from Dollicious once the glossiness wore off . <p> So what does this gloss snob think of the Glamour Dolls Makeup Gloss Snobs ? Once I figured out how to best apply them ( seriously , I ca n't stress exfoliation and using a lip brush enough ) , I really came to like these glosses !

My skin did NOT like the sudden change . Can you say dry patches and peeling galore ? Not cute for my travel photos ! <p> Luckily , I had packed the Pulsaderm Buddy with me . This small cleansing brush is perfect for travel , as it 's lightweight , waterproof , and fits right into your palm . Its rechargeable battery ( which can be charged from a wall outlet OR a USB ) holds power well . It lasted about 20 days before needing to be recharged ! <p> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush heads " one for normal skin , and one for sensitive skin . I particularly preferred the sensitive head to use with the Buddy 's pulsing vibrations for effective cleansing and exfoliation . <p> As soon as I noticed my skin clashing with London 's environment , I ditched my makeup and and took the Buddy to my face with some Pond 's Cold Cream . I moved the brush in circular motions slowly on my cheeks and chin ( the problem areas ) as well as my forehead . After rinsing , my skin looked and felt better immediately . My face was smooth , even , and a perfect foundation for makeup . I repeated this about every other day on the trip to keep everything in check , and my travel photos were saved . <p> I liked that the Pulsaderm Buddy brush pulses rather than spins , because it feels more gentle than those that spin . However , I will admit that even the sensitive brush head feels harsh at times . I kept the pulsing on the lowest setting of two so not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Sensitive brush head for delicate skin , which I think might work better for me . <p> The brush does a really thorough job at scrubbing off all of your makeup ; you can see it on the brush right away . Ive been using it with the cold cream ever since the trip as my main method of makeup removal , because I 'm sick of wipes not getting the job done . Depending on your foundation , this can make the bristles start to look dingy , so you have to be sure to clean the brush thoroughly with antibacterial soap between uses . After a while , you might start to see staining . Cleaning it frequently will keep it looking good for as long as possible . ( In the above picture , the brush head I 've been using is on the left , and you can see how my foundation has tinged it a bit compared to the unused brush ) <p> I ca n't deny how much the Pulsaderm Buddy helped keep my skin looking great while traveling and far after my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush head replacements cost $22 . This system does ring in to be cheaper in the long run than the Clarisonic though I ca n't compare the two , having not experienced the Clarisonic .

Between my prescription from Curology , and my go-to winter skin care products , I have n't had too many problem areas ( knock on wood ) . Lately , I 'm taking advantage of the clear canvas to give my skin a breather from heavy makeup a few days out of the week . Instead of putting on a full face of foundation , I 've been using the brand new Maybelline Master Conceal Camouflaging Concealer to spot correct any unevenness , leaving most of my face bare . <p> The Master Conceal Camouflaging Concealer is one of Maybelline 's newest Spring 2015 releases . Available in five shades , it 's designed to cover blemishes and dark circles with a full-coverage formula while still being lightweight . <p> The squeeze tube tip is thin , making it easy to control how much you dispense . In my opinion , the formula is n't thick enough to be full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering any dark spots and under-eye circles . Plus , it layers well if you need a little more help in certain areas . I would suggest exfoliating prior to application , since it has a slight powder finish that could highlight dry areas . It 's creamy and easy to blend , and the Light/Medium shade looks seamless against my yellow-undertoned skin " making it perfect for my light-makeup days . <p> I start off by applying a light primer to help the application process . I place dots of concealer on the areas that need it , like dark spots , redness , small blemishes and under my eyes . <p> I start the blending process by tapping the product into the skin . <p> I finish up with a sponge to get that smooth skin finish . I focus on the edges of the concealed areas so that my skin and the concealer are indistinguishable . I 'm using the beautyblender micro.mini that I got in my stocking this year . It 's cute , but you could get the same effect with an affordable alternative like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with a no-makeup makeup look that 's fresh faced and on trend . On easy-going days , I 'll do this and my normal brow routine and I 'm out the door . It makes me feel put together without going all out , and is quick for when I 'm running late . <p> The Maybelline Master Conceal Camouflaging Concealer is rolling out in drugstores this season for around $8 . The tube carries a generous amount ( .4 fl oz ) , and you only need a small squeeze to cover a lot of area . It 's on permanent rotation for my makeup routine this season !

How about finding a drugstore mascara that makes your lashes look just as great as a high end product ? <p> Benefit recently announced their newest mascara , Roller Lash , which will be hitting shelves later this month . This new mousse formula is geared toward those born with short and straight lashes , offering maximum length , volume and curl . <p> Meanwhile , I have already been using the new CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom mascara since the beginning of the year , and have received many a compliment on my lashes because of it . It gives me lift , length and volume , as well as fanned-out separation . <p> So " could the $8 CoverGirl mascara be a dupe for the most buzzed about new higher end product ? Watch my video below for a full comparison along with a side-by-side demo ! <p> While my first impression of Roller Lash was n't all that negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mascara . The wand felt like a dime a dozen , and was outperformed by the CoverGirl comb which had bristles that were laid out more effectively . <p> Both formulas are mousse-like and very easy to build up to get full , dramatic lashes . Throughout the day , I did n't experience any flaking or smudging with either , and my lashes maintained a soft and flexible feel to them . Full Lash Bloom definitely felt lighter , but that could be because I did n't need to go in with my brush to separate the lashes as many times as I did with Roller Lash . I also noticed that both formulas set rather quickly , and once they 've dried down , you wo n't want ( or really need ) to add any more layers , because both of them will eventually start clumping . They hold their shape all day , so you do n't  have to worry about touch ups . <p> Another note , Roller Lash does n't  claim to be waterproof but it held its own after I started tearing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in place and there was no smearing to be seen . I do n't  have the waterproof version of Full Lash Bloom so I 'm not sure how well it would work in the same scenario . <p> After using each one on either eye , I think it would be really hard to tell a difference if I did n't point it out to you . After much fiddling , the Roller Lash side does end up looking a little more full than Full Lash Bloom . <p> But for a $16 difference , is the nitpicking actually worth it ? Plus , I did n't need to spend nearly as much time with Full Lash Bloom to get the effect I wanted as with Roller Lash . Because of it 's convenience , I definitely favor it for everyday wear . <h> 9 COMMENTS <p> I first had the roller brow in the $12 size and fell in love . I used it until it would n't work at all with a small drop of jojoba oil . Got the full size and hated it instantly ! Spoolie it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goop on the end each time . I had such less control I got it in my hair ! Then a hair on that spoolie was a nightmare to get off .

Great review I will not be purchasing that new benefit mascara but if I am low on cash I will try the one by CoverGirl . <p> Honestly , both sets of mascara pics look equally good to me .

@@9946531 @3146531/ <h> REVIEW : Sleek MakeUp iDivine Storm Palette <p> Once fall hits ( which it has officially " now follow suit , California weather ! ! ) , I start breaking out the jewel tone and sultry eyeshadows . Smoky eyes are my favorite to do and the best shades always come out around this time of year . <p> I have always wanted to get my hands on one of the Sleek MakeUp iDivine palettes for a while after seeing so many gorgeous looks created with them . Storm is one of their popular ones , and it 's got some great shades for the season ranging from rich greens and blues to earthy browns . <p> I used the palette in my recent fall makeup tutorial last week , so you can see what type of look this can give you . The palette offers a lot to work with in terms of mixing and matching shades , and you get a good range of tones so that you do n't have to stray outside of the palette to complete your look . <p> The Sleek MakeUp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin shades , with only three mattes . While I would have preferred more mattes for adding dimension , the matte black allows you to tweak some of the deeper satins to be suitable for crease colors . All of the shades have names , but they are printed on the plastic insert which I know some people toss . However , since there 's so much shimmer in this palette , it might be helpful to keep the plastic to help avoid fallout from one shade getting into another . <p> The stain/shimmer shades are all very soft and are more pigmented than the matte colors . Because of their texture , you can pick up the most color when using your finger , but a dense brush will work well . The matte shades are much stiffer while still giving you a good amount of color , except for the light beige , which I would use as a blending or transition shade . <p> I would 100% suggest you use a primer with these shadows , or they 'll crease rather quickly . As I mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work way better than a creamy base to hold these in place . Also , using the light beige all over the lid before applying other shades will help blending once you 've added darker colors . <p> For the quality , the Sleek MakeUp iDivine Storm palette is a steal at less than ten bucks . In the US , the brand is only available online , but in the UK ( where they 're from ) I believe they are available in Superdrug and other high street stores . <p> I love Sleek palettes . I do n't  have this one yet , but it keeps getting recommended to me . Next time I order , I 'll probably pick this up . If you do n't  have them yet , I highly recommend Bad Girl ( their best palette of the ones I own ; every shade is a knockout ) , Arabian Nights and Vintage Romance . Their Acid Palette is a great , inexpensive dupe for Urban Decays Electric Palette . <p> I had my eye on the acid one just around the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm glad to hear that its got great quality I was really on the fence about it because I did n't  wan na be stuck with sub par shadows . Thats def on my list for next time ! Thanks ! <p> The only bad shadow in Acid is the matte white . It has no pigmentation . Other than that , I think its really good . The texture is n't as amazing as Electric , but its still pretty good , and the pigmentation is great . Considering the price difference , if it were something one would only use occasionally , I 'd recommend the Acid . I use Electric all the time , but I take Acid on trips because its cheaper to replace if it breaks or gets lost .

You can also achieve the look with relatively few products , making it even easier to pull off . <p> When I know I 'm going to be doing a smoky eye , I do my face makeup first , keeping it light and fresh . Since the eyes are going to be the focus of the look , I do n't  want a strong contour competing for the spotlight .

After tightlining my upper water line , I apply the liner on my lid in a thin line as close to my lash line as possible . <p> Taking a small smudging brush , I smoke the liner out by blending toward my outer corner and gently into my crease to diffuse the color towards the edges . Sometimes I 'll go back in with the liner to darken up the lash line again after blending to make my lashes look thicker . <p> No smoky eye look is complete without lashes that act as the cherry on top .

For the smoky eye look , I tend to shy away from my typical bold brow and go for a more feathery look by using the Femme Couture Perfect Arch Brow , which is a brow gel and highlighter duo . I 'll apply the highlighter on my brow bone first , patting it in with my finger , then run the fibered gel through my brows to fill them in while keeping them on the natural side .

I 'm just way too hard on them , and also clumsy , so polish always chips within a couple days for me . The only thing that really helps color last on my nails is if I get a gel manicure . <p> But alas , gel manicures are expensive , super time consuming , and hard on the nails . So when the CVS Beauty 360 brand came out with their No-Light Gel Polish , I was more than intrigued . This line includes an Adhesive Base Coat , High Shine Top Coat , and 36 colors for whatever mood strikes you . Together , the formula is supposed to last up to 10 days with full color coverage , all at just $4.99 a bottle . <p> The polishes have a really great consistency " thick enough to cover your nail in just a few strokes , but still able to be layered without clumping up . The Adhesive Base Coat dries quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Even though my new nail routine has made my nails longer and stronger , I still do have a little bit of unevenness on the nail bed . Luckily , the base coat smoothed everything out to prime them . <p> I chose the shade Pebble , which is a pastel grey that 's so chic and applies creamy . In two thin coats , I had completely opaque color . The High Shine Top Coat went on smoothly as a last step , drying quickly for a manicure that almost looked professional ! It totally looked like a traditional gel manicure , and I felt like I did n't have to sit tight for ages waiting for my nails to dry . After about 15 minutes , the polish seemed set and I could get on with my day . <p> But , the problems started that night . While my nails had dried , they had n't hardened completely . Dents appeared after I had bumped my hand on something . I was able to smooth the polish out using my other finger , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had used this polish in preparation for a weekend trip to Seattle , and was really counting on it at least lasting the length of the trip . However , more dents appeared the next morning on my index and middle finger . By day 3 , I had chipping on the tips that eventually worked their way up throughout the trip . The thing is , since I was n't working or doing any of my normal daily nail-chipping activities ( working out , washing dishes ) , it was surprising how quickly the manicure was ruined ! The formula did n't seem any more effective than my typical nail polish routine . <p> With that said , the color polishes are still nice little bottles for $5 each at CVS . I 'm probably going to pick up more of the shades without expecting it to last any longer than my other at-home manicures . They still offer great 2-coat color and make my nails look great while it 's on . Unfortunately , its back to square one in the hunt for a truly long-lasting polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with is that I have a uv lamp but I cant find a good brand . I cant remember the brand but every time I 've used it the polish starts to peel off after a day or two . Itll peel completely off in 1 piece from most nails . I have 4 different colors and they all do it . The drugstores seem to have stopped selling the actual gel polish that requires the uv light in favor of the light-free kind ( like the one in your review here ) . The only way Ive ever been able to keep them from chipping or peeling is going to the salon , but I 'm certain there 's brands out there that work better than what I have . I 'd probably do my nails much more often if I could find one that stayed for more than a day ! Its so frustrating to put in all that work and have it wasted so quickly !

Whether you 're beefing up your birthday wish list , or ready to treat yourself to something nice , these are my picks to add a little luxury to your makeup collection . <p> Too Faced is a brand that played a pivotal part in kickstarting my love for makeup . I remember my best friend buying me their Glamour Revolution palette when I was 16 , which contained a blush , their Chocolate Soleil Bronzer , two lip glosses and nine colorful eyeshadows . I used the heck out of it I think I still have one of the shadows depotted somewhere for nostalgia 's sake . <p> The brand has come a long way since then , and a few of their key products are some of my favorites in my own stash . <p> I 've talked very briefly about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the L.A. Girl Glazed Lip Paints . Since then , more Melteds have joined the original two I bought , and you can pretty much call me obsessed . These are hands down my favorite liquid lipstick . As you can see , they are all incredibly pigmented and apply with a creamy finish . They 're super long lasting ; you 'll be rocking those brighter shades for hours before they go anywhere . All of them sit so comfortably on the lips with a cushy texture that never dries out . I will say the one problem I 've had with these is the applicator tips drying up and blocking product from dispensing , but running under a hot faucet will usually do the trick . You need hardly a drop to saturate your lips in color , helping to justify the $21 price tag . <p> I do n't think I have ever been let down by any eyeshadow I 've tried from Too Faced . I know I 've also reviewed the new Natural Eyes palette early last year , but seriously , this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand was extremely thoughtful in choosing what shades made the cut , with the perfect ratio of matte , satin , and shimmer shades to create all sorts of looks ( ya 'll know I 'm a stickler for my matte shades ! ) . The shadows are so silky and soft , and not one shade disappoints . I love this palette for traveling since it 's so tiny smaller than my hand ! For $36 , this is a slightly more affordable neutral palette on the high-end spectrum . <p> Lip Insurance is a new love that I 'm not quite sure how I lived without . This lip primer helps your lipsticks and lip glosses reach their full potential in terms of color and wear time . The new Glossy version helps give your lips a little extra shine , and keeps color from feathering . I find this more convenient to use than a lip liner , and for $20 , it can make your $1 lipstick to perform like a champ . <p> Oh , Chocolate Soleil , the first bronzer I ever tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was for and just powdered it ( heavily , I might add ) all over my face . That was sure a good look not . This one is definitely more of the indulgent splurge , since $30 is more than I would normally spend on a bronzer especially a warm one . But if you know anything about this puppy , you 're probably familiar with it 's chocolatey scent and silky smooth application . I 've switched from using the original to Deep Chocolate Soleil , which is a little darker and has a matte finish . <p> Back when I had an allowance to blow at Sephora , Too Faced was one of the first aisles I rushed to still is when I 'm window shopping ! I respect the brand for creating amazing products that prove themselves by performance rather than just riding on the brand name .

Usually long lasting and ultra pigmented , they 're perfect for busy days and low maintenance looks . Over the past few years , more variations have been popping up from top brands , both drugstore and high end . From mattes , to glossy , to metallic and everything in between " there 's a liquid lipstick for any trend you 're hot on . For a while , you had to pay good money for one that performed really well , but no longer ! These are some of my favorite drugstore liquid lipsticks , and three that are worth splurging on . <p> Linked below are the ones I 've reviewed and swatched on the blog previously . <p> The Milani Lip Intense Liquid Colors ( $7 ) apply with a cushy consistency , and stay feeling moisturizing while they dries down . You get full opacity in just one swipe with color that lasts for hours . <p> The L'Oreal Colour Riche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $9 ) have very similar formulas that are a fusion of balm , gloss , and lipstick . They stay glossy and comfortable throughout wear time as they hug the lips , and are n't sticky in the slightest . Since these do n't dry down like standard liquid lipsticks , they are more prone to transferring and so will need to be retouched after a few hours for full color payoff . <p> The NYX Soft Matte Lip Creams ( $6 ) are a recent discovery/obsession of mine . They first go on as a mousse texture but soon dry to a satin-matte , giving full coverage color with a thin layer . They have a similar look and feel to the Lime Crime Velvetines ( $20 ) , but the Velvetines dry down to be completely matte and last longer . Both need balm underneath to avoid a dry feeling throughout the day . <p> Rimmel 's Show Off Lip Lacquers ( $5.50 ) have all the pigmentation of a high-powered lipstick and all the shine of a luxe gloss .

While the formulas are very different , they are equally satisfying . Both extremely pigmented , the Glazed Lip Paints are more glossy while the Melted Lipsticks stay creamy from application to the end of the day . <p> Finally , OCC Lip Tars ( $18 ) are what I would consider the O.G . liquid lipsticks . These babies have been around forever , and dominate the scene with their intense color and budge-proof wear time . These are entirely worth the price , because you hardly need half of a pea-sized amount to drench your lips in your shade of choice .

I 'm not just talking about self-esteem , I 'm talking literally : drinking enough water keeps your body and its beauty in check . Health and outer beauty are so entwined , and staying hydrated can help promote clear and glowing skin , beat bloating , and keep you looking and feeling energized . <p> I do n't really drink any other beverage besides water anymore . Adam will always take full credit for that . When I met him almost four years ago , I hardly drank water at all . I was a hardcore Diet Coke junkie . I was also overweight , got colds and viruses at least once a month , and had little energy throughout the day . I wholeheartedly believe I was addicted to Diet Coke .

I make sure I 've always got a bottle with me . Merely having water with you is a really good way to convince yourself to drink it . My other secret trick : make sure your bottle is cute .

While silicone and I have had a love/hate relationship in the past due to its tendency to trap lint , the bkr 's sleeve is extremely easy to clean , making it easy to brush away dirt . I brought my Bambi Heart bkr to Coachella with me , accidentally dropped it in the dirt , and was able to rub it clean . The sleeve is also really sturdy . I 'm able to take it off and put it back on without being afraid of it ripping . <p> bkrs come in two sizes : 500 mL , which is a good size for on-the-go , and 1 L which I like to keep with me at my desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal for sipping without splashing a little luxury I did n't know would make such a difference . <p> The bottle itself is made of glass , which I like because you do n't get that plastic taste throughout the day .

The cap is also completely leak proof with a rubber stop at the top . When I was in London , I just threw it in my bag without any regard and had absolutely no issues . <p> I sort of favor my 1L Lola bkr because I know that once I empty it twice , I 've got my recommended amount of water for the day .

You can find some amazing shadows no matter what your budget is , so let 's jump in to talk about some popular options for all budgets ! <h> Splurge : <p> 1 . the Balm- Nude Tude $36 This sassy palette houses twelve cool neutrals with a range of satin , matte and shimmer finishes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough of a variety to also do a really light , every day look as well . I particularly like the packaging , since it 's slim and contains a large mirror on the inside , perfect for traveling . I swatched this palette last year in my quick review that you can see here . <p> 2 . Urban Decay- Naked Palettes $54 Among the more famous neutral palettes is of course the Naked collection from Urban Decay . You can opt to buy one of their full sized 12-pan palettes , the most recent being the rosy selection of shades from Naked 3 , or their smaller Basics palettes . Either way , you 're bound to get lovely , buttery smooth shadows that will offer a plethora of looks . <p> 3 . Too Faced- Natural Eyes $36 This palette was just made over to include three brand new shades from the brand . Another great selection of finishes make this palette ideal for both every day and glam looks . The shadows are silky and blend easily . I reviewed and swatted this palette here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 Two of my favorite neutral palettes ever are both of the Revealed palettes from Coastal Scents , and I 've been reaching for the second constantly since its release . Each touts 20 shades , the first installment leaning cool while the second takes after the Naked 3 rosy shades . I prefer the second one because of the matte shades and better pigmentation . See swatches of the first Revealed here , and Revealed 2 here . <p> 2 . NYX- The Natural Eyeshadow Palette $7.50 One of the more simple palettes on this list , the Natural Eyeshadow Palette from NYX is a straightforward , everyday selection of shades . The deeper colors are more pigmented , but all are buildable . You can get a few solid staple looks from this palette . <p> 3 . Wet n Wild- Comfort Zone $5 I consider Comfort Zone one of the best things to come out of Wet n Wild , and a staple in any makeup collection . Eight shadows with that smooth Wet n Wild formula we know and love , This neutral palette has pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey Cassi ! Yes , although its made out of cardboard , its still fairly sturdy while being slim . I have brought it on multiple trips this summer with me ! The only thing that is a little inconvenient is that it does n't  have a mirror , so make sure you pack one = <p> A smaller palette that I 'd forgotten I even had until yesterday the Wet n Wild Walking on Eggshells palette ( one of the 3 color ones ) . Proof positive that I need to get more storage for my makeup and organize it but that 's beside the point . I love the CS Revealed palette ( I have the first one ) , it has such a great range of neutral shades . I need to get my hands on the 2nd one ! <p> Walking on Eggshells is a classic go-to ! I 've got that one stashed away for super quick neutral eye looks myself = Oh yes I loooove the second revealed palette . I 'm sure theyll have a sale soon where they are discounted , so hold out !

" For me , you do n't need to be putting together the most elaborate outfits to inspire someone . Honestly , random people on the street in seemingly " normal " outfits will lead me to trying out a new trend or something I would n't have normally picked out myself due to insecurities . I would n't necessarily label myself a fashionista , but I know I 've got my own aesthetic that could possibly inspire someone else to try something new , however ordinary it may seem . <p> Exhibit A : the flannel shirt . I 've never owned a proper flannel shirt until last week , because I thought it would look too masculine on me .

But they definitely accentuate my hips and the wash let 's me wear them casually or dress them up . <p> Exhibit B : halter necklines " another one that I did n't think I could pull off . Not only am I self-conscious about my arms , but the high necks usually do n't do much for my upper body . You know how some shirts just fall straight down after your boobs , totally concealing your waist ? That 's usually what these shirts do for me .

Obviously , if you 're in colder parts of the world than Los Angeles , you 'll probably have to throw on a coat = <p> Whenever I wear a higher neckline , I try to offset it with a chunky necklace . I have a long torso , so this helps it look more proportionate . Swapping out my black high boots for nude flats also makes my legs look longer , and adds an overall classic simplicity to the look .

The brand recently released their Pressed Powder eyeshadows , their take on the standard pressed eyeshadow . They have a new range of mattes , shimmers and satins that " in my humble opinion " are pretty dang gorgeous . I picked up several during Generation Beauty last weekend , and have been so excited to share with you ! <p> The new Pressed Shadows go for $5 and come as individual pans that you can either stick in one of their own cardboard palettes or a Z Palette . My honest preference is a Z Palette , since the brand 's palettes only have space for four shades and are rather bulky . <p> First off , we were given the Weekend Warrior palette which was part of ColourPop 's collaboration with Amanda Steele .

Even the light grey/mauve stood out against my skin tone , though I would categorize it still as a transition shade . The texture is super smooth and silky , and they blend extremely easily . I will say that the mattes tended to fade on me noticeably after 5 hours , but I think a stickier base could have helped remedy that . <p> Next , I was able to pick 4 free individual Pressed Shadows at the ColourPop booth at Gen Beauty , and house them in this exclusive palette .

With the exception of Let Me Explain , brushes tend to pick up more of the shimmer than the actual pigment with these shades specifically . <p> This is a look I created using a mix of all of several of these shadows . Watch the video at the top of the page to see which ones I used and how to recreate it . <p> All in all , I think this was a fantastic move on ColourPop 's part .

@@9946567 @3146567/ <h> REVIEW : LOccitane Divine Cream <p> Today I 'm going to be sharing my thoughts on the most luxurious , moisturizing product I 've ever used on my face . <p> On September 12 , L'Occitane launched their Divine collection , highlighting the immortelle flower : a flower that never fades , even once it 's been picked . A lot of science goes into the anti-aging properties of this collection . The immortelle flower contains a high concentration of neryl acetate , which is an anti-aging molecule . It also boosts the cells that get rid of skin aging ! L'Occitane has 5 patents pending on these Divine formulas . <p> I had the opportunity to try the Divine Cream* from this new collection . It is stored in a 50 ml jar that was inspired by an apothecary jar . It 's adorable and reminds me of old-school beauty . It comes with a small spoon to scoop out the product which is really handy . I love this little addition , not only for controlling the amount you use , but also keeping the cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . In the picture , I 've added a quarter for size comparison . <p> The scent of the Divine Cream is one of my favorite elements of this product . It 's very floral but also has woody and honey notes . The cream itself is rather thick and a little goes a long way ! Half of a spoonful is enough to cover your entire face and some of your neck . You certainly do n't need to apply any more than this onto your face , because this much alone is extremely moisturizing . Since I barely use a pea-sized amount once a day , I know this is jar is going to last me a long time . <p> I 've been using the Divine Cream for almost four weeks now . I ca n't speak to the anti-aging properties since I 'm only 20 years old ! However there were so many other benefits I experienced from its use . It provides extreme moisture to my face that my skin drinks up like lemonade on a hot summer day . I have combo skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . My skin absorbs it and stays moisturized all day . Even under my makeup , I can tell that my face has a newfound glow after applying the Divine Cream . I can see that my skin looks healthier and the texture has improved tremendously . <p> Now here 's the only downside : the Divine Cream sells for $106 . The Divine Cream is the epitome of a luxury cream , and the price not only reflects its quality but all the work that it takes to produce it . Right now , however , - you can get a free trial of the Divine Cream by signing up on LOccitanes website ! - Would I personally pay $106 for it ? Not realistically . Even with its anti-aging properties , right now I only use it as a moisturizer and that price tag is a little too rich for my blood . However , if the Divine Cream popped up in one of L'Occitane 's gift sets that usually go for under $40 , I would snatch it up just for the cream itself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have some more affordable products using this legendary flower . <h> 6 COMMENTS <p> It is an amazing product but I can understand how it might be a little out of most peoples price range if they are n't  seeing signs of aging just yet . I am at the perfect time to be using this product so I have it out and ready to roll when I finish my current one . <p> A non-blogging friend was raving about this product . She received a sample and said it was amazing , but the price tag was out of her budget . I would love to see this in a smaller , more affordable size .

It probably would have gone a lot faster had I stayed on Hairfinity , but I just kept forgetting to take them every day after the initial month ! Anyway , now that it 's considerably past shoulder length , I can start doing pretty summer hairstyles with it . <p> Lately , I 've been using the NuMe Titan 3 to get bouncy curls that eventually turn into loose waves throughout the week . I can literally do my hair once and it will look great for five days . The Titan 3 comes with three separate curling wand attachments at 19mm , 25mm , and 32mm to get a ton of different looks with the one tool .

It also looks great whether you 've just curled your hair , or theyve transformed into worn-in waves after a couple of days . <h> Steps : <p> 1 . Use the NuMe Titan 3 with the 25mm barrel to curl your entire head of hair . 2 . Finger comb the curls to break them up and give them a more natural look . 3 .

I sold my Titan 3 to a friend because she had to have it lol I have their reverse wand , 32mm and Lustrum but I never use them unless I 'm doing someone elses hair or am feeling a new look , I hardly use heat on my hair .

It 's been an amazing year full of achievements and good memories for me , and I 'm hoping 2015 follows suit .

Probably the biggest night for dressing up and going out , you do not want to be caught without the essentials . Keep reading for suggestions on what to pack in your own New Years Eve Survival Kit . <p> 1 . Cute Clutch Leave your totes and shoulder bags at home . On New Years Eve , you 're likely to be dancing , drinking , and moving throughout crowded parties . Either you 'll be bogged down by a large bag ( super awkward to dance with ) , or paranoid about keeping track of where you leave it . Opt for a cute clutch , maybe even one with a chain strap . These are easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping . <p> 2 . Lip Balm Chances are , it 's chilly where you are during this time of year " especially late at night and in the wee hours of the morning .

This stuff keeps your lips moisturized for hours and is perfect for layering underneath your lipstick shade of choice , or for quick touch ups throughout the night . <p> 3 . Perfume If you 're headed to a poppin ' party , you 're definitely going to want to stay smelling fresh . A chilly night can become sweltering when you 're in a close space with tons of bodies . Pack your favorite perfume in a clutch-friendly , leak proof container like the Travalo . Spritz on during the night to make your presence more appreciated among the crowd . <p> 4 . Oil Blotters Leave the shine for the Times Square Ball , not your face . Bring a pack of oil blotters with you to absorb extra oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening your makeup and party photos . My pick : Clean &amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets . The package is super thin and portable , and the sheets do not smudge makeup when getting rid of the oil . <p> 5 . Precision Q-Tips When you 're out partying for hours , makeup has a way of creeping around your face . Precision Q-Tips will be your secret weapon for keeping your look strong all night long . Use the pointed cotton swabs to clean up smudged eyeliner or feathering lipstick . You 'll look just as good when the clock strikes twelve as you did at the beginning of the night . <p> 6 . Band Aids You will probably be spending a lot of time on your feet , and I 'm guessing you 're planning on wearing your cutest pumps ?

@@9946584 @3146584/ <h> How to Find Your Perfect Makeup Shades at Sephora <p> Last week , I took a trip to The Grove , a popular outdoor shopping center here in Los Angeles , as they were celebrating their grand opening of the new Sephora store . As a beauty lover , I was totally enamored with the pristine store , unused testers , and fully-stocked shelves . But the coolest thing I saw during my visit was the new Sephora + Pantone Color IQ Beauty Studio Kiosk . While Color IQ a free service that has shows you your perfect makeup shades has been around since 2012 in select stores , it 's better than ever with two new features . <p> In case you 're unfamiliar , the Color IQ service uses a device ( pictured above ) that utilizes tri-directional color image capture technology that records pure , distortionless images of your skin that are synthesized and used to assign you a Pantone SkinTone number . That number is the key to matching yourself to the best makeup shades for your skin tone throughout the store , across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched you with foundations , but now you can find your best concealer shade for hiding blemishes or highlighting , and your best lip shade to compliment your complexion based on color harmonies and undertones ! <p> The entire process only takes a couple minutes with the help of a Sephora employee , who holds the device to your neck ( to avoid makeup getting in the way ) and shows you how to work the database of products . Once you have your color match , you can search by product ( foundation , concealer , or lipstick ) , brand , coverage , finish , formula the options are endless . <p> My color ended up being 4Y07 , which means I have a medium yellow undertone ( no surprise there ! ) . I had been specifically looking for my perfect concealer match for covering problem spots that would give me medium coverage , and the Color IQ database recommended the new Sephora Collection Bright Future Gel Serum Concealer in Tatin . I grabbed a tester and was surprised to see it really was an exact color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lightweight feel ) ! You better believe I grabbed two and checked out with a quickness . Since I 've had a few eczema flare ups recently , I 've used the concealer to cover up blemishes when I do n't want to wear a full face of foundation , and it blends in so well that you seriously ca n't tell I 'm wearing makeup . Score ! <p> Aside from the new Color IQ additions , more stores are going to be offering the Sephora Beauty Classes , which I talked about previously in this post , as well as free mini makeovers and 15-minute facials for Beauty Insiders . All of these new additions are to help you have the best shopping experience and find the best products on the first try , without wasting money on products you do n't love . <p> Even if you do n't have a Sephora close by , you can replicate the Color IQ process by punching in your current foundation product and shade on their website , and it will match you to similar shades from other brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can save it to your Beauty Insider account so you never forget it . Find out yours in-store or online and tell me your number in the comments ! <p> I hear that all the time too , and I think its kinda bizarre since its only one brand and not universal . Since Pantone is like *the* authority of color , I feel like its a more broad way of finding your match or at least learning your undertone ! <p> I also use the original color matching system when they released it and they had me 2 shades darker . I did n't  buy that shade , and when I went to a different location they had me with really pink and darker shades . It was all out of whack hehe I think this is much better ! <p> I hope they made it more accurate . I had the matching done . They matched me to a foundation that was FOUR shades too dark and much too warm . Thank God I did n't  buy anything . They used their shade match on me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you think you are . " YeahI am. lol My husband even noticed , and he s not the type to pay attention to makeup . <p> My friend who works at Sephora says that because the technology is sensitive , the pressure they use to press it up against your face can even make a difference ! Its always good to have a second opinion . When they did it on me , they used the device on my neck and I think were less shy to press it onto me , and I was super surprised with the match because its like spot on at least for concealer . Havent tried any of the foundations it suggested ! <p> They did a few spots on my face , and also my neck and chest . I was n't wearing any makeup . I did n't  know about the pressure affecting it .

The latest : Lovatics by Demi Lovato for NYC New York Color ! <p> The brand announced the collection , which is launching for Spring , this morning via a new private Instagram account . Demi has been NYCs ambassador for over a year now , and so it was a no brainer that the Confident star would put together her own line for them . <p> There have only been four products announced thus far for this seasons launch , but after a quick Google search I have come to the realization that these products along with others seemingly belonging to the Lovatics line were released in other countries months ago . I have a feeling that well be seeing the rest of the collection hit stores come summer . For now , here 's what we 've got to play with : <p> We all know that a must-have in any makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Demi Eyeshadow Palette in Natural ( $4.99 ) is the first to launch , with a whopping twelve shades ranging from light and subtle to dark and smoky . Ill be completely honest here : I 'm actually a little neturaled-out right now and wish they could have released a more colorful palette for their Spring launch , and especially since the collection is supposed to reflect Demis bold style . However , I know there are more colorful palettes coming our way because of what has been spotted overseas . <p> What I 'm most excited for : the Lovatics by Demi Lip and Cheek Tint ( $3.99 ) . Above are the shades Cheeky Berry , Cheeky Red , and Cheeky Strawberry . The sheer color is supposed to be perfect for adding color to the cheeks with a texture that 's easy to apply with either a brush or your fingers . The formula is said to be buildable so that you can get a more bold shade for the lips . <p> While NYC has a reputation to be hit-or-miss , one thing theyve always done right are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mascara ( $4.99 ) will be their newest addition , which claims to give 11x more volume and 64% more length . The brush is definitely unique , with two types of bristles : the small rigid ones tapered at the top to catch unnoticeable lashes , and the long flexible bristles to lift even your longest lashes . <p> No one can deny that Demis brow game is on point . Hopefully well be able to join her with the Lovatics by Demi Eyebrow Liner ( $1.99 ) ! Current shades available are Medium Brown and Dark Brown , and the pencils have a built in brush on the cap for easy grooming . These remind me a lot of the Jordana brow pencils , which I love . I 'm just hoping the formula is n't too waxy but allows a more natural approach to filling in . <p> You 'll start seeing the NYC Lovatics Collection this month at your local Target and Walmart.

Their new Sculpting Set 2.0 comes with three brushes you can incorporate into your routine in many ways . I like using the Medium Sculpting Brush for contouring , though it can also be used for blush and bronzer . The Fan Brush is great for dusting a highlight lightly onto the high points of the face . The Setting Brush can be used for setting concealer with powder , or to highlight as well . <p> Above I demonstrate how you can use four Real Techniques brushes to achieve the fresh face makeup trend for Spring .

This past month , we did n't have as many new developments as our first month wedding planning , but the details we did nail down were pretty big ones ! <p> After we came back from booking The Pines Resort as our venue , we created our wedding website using The Knot . I researched several different companies that provided free wedding websites , and theirs was by far my favorite . Basically , it keeps everything in one place : your website , your wedding planning to-do list , your address book , and your RSVPs . <p> The online RSVP system was extremely important to me , as I wanted to save money ( and trees ) by passing on physical RSVP cards . The Knot provides an online form you can send your guests so that you can collect their contact information for the save the dates and invites , then saves the info in a large spreadsheet for you . <p> Once invites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the website to find their invite . From there , they can choose whether or not they will be attending , as well as their dinner choice from the drop down menu . If they have other guests in their party ( +1s , family members , etc ) they can RSVP for them at the same time . This is super handy considering a lot of the families we 're inviting have 3-4 people in their household , so that way they do n't each have to reply individually . <p> Speaking of RSVPs , one of the biggest things we checked off our list was designing our save the dates and invites , and getting them printed . It was really important to me when choosing a company that delivered quality at a fair price , and had designs that were truly unique and special enough for the occasion . I was so lucky to partner with Minted.com , and I ca n't tell you how obsessed I am with our stationery ! <p> I was drawn to both of these designs largely because of the foil detailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really thick with a creamy cotton texture ) so it not only adds glamour but also texture to the card . They were also both very clean without too much distraction from the main focus " the wedding information " while still being super elegant . We printed information on the front and back for both the save the dates and invites , with information about room blocks as well as our wish for a child-free weekend . ( Sorry , not sorry ! ) <p> Something that sets Minted apart from other stationery printers is their personal customization . They have a do-it-yourself customizer where you can tweak the text , fonts , and colors , but you can also write special instructions if you want something outside of the default settings changed . Once you order , they send you a digital proof which you can either approve , or ask the designer to tweak and send back for final approval . We went back and forth about three times before I finally approved the design , and I was relieved that they were so kind in helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fact that the cards came with envelopes in matching styles , and Minted offers free address printing on them ! It will save us a ton of time , and in general looks a lot better than my tired handwriting would after I got through half of them , probably . We also chose to purchase their Skinny Wrap Labels for the formal invitations , which not only help seal the envelope but also contain our return address on them . A really nice touch that 's also functional ! <p> I 'm going to start packaging up the save the dates next week , and our guests should get them by the first week of March . I 'm so excited for them to see the cards " they are TOTALLY fridge-worthy . <p> Finally , the other big development we 've made over the last month is deciding on bridesmaids dresses well , we have n't quite decided on the actual dress , per se , but at least where they 're coming from ! <p> I 'm looking forward to partnering with Kennedy Blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wedding Shoppe in Saint Paul , MN ) that takes a really unique approach to bridesmaids dresses . They make tons of different styles , but in the same range of colors which means your bridesmaids can match without having to choose the exact same dress . As someone who has a hard-to-please body type myself , it was really important to me that my maids wear something they 're comfortable in while still looking like part of the group . Kennedy Blue let 's them do just that , and at pretty reasonable prices ! <p> Now the real novelty of Kennedy Blue is that they have an at-home try on service for their dresses . You can choose three dresses to be sent to your bridesmaids to keep for three days so they can try them on and decide which ones they " and more importantly , you " like best . This try-before-you-buy approach takes the risk out of buying online . They take care of all the logistics , including the return label once your try-on time is up . Once you 've settled on your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll send you a fresh dress in your size and color choice . Plus , all try on orders come with a promo code of 10% off your dress order ! <p> These are some of the dresses we 're considering for the girls . We 've finalized the color , called Bordeaux , which they sent me a swatch of to see in person ( another great service they offer ! ) . Once we get the at home try on process going , I 'll definitely share the experience since I think it 's such a convenient and unique take on this part of wedding planning . Plus huge spoiler alert they also make wedding gowns , and it 's official : I 'm wearing one of theirs for the big day . SQUEE ! ! ! <p> You are so lucky to be able to partner with these great brands . I think the online invitation sites are taking over . I had friends who used to sell invites as a home business but have stopped because you can find so much more now at Minted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love all of your invitations ! They are so modern and attractive . My step-daughter got married a few months ago , and her bridesmaids also wore Bordeaux . The dresses were essentially the same below the bodice but had different neck or top treatments . They all looked great . So fun to follow your plans !

Keep reading if you want practical advice on what to wear to Coachella to have a great time , from someone who has actually gone . <p> Coachella , the world-famous music festival in Southern California , has become a culture all its own . Having a very relaxed ( practically nonexistent ) dress code , many people use Coachella as an excuse to step out of street style norms . The festival has cultivated a boho-chic vibe with many going over the top , turning it into a fashion event as much as it is a music one . <p> However , after attending Coachella myself a couple years ago , I realized quickly that what you wear can play a big part in how much you enjoy the weekend .

Here 's the problem with that : <p> You 're in the desert , surrounded by dirt and dust . <p> It gets windy , so that dust is swirling through the air . <p> It 's hell-adjacent hot . You will be sweating . <p> I literally had to throw away the shirt I wore to Coachella , because it was so badly stained with dirt and sweat , even Oxyclean could n't revive it . Of course , due to the sun , you 'll want to stay out of dark colors as well . Opt for light shades that wo n't put dirt in the spotlight . <h> Do : Keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles that are light and breezy . Again , this is due to the extreme heat , and will help you avoid sweating through your clothes . You also want to choose clothing that is easy to move in . The grounds are huge , the space between stages long , and you 'll be doing a ton of moving around ( I clocked in 22,000 steps/day ) . <h> Do n't : Count on Re-Wearing Clothing <p> Do n't rely on re-wearing an article of clothing in order to pack light , besides accessories like hats or jewelry . After a day of dancing , sitting on the ground , sweating in the sun , eating out of food trucks etc your clothes may not necessarily be in the best condition to re-wear the next day . So even if you usually wear jeans or bras twice in a row , pack extra just in case . <h> Do : Mind the Sun <p> The type of clothing you wear will affect how much sunscreen you 'll need .

This is not the weekend to show off your most expensive outfit that would kill you to replace . Especially if you 're camping , it 's also a very easy atmosphere to lose things in . By all means , wear clothes that make you feel cute , but that you wo n't cry over if they get misplaced . <h> Do : Comfort over Couture <p> The bottom line of this post is that you will have a better time in comfortable clothing . You can still slay in the latest styles , just keep in mind that it 's a surprisingly active weekend . You 'll notice that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wear new shoes . Wear shoes you love that are comfortable . Do n't wear clothing that restricts movement , or bottoms that are hard to put on and take off . I say this because the bathroom choices will be between a port-o-potty or trailer toilets that leave you with little room to maneuver . ( Note : avoid jumpsuits ! ) <p> To make a long story short , be cute , but be practical . It will make the chaos of Coachella a lot more fun to experience .

@@9946603 @3146603/ <h> 4 Ways to Use the Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge <p> One of the biggest revolutions in makeup application in recent years has got to be the return of the sponge : and I 'm not talking about the rough triangle sponges . No , I 'm talking about the bouncy , typically tear-drop shaped sponges that help apply makeup like a dream . Well , if you find a quality one , that is . <p> Here 's the thing though , because of the nature of sponges , they should be replaced about every four months or so . If you 're shelling out $20 for the one everyone swears is the best , that could add up quickly . <p> So when I saw that the Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge was about five bucks , I had to put it to the test . After working it into my routine for the first time , I was immediately sold . It became a staple tool for me , especially because it can get so many jobs done ! <p> Here are four ways you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . <h> 1 . Flat Side : Foundation <p> This sponge has something most do n't : a flat edge ! I use this feature to apply my foundation . It 's able to cover a lot of surface area at once , and the top edge helps get product into every corner , like around the nose or along the hairline . <h> 2 . Round Side : Blush <p> To get a soft and diffused look , the round side is perfect for applying cream blush . I especially like using it for super pigmented products , like this Creme to Powder Blush in Pink Peony by Sleek Makeup . It 's a gorgeous bright pink , but it is so easy to apply way too much . Dabbing the sponge into the blush , then onto my face gives me more control for an every day look . <h> 3 . Pointed Tip : Concealer <p> The sponge 's point is perfect for dotting and blending concealer , either on blemishes or my favorite : under the eyes . I 'll dab a bit of Pixi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers , then use the point to blend it out . I find that I get way less creasing doing this . <h> 4 . Sharp Edge : Contour <p> I only just discovered this way to use the sponge , and I ca n't believe I have n't heard of more people doing it . For a really defined contour , dab the edge of the flat side into your bronzer , then line it up with the bottom of your cheekbone . Press the product onto the skin , then you can use the round side ( that 's not covered in blush ) to blend it out . <p> These are the best drug store beauty sponges I 've tried so far . I bought two when they first came out , and I 'm still using them . They have a really nice shape . I got them in a two-pack from Target online , and paid less than half of what a BB would have cost . Plus , I really like the flat angle on these . <p> Ive been debating about this one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little make up wedges . I may have to look into this myself though , the issue i have with them is you ca n't clean to the middle of them and it breaks down .

While it was n't on display at the convention , I think it 's definitely worth talking about as one of the next popular skin care gadgets . <p> The Conture Kinetic Skin Toning System is a new anti-aging and skin toning device that is marketed to treat signs of aging quickly , effectively and painlessly . It 's been clinically proven to deliver glowing , healthy and younger looking skin without invasive treatments or endless trips to a clinic you 'd normally have to go through for those results . <p> How does it work ? The Conture stimulates your skin with isometric compression and ultra-low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift and release the skin within the silicone cup on the nozzle , while the vibrations flow outward .

Girl , I hear you , BUT what really drew me in was the Conture 's user testimonials and how they boasted the biggest improvement in radiance &amp; luminosity , and smoothness &amp; evenness . These are areas that have seriously been lacking when it came to my winter skin , and I was at my wit 's end trying to remedy . <p> What had been particularly frustrating was that all of my favorite products seemed to have just stopped working for me .

Being dermatologist tested and recommended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conture . <p> I knew I would n't see results in terms of anti-aging because of my age , but I was also pretty skeptical at how much of a difference this little face vacuum doohickey could possibly make . So I 've used it for almost a month and well it ended up being my skin care savior this season . <p> I started using the Conture on Mild , since my skin had been feeling super sensitive since November . After about a week , I started feeling improvements and switched to Face mode . After another week , I saw a really quick turnaround in my skin 's appearance . My breakouts were clearing up , dark spots slightly starting to fade , and the texture was improving immensely . I was being reunited with the skin I knew my routine was supposed to serve up . <p> The Conture 's role in it all ? The device completely enhanced my skin 's absorption . My cleansers , creams and moisturizers were able to live up to their full potential and did their job better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cells ' turnover rate , as new blemishes seemed to heal faster and my skin has been getting consistently clearer and more luminous , with an even texture and tone to boot .

They also have a serum , lotion and creme to use with the device if you 're targeting wrinkles and hoping to achieve firm skin . As something that is mostly advertised to treat aging skin , I 'm stoked that its was still able to revive my own skin and help repair it after a particularly harsh winter for my face . <p> The Conture Kinetic Skin Toning System is n't cheap " you can try it for a month by paying $29.95 , followed by 5 monthly payments of $59.99 ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do have the scoop that there will be a TV special that will bring the price way down soon , so keep your eyes peeled ! = <p> I really think Mirandas comments on the shipping , price and returns policies should never have been included .

@@9946607 @3146607/ <p> Even as someone who loves affordable beauty finds , and knows I can get awesome quality without breaking the bank , the latest releases from high-end brands still get me swooning from time to time . Case in point : the Urban Decay Naked Smoky Palette . In years past , the Naked palettes that had been released never really excited me as much as this one . Even though Urban Decay 's eye shadow formula is one of my all-time-favorites , the shade selections always just seemed so dupe-able . <p> But when Naked Smoky came out , I had hearts in my eyes . My favorite eye look is a sultry smoky eye , and I loved the shades Urban Decay brought together in the gorgeous silver palette . <p> I 've been a fan of Makeup Revolution 's eye shadows in the past , so I was excited to see a palette with similar shades at a fraction of the cost of Naked Smoky . They both have twelve neutral smoky shades inside that range from matte , to satin , to shimmer finishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo above just how closely the shades match in terms of color , which would help you create the exact same looks at a way more affordable price . <p> A couple things to note before going into the shades : both palettes have large mirrors inside , but the Makeup Revolution packaging is a lot more space-friendly , being slimmer and more compact while having a taller mirror so you can see your whole face at once . Although , there 's no denying the beauty in the Naked Smoky packaging , with the embossed silver lettering and gray marbled design . They both also come with a double ended eye shadow brush , but Urban Decay 's wins this round with soft and dense bristles : one side being a smudge brush and the other side perfect for blending . <p> Now , as I started watching the shades side by side , I did notice some key differences . Above , the Urban Decay Naked Smoky Palette shades are labelled on the left , and the unlabeled shades belong to the Makeup Revolution Iconic Smokey Palette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost identical , many of the corresponding shades show up a smidge different when applied . The closest dupes I found in color were for Dirtysweet , Slanted , Smolder , Password , Whiskey , and Combust . The others had a noticeable difference in shade or finish , like the matte jet black in Naked Smoky matching up with the shimmery charcoal black in Iconic Smokey ( something that actually disappointed me , because a matte black is a must-have for me in smoky looks ! ) . <p> Both palettes offer awesome pigmentation , as you can see from the swatches . Urban Decay 's shadows are some of my favorite , like I said , with a buttery texture that goes on smoothly and blends out effortlessly . Makeup Revolution 's shadows hold their own and have a similar feel , although leave a little more fallout when applying . Something I 'm willing to overlook , though , considering the color payoff is so great . <p> Final verdict : If you can get over the very slight differences in the shades/finishes found in the Urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution Iconic Smokey Palette ( $12 ) , you can definitely save the extra forty-two smackaroos to get an incredibly similar palette where you can create indistinguishable looks that deliver just as much smoky drama and last all day . <h> Which one would you choose : the Naked Smoky or Makeup Revolution Iconic Smokey Palette ? 
@@9946608 @3146608/ <h> REVIEW : NYX Collection Noir Matte Black Liner <p> September 19 , 2013 <p> Following NYX 's big debut at Target , I finally got a chance to stop by and pick something up . The shelves were pretty barren , which I should have expected . I decided on the Collection Noir Matte Black Liner . <p> To be completely honest , I was n't paying attention when I grabbed the box and so thought this was a liquid eyeliner that dried matte . However , I was pretty excited to try it out anyway because I do n't have nor use many pencil or crayon liners . My one trusty pencil liner has been the CoverGirl Perfect Blend Pencil Crayon in Basic Black . I 've been using that one since I first started wearing makeup when I was 12 years old ! <p> The NYX liner is very soft and malleable , so you ca n't twist the product up too much while applying without the risk of breaking the tip . This also allows the point to quickly become nubby after the first use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get the point back . <p> I love that this liner is really black . Here it is compared to both the CoverGirl Perfect Blend liner as well as Urban Decay 's 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencil in Zero . <p> - <p> I personally think the NYX liner looks the blackest of them all ! <p> Usually when I wear pencil liners , it 's because I plan on smudging them out to create a smokey effect . I found this pretty hard with the NYX liner here 's my result from smudging with a smudge brush compared to the other two liners . <p> I find it pretty contradicting when they say this liner is perfect for a smokey eye , but that it is also smudge proof . This was incredibly hard to blend , and as shown in the picture you can still see the original line underneath my blending efforts . The claim that it is smudge-free definitely holds up ( more so when I 'm not trying to smudge it vigorously with a brush haha ) , as well as water proof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup remover wipes . <p> The NYX Collection Noir Matte Black Liner runs for $5.99 at Target . If you 're looking for a pencil/crayon liner that wo n't budge throughout the day , this is it ! However if you 're looking for a blendable formula to create smokey eyes I would n't choose this pencil . Overall I 'm pretty happy with my purchase , and will most likely use this for lower lash lining because I know it 's not going to creep down my face throughout the day . <p> Do you find yourself using pencil liner more than liquid liner ? Which pencil works best for you ?

Aprill from GlitterGlossGarbage.com recommended a brand I was n't familiar with : Parnevu . As I roamed the website they had a lot of products targeted for weak , damaged hair with really affordable prices . I knew I had to get my hands on some of them ! <p> The Parnevu Hair Mayonnaise* is a hair treatment made with a natural herbal formula incorporating olive oil , egg protein and African herbs . Now I know what you 're thinking : although these are all proven to do wonders for your hair , what about the smell ? At least that was my first concern . However , this stuff smells amazing . The scent is very light , smells like cookies ( at least to me it does ) , and does n't linger in your hair after rinsing it out . <p> The Hair Mayonnaise is supposed to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can either be used daily in small amounts before styling or as a deep conditioning treatment . I have only used it for deep conditioning treatments so far because my hair needs some extra repairing . The Hair Mayonnaise is thick and creamy but does n't weigh hair down or leave it feeling greasy at all . <p> After shampooing , I work a generous amount into my hair , massaging it into my scalp and continuing all the way to the ends . I cover my hair with a shower cap for 10 minutes while I shave my legs , then rinse it out ! <p> I noticed a difference right away in the shower as I was rinsing the Hair Mayonnaise out . I usually experience a LOT of shedding and breakage in the shower- like , an obscene amount . However as I was rinsing , I noticed hardly any shedding . <p> I let my hair air dry and the results were immediately apparent . Usually my hair dries a frizzy , unruly mess . This time , my curls fell around my shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked soft and , most importantly , healthy . On any normal day I would have applied leave-in conditioner once my hair was dry , but my hair felt perfect . There was no need to add extra product , and my hair even looked naturally styled enough to wear out ! <p> I 'm one of those girls that gets hair everywhere because my hair is always breaking . Throughout the next few days the lack of breakage was incredible . It was blowing my mind how much stronger my hair felt . I went about 3 days after the deep conditioning treatment before I had to add any leave-in conditioner at all , and even then I only needed a little on my ends . Each time I use this my hair feels better and better . The Hair Mayonnaise has also been a great scalp treatment . I struggle with occasional dandruff , which I usually use Selsun Blue for . I found using the product as a scalp treatment without the use of medicated shampoo was enough to clear my scalp of dandruff and keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Parnevu Hair Mayonnaise is my new holy grail conditioning treatment . The best part is , it comes in a huge jar ( 16 oz ) and is only $7 . I know I 'm going to be purchasing this again and again as soon as this tub is done ( which I do n't think will be for a while , considering the size ) . <h> 6 COMMENTS <p> I have this weird psychological problem that prevents me from using or consuming something that sounds too weird .

This technique can be used on the face as well , but I highly recommend patch-testing how your skin reacts to latex before applying .

Since I 'm using the Tria on my legs , I decided to test waxing at home on my underarms . <p> One of the big differences between waxing and shaving is that waxing will take out the hair from the root , which will usually produce longer-lasting removal up to 8 weeks .

I was introduced to BodyHonee , which makes waxing products that not only claim to be all of these things , but also that are made of all natural ingredients .

It 's important to remember to let the wax cool a bit straight out of the microwave , and test the heat on the back of your hand before applying to the hair so that you 're sure not to burn yourself . <p> Once the wax cools , you want to apply the wax with the accompanying spatula , spreading in the direction of hair growth . The underarms can be tricky to wax , since many people have hairs growing in different directions . Luckily , mine only grow upward .

After the first strip , I was hooked . I could n't believe how well the wax worked to really grab my hairs and leave my skin feeling extremely smooth .

Im SlashedBeauty over there ! ) , you may have seen some of my adventures from Ireland last week . We fit so many sights and activities into a little less than a week , and it was an unforgettable experience trekking across the country with my mom ! <p> One of my favorite stops along the way was the Cliffs of Moher . If you 're unfamiliar , its like the Irish version of the Grand Canyon but just better . The view is spectacular , with chiseled cliffs sprouting from the pristine waters . We were lucky enough that the weather was pretty great by Irish standards the day we visited , only a little nippy but otherwise clear and bright . <p> I had three fashion favorites throughout my trip that were worn nearly every day . The first , which has been a staple on each of my vacations for over a year , is my jean jacket from Old Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light enough not to overheat when the sun comes out . My favorite feature is the inner pockets , which helps me keep important items ( passport , cell phone ) safely in reach . <p> My second must-have while traveling was my Tiny Tote by Dagne Dover . When I first looked at it online , it looked dangerously small for all of my daily needs that I typically keep with me but once it arrived , I knew itd be perfect for on-the-go . The small tote is surprisingly roomy , with enough space for my phone , sunglasses in a hard shell case , a couple lipsticks , perfume rollerball , hand sanitizer , hand lotion , and a small coin purse . Since it comes with a cross-body strap , it was easy to throw over my shoulder while trekking through both the countryside and the city without weighing me down . Plus , I love the trench blue shade , since it adds a nice splash of color to my outfit . <p> Finally , I brought along my Breckelles Indy Booties . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Coachella comfortably last year . While fashionable , they 're also durable and do n't  leave my feet aching even after my Fitbits reported 20,000 steps ! From the Cliffs to the Guinness Brewery , I ended up rocking them more frequently than my sneakers on the trip . <p> My other favorite stops were Galway and of course the heart : Dublin , where we found amazing shopping , music , and of course drinking . I loved visiting the Old Jameson Distillery , where we were schooled on the history of the brand as well as the process of making the most high quality Irish whiskey around . Throughout the tour , we were shown demonstrations of the process and we were even able to do a taste comparison of Jameson whiskey vs . Scotch and American whiskey . <p> During our visit , we stayed in many beautiful manors and castles . My personal favorite was the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel . Overlooking Dublin Bay , the castle was definitely the poshest accommodations we encountered , with beautiful rooms , amazing food , and great amenities . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags of luggage between us , and had a view of the sea from the private balcony . <p> It was also the most modern of the hotels we were staying at , while still maintaining the authentic charm of what you would imagine a castle to be . One of the most impressive highlights of the hotel was the indoor pool and spa area . With a large heated pool , jet spa , and private workout area , we were sure to indulge in the royal treatment ! There were three places to eat and drink in the castle after a long day exploring , and our breakfast was included in our stay and what a good one it was ! <p> Overall , it was a great trip that went by much too quickly ! But , its definitely good to be home , at least until my next trip overseas in August when I get to go to Israel .

I wanted to challenge myself to put together a look under $25 that I would totally wear out and about .

@@9946634 @3146634/ <h> Review : e.l.f . Skin Care <p> The long-awaited and much anticipated e.l.f . skin care line launched a couple weeks ago , and it was revealed that out of the twelve product concepts , customers requested moisture-focused products the most . The Daily Hydration Moisturizer , Soothing Serum , Illuminating Eye Cream , and Nourishing Night Cream were the four picks released as the first in the line . The skin care products ' prices are a little higher than the dollar bargains that e.l.f . is most well known for , but from my experience with them thus far , the price is justified . <p> The brand was very thoughtful with the packaging , which not only looks and feels high-end in the sleek , aqua blue containers , but is also designed to keep the products at their full potential . Each product 's packaging is opaque , which helps preserve the properties of the formulas . <p> In the morning , I 've been using the Daily Hydration Moisturizer ( $8 ) which surprisingly keeps my skin smooth while looking healthy underneath my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the day , but my dryness is kept under control . This is the only product in the line that contains fragrance , although very subtle . I think I was most disappointed in the fact that , as a daytime moisturizer , this does not have any SPF protection in it . I typically like layering my SPF with moisturizer , my primer , and foundation so this makes me feel like I need to add that extra step of sunscreen to keep my skin sun-safe . <p> I 've typically used the Soothing Serum ( $12 ) in my nighttime routine . Since it has Dimethicone in it , it might also work as a face primer but for my skin it seems too slick for that . It has an extremely thin cream consistency that sinks into the skin rapidly to moisturize deeper layers . Its refreshing and hydrating , and after a few uses I saw the redness around my nose start to calm down . <p> Next at night , I use the Illuminating Eye Cream ( $10 ) on my lids and under-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's very emollient some might say it leans oily . However , I already have oily lids and I have n't found that using this made them any worse . It has helped keep the area around my eyes smooth , and I have n't had any dry patches or puffiness that I commonly get this season . I like that it has a second lid underneath the tub 's cap to keep the cream as safe as possible . <p> After the eye cream , I 'll finish off with the Nourishing Night Cream ( $12 ) . This has a slightly heavier feel to it than the serum , but still does not feel overbearing . A small amount will offer a ton of moisture that I can still feel once morning hits . With both the night cream and eye cream , it would be best to use a spatula to scoop out product so that you 're not running the risk of contamination or just make sure your hands are completely clean . <p> The e.l.f . skin care line is water-based , and features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oil , Aloe , and Green Tea Extract to soothe and moisturize . I feel like this is an appropriate line for those with sensitive , normal or dry skin . Out of the four , I would say my favorites are the eye &amp; night creams . <p> You can purchase the skin care line online separately or as a full set . <p> If its water based then that means its perfect for oily skin . If someone is dry they do n't  have much or any sebum . Sebum is oil . If someone is oily it means they have alot of sebum . All skin types need moisturize . Just different types . To accurately moisturize dry skin the products should be oil based . To accurately moisturize oily skin the products should be water based . Therefore the ELF skincare line is actually better for people with oily , normal , acne prone , or combination skin types . <p> This skincare line is water based which means its perfect for oily skin . People with oily skin should use water based skincare products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't buy in the product line would be the moisturizer because it does n't  have SPF in it . <p> I am very particular with the skin care I use since my skin is sensitive but I want to try this . Ive been a lover of ELF for a few years and I 'm always mpressed Im sure I will love this and I love the packaging . <p> The packaging is really lovely for an affordable line . I am so jazzed to see a day moisturizer that is chemical sunscreen free ! *happy dance for me* I do wonder if the products could stand up to the demands of my very dry skin . Maybe I should pick up the line and give it a shot .

There are also three brand new shades that appear in this palette . <p> The day section consists of 3 mattes : Heaven , a creamy white , Cashmere Bunny ( new ) , a medium taupe , and Sexpresso , a deep brown . <p> The Classic section consists of Silk Teddy , a champagne pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown with a satin finish , and Erotica , a chocolate brown with gold shimmer particles . <p> All of these shadows are extremely soft and buttery to the touch . They glide onto the skin easily and with excellent color payoff that will last you all day . The palette comes with a fold out card with suggestions on how to get three distinct looks , but the possibilities are really vast with these shades . They all work very well together , and I find myself blurring the lines between the sections more often than sticking to just one category . here 's one of my go-to looks using this palette : <p> Lid : Honey Pot , - Crease : Push-Up , Outer Corner : Sexspresso <p> At $36 , while still pricey , the Too Faced Natural Eyes Palette is a more affordable alternative if you 've been swooning over the Naked palettes . You can purchase it at Sephora.

@@9946647 @3146647/ <h> REVIEW : Rimmel Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation <p> There has been a lot of buzz around new drugstore foundations this Spring . As the weather warms up , I need something that will keep my skin matte and my makeup in place . <p> The Rimmel Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation popped up overseas last year , and won over UK bloggers . Having finally arrived in the US at the top of 2014 , it was only a matter of time before it became a drugstore darling . <p> I have combo skin " an oily t-zone with drier patches around my chin and nose . When I choose a foundation , I want something that will balance my skin while offering good coverage . <p> The Stay Matte Liquid Mousse has a medium consistency whipped texture that blends into the skin easily . I 'm used to very liquidy foundations , so at first the formula felt a bit thick on my skin . You barely need a quarter size to cover your entire face . If you build up too much , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help to avoid that . <p> My favorite part about the foundation is that it sets with a satin-matte finish while still giving it a natural glow . You 'll get almost full coverage and an even skin tone with a small amount of product . The staying power is pretty impressive , too ! The finish , coverage , and oil control lasts for about 8 hours . I feel a smidge dewy at the end of the day , but far less than my bare skin and other foundations . However , if I have a particularly dry spot , it does become more noticeable topped off with Stay Matte . Makeup applies and sets well on top of this foundation . <p> As you may have heard from other bloggers , the biggest downfall of the Stay Matte foundations is the color selection , or lack thereof . With only 8 shades currently in the line , they all lean rather pink and orange . Shade 203 True Beige is the closest to my neutral skin tone ( which leans yellow ) and it 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my neck , it looks a little better , but I wish there was a more perfect match and can imagine this will be the biggest problem with most shoppers . <p> For about $5-7 , the Rimmel Stay Matte Liquid Mousse Foundation is a great option for skin that leans more oily than not . It may take you a couple tries to get the right shade , but remember : you can return makeup at most drugstores . The coverage and staying power outperforms other foundations at the same price point , and will feel great on your skin . I would definitely recommend this product as we move into the heart of Spring and through Summer , when most of us will need shine control ! <p> I 've seen a lot of bloggers try this for the MOD Rimmel post , and the reviews seem good across the board . I have oily skin , so this seems like a no-brainer if they have my shade , I 'm going to try it ! <p> You can find henna samples , here . http : **37;269;TOOLONG I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigmented , gave up dye fast , the uptake into my hair was crazy and I loved the colour .

( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henna is fabulous stuff , it gives gorgeous colour ( everyones is different , depending on their starting base ) it is safe to use over dye , it strengthens and conditions and gives insane shine . When I was a henna head , my hair looked like a Pantene commercial . I kid you not . But , again , you do n't  date henna , you marry it . <p> If you are interested in it , I suggest doing your research , read the experiences of others who use BAQ henna to dye their hair . If you have questions , concerns , do n't  hesitate to ask me , I was a henna head for a couple of years ( I ended up letting it go because I am just not a redhead at heart ) and I can help . Okay , this is a book in your comments . I do n't  want to scare you away from henna , I just wanted to give you a little info and offer help , answers to questions . Hell , I can tell you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If you are still interested , before you commit it to your head , buy sample sized packets of henna powder , do strand tests . Trust me , You WANT to strand test this stuff before you slop it on all over ! = <p> I have heard so many awesome things about this foundation , if I used foundation I would certainly give this one a try . I think its been years since I even used anything from Rimmel I need to scope them out more . I am disappointed that Rimmel is still one of those companies that offer a small selection of shades its been that way for a while and I remember when the stay matte foundation first came out years ago I could never try it because the darkest shade was still 4 or 5 shades too light for me.

So many awesome collections are coming out , including the new Pixi Limited Edition Holiday Collection ! I only just discovered Pixi this year , and have enjoyed the products Ive tried from them thus far I just talked about their toner as my new holy grail skincare item a couple of weeks ago . Although they are generally a mid-range brand , they have many affordable treats this season for the holidays . This collection includes four gifts : two value sets with much-loved products , and two brand new items ! <p> Let 's start off strong by looking at the headliner of this collection : the Ultimate Beauty Kit 2nd Edition . This book-style palette contains a whopping 40 eyeshadows and 12 face powders that will deliver a very large arsenal of looks . The shades range from cool to warm with a variety of different finishes as well . The pans of product are very generous for a palette like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The shadows are smooth and fairly pigmented across the board " moreso with the glitter and satin shades than the matte shades . A few of the mattes feel a little powdery but , overall , I found the shadows to be easy to work with . There are a ton of neutrals for every day looks but also nice pops of purple , blue and green . <p> The face powders are a bit more sheer but buildable . The top 6 work well as highlighters , the bottom 6 as blushes . I love the different shades Pixi included ; check out that orange and deep pink on the bottom ! <p> The next item in the collection is a trio of the brand 's very popular Shea Butter Lip Balms called Balmy Winter . The set includes the shades Comfort Clear , Honey Nectar , and Ripe Raspberry ( the last two being tinted ) . Honey Nectar is a nude apricot shade while Ripe Raspberry is a fuchsia pink . The shea butter in these balms make them ultra hydrating while still feeling lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . This would be a great stocking stuffer , and is priced right as it saves you $8 in comparison to buying the three separately . <p> Pixi is also known for their Fairy Dust loose pigment eyeshadows . The brand packaged up all of their shades into this Fairy Dust Favorites Light Catcher " a stacked container that let 's you take each color with you . These pigments are great to use as eyeshadows , highlights , or even to mix in with a nail color for some extra sparkle . This holiday treat is the best value in the collection . You are getting more product per well than the normal Fairy Dust packaging , and you 're paying $12 for all colors as opposed to $10 each separately . It 's a no brainer that you need to grab this while you can as a gift or for yourself = <p> Lastly , we have a new shade to add to the Pixi Nail Colours : Nude Dazzle . It 's a beige-y silver that 's pure sparkle with a foil finish , and applies completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accent nail , or throw them on all 5 fingers for a flashy festive manicure ! <p> I think the Limited Edition Holiday Collection from Pixi is on point this year .

Although , I recently started using a really cool note taking device that almost makes me wish that I were still in school aaaaalmost . <p> Throughout college , I encountered a ton of professors that did n't  allow laptops or tablets in the classroom . It annoyed me to no end because I can type a hell of a lot faster than I can write .

Where the heck has this been all my life . This device will take your handwritten notes , digitize them , and store them in the cloud so you can access them from all your devices . How . Cool . Is .

@@9946695 @3146695/ <h> Decorating Around a Black Leather Couch <p> Next weekend , Adam and I are moving into a new apartment ! I 'm very excited to get out of this one and have more room to decorate and really make the space into a home . A couple years ago , when Adam moved in with me , we decided we needed to ditch our rickety , cliche college futon and get an actual sofa . We went to Big Lots , which surprisingly has really nice full size couches for dirt cheap . When we narrowed down the selection based on taste and budget , our options were between a modern beige sofa or a large black leather couch . <p> Although I had my reservations about the choice , we both figured that the black leather fabric would be more forgiving to snacks or drinks enjoyed in front of the TV . Plus , it was actually really comfortable and cushy . But , when we got it delivered that day , I became overwhelmed because it was such a heavy presence in the room that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of gave up and just let it take over the room . <p> Now that were moving , Adam entertained the idea of getting a new couch . If you 've ever moved , though , you know that the whole process can get expensive . There are other things that we actually need ( like a fridge ) that take priority over items we already have . So I decided to come up with some color scheme options for the new living room that balance out the black leather sofa , but keep things light and fun . <p> When we first tried decorating around the sofa after purchasing it , I incorporated blue accents to match a blue chair that Adams grandpa had given him . So when looking around at decor we already had , I noticed that I could put together a room that incorporated the original blues I invested in , plus hints of gold by hanging wall art together that we had been keeping in different rooms . This living room would be the easiest for us to put together , since wed be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works together . I liked how the gold brings warmth to the cool tones . Plus , I could use the wine glass canvas Adams mom painted for us ! <h> Shop This Room <p> Turn on your JavaScript to view content <p> While thinking about other color schemes we could possibly use , I figured that blue needed to stay constant throughout because of Adams chair being a permanent and sentimental furniture piece . I 've always loved the combination of blues and greens , because it reminds me of sunny weather and relaxing days . Bright blues and greens also pop against the dark furniture we 've accumulated in efforts to compliment the couch over the years , like our black book case and coffee table . The light , cool shades definitely help balance the dark pieces . <h> Shop This Room <p> Turn on your JavaScript to view content <p> Finally , the most simplistic but rather chic design option : black , white and blue . This was the color palette that my friends loved the most , and the one Adam chose out of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeless about black and white , and I plan on accenting with different shades of blue , like navy , sky , &amp; cobalt . The combination is very tranquil , and makes the black leather couch seem the least out-of-place , which is why I was n't too bummed that I did n't  get my way with my first choice of blue &amp; gold accents . I also get to use this beautiful , one-of-a-kind sketch that I inherited from my grandma , which looks just like her when she was young . I can definitely get into this clean look plus I can always use the gold decor in the bedroom ! <h> Shop This Room <p> Turn on your JavaScript to view content <p> Now that we 've decided on our major design decision , I 'm even more excited to move and start sprucing the place up .

For a more wearable look , pick neutral shades like a peach , burnt orange or bronze . Bring the drama or go day-to-night by choosing fuchsias , purples or even blues . You 'll want to use a lip scrub and moisturize prior to application , since metallics will highlight any unevenness on the lips . Just like when playing up the eyes , keep the rest of the look neutral when making your lips the statement . Pictured : OCC Lip Tar Metallic in Authentic <p> My Picks : <h> 3 .

And those who had straight hair always wanted curly . I was the former : I had frizzy , thick , wavy hair that got curlier as I grew older . That was great in the 80 's when curly hair was all the rage , but then the styles went straight . Since then , I have blown-out , ironed , flat-ironed and even chemically straightened my hair . The chemical straightening worked wonders , if you wanted to sit in a salon chair for 5-7 hours , every six weeks . Not to mention the hundreds of dollars draining the pocketbook . <p> The man I 'm now seeing did n't even know my hair was curly until four months in , when we traveled together . After my shower , when I came out ( literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I revealed I was not the woman whom he thought I was . I flat-ironed my hair on a regular basis . The conversation went something like this : <p> HIM:I do n't understand why you spend so much time and energy straightening your hair , your curls are cute.ME : Cute ? ! You think this is cute ? ! ( Half my face was hidden by frizz ) HIM:Yes ! You look like a poodle . <p> I marched back into the bathroom and plugged in the flat iron . <p> My natural " poodle " hair <p> In the African-American community , the decision to keep natural curls or straighten has become an issue of cultural pride . According to a study by consumer research firm Mintel , the number of black women with natural hair jumped from 26% in 2010 to 36% in 2011 . The report also stated that between 2006 and 2011 there was a 17% percent drop in the sales of hair relaxers . <p> I decided to conduct an informal poll on SurveyMonkey.com and asked if curly , wavy or straight hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the person , the second highest response was that curly hair was the least attractive " on both men and women . Granted , of the 87 respondents , 97%- were Caucasian . For those who grew up with curly hair , none " zero percent " responded that curly hair was most attractive on a woman . For those who grew up with straight hair , only 4% responded that straight hair was most attractive on a woman . Grass is always greener ( or straighter , or curlier ) on the other side . <p> My hair straightened , then curled <p> In the past couple of years , I 've noticed that curls have been slowly coming back into style . Not the tight , curly coifs of the 80 's . But a softer curl , just on the bottom half of the hair . Now , to achieve this effect , I have to straighten my unruly mop and then use a curling iron on the bottom to get the soft , even curls that I see on the red carpet .

Inside , you 'll also find a full mirror , which I love because I can see my whole face when doing my makeup to see my entire look coming together . The palette itself is incredibly sturdy with a snap closure , and I will totally be packing it with me on my upcoming vacations coming up ! <p> What impressed me most about this palette was the shade range .

While most of the shimmer is a spray-over , they still retain their sheen once you get past the first few layers . The formula is velvety and so easy to work with . <p> What 's more important about the shade selection is the shade performance , and the Timeless Beauty palette did n't disappoint . I was genuinely surprised with the pigmentation of each and every shade . The blushes needed hardly a tap of a brush to get a ton of color transferred onto the face , and the highlights made a strong statement as well .

I 've always had really good luck with blushes from City Color , and these are no exception " the color actually did last over five hours over my NYX HD foundation . That 's a win ! <p> For once , I honestly have no complaints about this palette . I think it 'll work well for so many people , and even though at $24.99 its priced a bit higher than the brands other products , the quality , quantity and variety justifies the price . Plus , you can get an extra 10% off by clicking through my link to the City Color website . Today is the first day the Timeless Beauty palette is available online , and I am making a bold prediction it may sell out .

It 's full of gorgeous rose-toned neutrals , champagnes , and warm browns to create some really pretty spring looks . <p> I 've been loving this palette since I first laid eyes on it . It 's got an abundance of mattes ( huge plus in my book ) , plus satin and shimmer shades to spice up your looks . The formula is soft and the shadows blendable . I was pleasantly surprised with the color payoff and how well they last throughout the day . For $20 , this is an awesome alternative to similar high end palettes . <p> Halo eye makeup looks have been my go-to lately , because I love how round and bright they make the eyes look .

@@9946762 @3146762/ <h> How to Prepare for Your Senior Picture <p> I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but summer break is indeed coming to an end soon but the exciting thing is that many students will be taking their senior portraits this year ! This is the photo that gets hung on the living room wall and shown off arguably the most throughout your life , so you got ta make it a good one ! <p> I did n't  take a senior photo in college , but when I was in high school , our senior photos were super important since they were larger in the yearbook than everyone elses , with our senior quotes underneath . Mine ( above ) turned out alright , but hindsight is 20/20 and there are definitely some changes I would have made given the chance " so let me give you my best tips to prepare for your senior photo so you 'll love yours forever ! <h> 1 . Love the Skin You 're In <p> Luckily , I did n't  struggle with problem skin very much in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've heard the horror stories about breaking out right before picture day ! The best thing you can do is really nail down your skin care routine at least 28 days before you take your picture . Since dermatologists say that acne medication can take anywhere from 4-8 weeks to start working , getting a head start is your best bet to a clear canvas for the photo . <p> Not sure where to start in picking out the right products ? Try downloading the Oxy 28 Day Challenge app , which asks you questions about your skin to give you a customized and dermatologist-approved acne treatment plan with product recommendations . The recommended plans have a money-back guarantee to clear up your skin in 28 days , so you 've got nothing to lose ! The app will also send you reminders and tips to keep you on track on your road to clear skin for picture day , and you can upload before &amp; after photos to track your progress . <h> 2 . Your Outfit is Key <p> I was really zeroed in on the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad it gave enough of a contrast against the dark background or I would have been a floating head ! If you do n't  know what type of backdrop the photographer will be using , its best to have a couple of options in mind that you absolutely love and would n't mind shooting in either way . That way , you do n't  clash or blend in to the background . <p> Ty to avoid loud patterns like stripes , as they usually do n't  translate well on camera and probably wont be distinct when the photo is shrunken down for the yearbook . <p> Wear a nude bra underneath your outfit so you do n't  risk the flash exposing more than you want " it will also help conceal straps that may be peeking out under your blouse . And please , for the love of god , do n't  wear spaghetti straps . Also , avoid strapless shirts/dresses . I promise : you will look naked . <p> Pick accessories that do n't  reflect too much , since you want your face to be the key feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ironically , here 's one area that I wish I could change for my own senior portrait . Its a good idea to go a little heavier with your makeup so that you do n't  look washed out in the photo , but if I were to do it again , I would n't have gone with the black smoky eye I chose to wear . I think the dark colors made my eyes look smaller almost hooded . <p> Instead , I would go with softer shades but still adding extra definition around the eyes with a few extra coats of mascara and winged liner , with a nice matte brown in the crease . Inner corner highlighting will also help keep your eyes looking open and bright . <p> Adding just a tad more blush and contour than you would normally wear will help keep the definition in your face through the flash " I wish I had used a little more contour in my own photo ! <h> 4 . Care About Your Hair <p> In this case , I was glad they used a dark background because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the photo , use a deep conditioning treatment so that your hair is smooth and frizz-free , and follow up with an oil the next morning while styling for a boost of shine . <p> I also regret that my bangs covered one of my eyes in the photo , casting even more shadow onto my face . Bring bobby pins that blend in with your hair color if you constantly struggle with waving your hair out of your face . You can also afford to be liberal with hair spray for the photo since you 're not capturing movement . <p> Since most yearbook photos are taken straight on , I would suggest leaving your hair down so that you do n't  look like you 've suddenly chopped off all your hair when its hiding in a ponytail or bun . <p> Overall , accentuating your natural beauty and stay true to what makes you feel like you ! Trying a brand new look or style for the photo can easily backfire , so do what 's comfortable to you and you 'll end up with a photo you 'll love . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Oxy .
