@@100638581 @4838581/ <p> Diets . Do n't . Work . We have all heard the phrase , yet so many people find themselves going back to the quick fix solutions that did n't work in the past ! I always say , if you ca n't stick with it long term , you already know it is doomed for failure . So ... If diets do n't work , what will ! ? ! <p> Here at Dashing Dish we are all about creating healthy mindsets and long term healthy habits , which is why we try to make living a healthy lifestyle simple and enjoyable ! If you are looking for the best place to get started , here are three simple steps that will help you develop healthy habits that will last a lifetime ! <p> 1 . Make a Few Simple Swaps . <p> As tempting as it may be to go on a diet , cut major food groups , or make drastic changes to your eating habits in the new year , I would challenge you to think about things differently . What if instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fueling your body with real food ! ? This will help your body work the best that it can , and you will feel your best . Eating real food does n't deprive you , but rather it allows you to say yes to foods that are nourishing and delicious ! It also creates a balanced approach towards food and makes room for the treats you enjoy in a healthy way ! <p> So , when it comes to cleaning up your diet and eating real foods , where do you begin ! ? ! The best place to start is to make small swap outs in the nutrition department that wo n't seem drastic or like you are cutting out whole food groups , but rather you are replacing them with a better option ! These small swaps will end up making huge impact in your overall health and body composition ! <p> Here are five nutritional swaps that will make a drastic impact on your health and body composition : <p> Instead Of These : ( Dashing Dish recipes do not include any of these ingredients ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butter ( or any unhealthy fats , such as fried foods or processed oils ) <p> Processed Snacks ( such as crackers , chips , cookies , etc . ) <p> Try These Instead : ( Dashing Dish recipes use all of these ingredients ) <p> The key to setting goals is making sure they are attainable and realistic . For this reason , it is often best to start with short term goals , as they are something that can be accomplished in a realistic time frame . These short term goals can be made with the effort to bring you towards your bigger goals in a more manageable way . <p> Here are some examples of short-term goals to get you started : <p> Bring Back the Snacks . Surprisingly , smart snacking in between meals can be incredibly beneficial for your metabolism ! When you aim to eat three small meals with about two snacks in between , your metabolism will stay fueled throughout the day , and your blood sugar levels will remain stabilized . <p> Eat Every Few Hours . Eating something small every three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can also prevent you from becoming overly hungry which can lead to overeating at meal times . <p> Drink More Water . Buy a large water bottle to help you keep track of the water you are drinking throughout the day . This will help prevent dehydration , which can be commonly mistaken for a false sense of hunger . Replace any other beverages you are currently drinking with water . Add lemon or lime juice , or Tru Lemon packets for flavor if you desire ! <p> Get Moving . Aim to be active for at least thirty to sixty minutes per day most days of the week ! This could be going to the gym , joining a workout class , walking , cleaning , playing a workout video , or dancing around your house ! <p> Spend Time with God . Even if it seems that we do n't have time to set aside to spend with the Lord , we are actually making a very important investment into our present and future when we do . Time spent with our Heavenly Father will strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . He will also give us wisdom to carry out everything we do each day with efficiency . We will have an easier time prioritizing the important things when we put Him first each day . <p> Plan Ahead . One of the keys to being organized is planning ahead . For example , if you have a busy week ahead of you , try planning your meals ahead of time , or bringing a snack with you on the go . Each step you take to plan and prepare will save you stress when things get really busy . I also like to plan my workouts ahead of time . If you treat workouts like a scheduled appointment then you are less likely to miss them ! <p> Make a To-Do List . Often times , tasks can become overwhelming as they race through our minds . We may even forget some of the important things on our to-do lists if we do not write them down . Spend a few moments at the beginning of each day jotting down the things you need to get done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . This will help you feel accomplished and take a load off your mind as you see things getting done . <p> Stay Focused . When we have a to-do list that is a mile long , it can be easy to get sidetracked . If we stay focused on the task at hand until it is complete , we will feel a sense of relief as we make progress and accomplish each task . Just be sure to cross off the list as you go throughout your day ! This will help you feel a sense of accomplishment , and give you a sense of what can wait until tomorrow . 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

@@100638587 @4838587/ <p> To the girl or woman who may be reading this who is battling an eating disorder <p> First I want to start by encouraging you ! The world may tell you that it is impossible to ever fully heal or recover from eating disorders . However , I am living proof ( among thousands of other women that I have spoken with ) that have been healed and completely set free by the redeeming power of Jesus ! The good news is , what God did for me He can and will do for you as well if you let Him , because the Bible says that He does not show favoritism , and what he does for one person , He will do for anyone who believes . ( Acts 10:34 ) . Everyones journey may look different , but with Jesus , freedom is possible ! <p> The second thing I want to say is that if you have n't already told someone you trust that you are dealing with this , it is very important that you do so . The reason it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep everything in secret , because he knows he has power to work in the darkness . When we reveal things to the people around us that you trust ( like your family , for example ) , it is brought into the light . It is only in the light where God can move and bring freedom . It is for freedom that Christ has set us free ! As a child of God , you have already been set free , but you must choose to step into that freedom ! So if you have n't already told people around you that you trust , that is the first step ! You may need to seek professional help as well , and in this case , it helps to have someone to talk to so that you can have support when seeking help . <p> I want to also share that my healing process truly began when my sisters came to me and talked to me about what I was struggling with . It was at that moment that I finally admitted what I was doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing those that I loved . I also began to talk to my mom and my family about what I was facing , which helped me break free from the darkness , shame , and guilt that the enemy was trying to keep me in . When I opened up to the people I loved and trusted , God was able to she 'd His light on these once dark places . My mom also made an appointment for me to speak with a Christian counselor and pastor , which helped me talk through a lot of things that I was facing emotionally ... And although all of these things were important steps in my recovery , the thing that changed me and truly allowed me to heal was my personal walk with Jesus . <p> When I was walking through my own journey to freedom , the Lord showed me that there were four major steps to healing from the inside out . It all began with me making the choice to surrender everything to Him . After making that choice , He took me by that hand and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to complete and total healing and restoration . <p> Here are some of the steps that the Lord led me through in my journey . <p> 1 . Submit everything to God . First and foremost , I knew I had to come to the Lord in full surrender , which meant that I had to start by repenting for how I treated my body . The bible says that our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit when we ask Jesus to be our Lord and Savior , ( 1 Corinth. 6:19 ) . When we battle eating disorders , we are not honoring God with the bodies that He gave us , and we should come to Him with a repentant heart . When we repent , He is faithful and just to forgive us the very first time we pray ( 1 John 1:19 ) . The next step is to surrender everything to Him . This is a daily ongoing decision that involves laying down our will for His , and making the choice to trust that His ways are better than ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this decision is the first step to freedom , peace , and a truly satisfied life . <p> 2 . Recognize truth from a lie . Often times when we are believing a lie , we do n't see it at first . Ask God to search your heart and reveal anything that is not truth that you have been believing . Ask Him to open your eyes to the truth and to bring any area that was once in darkness into the light . <p> 3 . Renew your mind . Spend time in prayer , praise , and God 's Word DAILY ! Allow God 's Word to renew your mind to who He says you are . Spend time in fellowship with Him and allow Him to heal you from the inside out . <p> 4 . Guard your heart . You are unique , original , and a beautiful masterpiece that God created for a specific purpose . Be careful to guard your heart against the customs and behaviors of this world and comparison to others . <p> 5 . Spend time with Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you could do is to spend time daily with Jesus ! It does n't have to be complicated , He just wants to spend time with you , and to hear from you , and He also wants to speak to you ! When I was going through this season , I remember asking the Lord to reveal His love for me . I know this does n't seem to connect with weight or eating disorders , but it 's only when you get a true revelation of His love for you that you can give control to Him and let go of the fear and control related to your weight . If you see yourself as He sees you , and you know His great love for you , it takes a lot of the fear away of giving Him control . In order to get a revelation of His love , all you have to do is ask Him to show you . I can promise you that He wants to reveal His love to you more than you want Him to ! <p> Now , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any area of our lives is the spiritual healing that only Jesus can provide . However , there is also a practical side to walking out freedom from disordered eating . As far as the physical part of this journey goes , I personally found that as I began to heal on the inside , the Lord put a desire in me to start to cooking and baking and to learn to have a healthy relationship with food again . After time went on , the Lord led me to different resources that taught me how to begin to listen to my body and eat intuitively , ( such as the book , You are Not What You Weigh by Lisa Bevere ) . <p> For me , intuitive eating began with me praying and asking the Lord to teach me how to listen to my body . I made the choice to trust to the Holy Spirit on the inside of me rather than my fears . It took some time to relearn how to eat in a balanced way , so be patient with yourself ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be alarmed if it seems scary at first but know that God will not lead you astray or disappoint you when you are seeking His will and help ! <p> I want to also point out that as far as the healing process goes and learning to eat healthy again , everyone 's journey may look a little different . The good news is , God knows each one of us so deeply and how to get through to our hearts when we surrender to Him . The Bible promises that the Spirit of God on the inside of us will teach us , guide us , and lead us into all truth when we invite Him to lead ( John 16:13 ) . Surely if He created our bodies , He can teach us how to walk into the freedom that He provided for us ! <p> And , last but not least , the last and most important thing that God taught me when walking out my healing was that I am not what I weigh , and guess whatNeither are you ! I do believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh and He wants you to feel comfortable in your skin , and He will help you get there ! But with that being said , I would encourage you to take a step back and realize that you are truly beautiful and wonderfully made by the King of Kings , and I am sure that you have SO much to be proud of outside of what you weigh ! While you are traveling on this journey to finding complete freedom and peace in this area , be sure to realize at the end of the day one thing ; You are so much more than what you weigh ! <p> Please Note : The information provided here should not be considered medical advice and is not intended to replace consultation with a qualified medical professional or treatment provider . If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder , it is important to tell someone you trust , so you or that person can get professional help to address the specific needs of recovery . 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734 
@@100638591 @4838591/ <p> As many of you know , I am just days away from expecting my first baby , which means I am in full blown nesting mode ! Because we are having her in the month of June , I started to plan ahead for freezer meals that I would enjoy in the summer . Unfortunately , things like salads and fresh foods are n't good to make in advance or store in the freezer , however , there are plenty of options that are packed with summer fruits and veggies , and are great for warmer weather ! That being said , if I were to prepare freezer meals in batches in the winter or fall months , I would likely have more soups , chilis , sweet potato dishes , casseroles , baked pasta dishes , lasagnas , and crockpot meals , which all freeze and re-heat really well . <p> To start , I want to share how I got started with planning my menu , how I executed my meal prep , and how I freeze and stored things for when the baby comes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my menu , I did so by writing out a list of things I would want to have for breakfasts , lunches , dinners , and snacks . From there , I narrowed it down to choices that I knew Sean and I both enjoyed ( for the most part ) , and that there was something for both of us to choose from for each meal . I planned to make meals lasting at least two weeks , although , I figured it would be nice if I ended up having more than we needed in the long run . <p> 2 . Prepare Meals : From there , I made my grocery list and meal plan using the Dashing Dish meal plan and grocery list builder , breaking it down into two weeks . That way I could grocery shop and make half the meals one week , and the rest the following , ( which I preferred , so I did n't feel overwhelmed ) . After grocery shopping , I would make my meals and snacks on different days of the week when I had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big meal prep session . ) I found it best to break it down into individual meal prep throughout the week because I have been so busy , so I had to work it in when I found time . <p> 3 . Freeze and Store Meals : As far as freezing and storing meals , I plan to pull things out in batches as I need them , and enjoy them as leftovers through the week , so I personally packed things into big casserole dishes , etc. , although you could also pack things individually if you prefer to have one single serving that is fresh each time you enjoy a meal . <p> 4 . Thaw and Re-heat : I personally baked things before hand so they are ready to go when I am hungry , ( which I 'm guessing will be very helpful with a new baby ) . Since they are already baked , I plan to pull them out of the freezer the night before ( or the morning of ) , and allow them to thaw in my fridge overnight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thaw at room temp for a few hours ) . I can then reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving , and save the rest to eat as leftovers . If however you prefer your food freshly baked , ( not re-heated ) , then I would recommend assembling the dish , and freeze before baking . That way you can thaw overnight or throughout the day in the fridge , and bake according to the recipes directions when you are ready to enjoy ! <p> LUNCHES : For lunches I made one of my husbands favorites , my Easy Cheesy Burritos , Salmon Cakes , and Black Bean Burgers ( recipes coming soon ) . I also made some Chicken Fajita Cauliflower Rice Bowls , which I frozen individually for easy thawing ( recipe coming soon ) . I plan to pull these out individually as needed as well and heat in the microwave for about 1 minute . I will most likely serve the burgers and salmon cakes with a side dish such as veggies , avocado , or with a salad , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken fajita bowls with salsa and possibly some avocado or guacamole . <p> I also pre-made some Buffalo Chicken Burgers ( I kept these raw to freeze ) and marinated some chicken breasts in ziplock bags to thaw in the fridge and grill when we are in the mood for grilling ! <p> And that about wraps it up ! Overall I really do n't feel like it was a lot of work because like I said , I did all the prep in little batches throughout a two week period , freezing things as I went . As you can see , freezer cooking can work for you whether you enjoy fresh foods , or do n't mind leftovers ! I hope this information was helpful , and it inspires you to meal plan for a coming busy season in your life ! <p> Last but not least , here are a few other food freezing tips : <p> To prevent freezer burn , use freezer specific containers . For zip-top bags , use ones specifically made for freezing . You may end up with freezer burn if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , if you 're freezing something in a bag , get rid of excess air before sealing it . If you 're using a plastic container , make sure it has a tight-fitting lid and use the smallest size that will fit what you 're freezing , as excess air in the container allows for freezer burn . <p> If you are baking food ahead of time , let food sit at room temperature until it cools completely before freezing . If the food is warm at all , it will create moisture as the dish freezes , creating freezer burn . <p> If you are not baking food ahead of time , always thaw raw food in fridge ( not at room temperature ) , overnight or at least eight hours during the day . Bake or cook according to recipe directions and food safety parameters . <p> Meals can be stored in the freezer for up to three months before they spoil or before flavors are affected .

@@100638598 @4838598/ <p> A few weeks ago I got to celebrate one of my best friends second baby to be , so we threw her a baby sprinkle ! A " sprinkle " is a mini-version of a baby shower , that is generally thrown for a mommy-to-be who is having her second or third baby . <p> Dayna and I have been friends for about 10 years , and we have been through a lot together , but the most exciting has certainly been expecting our babies together ! Dayna has a 1.5 year old daughter Luella , whom we just adore , and she is expecting a son in August ! <p> Dayna and I have something else in common , other than being pregnant together ... We both love ice cream ! I knew for her sprinkle that I had to do an ice cream bar ! <p> We set the sprinkle from 2-5 pm on Sunday , so a dessert bar was perfect for that time of day ! <p> We made lemon water and lemonade for drinks , Skinny Pop for a snack , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chocolate covered oreos and pretzels , and rice crispy treats , ( which are a few of Dayna 's favorite treats ) .

@@100638599 @4838599/ <p> Years ago , I started journaling while reading my bible . I would simply write down whatever came to mind , or whatever I felt God was showing me and/or teaching that day . It did n't take long before I was able to see a consistent pattern developing in what God was speaking to me , and it was only through journaling that I was able to capture the beautiful portrait that God was creating in my heart . <p> The only problem that I found with my journaling was that there was no structure to it . When it comes to spending time with God is perfectly alright in many ways . However , I 'm certainly a person that craves organization , and the one thing that I found was that it was very hard for me to find ' certain ' journal entries when I went back to look for them . <p> That being said , one of the best sermons that I 've heard so far was my pastor 's teaching on self-feeding . He talked about a specific way of journaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has radically transformed the way he views spending time with God , and that it made him very excited to see what God was going to show him every day . After seeing some of the benefits journaling has had in my own life , I was instantly intrigued ! <p> The " O " is my observation of that verse , or how God is bringing light to that verse for me . <p> The A is the application of the scripture to my life , as the Holy Spirit leads . <p> And " P " stands for prayer . I take a moment and write out a prayer as it relates to what God has shown me that day . <p> Here 's a quick example of how a SOAP journal entry might look ( Note : This is not an actual journal entry of mine ) : <p> S ( Scripture ) : " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me " Philippians 4:13 <p> O ( Observation ) : There is nothing that I ca n't do with Christ living in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way . <p> A ( Application ) : Yesterday I was really doubting being able to accomplish the huge project I was working on , but I need to remember that the Word of God does not lie , and it says that I can do ALL things through Christ , and that means ALL things , even my project ! <p> P ( Prayer ) : " Lord please forgive me for relying on my own strength when trying to accomplish things . Ultimately I know that when I depend on myself I will be let down , and short circuit your strength and power working in me . Help me to remember this verse when I 'm tempted to doubt my abilities , and help me to rely upon your strength . Help me to remember that you promised that I can do anything with your help ! In Jesus Name , Amen . " <p> My walk with God has been impacted in so many ways since I started this type of journaling a few months ago . <p> Instead of having a thousand thoughts running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I now find myself more focused , meditating on a specific Word for that day . It 's almost like I have a specific portion of scripture to chew , digest , and sustain me for the day .... I guess that 's why it 's referred to as our daily bread ! <p> It 's also improved my relationship with God because I am able to make clear connections to what He is speaking to me . I do this by titling each journal entry with a few key words that explain what He led me to that day . This allows me to easily back track to a particular scripture , and how it applies to me . <p> That way , when I find myself needing to be reminded of a specific promise , teaching , or word that He has shown me , I am able to flip right to it ! This is also great when I 'm trying to minister to other people , because I am able to look up a certain promises as they relate ! <p> On that note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about journaling , and spending time in the Word of God , so I am not saying this is the only way to spend time meditating on the Word , or that it is necessarily what 's right for you . The Word of God is alive , powerful , and sharper than any two edged sword ( Heb. 4:12 ) . It will change your life no matter how you go about studying it ! However , this is one way of really focusing on God 's promises , that has been powerful for me personally , so I thought I 'd share it with all of you ! Hope it 's a blessing ! xo Katie

@@100638607 @4838607/ <h> Dashing Dish is a place where I hope to share what God has taught me , both spiritually and physically . <p> My relationship with food , exercise , and my body has gone up and down many times in my life . It really all began when I was a pre-teen , and I began to develop earlier than the other girls , leading to feelings of insecurity about my body from a very young age . <p> From the age of 14 to when I was 21 years old , I began down a road of disordered eating , which manifested in different forms . It all began when I had the thought that eating a very small amount would make me skinnier , so I began to starve my body . As with any unhealthy means to lose weight , this excessive restriction of calories and food groups could only last so long . This ultimately led me to a cycle of bingeing , which began when I was about 16 years old . ( It just so happened that I was working at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight started creeping up , I started doing everything I knew to do in order to gain control of my weight . This ultimately lead to a vicious cycle of bingeing , starving , dieting , and compulsive excessive exercise . As I attempted to control my weight over the years , I went from one extreme to another , and as I did , my weight fluctuated from extremely low , to high , and everything in between . <p> When I entered college , I began to work out at the gym on campus and I began to eat a lot of ' healthy ' food . However , despite my best attempts , my weight still fluctuated dramatically , which always lead me to feel fearful of ' certain ' foods and I never could miss a workout . It did n't take me long to learn that my efforts were not healthy . In fact , it left me feeling fatigued , stressed , anxious , and tired all of the time ! Realizing that this was not how I wanted to live the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Everything finally started to change when I took this to the Lord in prayer . I knew I wanted to glorify Him with this body that He gave me to take care of . I came to the Lord and asked Him to help me . I asked Him to reveal to me what His plan was for me and to show me what I needed to know in order to to treat my body right . <p> And so the pursuit of true ' BALANCED ' healthy living began for me when I finally got off the ' control ' wagon . I realized that all the ups and downs in my past really stemmed from my need to control . I finally made the choice to give God ' control ' of my weight , and it was then when I saw the most dramatic and beautiful changes in my weight , health , and life in general ! My transformation did n't happen over night , but the more that I sought God in this area , the more free I became . I truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ( about anything ) and spend time with Him daily , that His desires will become your desires . You suddenly come to a place where you stop worrying or being anxious , and you finally have peace ! <p> I also realized that everything in life comes down to a balance between the spiritual and physical . For example , I asked God to speak to me about how much I should work out , how I should fuel my body , and even about how much He created me to weigh . I knew that although I asked the Lord for His help , that it also meant I needed to put action to it . After all , the Bible says in James 2:17 , " Faith without works is dead " . I have to admit , it was n't an easy process to live healthy without any shortcuts . But in the end , it 's always worth it , because anything worth keeping takes hard work and determination to get . <p> For me , this meant not only having faith that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . So , I started going to the library for hours and began reading research articles on how nutrition and exercise effects our bodies . ( Since I 'm a registered nurse , I have always found these articles interesting . ) I also began trying out different workouts and finding ones that worked for me . This meant finding workouts that I actually enjoyed enough to go back to . For me personally , a combination of circuit and strength training is what has truly transformed my body . I also got in the kitchen and started creating healthy and tasty meals that were quick and easy to make , which is essentially how Dashing Dish got started . <p> God also taught me that one of the greatest ' tools ' He gave us is the ability to listen to our bodies ! That 's why when it comes to my everyday food choices , I choose to eat foods that are healthier because they make me feel energetic and satisfied . Personally , I have found that when I eat a higher protein diet and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel energized and my blood sugar feels steady throughout the day . I have found that everything in life comes to one principal : The more you seek Him , the more you have a revelation of His great love for you . As you begin to understand His love , the more you trust Him with EVERY area of your life ! If you have n't already surrendered your life to Him , He is just a prayer away ! He loves you , and He has AWESOME plans for you , if you simply let Him work in your life . <p> It 's truly amazing to stand back and see what the Lord has done in my life as I surrendered ( and continue to surrender ) anything and everything He shows me to give over to Him ! The cool thing about God is that He only asks us to give Him something if He has something better to give us in return . I now find myself enjoying food , listening to my body , and feeling more fit and toned than I ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow His leading . The neat thing is , that 's how faith works with everything . The more you start to trust God and give areas of your life that you are ' in control of ' over to Him , the more freedom and joy you will find . It might not make sense at all to your brain , but it 's not supposed tothat 's why it 's called faith and trust ! I can promise that God has a better plan for your life than you could ever imagine or achieve on your own ! <p> Dashing Dish is a place where I hope to share what God has taught me both spiritually and physically over the years to reach a healthy balance . I hope that as I share what He has poured into me , that you will be refreshed with the great love and plan that He has for you !

I 'm sure many of you may be curious about the details , so I decided to do a pregnancy Q&amp;A ! This has been one of the hardest secrets to keep , and I am so excited to finally share the details with you all ! Yayyy ! ! ! <p> How did you find out you were pregnant and what were your first pregnancy symptoms ? <p> I found out I was pregnant on October 8th , when I was babysitting my nephew Gabriel for the weekend . I brought a pregnancy test with me because I was starting to feel some symptoms that I honestly thought were PMS , but I thought why not bring a test just in case ! ? ! The first test I took was a first response , and when I took the test , the strangest thing happened ... nothing showed up on the results window ! Not a control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I threw the test away in frustration , and thought , " well that was a waste !

I picked it up , and there were two lines ! ! ! I literally gasped out loud ! ! ! I was nervous , excited , and in shock all at the same time ! I also wondered if I was actually pregnant , or if the test was in error since nothing showed up for a while , but I have heard that it is very rare for a test to have a false positive , so I was pretty darn sure that I was . <p> Moments later my nephew woke up from his nap , and as I went to grab him out of his crib I told him that he was going to have another little cousin , ( so yes , technically , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appropriate to tell an 8 month old before my husband ! ) ; ) Speaking of , my husband was out of town at the time , so I had a few days to test again ( all showing positive ) and think about how I would tell him in a special way ! <p> How did you tell Sean ? <p> The day before Sean came home I went to a local bakery and got a box of donuts . Sean loves donuts , but honestly does n't eat them often , so if I buy them it is usually a very special treat . On October 12th , ( the morning that he returned home from his trip ) , I set the closed donut box out on the counter . The box had a donut , the positive test , and a onesie that said , " He Answered " , because we have been praying for this little one for quite some time , ( more on that later ) . <p> When Sean in the kitchen , I told him that I bought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He was so excited and said , " thank you sweetie ! " Little did he know there was something much better than donuts in the box ! ; ) <p> After he opened the box and realized what was going on , he broke down and started sobbing tears of joy and gratefulness ! We hugged and cried together for what seemed like forever . Afterwards we watched a slide show that I made of our journey together , all the way from when we met , to getting engaged , and on to now having a baby ! The slideshow was filled with pictures and scriptures of God 's promises we have stood on for this baby , so of course we cried some more while watching it ! <p> How did you tell your family and friends ? <p> Sean and I told my family first , because my moms birthday was on October 13th , just one day after I told Sean . I knew it would be the perfect opportunity to share the news because my whole family would be together . I shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grammy to baby G &amp; E ( Gabriel and Easton ) , and soon to be grandma to three . " When my mom opened the gift she gasped and said , " Noooo way ! ! !

" I 'm sure everyone was getting the hint pretty quickly at this point , but when my mom read the card out loud it was clear to everyone we were pregnant ! My sisters started crying and we all laughed and cried together the rest of the dinner ! It was a joyous celebration without a doubt ! <p> Just two days later we were with Sean 's entire family for his brothers birthday celebration , ( talk about great timing ! ) So , we decided to share the news with them on that day . Because it was also October , which is breast cancer awareness month , I always celebrate and honor Seans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift basket of pink ribbon items . <p> We gave his mom the gift basket when we first got to the house , and I told her to look at the ' shirt ' first ! The shirt was actually a rolled up onesie that said , " My grandma is my hero " with a pink ribbon on it . She read the onesie and did n't really respond right away , ( I do n't think she wanted to assume anything ) , so moments later I said , " I 'm pregnant " ... and the entire room was bursting with joy from that moment on ! We all hugged and cried together and talked about how excited we were for the first baby to be added to the Farrell clan ! <p> I told a few close friends early on who I knew were standing in agreement and praying with us to get pregnant . I wanted to share the news of God 's faithfulness , so I gave them a gift with the same onesie saying , " He answered " , and shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you when you found out , and how far along are you now ? <p> I believe I was around 3 weeks when I first found out . The problem was I do n't have regular periods , so it is tough to say for sure , but it was confirmed after having an ultrasound confirming how many weeks I am . I am currently just a few days shy of 12 weeks . <p> When is the due date ? <p> My due date is on Fathers Day ! ! ! When the doctor told us I was due on June 18th , Sean instantly replied , " that 's Father 's Day " ! He was so proud and excited ! If the baby is born on or before it 's due date , what a gift that will be for his first Fathers Day ... and even more so , what an AWESOME gift from our Heavenly Father ! <p> How have you been feeling ? Do you have any food cravings or aversions ? <p> From weeks 6-12 I had quite a few rough days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ! I do n't know who came up with the term " morning " sickness , but that certainly was not the case with me ! I also felt a whole new level of exhaustion that I did n't even know was possible ! I am not a napper , but I was finding myself taking naps throughout the day , or at the very least falling asleep at 6 pm ! <p> As far as food goes , things certainly changed pretty early on . At about 5 weeks I started to despise ( and I mean despise ) coffee , protein shakes , and a lot of different foods that I ordinarily LOVE ! This was really hard for me at first because I did n't know what to eat ! ! ! I kept saying , " I give people ideas on what to eat for a living , and I have no clue what to eat myself ! " The hardest part was finding the ONE thing that actually sounded good for each meal , and it changed almost every day . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eating mostly carbohydrates ! I do n't know if this is because your body actually needs more carbohydrates , or if they are just easier to digest , but I have heard that this is pretty common for your first trimester , ( and to be honest , I am hoping this will be improving soon ! ) Another change has been the fact that we have been eating out more , mostly because there have been so many days that home cooked meals just did n't sound ( or smell ) good ! Going out to eat is not something that we typically do often , but if it means that I can eat a meal without getting sick , it is worth it to me ! <p> I have been doing my best to choose the best and healthiest options available , but can tell you that pregnancy has already taught me more about listening to my body ( and having grace with it ) than ever before ! I thought I did so before I got pregnant , but when you are thinking about another life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Will you find out the gender before the baby is born ? <p> Yes we will ! In fact , we are doing a gender specific blood test . This is a fairly new test that be done as early as 10 weeks into the pregnancy . It is a simple blood test that is able to determine if there are any Y chromosomes in the mothers blood , which would mean the mother is carrying a boy . We decided to do the test so that we can find out early ... Just in time for Christmas Eve ! We decided to do this because Sean 's brothers live out of town , so we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to find out when everyone is together ! We are gathering at my sister Sarah 's house for the evening for a Christmas Eve/Gender Reveal Party ! We ca n't wait , and of course we will be sharing the news with all of you on Christmas morning , so stay tuned ! : ) <p> Will you be sharing pregnancy news and updates ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump pictures with you all ! At first I really had to pray about the decision to share updates , because I remember there were times it was hard for me to see my newsfeed filled with peoples pregnancy photos while I was in the season of waiting ... But after praying about it , God spoke to me and said , " This pregnancy will bring people hope who have been waiting for a baby of their own " , so I decided to share some pictures along the way . I plan to do so with the utmost of sensitivity however , and I do hope that if you are in the season of waiting on your own baby , that any picture I do share will bring you joy and hope knowing that if God did it for me , He can and will do it for you as well ! <p> How will Dashing Dish be impacted by you becoming a new mom ? <p> I am very excited about how becoming a mom will impact Dashing Dish ! I have always been a huge advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let 's face it ...

So , instead of writing a book , Sean and I felt impressed to share our testimony in a video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of waiting of their own . TO WATCH A VIDEO OF OUR TESTIMONY CLICK HERE . <p> I also plan to share some additional blog posts here on Dashing Dish on some of the things that God taught me during my own season of waiting ! <p> What would you say to the women out there who are in the season of waiting for a baby ? <p> To the women in waiting , I would say do n't lose hope ! There were many days I would cry and cry wondering when the day would be that I would get to have a baby growing in my belly . And there were so many days that I would feel such sorrow , regardless of the fact that so many things were going right in my life ... All because I could n't get my mind off of my hearts deepest desire to become a mom . On those hard days ( and there were many ) , I had one thing that kept me anchored , and it was the Word of God . I spent time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was refreshed with encouragement and hope as I read of His faithfulness and His great love towards me . His Word gave me comfort , it gave me hope , and it assured me with His promise ! <p> One of the things that God did as I sought Him , was give me so many precious promises to stand on in the waiting . I wrote down each one of those promises , and made scripture based prayers out of them . As I would pray these scriptures out loud , I would be declaring God 's Word concerning children , knowing that His Word heals , comforts , brings life , and prospers to do what it is sent to do ( Isaiah 55:11 ) . I also put scriptures around my mirror that I would look in everyday , and instead of seeing a barren body , I would look at those scriptures , and declare them over my body , renewing my mind to what God 's Word says that I am , which is a joyful mother of children ( Psalm 113:9 ) ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through something that seems like the greatest fight of your life I can tell you from experience that God is faithful and He is always true to His word ! I would encourage you to run to God , dig into His word , and cling to His promises ! <p> I would also encourage you to be willing and obedient to follow wherever He may lead you , choosing every decision that leads to peace.Because some of the greatest blessings come from seeking Him first , and following the peace He has put in your heart ! <p> He is such a good Father , and He truly is the giver of every good and perfect gift . He has precious gifts in store for you , simply because he loves who does not change like shifting shadows. - James 1:17 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

@@100638641 @4838641/ <p> If you have n't already heard me rave about meal planning , I certainly encourage you to check out this post on how-to meal plan for the week . Making lunches ahead of time , ( aka meal prepping ) is one of the best things you can do in my opinion . It saves you time , and if you are used to eating out for lunch , it will certainly save you money ( and calories ) in the long run ! One of my favorite things to prep ahead of time for lunches is salads . They are quick , easy , and delicious ! The only problem with preparing them ahead of time is that they can get soggy if you do n't pack them up correctly .... So I decided to share some of my favorite tips on how to prep fresh , crisp , and tasty salads ahead of time for the week ! <p> - I start preparing my salads by planning what type of salads I will be making that week . I am someone who could eat the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I generally plan to have the same ingredients on my salads for that week . ( I generally make about 4 salads per week , and the rest of the week I plan to eat leftovers from some of my dinners ) . After I plan out what type of salads I will be having , ( as well as what other meals I will be making for the week ) , I make a list and go grocery shopping for my ingredients . <p> When I get home , I start preparing the meat/proteins for my salad . This is usually chicken- either grilled , baked , or cooked in the crockpot , and some times hard boiled eggs . Other sources of protein/fats that I like to add to salads are chickpeas , nuts , feta cheese , shaved parmesan , and avocado , just to name a few ! <p> While my meat is cooking , I wash my fruits and vegetables , and lay them out on a big kitchen towel , which makes it easy to wash them all at once . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( You can put them in separate containers at this point , or if you do n't want to dirty dishes , you can just keep them on separate piles on the clean kitchen towel . ) <p> Then , once my meat is cooked ( and cooled ) , and my veggies are washed , dried , and chopped , I am ready to assemble my salads ! The key here is to put the ingredients in layers ( I like medium size - mason jars , which I bought in a 12 pack at Walmart for a really good deal , or Tupperware/sealed containers of some sort . Layering will ensure that none of your ingredients get mushed which would make them bruised , soggy , and wet . <p> I recommend starting with your meat , and beans if you are using them . Next , start layering your vegetables , starting with the most firm vegetables , such as bell peppers , onions , carrots , celery , etc . Then layer the cheese on if you are using any , and end your softest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are using nuts , hard boiled eggs , or avocado , I find that these are best on the very top because they tend to get soggy . <p> Now that you have your salad ' toppings ' prepped , it 's time to prep the heart of the salad- the lettuce ! I like to divide anywhere from 3-4 cups of romaine lettuce , spinach , ( or shredded cabbage if I 'm doing Asian inspired salads ) among a few different Tupperware containers ( depending on how many salads I am making that week ) . - - I like to package the lettuce in individual medium-big size containers ( 4-6 cup size ) that will allow for some extra room at the top to pour and mix in my toppings when I am ready to eat my salad . I also pack up a few small containers ( 1/4-1/2 cup size ) with dressing. - ( Please note that you do n't have to prep your lettuce ahead of time , as you may not even have room in your fridge to do so ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning only takes a matter of seconds , and when your toppings are already pre-packed , the hard part is already done ! ) <p> Now to put it all together . When you are ready to enjoy your salad , simply open your jar/container with your salad ingredients , and your large Tupperware filled with lettuce , and pour the toppings and dressing on ! If you want , you can put the lid back on the large Tupperware , and give your salad a shake to mix everything together , and enjoy !

@@100638649 @4838649/ <p> If you struggle with emotional eating , or you find yourself running to food in times of stress , I can assure you that you are not alone . In fact , in many ways our society celebrates running to food to cope with emotions ! <p> If you feel that you are lost in a vicious cycle of emotional eating , there is hope . In fact , I can speak from personal experience when I tell you that you can be free from all bondage from any food related strongholds . Not only do I know this personally , but the bible tells us that in Jesus we can have freedom in every area of our lives , but ultimately we are the ones that decide if we are going to walk in that freedom , ( 1 Peter 2:16 ) . <p> I have found that freedom often exists in its fullness when we run to God and allow Him to help us spiritually , but we also do our part physically .

Next , I usually start praying , asking God to help me to operate in the fruits of the spirit , love , joy peace , self control . If the temptation is not going away immediately , I start to speak the Word of God out loud , which is how Jesus resisted temptation when He was tested , ( Matthew 4:1-11 ) . When we submit ourselves to God and resist the devil with the Word of God , we have a promise that he must flee from us , ( James 4:7 ) . <p> On the- physical- side of things , I suggest- finding some activities that allow you to unwind , that do n't relate to food .

@@100638666 @4838666/ <p> I was n't always someone who enjoyed working out early in the morning , but now I ca n't imagine it any other way ! Here are my top ten tips to getting in an early morning workout ! <p> 1 . Be Prepared- One of the most important steps for me to make my early morning workouts happen is to be prepared ! I like to have my clothes laid out , my workout bottle filled and ready in the fridge , and my workouts written and ready to go ! That way , I get to set my alarm with just enough time to wash my face , brush my teeth , and throw on my clothes . Being prepared means less things to think about when it 's early in the morning ! <p> 2 . Find Workout Buddies- There is something so much more motivating about working out with a buddy or a group of friends ! Not to mention , having someone at the gym to meet you makes it that much easier to jump out of bed knowing that someone is counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My favorite workout buddy is my sister , Emily . We meet each other at the gym early a few times a week , ( she is a teacher , so we have to meet at 5:30 am so she can get to school on time ) , but the great thing about our workouts are that they are done before I know it and then we have the rest of our day to enjoy ! Click Here for a Circuit Partner Workout ! <p> 3 . Go to Bed Earlier- Let 's face it ... one of the most common reasons many people do n't like to workout early is that they feel too tired . If this sounds familiar , I have great news ... This can be solved by getting to bed at a reasonable time ! I find that if I get at least 7 hours of sleep , I feel great the rest of the day , despite how early I get up ! For example , when I know I am waking up at 5 am to meet my sister , I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not too unreasonable and it is totally worth it to me knowing I will feel great the next day after I have allowed my body to get enough rest ! <p> 4 . Eat a Quick Pre-Workout Snack- I personally do n't like to have a lot of food in my stomach when I workout ( it gives me stomach cramps ) , but often , I like to eat something really light before heading out the door . If you are someone that prefers to eat before a workout , I recommend something with carbohydrates and not too high in protein , unless you are able to eat at least 30-60 minutes before your workout . This gives your body time to digest it . I suggest anything from Dashing Dish muffins , overnight oatmeal , or some dry low sugar cereal . Again , this will vary from person to person , so I recommend experimenting with a few different options to see what works best for you . Also , be sure to always have a water bottle ready to go ! Being hydrated is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink for the day . <p> 5 . Get in the Mindset- I can honestly say that I enjoy working out early in the morning , but that was n't always the case . In fact , there was a time when I would cringe at the thought of rolling out of bed and working out . However , I have found over time that there are more pros than cons when it comes to getting it done first thing . Here are a few examples of the benefits : Working out in the morning means that I do n't have to think about it the rest of the day , I feel more energized the rest of my day , and I tend to want to take care of my body the rest of the day , knowing that I put in the time and effort to workout ! <p> 6 . Find a Workout You Enjoy- This might come as a shock to some of you , but I firmly believe that you can and should enjoy your workouts . If you are currently doing something that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread , I want to encourage you to find something you enjoy . Yes it is possible ! With all the options available today , there is no reason that you ca n't find something that you love and feel that you are good at , and it does n't even have to be done at a gym ! Try going with some friends to a work out class , buy some workout DVDs , or sign up for a walk/run/biking event . Do whatever you can to get out of your comfort zone . You never know , you might try something once and look forward to working out the rest of your life ! Click Here for Some Fun &amp; Easy Workout Ideas ! <p> 7 . Workout at Home- One of the greatest reasons for not working out early is that you simply do n't have time ! For most of us , the morning can be one of the busiest times of all ... But there is an answer ! Working out at home is one of the best and easiest ways to get an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra time to drive to and from a gym . I have plenty of at home workouts that require only a few simple pieces of equipment ( such as dumbbells ) , as well as some that do n't require anything except for your own body weight ! Click Here for an At Home Total Body Circuit Workout ! <p> 8 . Plan Out Your Workouts- Having a plan , especially when it 's early in the morning is key to getting a good workout in ! I know that if I did n't plan my workouts ahead of time on my early workout days , that I would most likely have a hard time pushing myself in the gym . I do n't know about you , but the last thing that I can get my brain to do at 5:30 am is plan out a workout , nor do we have time when I am meeting my sister , who has to leave the gym at 6:30 am . The best thing we ever did was buy a simple and cheap notebook from Target and write out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are doing for the whole week in advance ! It is also more motivating to know what we are doing ahead of time and have an organized game plan . <p> 9 . Have a Workout Playlist Ready- I do n't know about you , but having an awesome workout playlist gets me in the mood to workout ! Do n't have any idea where to start with a ' clean ' and uplifting playlist ! ? No problem ! One of my current favorites is Hillsong Young &amp; Free ! Click Here for a Awesome Workout Playlist ! <p> 10 . Re-Fuel with a Healthy Post-Workout Breakfast- If you do make the time and effort to start your day off with a workout , be sure to fuel your body properly throughout the rest of the day ! As important as working out is , nutrition really is the most important component when it comes to maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle ! If you are worried that you do n't have time to workout and prep a healthy breakfast in the morning , no worries ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are super speedy to make and can even be made the night before . I personally like to re-fuel with something that is higher in protein and complex carbohydrates .

@@100638671 @4838671/ <p> Do you feel like you are working hard at the gym , eating healthy , and yet your weight loss has stalled or wo n't seem budge ? Weight loss plateaus can happen for numerous reasons , especially in women . Here are some changes that you can make that will to get you moving towards your goal in no time flat ! <p> 1 . Change Up Your Workout Routine . Once you have been doing the same thing for a period of time ( whether it be how often you workout , or the types of workouts you do ) , your body will eventually adapt to your routine . If what you were doing does n't seem to be getting you the same results then you will need to change up your workout routine . This generally requires making small tweaks in order to find out what your body will respond to . I suggest adding 10-15 minutes on to your workouts , increasing the intensity of your workouts , adding weight training to your routine , or change up the types of workouts you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that you do n't overdo it , and help you identify what works best . <p> 2 . Focus on Nutrition . We have all heard the saying , Weight Loss is broken down into a simple equation . 80% comes from our Nutrition , and the other 20% comes from Exercise . For the most part I would say that this statement is pretty accurate . The only thing that I would add is that a small percentage is also determined by genetics and hormones , especially as women . For the most part however , nutrition is the key component that determines our weight and overall health . This means that eating clean , and cutting out processed foods ( such as white flour and sugar ) is essential . Unfortunately there are no short cuts or magic pills . If you are serious about reaching your goals , eating nutritious foods on a consistent basis is key ! <p> 3 . Adjust Calories . This statement can go both ways . Most people understand that lowering your total intake of calories can help you lose weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually slow down your metabolism , hindering your progress as well ! ? ! When it comes to calories , I suggest tracking them for a short period of time , especially in the beginning of your journey , or when you hit a speed bump . ( I like MyFitness Pal for this , and to make it easier all of the Dashing Dish recipes are automatically logged in to MFP when I post them ! ) When you start to track , you may be surprised to find that you are actually taking in more ( or less ) calories than you think in a day . You can also use online calculators to determine the number of calories that your body needs , ( based on your age , sex , height , activity level , and current weight ) in order to reach your goal . I do n't recommend relying solely on these calculations however , as many of them do n't take into account your daily activity and body composition , nor do I recommend tracking calories long term . Overall , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you feel ... And remember , food is fuel not the enemy ! <p> 4 . Fill Up on Fiber and Protein . Foods that are high in fiber and protein not only provide volume making you feel satisfied , but they also take longer to digest , making you feel full longer . They also help balance out your blood glucose ( blood sugar ) levels , which can help reduce and control cravings , and prevent energy crashes . Some good sources of protein are lean meats and fish , beans and legumes , reduced fat dairy , and all natural protein powder and bars . Some good sources of fiber are vegetables , beans , whole grains ( which includes old fashioned oats and oat flour ) , sweet potatoes , and lower sugar fruits such as berries and apples . <p> 5 . Stay Hydrated . Did you know that the part of our brain that tells us that we are hungry also tells us that we are thirsty ? ! The hypothalamus is the general control center in our brain , and it sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to properly regulate our bodies . So often many of us turn to food instead of drinking water , which can lead to chronic dehydration and a consumption of calories that our bodies do n't need . When in doubt , I suggest reaching for water before food , and giving it at least 15 minutes to see if you feel satisfied . <p> 6 . Get Enough Sleep . Many people do n't realize the importance of sleep when it comes to reaching your weight loss goals . When we sleep , our bodies repair themselves after workouts , which allows us to build muscle and build up our metabolism . Skimping on sleep can also lead to a lack of energy and motivation , making it harder to stay dedicated to working out and eating healthy . <p> 7 . Do n't Overdo it . If you are the overachiever type , you may want to reconsider if you are over-doing it . Although pushing harder may seem like the best option , it can also create undue stress on the body . When we are chronically stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes it difficult to metabolize fats and carbohydrates properly . This results in a chain reaction that increases our appetite and makes weight loss stall , making it difficult to reach a healthy weight . <p> 8 . Set Realistic Goals . Far too often people set goals that ultimately set them up for failure . It 's great to have a long term goal to workout out five or six days a week , but it 's certainly not a realistic place to start . When setting goals , be sure to make your health ( rather than numbers ) a priority , and based on what is realistic for you . <p> 9 . Stay Consistent . Living a healthy lifestyle is all about balance . This means that the occasional treat or special occasion indulgence is perfectly acceptable as long as they do n't become a slippery slope for you . If you find that having a treat derails your entire day , or even week , you may want to limit them all together temporarily . The most important thing is to know and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have one of those days that you get off track , do n't get discouraged or beat yourself up ! Instead , make the choice to dust yourself off and get right back on track the next day ! It 's important to remember that even the most dedicated people have their ' off days ' , but the ones that are successful are those that stay consistent over a long period of time . <p> 10 . Enjoy the Journey . Typically the people that have the most success when it comes to reaching their health and fitness goals are the ones that learn to enjoy the journey . Why ! ? ! Because they see the changes they are making to be a lifetime commitment , rather than a short term fling . Finding recipes that are both healthy and enjoyable , and finding workouts that you look forward to ( or at least do n't despise ) are incredibly important if you are going to stick with it long term .... Which is why we do what we do here at Dashing Dish ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so remember to enjoy the ride ! <p> ( Please note that this information is intended for a healthy individual .

@@100638700 @4838700/ <p> I would be lying if I said I was n't ever tempted to compare myself with others . In fact , I truly believe that this is something we are all must deal with at one point or another . I used to think it was only natural to have thoughts such as , " I wish I had her hair , clothes , body , etc . " However , I have found through the Word of God that there are many verses that warn us not to entertain such thoughts . <p> The reason being is that God created each one of us for a unique purpose , and to fulfill something that only we could . He also created each one of us to look , act , and be unique ! Think about it , He gave each one of us a- different- type of style , hair texture , skin color , and even body type ... ( take a moment to look around at all of the hundreds of types of bodies He created , it truly is amazing ! ) When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize there is no point in comparing , because we are all so unique !

" Galatians 6:4 <p> I realized that if I was ever going to get my eyes off of other people , then I would have to keep my eyes on what God has given me , and using it to the best of my ability . Each time I find myself starting to compare myself to others , I simply make the choice to stop those thoughts in their tracks and think about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which says I was designed for a unique purpose and that no one else can fulfill my destiny but me ! I make a choice to focus on the strengths God has given me , do the best that I can with what He placed in my hands , and I thank Him for who He created me to be ! - When we do this , we give glory to God , and get the satisfaction of a job well done !

For example , some days I go grocery shopping for DD , some days I spend almost entirely on meal plans , or recipe trials ... Or even different ' projects ' I 'm working on for the future of DD ! However , in this is what a typical day is like for me ! <p> I always start my day in the Word ... There is nothing better to me ! It renews my mind , encourages me , and shows me the way to go ! I 'm telling you , the Word is alive and active ... God is SO faithful to point me to scripture that is applicable to what I need for each day ! I guess that 's why it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satisfy like nothing else ! I also love to journal what the Lord spoke to me that day , it 's great when you look back and see His promises fulfilled ! <p> I also love my " Power of a Praying Wife " book ! I got it shortly after getting married , and it has some seriously powerful prayers that have honestly been such a blessing to my marriage ! The prayers are based on the Word of God , so they are POWERFUL ! <p> I also work out most days of the week ... Either doing an exercise video , doing my own workout at the gym , or going to a group class ! ( I always make sure to take at least one to two days of rest ... which is just as important ! ) I also love to take walks , but Michigan is n't exactly the ideal ' outdoor ' workout weather these days ! : ) <p> After working out , I get ready and have breakfast , ( while watching Andrew Wommack or Joyce Meyer on TV ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) For breakfast I have to say , there is nothing better than a Dashing Dish Protein Shake in my opinion ! I do n't know if I 'll ever get tired of them ! : ) <p> ( Please note ... I DID NOT post ALL of the food I ate in one day ... Please do not use this as a guide of how much/little to eat in one day ! I just wanted to share a few pics of some of my favorite meals ! ) <p> I then get to work on my post for the day ! If I know I 'm having a super busy day , I try to do this the night before , as it takes about 30-60 minutes to edit everything , figure out the nutritional values , and plug everything in . <p> Then , once the post for the day is up , I get to work in the kitchen !

I consider it the greatest part of my ministry , and it is such a blessing to be in contact with so many amazing women each day ! I generally spend about 1-2 hours a day on emails , then I start to work on health coaching materials , writing them up for each individual . Once that is completed , I start to revise , edit and clean up the recipes I jot down while doing recipe prep . <p> Some days I also do different things such as conference calls , speaking engagements , or teach classes !

It is a bit much for just my husband and I sometimes ! : ) <p> Because my husband and I work from home , many people may imagine that we spend ' so ' much time together , but we quickly learned that just because we are home together , it does n't mean in any way that we actually spend time with each other ... So , we have learned that we need to set a ' cut off ' time where we make time for each other .

But this is what a typical day/night would look like ! Reguardless of the day though , I feel BLESSED and excited to be a part of what God is doing through DD !

@@100638767 @4838767/ <p> So often we try to fix these ' issues ' by changing what we see in the mirror , but if we stopped and realized they begin in the heart and mind , we would clearly see that they must first be addressed here as well . <p> I had I revelation that the problem with all unhealthy behaviors starts with a love of self . When we think we own our bodies , and love self , we give self what it wants and justify it . This causes us to walk around with a heavy burden , because we are trying to " own " something we were only meant to be managers over . <p> When we repent , surrender our bodies and self to the Lord , we are giving Him back what He already owns . <p> The thing about God is , He will never demand is to give Him things , but rather , He always waits for us to surrender them , because He has given us a free will . When we surrender to the Lord and make Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us peace , guidance , and joy in return for the self-produced struggle . <p> Giving God control means that we can then be stewards over our bodies , ( the word steward means to manage ) . When we manage something , we take good care of it , with the goal of pleasing the owner when they come to check in on things ! <p> When we look at it like this , it takes the pressure of owning off of us , ( which is a huge weight off our shoulders ) , and it puts the responsibility of managing in our hands ... with the guiding and leadership of the owner showing us what to do ! <p> Being a manager also means that we follow orders of the owner . Is God telling you to do something ( or not to do something ) when it comes to caring for your body ? If He is the owner , it is responsibility as manager to simply say , " Yes Sir " and be obedient to what He is asking us to do . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , which is how God intended it ... We let Him lead and own everything in our lives , and in turn He guides and directs us as we manage what He has entrusted to us . <p> Suddenly , what once seemed like a struggle , will now flow as it was designed to ... effortlessly , like a well run successful business ! <p> If you find yourself being weighed down with thoughts of your weight today , ask yourself , have I truly given God control ? The first step begins with a choice to surrender ... which is not as hard as it seems when you realize He has promised to take care of you , guide you , and provide for you ! <p> Next , pray a prayer of surrender from your heart to your Heavenly Father . <p> If you do n't know where to start , here one to get you started : <p> Father , today I make the choice to surrender my body to you . Forgive me for trying to own it , rather than being a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift that you have given me of being able to manage over this body . Help me to be a good manager of the gifts you have given me , and to care for them in a balanced and healthy way .

I lay these things down at your feet , trusting that you will lead and guide me on how to best manage and care for my body , because ultimately , it belongs to you ! 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

@@100638796 @4838796/ <p> I have- received many questions about counting calories , so I thought I would share my thoughts after using both approaches in my personal journey to health . In general , I do think that counting calories , especially at first can be beneficial for someone who is just starting to read nutrition labels and get familiar with their bodies needs . However , I always suggest that the ultimate goal to aim for is to listen to your body , rather than counting calories long term . <p> Counting calories in the beginning of a weight loss journey can be helpful because you can get a realistic sense of how to space out calories throughout- your day to best fuel your body , and you get familiar with portion sizes in general . On the other hand , when it comes to maintaining this long-term , counting calories really is n't realistic , and it can even become obsessive if taken to the extreme . <p> I personally found that counting calories for about a month in the beginning of my journey worked well for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space calories out throughout my day in a way that made me feel energized throughout the day . After becoming familiar ' with proper portion sizes , I decided to stop tracking calories and start to listen to my body 's natural hunger cues . <p> Although I do n't track calories anymore , I still pay attention to the amount of calories , fat , sugar , carbohydrates , and protein in the foods I am eating . However , this is more about being informed and aware of what I am putting in my body . For example , something may- seem- healthy , especially with all of the tricky labels out there , but if you do n't pay attention or do any planning on your part , you could easily end up taking in a lot of calories , fat , and sugar without even realizing it . <p> So , although I am aware of what I am eating , I do n't keep a running total of calories for the day on paper , or in general . Here are a few reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and eating with friends and family can get tricky . In general , if you are tracking food and you do n't know how many calories , points , etc. are in something , this can lead to anxiety Or even a bingeing ' mentality , when you throw all care out the window because you do n't know what to write down . Instead , when I am at a get-together , I try to pick the healthiest choices that I see and make it my goal to focus more on enjoying the people I 'm with rather than on the food . - If I do pick a dessert or something that I know is n't so healthy , then I stick to one portion , and really spend time enjoying each bite , or I share it . <p> 2 . If you count calories , you can actually over eat . If you count calories , then chances are you will feel like you need to finish every single bite , even if you are truly full , in an effort to track the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it , because God really did put a signal inside each one of us to tell us we are satisfied for a reason ! When I was first learning to pay attention to my body , I would take a few bites , put my fork down , and really pay attention to how I felt . Then , when I felt like my stomach was- satisfied , I stopped , and saved the rest for later . Sure , it was tough to do this at first , and it does take practice ( and prayer ) in the beginning , but eventually you will be so in tune with your body , you wo n't even have to think twice about it ! <p> 3 . It can lead to bingeing . For me personally , counting calories led to binges when I let myself have a day off of counting . This was most likely because I felt like I had to use the ' freedom from tracking ' to it 's fullest - by eating whatever came- across- my path . Again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there will always be another chance to eat any certain type of food again . However , on the days that I was n't counting calories , I felt as though I had to eat everything like it was my last chance to eat , knowing that the very next day I was going to be back to tracking . <p> Those are just a few of the reasons I do n't advocate counting calories long term . On that note , I will say that everyone is different , and everyone has different things that work for them . So , all that being said , if tracking is what works for you ! In general , I would say that it is better to have some kind of plan than no plan at all ! <p> A realistic way of incorporating all that I have just discussed would be to start counting calories for about a month or so , just so that you can get an idea of how much to eat , and - become familiar with composing meals that are a good balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple ways you can do this , but you may want to start by using My Fitness Pal , ( which is a free website/i Phone app that has all Dashing Dish recipes already plugged in ) , or Weight Watchers , ( which my recipes also include ) . <p> With that foundation established , you should be able to move onto truly listening to your body , and eating until you are satisfied . Like I said , this may seem strange ' at first , but that is how God created our bodies to function ! He gave us the ability to know when we are hungry , and full , so we would eat only what our bodies truly need ! - Also , with this approach , I find that it is easier to put the focus on eating healthy and nutritious foods rather than all the numbers . <p> When combined with the main principals of healthy eating , ( limiting amount of processed foods and sugar , trying to get a good balance of protein , fiber , and healthy fats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals ) , you should be able to maintain a healthy weight in a way that is sustainable for life !

Before I even became pregnant , God gave me the promise in Psalm 17:14 , which says , " And whose belly You fill with Your treasure ; They are satisfied with children , And leave their abundance to their babes .

It was a beautiful sunny day ... A perfect day for a baby shower brunch ! <p> My sisters , mom , and mother-in-law arrived early to set up for the big day . My sister Sarah is a party planning extraordinaire , ( people always say she should be a party planner if she were to change professions ) . ; ) She thought of every detail possible , making the day so incredibly special ! From pearls on the table , to a pearl themed children 's book for the guests to sign , she put special thought and care into everything ! <p> Sean and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take everything in .

But God . His love and faithfulness are beyond comprehension , and to Him , I am more thankful than words could ever say ! <p> Thank you friends for sharing in the memory of this special day with us ! I pray it filled you with just as much joy and anticipation for this sweet little girl as it did for us ! : ) xo Katie

Because sisters , I have great news for you ... You were Born to Thrive ! <p> This past week , my husband and I heard about a one year old baby that was brought to a Christian therapist for help . At one year of age , this little boy had not gained a single pound , his frail body was within ounces of what it weighed at birth . This little creation was failing to thrive . <p> With more information about the baby 's life , the therapist learned that he was being raised in a home where there were more issues than I have room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even after rescue and proper care , the baby still would n't gain weight . <p> The therapist , led by the spirit , saw that even at in the earliest of days in this little life , he experience and believed - that he was not worthy to thrive . The therapist broke that agreement in the spirit through prayer , and within days the baby started to show signs of improved health . Within a week , he gained five pounds , and his health started to improve . <p> I tell this story because I think it 's a powerful illustration of how so many of us live out our lives . At some point we accepted a lie and live under the crushing belief that we really are not worthy to thrive . We make choices that line up with that belief . We get hit with messages from the world that cement the conviction even further . We speak words of condemnation and criticism over ourselves in agreement . We fail to thrive - both spiritually and physically . <p> The amazing truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be free from the thoughts that have limited us for far too long ! We can break those agreements and declare no more ! ! ! When we refuse to link arms with lies and replace them with the truth of God 's word , we begin to live out those new , TRUE agreements .... And it wo n't take long until they begin to bear fruit in our lives . <p> Here 's the truth about YOU - you were not created to merely survive in this life ... No ! You were made for a purpose , and you were made to thrive , yes THRIVE ! You were created to bring glory to God with your everyday life ! You have unspeakable value . You are beautiful ! You are approved of , accepted and loved . And , the best news of all ?

Pray against any lie , ( or even have a pastor , mentor , or close friend you trust pray with you ) , and renounce any lie you have believed .

Remember , you were not created to merely survive ... you were born to thrive ! <p> Let 's take action right now through prayer ! <p> Father God , we praise you for Who You are ! You are mighty God.You are faithful God . You are the Lord who calls us by name ! You promise to hold our hand . You 've redeemed us !

We have been given everything we need to live a life that thrives and brings you glory . Through our lives your glory is revealed . When we cling to the truth of who YOU say we are , we begin to thrive from the deepest parts of our spirit outward . Our lives reflect your glory and we experience everlasting joy and we know , despite any message that the Enemy or the world uses to tell us differently , that we are a people that you have blessed and called your own .

@@100638828 @4838828/ <p> Merry Christmas Everyone ! ! ! I just love this time of year , as we take time to celebrate the goodness of our Savior Jesus ! I am so thankful for so many things ... Words truly can not express just how grateful I am ! I am grateful to the King of the world , who came as a man to save us , so we could not only have eternal life ... but so that we could have a personal relationship with Him ! I am thankful to my wonderful husband , who is my best friend , and biggest supporter , and- I am thankful for my family , who are the greatest gift to me on this earth .... <p> But most of all , I want to express my deep gratitude for each and every one of- YOU ... When I quit my full time nursing job as a step of faith a few years ago , I honestly had no clue what the future would bring . All I knew is that the Lord was pressing it upon my heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to in the area of weight , healthy eating , and freedom from eating disorders ... And I can honestly say that nothing in this world brings me more joy than to watch people find freedom in Him ! I want to thank each one of you that has supported , and blessed me with words of encouragement ! I have learned so much already on this journey , and I have come to find that the body of Christ is truly just that ... A body , with many parts . As each one of us takes our place in the body , doing what the Lord has called us to do , we can help each other become all that Christ has designed us to be ! <p> My greatest prayer is that Dashing Dish has blessed you and your family in finding health , balance , and a deeper walk with our Savior ! This Christmas , I pray that- you and your family are richly blessed , and that you time time to enjoy one another , and of course reflect on what Christmas is all about " Jesus ! 
@@100638829 @4838829/ <p> " Huh ! That was interesting ! " It 's a phrase I 've taught myself to say in response to those instant , unexpected , condemning thoughts that literally come out of nowhere . They are LIGHTENING fast are n't they ! ? This morning I walked into my strength class at the gym feeling great . I was in a really good mind , body and soul space . As I walked in though , I very consciously noticed that one of my sweet gym friends said hi to me and then obviously looked at my legs . I mean she really , noticeably GLANCED for a delayed moment . Immediately , a complicated conversation began in my mind ! Assessment was made . Judgment was decided . I concluded immediately that she saw my legs , thought that they were horrible and it took everything within her to hold back from telling me I really should n't wear shorts . It 's crazy right ? Let me explain ! <p> As I write this the depth of craziness is obvious to me , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ( like 20 ! ! ) , after a hurtful comment , I made a false agreement with myself that my legs were " gross " and that I should n't wear shorts until they looked perfect . Perfect ! ? What ! ? Of course now , on this side of healing I see the outrageous absurdity of it , but the Enemy is wiley and his lies are sneaky . As I paused today and reflected on my " huh , that was interesting " moment , I realized that old , broken agreement was simply trying to find its way back into my life . It was a quick blow from the enemy to test my resolve , would he be able to get back in with that old familiar whisper ? Thankfully no . I immediately recognized him and shut down that lie . <p> My point in sharing this ? Even after we do the work to break through lies , strongholds , and disorders , we must still stay on alert and ready to actively resist the devil and his tactics . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly joyful that He who is in us is SO mighty , and that in Him we are free and victorious ! <p> Another important point on this subject ! ? ! A fleeting thought does not trump your victory ! Victory over food disorders , diets , weight struggles , distorted body image , and disordered thinking does n't mean everyday is a grand slam . Some days do n't feel like a win and that 's ok ! Some days are more of a draw . Struggling is not the same as defeat ! ! I want to say that again - struggling is NOT the same as defeat ! Struggling is part of the human condition , but it does n't " undo " your victory ! As long as you feel the conflict between flesh and spirit , you 're still in the race ! It 's when the conflict ceases we need to worry ! The battle simply means the Lord is at work in you ! Take heart ! In Christ you are victorious indeed ! <p> When lies , whether new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the light and truth of God 's word to protect and guide us . <p> We also have the ability to replace those thoughts just as quickly as they come ... and it begins with being thankful , and here 's how ... <p> Instead of focusing on what my body is not , let me tell you what it is .... <p> This body is almost 41 years old . This body endured years and years of unthinkable self-abuse but prevailed . This body gave birth to two of God 's most incredible creations ! This body is strong and gentle . This body can do an impressive amount of push-ups one moment and the next , with the same strong arms , comfort and cuddle little bodies . This body is able . This body is powerful . This body is flawed on this side of heaven but in the eyes of its creator seen as flawless ! This body is far from perfect , but it is the chosen dwelling place for the One who is ! This body is mine . I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Maker ! Everything I am means NOTHING if He is not my one thing ! <p> If you have been tempted to believe a lie that would cause you to question your value and worth when it comes to your body , let me challenge you to shift your focus . Instead of thinking about what your body is not , let me ask you , what IS your body , and what about your body can you be thankful for ? <h> Written by Sarah Shaffer <p> Sarah Shaffer is the part of ministry here at Dashing Dish .

It has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl to go to Hawaii on my honey moon , but when Sean and I got married , we simply did n't have the means to travel to Hawaii . However , I did n't let that discourage me ... Instead Sean and I let it motivate us to save for a trip to Hawaii ! It took about 5 years of setting a little money away at a time , but thanks to budgeting and the help of Dave Ramsey 's Financial Peace University , we were able to celebrate our 6 year wedding anniversary in Kauai and Maui ! <p> I mention Dave Ramsey 's Financial Peace University , because much like caring for our physical bodies , my husband and I are strong believers in being good stewards of our finances , and this program taught us the foundation to budgeting God 's way ! It has helped us plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , such as the house we recently built ! Since sharing about FPU , I have had quite a few emails and questions about how to get started and practically follow a budgeting plan ... So , my husband has agreed to write a guest post soon and share it on Dashing Dish about budgeting and Dave Ramsey 's Financial Peace University plan ! Budgeting may sound limiting at first , but just like eating healthy , once you make it a lifestyle , you see it is really the pathway to freedom and true peace ! <p> Now , on to our trip to Hawaii ! Sean and I boarded the plan for a very long flight with three layovers to our first destination , the island of Kauai ! We were more than excited because although we have been on trips with family , this was the first trip we have taken just the two of us since our 1 year anniversary ! We got off the plane and were welcomed by 80 degree weather , blue skies , and sunshine , so naturally our first stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a restaurant located within our hotel called Tidepools . It was a neat restaurant that was open to the water so we could see the sun setting ! I enjoyed macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi , and Sean got steak . I am generally not a seafood fan , but I wanted to enjoy at least one serving of fish while I was on the islands after hearing how good it was . I sure was glad I did , the fish was very light tasting and it was incredibly delicious ! <p> The next morning we ate a an open door breakfast place on our hotel grounds , which was both beautiful and peaceful ! It was the perfect way to start the day ! <p> Our breakfast got us fueled to go on a hike to the beautiful Grand Waimea Canyon ! It took us about 1 hour to drive to the top , including the frequent stops we made to take pictures of the breathtaking views ! <p> At one of the stops we decided to get out and go for a hike . We followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden waterfall ! It took us about an hour each way to get to the falls , but it was certainly a fun adventure and we enjoyed the journey ! <p> One of the best things about Hawaii was that you could be active and get in a good workout without going to the gym ! Aside from going on this hike , we spent most of our mornings going on a walk or run along the coast ! That sure beats a gym any day if you ask me ! <p> At one point my husband and I stopped to look out at the top of the canyon . I could n't help but well up with tears at the incredible majesty of our Great God ! ! ! It truly is humbling to think of how small we are compared to how great He is , and yet He knows us , He cares for us , and He knows how many hairs are on each one of our heads ! <p> After our hike we went back to our hotel and got cleaned up to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukes ! <p> Dukes is highly recommended for one very good reason- their giant Hula Ice Cream Pie dessert ! After we ate our dinner we ordered the only dessert on the menu ( yes it 's so good they only offer one dessert ! option ) ... And we enjoyed every bite ! <p> Our last day in Kauai was spent taking a boat tour of the Na Pali Coast , which was my favorite parts of the entire trip ! <p> Along the tour we had the opportunity to see spinner dolphins ! The captain told us that there is only about a 20% chance of seeing them in the wild , making it that much more special ! <p> The views of the shore were breathtaking , and will forever be engrained in my memory ! <p> That evening we went to a Mexican restaurant called Tortilla Republic . We actually found it on our own , and it ended up being our favorite food during our entire trip ! I got the chicken fajitas , and Sean got the steak . <p> Afterward we went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking at all of the amazing flavor combinations they offered I could see why it was so raved about ! I got the peanut butter cup ice cream which was incredible ! <p> After staying in Kauai for four days we got on a small plane and traveled to Maui . My parents ( who have been to Hawaii a few times ) recommended island hopping because each island is so uniquely different . After experiencing both islands , we were glad we took their advice ! Kauai is a smaller island , so it has a ' small island ' feel . It is slower paced , and filled with natural beauty rather than buildings and highways . Maui had just as much beauty , but it was more built up than Kauai making it a bit faster paced , with the benefit of more things to do . <p> One of our first meals in Maui was at a highly recommended Mexican restaurant called Frida 's . I got the chicken tacos , and Sean got steak tacos . The neat thing about the restaurant was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat dinner while watching the sun set ! So beautiful . <p> The next morning we woke up early to drive to a bakery that is famous in Maui called Komoda 's . It was an hour drive , so let 's just say Sean was pretty ambitious and wanted to try a few bites of four different donuts , just to make the drive worth it ! ; ) They were very reasonably priced , and very fresh , although not exactly healthy ... But when you are in Maui and there is a world famous bakery , you try the donuts ! ; ) Although I have to admit , I brought a Quest bar with me , and had that , a bite of a donut , and some coffee , otherwise I think i 'd be passed out on the ground by noon ! <p> After visiting the bakery we went to the Twin Falls , which is a waterfall on the Road to Hana . We did n't end up driving up the whole Road to Hana because the roads were under construction making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls were definitely worth driving to see ! <p> I do n't know what it is , but ever since I was little I have loved palm trees , ( probably because it means we are somewhere warm , which is welcomed when you live in Michigan your whole life ! ) So , it 's always a goal of mine whenever we go somewhere with palm trees to take a picture with a ' shortie ' palm tree , and I name it the " Katie Tree " ; ) <p> The twin falls had a beautiful bamboo garden that was pretty neat to walk through as well ! <p> That evening we went to a famous steakhouse called Roys to celebrate our anniversary . The staff brought us their divine chocolate lava cake as a anniversary surprise , which ended up being one of my favorite desserts from the trip ! <p> The next day we went to lunch at a place called Flatbreads Organic Pizza Co . It was by far one of my favorite meals of the trip ! The ingredients were all local , organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin crust pizza and a tropical style chicken salad . <p> We then drove up to the coast and watched the surfers and just gazed at God 's beauty ! I 'll never forget that beautiful water and those bright blue skies ! <p> We spent our last day on a beach near our resort called Kapalua Bay . It is known for its giant sea turtles and beautiful coral reef . <p> Anytime we go somewhere with sand , Sean and I make sure to build a sand creature of some sort , but here we decided to make a snow man , since the holidays were shortly approaching ! <p> We spent the rest of the day enjoying and taking in the natural beauty of Hawaii ... Trying our best to capture and remember all of the beautiful details that God created ! <p> This trip to Hawaii was without a doubt worth every moment of saving for the past five years ! It just goes to show that when you do n't buy everything you desire for the temporary moment , but save for something big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave Ramsey for teaching us this powerful life principal ! <p> And thank you Father for the glorious beauty that you created for each one of us to see , whether it be in Hawaii , or in our own backyard ! <p> If you are thinking of visiting Hawaii one day , I would tell you that it is certainly something to behold ! If I were to describe Hawaii , I would say that it beautifully depicts Psalm 95:4-5 , which says , " In his hand are the depths of the earth , and the mountain peaks belong to him . The sea is his , for he made it , and his hands formed the dry land . "

Here are my top 10 tips to start living , enjoying , and putting a healthy lifestyle into practice ! <p> 1 . Partner with God : I firmly believe that success in any area of our lives begins when we make the choice to partner with God . I also believe that God is pleased when we look to Him for strength , guidance , and help . We can partner with God by inviting Him into our situation or journey , which can be done through prayer , spending time with Him , and continually seeking His wisdom every step of the way ! <p> 2 . Prioritize : I think that it 's pretty safe to say that as women we tend to neglect ourselves in an effort to care for those around us ! Somehow we tend to think that putting a priority on our health is selfish ... although this could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to think about how the stewardess in an airplane explains what to do in an emergency ... Before takeoff the stewardess explains that if you are a mother of small children , you need to put your oxygen mask on yourself before putting it on those around you , because if you are not healthy , you wo n't be there to care for those who need you ! I think that it is time that we realize that in order to be the best wife , mom , caretaker , businesswoman , etc. we need to be prioritize our health so we can be healthy enough to care for others ! It 's time that you give yourself the permission to care for yourself , because you are valuable and you are worth taking care of ! <p> 3 . Pray : Many of us grew up eating our meals around the dinner table , but our society sure has changed in regards to sitting down to eat a meal ! These days people are eating on the go , standing up , or even in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we forget to take the time to relax , enjoy our food , and pray over our food . If this sounds familiar , I would encourage you to take the time to sit down and invite God to the table with you every time you eat . Take a moment to pray over your food , and ask God to help you to choose and desire healthy foods ; and ask Him to help you to listen to the hunger cues He placed within you . When you take just a few moments to invite God in on the ' small ' things , ( such as praying over your meals ) , you will find that He will be there in those moments to lead and guide you to make the best choices for your body and health ! <p> 4 . Pitch the Junk : The first thing that I recommend to someone trying to get healthy is to clean out the fridge and pantry , and pitch the junk food ! It may seem hard at first to get rid of your favorite treats , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any favors by keeping your greatest temptations within arms reach ! Now it may seem difficult at first to go without the things that you are used to eating , and that is because man-made processed foods and foods loaded with salt and sugar can be down right addicting ! Not only is junk food addicting , but it is void of nutrition , which means that it provides no lasting nourishment or satisfaction ... which keeps you coming back for more ! Now , that being said , I do n't suggest that you banish your favorite foods all together ! I believe that all things can be enjoyed in balance and moderation , but I do n't suggest keeping them in your home ! Instead , go out to eat on occasion and enjoy those things in moderation . In addition , I suggest finding healthy alternatives and swaps to the things you do enjoy ! Dashing Dish can help you there , as it currently has over 800+ recipes that are specifically designed to help you find healthy alternatives to the food you crave ! Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing junk food in your home : <p> 5 . Plan : One of the most common obstacles that prevents people from living a healthy lifestyle is a lack of time ... and I have said it once , and I will say it again : When it comes to living a healthy lifestyle when you are busy , planning ahead is key ! Planning ahead prevents you from making bad choices when you are hungry , stressed , or are strapped for time . One of my favorite ways to plan ahead is to Meal Plan . Meal planning can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it . For example , you could start small by planning out just your dinners for the week , or you could plan on a broader scale and cook one or two days a week , preparing meals for your entire week ! I personally fall somewhere in between , where take a few hours on a Monday to prepare my meats , wash and cut my vegetables , and boil some quinoa or whole grain pasta to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planning is to get organized and have a plan , because in the midst of a busy week let 's face it ... who has time to think about grocery shopping and planning out meals ! ? ! I like to use my Dashing Dish Custom Meal Plan Builder to plan what I will be having for the next week . As I plug in my recipes into the meal plan calendar , the ingredients go straight to the Dashing Dish Grocery List Builder , which then syncs to the Dashing Dish iPhone App ! I love having my calendar and grocery list with me on my phone and print it off to hang on my fridge at home ! This keeps me organized and on track , and it saves me time , stress , and money in the long run ! <p> 6 . Pause : So often as women we run to food to comfort us when we are emotional , bored , tired , stressed ... you name it ! One of the best ways that I have learned to overcome emotional eating is to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . If I know that I am going to eat and I am not truly hungry , ( ie : it is not time for a meal or snack , or I just finished eating ) , I like to take a moment and ask myself : Am I eating for comfort ? Am I turning to food in order to avoid my emotions , bring me temporary satisfaction , or to procrastinate something ? Or am I really hungry ? Taking that moment to pause and ask yourself these honest questions will give you the time to do a course correction . When you pause and you realize that you are turning to food out of emotion , it will allow you to physically stop , turn around , and head out of the kitchen . I personally have found that leaving the kitchen and walking away is half of the battle ! This will allow you to get away and find somewhere to spend some alone time with God , even if it means getting in your car , taking a walk , or going into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God instead of food , He will meet our needs and satisfy our souls in a way that only He could , and we wo n't have the regrets that come with emotional eating that often pile on top of whatever we were trying to bury in the first place ! <p> 7 . Power Hour : One of my favorite ways to start my day is to take one hour and dedicate it to spending time with the Lord , which is then followed by a work out ! When I start my day with the Lord , everything I do is more productive , I have the joy of the Lord as my strength , and I have the peace of God guarding my heart and mind throughout my day ! When I also take some time first thing to workout , I find that my energy levels are geared up for the day , I am able to clear my mind , and I make healthier choices overall for that day ! If you are thinking that you do n't have time to take 1-2 hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to try going to bed earlier and setting your alarm for an hour earlier . Another thing you could do is start each day with one hour dedicated to prayer , time in God 's word , and perhaps a quick 15-20 minute workout ! This will prevent you from making excuses and risk not fitting in the most important things when you get tired or busy later in the day ! So , if you are having a hard time fitting in time with the Lord and/or exercise , try starting each day with one hour dedicated to prayer , reading , and fitness ... There are so many benefits , you will be glad you did ! <p> 8 . Perspective : One of the most common temptations when it comes to living a healthy lifestyle , ( or ... if we are honest ... in just about in any area ) is COMPARISON ! There is something so sneaky and subtle about comparing ourselves with others , because so often we can mistake it for ' being inspired or motivated ' by someone else . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a step further and try to look like , be like , and act just like someone else ... which can leave us feeling defeated and unable to measure up ! The reason for this is the fact that everyone is unique , and everyone 's lifestyle , genetics , background , and bodies are different ! The best thing that I have ever learned when it comes to living a healthy lifestyle is to keep it all in perspective . Being healthy is not about the number on the scale , the clothes we fit into , or being perfect ... it is about finding and doing what works best for you in order to nourish your body and care for it 's specific needs ! When you are on the journey to health , I would encourage you to do the same . Keep it all in perspective , do n't compare yourself with anyone else , and remember ... Healthy looks different on everyone ! <p> 9 . Patience : In our society today , we tend to look for quick fix solutions to everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results overnight ! When it comes to learning healthy habits , we have to realize that it often takes years to develop unhealthy habits ... so it will take time to make new ones ! Another key to patience is to realize that you do n't ( and should n't ) need to change everything all at once ! This can be overwhelming , and it often leads to feelings of failure and defeat . Instead , I would encourage you to start by making a few obtainable short term goals . Start to see every choice ( big or small ) as a step towards your main goal , and realize that they all add up over time ! God also reminds us to be patient in His Word ! Galatians 6:9 says , " Do n't grow weary in well doing , for if you faint not you will reap a reward ! " I like to think of every choice as an act of obedience unto God , and that He is cheering us on every step of the way ! <p> 10 . Purpose : Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy lifestyle , we all have times in our journey when things get tough . It may be a life change , a stressful season , or a lack of motivation . In times like these , it is important to know our " WHY " ... Our why is the reason that we are choosing to live a healthy lifestyle , and it is the reason we started . Everyones why may look different , but it is so important to find yours ... Perhaps your why is to live a long and healthy life . Maybe your why is to get in shape so you can keep up with your children and family . Or maybe your why is to become the best version of you ! Whatever it may be , finding your why will give you a sense of purpose and commitment to keep you going ! 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734 
@@100638853 @4838853/ <p> I met up with an amazing young woman the other day who is beginning her weight loss journey . As we were talking and sharing stories , I told her about some of the key things that ' finally ' brought me to a place of health and balance. - One of those things was renewing my mind with The Word of God . <p> I 'll never forget , one night as I was laying in bed , I heard the scripture Proverbs 4:20-22 so clearly in my heart . I was so excited to read what it said , that I literally jumped out of bed ! When I opened up my bible I read these words that would forever impact my life : <p> 20 My son , pay attention to what I say ; turn your ear to my words.21 Do not let them out of your sight , keep them within your heart ; 22 for they are life to those who find them and health to one 's whole body . <p> God revealed to me that in order for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the Word of God , and what He said about me before my eyes . I started looking up scriptures , and asked God to give me hope for things that I was believing for . I began to write them down in a journal , but realized that shortly after writing them down , I often would n't look at them again . <p> That was when I decided to write the scriptures on notecards and tape them up everywhere that I would see them ! I posted the notecards around my room , ( on my mirror , by my nightstand ) , in my car , in my school folders , wherever I could ' keep them in front of my eyes ' . This also played a crucial role in me renewing my mind , because I was able to combat the lies of this world with the Truth of God 's Word , which is obviously a task , especially at first . <p> It eventually became much easier to keep the truth of what I was believing for in the forefront of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . I soon began to believe what He said about me more than what I was experiencing at the moment . I started to see myself as healthy , balanced , and whole in my heart , and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would reach that place , because I knew God promised it to me , and I know that He never breaks His promises ! <p> I still write bible verses on notecards to this very day on whatever I 'm believing God for ! It 's so awesome to get into my car for example , and I see a verse that brings me right back to trusting my Father after a crazy busy day ! <p> I encourage you to ask God to give you scripture for whatever you are having a hard time believing for . Maybe you 've tried and failed many times in the area of ' getting healthy ' .... Well guess what , I 've got good news ! The Lord wants you to live a long healthy life on this earth , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I know you may ask ! ? ! Because He has shown me so many precious promises that says He does ! - Seek God about what you are believing for , and write the scriptures down on note cards or a sticky note ! Post them all around your house ... Keep His Word before your eyes ... And speak it out until it gets rooted deep in your heart and you believe it ! I am living proof that Proverbs 4:20-22 works , and I can promise that it will produce life and health for your body too !

@@100638865 @4838865/ <p> I start preparing my salads by planning what type of salads I will be making that week . I am someone who could eat the same thing for a few days without getting tired of it , so I generally plan to have the same ingredients on my salads for that week . ( I generally make about 4 salads per week , and the rest of the week I plan to eat leftovers from some of my dinners ) . After I plan out what type of salads I will be having , I make a list ( which can be done with the Dashing Dish grocery list builder ) , and head to the grocery store . <p> The first thing I do when I get home is start preparing the meat/proteins for my salad . This is usually chicken- either grilled , baked , or cooked in the crockpot , and some times hard boiled eggs . Other sources of protein/fats that I like to add to salads are chickpeas , nuts , feta cheese , shaved parmesan , and avocado , just to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wash my fruits and vegetables , and lay them out on a big kitchen towel , which makes it easy to wash them all at once . I then dry them individually , and slice them up . ( You can put them in separate containers at this point , or if you do n't want to dirty dishes , you can just keep them on separate piles on the clean kitchen towel . ) If you are eating the salads from home , you can put each ingredient in a covered container in the fridge , and assemble the salads when you are ready to eat ! <p> If you are making salads to pack and take with you on the go : <p> Once the meat is cooked ( and cooled ) , and the veggies are washed , dried , and chopped , I am ready to assemble my salads ! The key here is to put the ingredients in layers ( I like medium-large size mason jars , which I bought in a 12 pack at Walmart for a really good deal ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of your ingredients get mushed which would make them bruised , soggy , and wet . <p> I recommend starting with your meat , and beans if you are using them . Next , start layering your vegetables , starting with the most firm vegetables , such as bell peppers , onions , carrots , celery , etc . Then layer the cheese on if you are using any , and end your softest vegetables and fruit at the top . Also , if you are using nuts , hard boiled eggs , or avocado , I find that these are best on the very top because they tend to get soggy . <p> Now that you have your salad toppings prepped , it 's time to prep the lettuce ! I like to divide anywhere from 3-4 cups of romaine lettuce , spinach , ( or shredded cabbage if I 'm doing Asian inspired salads ) among a few different Tupperware containers ( depending on how many salads I am making that week ) . I like to package the lettuce in individual medium-big size containers ( 4-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top to pour and mix in my toppings when I am ready to eat my salad . I also like to put a paper towel in the container with the lettuce , which absorbs extra moisture , and keeps the lettuce from getting soggy . <p> For the dressing , I like to pack up a few small containers ( 1/4-1/2 cup size ) of a clean homemade dressing , or garlic expressions ( one of my favorite store bought dressings ) , and/or hummus to pour over the salad just before eating . <p> Now to put it all together . When you are ready to enjoy your salad , simply open your jar/container with your salad ingredients , and your large Tupperware filled with lettuce , and pour the toppings and dressing on ! If you want , you can put the lid back on the large Tupperware , and give your salad a shake to mix everything together , and enjoy !

@@100638881 @4838881/ <p> When it comes to breaking free from bondage , I have found that many people often dread the work that comes with being free ... And to be honest , I completely understand ! - I do n't know about you , but just hearing the phrase , " breaking free from bondage " seems strenuous and- down-right- uncomfortable ! This is especially true for many people when it comes to losing weight , or reaching a health or fitness goal . <p> After years of working with people , and experiencing change - in many areas of my own life , I have come to find that the reason change often seems so difficult is that we are trying to make it happen backwards ! The bible says in Proverbs 23:7 , - " as a man thinks in his heart , so is he . " - This means that if you are ever going to experience freedom in any area , you are going to have to start to see yourself as free on the inside before you see it on the outside . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts and takes place right in between your ears , or in our minds . We must realize that we have an enemy , the devil , and he can only attack us in one area , in our minds , and he does so with lies and deception . One of the most common lies that the enemy tries to get us trapped in is to make us think that we are , ( and will always be ) slaves and in bondage to things . He comes at us with this lie because he knows that as long as he can get you to believe that you are a slave to a certain habit , behavior , or thing , you will never be able to break free , which is right where he wants you to stay . <p> The good news is however is that- Christ came to set us free from ALL bondage ! In fact , if you are born again , the Bible says you are ALREADY free. - " Whom the son has set free , is free indeed " ( John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus to be your Savior , that you are free from the power that sin once had over you . <p> I - like to think of it it like a person who is in a jail cell with the door locked , and when Jesus comes along , He comes and unlocks the door , and says , " come on out , your free ! " But just as we are about to step out , the devil says " wait , who told you that you could leave ? You are not really free , and you never will be . You will be in bondage to this thing , habit , or lifestyle forever ! " And so , the born again believer stays in the jail cell , with the door wide open , when all they needed to do was take a step out into freedom ! <p> Taking this step into freedom does require action on our part , and it takes effort to Renew our Minds with God 's Word , and learn our identity in- Christ . - The first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repenting of our behaviors that are not glorifying to Him , and ask for His help to change . He will always be there to respond to our cry , and He is a good Father that loves and desires to take our hand and lead us into freedom . <p> The next step is getting into the Word of God , and asking God to renew our minds , and help us to see ourselves as the overcomer that He has created us to be . It also means praying specifically about the things that we desire change in on a daily ( sometimes multiple times a day ) basis ! <p> This process of walking into total freedom can often happen in steps and stages , like peeling back layers on an onion . The reason for this is simply because many of us have lived in bondage to things for many years and it often takes time for our minds to be renewed , and our hearts to respond to the Lord and change . The important thing to remember however , is that God has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom in every area of your life , and the very first step is to see yourself as you truly are in Christ ... totally and completely set free !

Now I 'm not necessarily saying having a ' six pack ' as a woman is ' right ' OR ' wrong ' and i 'm sure there are cases when women are perfectly healthy ( body fat wise ) and have RIPPED abs ...

Fell Apr 23rd 2010 <p> Earlier this week I wrote about the male six-pack and how difficult ( and possibly unrealistic ) it is to achieve for most men . Well , for women it 's even harder , and not as coveted , and not even all that healthy . And to make the whole thing even less attractive , ladies , if you want six-pack abs , then you can probably say goodbye to your breasts . Please do n't do that . Seriously , on behalf of literally hundreds of millions of men , do n't . <p> The fact is that women are designed to carry more body fat than men . It 's actually healthier for women to have higher levels of body fat . A 2000 article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition determined that a healthy body fat range for men under 40 years old was between eight and 19 percent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a higher range : from 21 to 33 percent . <p> To achieve abdominal definition , you are looking at getting down towards single digits of body fat percentage , which is considered to be way below the healthy fat range for a woman . <p> What 's more , it 's probably going to be even harder for you to do this than it will be for a man . Men have an increased ability to build muscle tissue , which allows more of their calories to be partitioned towards building lean body mass . Even more important is that women are specifically designed to retain more body fat , so your own body is going to fight you harder at losing it . Your body wants to keep fat reserves even more than a man 's body does . Evolution programmed you to be this way . <p> There is also the fact that abdominal definition on a woman can look kind of creepy . <p> I 'm just one guy , and I do n't know if you care about my opinion , but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get too lean . I like curves . I like some softness over the muscle . And as I mentioned , achieving abdominal definition makes breasts go away . <p> This is why so many female fitness models with rippling abs get breast implants . You ca n't make your body lose fat only on your midsection , so you 'll end up sacrificing breast tissue as well . <p> My point is that you should n't let the media dictate to you what is attractive or healthy . Just because some magazine has a ripped and implanted young model on the cover does n't mean it 's a realistic or even healthy ideal for you to pursue . <p> When it comes to fat loss , you can definitely get too much of a good thing . <p> James S.

We spent years crafting the most useful resources that would help the process of planning and preparing healthy meals go from being the hardest part of living a healthy lifestyle , to the easiest part of all ! <p> When you say Dashing Dish is a clean eating website , what do you mean ? <p> Clean eating refers to a way of eating ( or a lifestyle ) that revolves around eating food in it 's most natural state . <p> What kind of recipes can you expect to find on Dashing Dish ? <p> -Clean Eating ; Which means they are made with 100% whole ingredients and do not contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -All of the recipes abundant in protein , fiber , and wholesome ingredients . They are also low in high glycemic ( simple ) carbohydrates . <p> -All recipes provide the weight watchers points ( Points Plus and Smart Points ) , as well as the nutrition information for every recipe . <p> Is Dashing Dish a diet ? <p> Here at Dashing Dish we are on a mission to get people off the dieting crazy cycle ! I am a firm believer that living a healthy lifestyle can and should allow you to enjoy the foods you enjoy on a daily basis and never feel deprived . There are far too many myths out there about how to drop 10 pounds in a week , and what foods are good ' and bad ' for you . I have seen , and been a victim of the vicious cycle of defeat and failure that diets produce in countless women , some of whom are very close to me ... and there is nothing more that I desire to see women break free from diets once and for all ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop for the ingredients ? <p> Unlike many healthy recipes , you can make all of the recipes on Dashing Dish using ingredients found at a general grocery store . I completely understand that not everyone loves to cook , or has the time for that matter . Which is why I design my recipes to be incredibly simple , and only require a few basic ingredients ( from a general grocery store ) to prepare . Even I do n't have the time to go to multiple grocery stores ... and I actually love grocery shopping ! <p> Are your recipes family friendly ? <p> All of the recipes on Dashing Dish are absolutely family friendly , and picky eater approved ! How do I know ! ? ! Well , I have a very picky eater testing each and every one of the recipes before they make it to the website ! <p> When I married my husband , he was basically an adult with a 2 year old pallet ! His diet consisted of hot dogs , chicken nuggets , mac and cheese , and donuts ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fast ! I started creating healthy versions of his favorite foods , and testing my recipes on him . I know that if my recipes can pass by my husband Sean , then they will pass the taste test of any picky eater ! <p> Why are you so passionate about teaching women to nourish their body ? <p> After years of dieting and disordered eating , I decided to educate myself on nutrition and the importance of eating real food , and I started to shift my focus from weight loss to caring for my body . I can now say that investing in my health is one of the best decisions i 've ever made . I now see my body as a wonderfully complex gift , and I want to treat it with respect because it is just that ; a gift from God that I only get one of ! <p> I also can say that making the choice to live a healthy lifestyle does n't mean that I have given up everything that I once enjoyed . In fact , I can honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday life more now that I ever did before ! <p> Another misconception that I have seen to be false is that living a healthy lifestyle does n't have to be overwhelming , expensive , or time consuming ! These truths are all ones that I have ( or hope to ) share with you here at Dashing Dish ! <p> Here at Dashing Dish , I desire to empower each and every person who visits with the resources , tools , and encouragement needed to live a healthy and balanced lifestyle that is enjoyable and maintainable long term ! 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

Well , I truly believe that every area of our life has the potential to make an impact on our well being , but most definitely the most important relationship in this life , which is marriage . For this reason , I felt the Lord prompting me to share about how God has transformed my own marriage by His grace , and how the power of prayer has radically blessed the relationship between my husband and I. But first , let me tell you a little bit about my husband and I , and how we met ... <p> I met my husband when I was 16 years old at our high school homecoming dance . I was the new girl in town , and I got asked to go to the dance with his best friend . It did n't take long before I noticed Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's just say that his best friend was pretty bummed out when I ended up spending most of the night talking to Sean ... and the rest was history ! We ended up dating all through my junior and senior year of high school and all through college . <p> After almost seven years of dating ( and the year before I graduated from nursing school ) , Sean proposed to me . He surprised me by flying out to Orlando , Florida , where I was on a spring break trip with my family . One night my family and I went to Disney 's Cinderella castle for dinner . As I was being seated , out of the corner of my eye I saw my prince walking towards me ! He got down on one knee and asked me to be his bride ... to which I responded , " Well of course ! " <p> After five years of marriage , I can honestly say that this was the best ' yes ' I 've ever said , ( outside of giving my heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the summer after I graduated from nursing school ) we got married , and embarked on our life-long journey together . <p> As wonderful , exciting , and blessed as our journey has been so far , there have also been some really hard days , seasons , and trials that have come our way . This may come as a shock to some people , because let 's face it , the hard times are not the things that are captured in pictures or featured on Facebook or Instagram ... But it 's true , we have had our fair share of storms , just like every other married couple ! <p> Now do n't get me wrong , the majority of our married life has been absolutely wonderful , and I look forward to the years to come ! However , just like everyone who has been married for any length of time , we have endured some hard days together . Some of them have been the result of natural life events , such as facing loss , stress , changes of careers , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , but there are also things that come against us that feel like a direct attack on our marriage . These are the types of attacks that I am convinced are meant to steal , kill and destroy our marriages . It is important to recognize that they are sent by the enemy , and they are bound to come ( John 10:10 ) . How do I know this ? Because I know the devil hates marriage , especially when it is a marriage with God in the center . Why ! ? ! Because marriage between a man and a woman reflects the relationship between Christ and His bride ( the church ) . Not to mention , a couple joined together with the dream to expand God 's kingdom puts a serious threat on the kingdom of darkness . <p> Does this mean that every marriage is doomed to failure ? Certainly not ! God has given us everything we need to be victorious in marriage , and He is for us ! So , what can be done to protect and guard this beautiful relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like everything else in life , I am convinced that the power is in prayer ! <p> Now , before I go any further on the subject of praying for your marriage , I do want to be sensitive and address the fact that some couples would benefit from seeking Godly counsel , and I truly do think it is wise for all married couples to have mentors in their life regardless of circumstances . I also want to add that praying for your marriage is a vital part of God 's plan for marriage , but it is not the only thing that encompasses a healthy marriage . <p> That being said , I can speak from personal experience that prayers wo n't only improve , but they can completely transform your marriage . In fact , it has been a huge part of my personal testimony and the testimony of what God has done in my marriage , that praying prayers based on the promises of God can radically change , heal , and deliver anyone out of any circumstance ! <p> You may be wondering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers based on scripture ! ? ! Well , I 'm glad you asked ! <p> The Word of God is alive , powerful , and sharper than any two-edged sword ! When we pray according to promises in the Word of God , we are praying in agreement with what God says about us and promises us . <p> Now , I want to also mention that this is not the only way to pray , in fact , God also longs to hear from you , throughout the day , as you talk to Him from your heart ! Also , we can see in Ephesians 6:18 that we are instructed to , " pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests . " So , I say all this to say , please know that there is so much more to prayer than just praying prayers based off of scriptures , but I truly do believe that this kind of prayer is a powerful and effective tool to bring about change , because it is based off of Gods word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55:11 ) <p> Nothing has impacted or changed my life and my marriage more than when I started praying the promises of God over them . I started doing this years ago in relation to my health and body image issues , and it was so life-changing that I decided to do the same for my marriage a few years ago . <p> I asked the Lord to show me scriptures to pray over my husband , over my marriage , and over myself to become the wife that He created me to be . It did n't take long before I started to see the fruit of God 's Word coming forth in my marriage , just as it did in other areas of my life . The great thing about praying for your marriage , is that it is even more powerful when you and your spouse do it together , as we can see in Matthew 18:20 ! <p> To be honest , I do n't know why it took me so long to start getting serious about praying for my marriage , but now that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought , I will never stop ! In fact , that is why I am sharing this with all of you ! God has such great plans for every single married couple , and I can promise that a huge part of walking in His plan comes by prayer ! <p> Whatever season you may be in with your marriage , or whatever difficulties you may be facing , I want to encourage you that God 's Word has an answer , a promise , and way through ! When we agree and focus our attention on God 's promises , we can and will overcome anything that comes our way ! <p> I encourage you to seek the Lord for scriptures and promises from His word to pray specifically over your husband , yourself , and your marriage . But , to get you started , I have included some of my personal prayers that I have written for my marriage . <p> I pray you are encouraged today by these prayers , and that the awesome Word of God reminds you of the great plans He has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feel free to print these scripture-based prayers on marriage out for yourself ! You could also write them down on notecards or in a journal . <p> If you are not yet married , but hope to be one day , I encourage you to start praying for your husband now ! There is nothing more powerful than praying for the man that God has made for you ! If you are married , I pray God 's blessings over your marriage ! May God bless you , keep you , makes His face to shine upon you , and give you His peace ! 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

@@100639028 @4839028/ <p> Have you ever had a day where you- started the day with a healthy breakfast , brought a healthy lunch to work , had a healthy mid day snack , and had an overall healthy day .... until the evening hit ! <p> If you can relate to this scenario , I can pretty much guarantee you are not alone . In fact , I have talked to countless women about this very issue , and all of them have the same frustration : Evening snacking is holding them back from reaching their goals . <p> Before i say anything else , I want to clarify a few misconceptions on this topic : <p> Eating at night does not make you gain weight . Yes , that 's right ... There is no set time that you have to stop eating at night to lose weight . That is a huge myth . Sure , it is not ideal to go to bed stuffed , because it 's hard for your body to digest while laying down and sleeping . However , the time of day you eat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your body , and regardless of the time of day . <p> Having treats , eating out , and enjoying foods that are not deemed as ' healthy ' is entirely OK , and it will generally happen in the evening , because that is usually the time most people get together with friends , family , and enjoy food . If we make it our goal to eat healthy most of the time ( at least 80% of the time ) , our bodies , minds , and soul will actually thank us for that occasional treat . - That being said , as long as it is ONE meal or treat enjoyed , and not numerous meals or days of overeating , and indulgence , than it is perfectly acceptable and in my mind , encouraged ! ( Yes , I have my occasional treat too , my treat of choice is almost always frozen yogurt with my hubby on date nights or with friends on the weekend ! ) <p> Mindless snacking on unhealthy foods and binge eating disorder are two different things . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , ( in this case binge eating disorder ) , please tell someone you trust as soon as possible , and seek professional help . <p> Now that we have cleared up those important points ... <p> Here are some tips and ideas I have found to help keep your end of the day and weekend eating on track ! <p> 1 . Do n't Skip Meals or Snacks . When we deprive our bodies of the energy and nutrients they need throughout the day , we are much more likely to overeat , later in the day when we finally give our bodies much needed fuel . The other downside to not eating a lot during the day , and then eating a lot at night is that it can be very hard on our digestive systems to process all of the food we ate just before bed . We can also severely damage our metabolism in the long run when we put our bodies through this all too common feast and famine cycle . Depending on your bodies needs , and the calories you are getting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1-3 snacks per day , and/or eating every 2-4 hours . <p> 2 . Get Enough Sleep. - When our bodies are sleep deprived , we tend to reach for sugar , caffeine , and simple carbohydrates in an effort to get our energy levels up . It is much easier to stay in tune to your bodies true hunger signals when we get at least 7 hours of sleep a night . <p> 3 . Eat Plenty of Protein and Fiber. - Be- sure you are getting plenty of protein and a good amount of fiber with each meal and snacks . Protein and fiber help you feel satisfied and keep your blood sugar levels stead , preventing sugar cravings , and overeating later in the day . Eating a balanced diet , with good sources of lean protein , lots of fruits , veggies , and whole grains , and a moderate amount of healthy fats will ensure that we do n't feel deprived at the end of the day . <p> 4 . Stay Hydrated . Make sure you are getting plenty of water throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also signals hunger , so it can be very easy to mistake the two . - Sometimes we are simply dehydrated , but our brain signals make us think we are hungry . I personally like to fill up a big glass , and put some lemon juice , ice , and stevia in it- it tastes like sugar free lemonade , making it much easier to drink ! <p> 5 . Remove Temptations. - If you have certain food(s) that are hard to resist , do n't buy it , and get rid of it. - There are a few foods that I wo n't buy simply because I do n't want the needless temptation of having them in the house . <p> 6 . Keep Healthy Snacks on Hand . When you are leaving your house , make sure you bring a healthy snack with you . That way , if you find yourself stuck in a traffic jam , or out longer than expected , you wo n't be overly hungry when it comes time for a meal . Also , if you are truly hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( fresh or frozen ) , veggies and hummus , or a 1 minute single serve Dashing Dish dessert ! <p> 7 . Stay Occupied . I believe one of the main reasons people tend to overeat in the evening is because it 's the only time of day that they are not preoccupied with something , making it easier to reach for food out of boredom . - If this sounds familiar , I recommend reading a good book , playing a game , or even taking an evening walk to keep you from mindless eating . Another tip would be to chew sugar free gum , or sip on some decaf coffee , herbal tea sweetened with stevia if you find yourself eating mindlessly . <p> 8 . Have a Set Shut Off Time . One of the problems of staying up late is that it causes you to feel hungry when your body should be sleeping . Make it a point to set a time when you shut down and go to bed . In order to go to sleep at a decent hour of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . If you must have coffee during the day , try to limit the amount after 3 pm . Even if you are not tired , going to bed and spending time doing something relaxing will help you unwind , and keep you out of the kitchen , where it can be easier to make poor choices late at night . <p> 9 . Be Present at Meal Times. - Often times we can get so busy that we are not truly ' present ' when we are eating our nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day . If we make an effort to sit down and truly enjoy our meals , we will be less likely to feel deprived later on in the day . <p> 10 . Strengthen Your Spiritual Muscles . Sometimes what we think is hunger is truly not physical hunger at all ... but rather it is something much deeper , resulting in emotional eating . In those cases I personally have found that there are three powerful weapons to combat emotional eating : Spend time with the Lord , Praise and Worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to go on walks , listen to worship music , and just spend time with the Lord . He always promises to draw near to us when we draw near to Him . He is able to strengthen , encourage , and steady our hearts better than we ever could on our own . <p> If you struggle with eating mindlessly at night ( or any time of the day for that matter ) , I hope these tips help you on your journey to health ! I believe that the very best place to start when it comes to overcoming any ' bad ' habit in the area of nutrition is to start to see yourself as an overcomer ! If you truly start to believe that you can become healthy and balanced in all things , it will just be a matter of time before your actions and behaviors line up with how you see yourself on the inside . I pray blessings over each one of you , and your journey to health ! xo Katie 
@@100639030 @4839030/ <p> Today marks 6 years of being married to my very best friend Sean Farrell , who also happens to be the creative director , photographer , and graphic designer behind Dashing Dish ! <p> Many people do not know that Sean is actually one of the biggest reasons that Dashing Dish exists today . I will never forget the night that we sat on the couch in our apartment as a newly married couple , when Sean said to me , why do n't you share the recipes that you are so passionate about making online ? ! I had never even heard of a blog before , and had never visited a recipe website , so to me this was a foreign concept . <p> Although I did n't know what this ' website ' would look like , my husband encouraged me to sign up for a Wordpress themed website , and share one of my favorite recipes . At that time I thought that this ' recipe website ' would be a simple website where I would share a recipe every now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) would visit from time to time ... After all , I just started a full time nursing job , so I knew I would n't have a lot of time to devote to it . <p> Little did I know that God had a beautiful ministry in the making , and it all began with the simple and sweet encouragement from my husband . <p> About six months after starting Dashing Dish , I started to receive hundreds of e-mails from women of all ages , from all around the world . Whether it was about losing unwanted weight or finding freedom in the areas of eating disorders , each woman had their own story. - I started to realize the great responsibility that God had given me with this website and that it was meant to share much more than recipes . I felt the Lord prompting me to share about the freedom and joy that can only be found in Him and to teach women how to find their true beauty in exchange for the ashes of their life ( Isaiah 61:3 ) . I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that this was my calling and it was confirmed to me many times over . <p> Despite knowing my destiny was awaiting me , I started to have doubts . How could I have spent five long years in nursing school , and have the job of my dreams , and give it all up for something that was n't yet even established as a business or ministry ! ? ! I began to wrestle with what my heart was telling me and I second-guessed myself at every turn . <p> This is where my incredible husband came in again ! <p> One night as I sat I sat in our bed rolling over the weight of the decision that I knew I was facing , my husband came in to pray with me . Tears poured out for the women that I knew God was calling me to reach ... Yet at the same time , my thoughts and analytical brain was racing in every direction . My sweet husband grabbed my hand and said Katie , what is in here , and he pointed to my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts that are so loud right now , and all of the analyzing and rationalizing , and look at what is in your heart . What is God speaking in here ? ! ? <p> I will never forget the evening that my husband spoke the words to my heart that encouraged me to take the step of faith . - That was the moment when I felt that I could be ' brave ' enough to do what God was calling me to do , because my husband encouraged me to lean , trust , and depend on Him . <p> As I approached this huge next step in my life , Sean , ( who is a graphic designer ) began to create the new Dashing Dish website , ( as you see it today ) , and he ended up spending one full year creating and developing it ! So , not only would this ministry not even exist today without Sean , it also would n't be the easy to use , beautiful , and family friendly , ad-free website that it is today , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ) <p> Fast forward 5 years after starting Dashing Dish , I look back and am in awe of the journey that the Lord has taken us on ... and the way that the Lord used both my husband and my talents to reach people with His love in this unique way . <p> Not only did Sean encourage me to start , step out , and design the Dashing Dish website , there are so many things that he does so humbly behind the scenes . He encourages me to dream big , and to do everything with excellence .

@@100639034 @4839034/ <p> Summer is just about officially here , which is the season of bridal showers , graduation parties , outdoor gatherings ! Some of my favorite things to do when I host ( or cater for a friends party ) is do a food or dessert bar . The great thing about a food ' bars ' is that they are easily put together , they please a crowd , and they look simply adorable , making them one of the most memorable parts of any party ! <p> Here are some tips and steps that will help you create a dessert and/or food bar that your guests are sure to love ! <p> Step 1 . Decide whether you want to serve food , desserts , or both . <p> This decision will primarily be made based on the time of day that you are hosting the party . If you are throwing the party at noon for example , your guests will most likely be expecting lunch . If on the other hand you plan to only serve appetizers or desserts , just be sure your party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have very hungry guests ! Also , as a general rule of thumb , I always write something about what I plan to serve on the invites , just so there is no confusion . <p> Step 2 . Evaluate your crowd to determine what types of food/desserts to prepare . <p> The next thing I begin to think about when catering or hosting a party is who will be there . For example , if I know there are mostly women coming , my thoughts automatically lean more towards a salad bar . ( No offense guys , but this tends to have more of a feminine appeal , and turns out really pretty ! ) For example , for my sisters wedding shower , I did a huge salad bar that not only looked really elegant , but it also also pleased all of the girls there , whom all enjoyed a salad ! If I am throwing a party with a more diverse crowd , I might do something with multiple meats and different options to choose from , like a taco , pizza , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great thing about those is you pretty much ca n't go wrong . As long as you have a few different options , most people will find something they enjoy . I also think about where the location of the food and party will be , which will make a difference in the types of food I will serve and prepare , based on if it will be indoors or outdoors . Also , when it comes to choosing foods , I try to keep most of my food items healthy , but still appealing to a large crowd ( that is where Dashing Dish recipes come in ! ) Of course , I might have a few things that are not the healthiest , such as chocolate chips , but for the most part , I try to keep the main dishes on the healthier side ! <p> Step 3 . Select a theme and/or colors . <p> This might not always apply , especially if it is a casual party , but if I know there will be a theme to the party ( especially if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to start thinking about the colors of the food , napkins , plates , etc . For example , this may help you pick the flavor of cupcake , frosting flavors , or desserts you will make , and of course it will help you think about decorations you may need . The great thing about food and dessert bars is that they are often cute enough by themselves , and the food is decoration enough , so I often only plan for a few little decorative accents such as flowers , paper straws , wooden spoons , and possibly linens to drape across the table , which I set the food on . <p> Step 4 . Begin to think about numbers . <p> Once you know what your menu will look like , you will need to start planning your grocery list . I often do this well in advance , and just as soon as I have a rough head count for the party . I like to be prepared ahead of time , and even get ingredients that might be hard to find ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each guest will have at least one serving of food and/or dessert , and I generally multiply that number by at least two per guest . From there , I determine if anyone will be bringing a dish to the party , and if so , I generally give them a few specific ideas to choose from so it will go with the theme . Once I know about how much food I will need to buy/prepare , I start to write up a rough grocery list . <p> Step 5 . Think about set up and details . <p> Once you know where your food/dessert bar will be located ( any long table will work ) , and what you will be serving , it is time to plan the set up ! This can be really simply done , or a bit more extravagant , based on the look you are going for , and the type of party . <p> 1 . The first thing I think about is linens . The type of linen or runner you choose for your bar will vary based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent them or purchase them for a great deal if you buy some fabric from the craft store , or you could buy one or two basic runners , so that you can keep re-using them , ( I have a burlap runner that I re-use for almost every party ) . I also like to get paper plates and napkins that go with the color and theme . <p> 2 . After choosing the linens , I think about if I want different elevations . This can be simply done by using cake plates , boxes , crates , trifle bowls , basic plates , trays , or even a stack of books ! The key here is just simply to add different heights to the bar , which allows you to place some things in the back , and some things in the front without things getting lost . Otherwise , it would just end up looking like a huge pile of food , and it will be hard for your guests to sort through . <p> 3 . Choose plates , bowls , trifle bowls , cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . I like to use mason jars for a lot of my food and dessert bars , because you can buy them in bulk for really cheap ( Walmart has a great deal on a 12 pack ) . I like to use the bigger ones for larger items such as salad toppings , and smaller ones for my dessert bar toppings . As far as plates go , you can really get creative and mix and match what you have , but if you do n't have much to work with , you can always go to a second hand store such as Good Will ( you 'd be surprised how many cute dishes they have there ) , or look at an inexpensive store such as Home Goods ! In general , when I am buying plates , trays , etc. , I try to think practically , and buy white or clear items , so I can keep re-using them in the future . Also , do n't forget about serving utensils ! Be sure that every dish has something you can serve it with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server . I even like to practice ' setting up ' my food/dessert bar the night before the party sometimes so that I can be sure I have all the right serving items . <p> 4 . Think about details . Like I said earlier , you wo n't need to buy a lot of decorative details , because the food/dessert bar in itself is generally pretty adorable , so I like to just pick out a few little accents to bring out the color and/or theme that I am going for . One great way to do this is by using colored paper straws and wooden utensils ( I buy them at Home Goods or on Etsy or Amazon for a few dollars . ) I also like to make little signs/labels which can be done really simply by cutting out little pieces of paper , and folding them , or with something like mini chalk boards ( Amazon/Etsy have great deals , and these can be re-used ) . You can also make little paper tags for things , buy colorful candies to tie in your color theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for an elegant touch ! <p> and last but not least ... <p> Step 6 . Think about ways to save money ! <p> Let 's face it , throwing a party can be pretty expensive . When it comes to entertaining or catering , I always try to think about ways I can save money . One great way to do this is by planning ahead . When you plan ahead and know what you are going to buy , this will allow you to look for sales on food ( as long as they are items that will stay fresh until your party , or can be frozen ) , and other items such as paper plates and napkins . Buying things in bulk can also be a great way to get a deal , as long as you know you will be able to use it all . When it comes to saving on serving wear and the details , I like to start by looking around my house for items I already have . Also , like I mentioned earlier I like to shop at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have great coupons ) for little details , crates , and mason jars , and I like to get a few items on Etsy and Amazon if I need something special . You can also plan to do the food and/or dessert bar with someone . For example , my sisters and I generally work on them together , which makes the work and cost go down , as it is divided among two or three people . The general thing that I try to keep in mind when I am hosting or catering any party though is that I am doing it to bless the person that we are celebrating , or just to bless my guests ! When you think of it that way , it always makes the time and money invested worth while ! <p> Now , to give you guys an even better idea on how to put these steps together I thought I 'd share a few pictures of some events I prepared food and dessert bars for ! Here is an example of a salad bar that I 'd did for my sister Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Sarah 's house this past summer . <p> We also did a dessert bar for her shower , which was really fun . It was sort of a ' build your own trifle ' theme , and Sarah had cute little sunday cups for each girl to build their own mini dessert parfait in . <p> Emily 's wedding colors were coral and gold , so I threw in a few items to tie in her colors . <p> The beautiful bride had a great day , and it certainly was a shower to remember ! <p> Another bridal shower that I recently did the dessert bar for was my good friend Heather . This shower was put on by my friend Dayna ( who is also an amazing photographer , and took some of these amazing photo 's ! : ) ) The theme for this party was a tea party , with whites and golds being her colors , so we did something a little more elegant , yet still rustic because it was outdoors . <p> Dayna asked friends and family to borrow tea cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rented a lot of the other items , such as the barrel table , crates , and linens . <p> Dayna also made all the tags for everything , and used a lot of her chalk boards that she already had to make signs for things . This attention to detail really made each item feel personalized and very special . <p> For the dessert bar , I chose to do cake pops and cookies that were the brides favorite flavors , ( pistachio and white chocolate macadamia nut cookies ) , and I even made a personal little pistachio cake for the bride to enjoy after the shower ! <p> I also made no bake cheesecake trifles ( recipe coming soon ) , white chocolate drizzled rice crispy treats , blondies , and chocolate covered pretzels . For most of these items , I made healthier options whenever possible . <p> Here I catered a business meeting for 40 + women ! I did a breakfast bar , followed by a salad and dessert bar for lunch ! <p> I hope these ' how to ' steps were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert bar ! It really can be quite fun , and they certainly do present quite beautifully at any party ! You can keep it quite simple , or do something extravagant if you choose , but the key is to have fun and celebrate the ones you love !

@@100639044 @4839044/ <p> When someone has decided to start living a healthy lifestyle , I always suggest making small changes over time in order to develop new healthy habits that will stick . One of the first places I suggest when it comes to cleaning out the pantry and fridge is to get rid of everything that has white sugar and white flour in it . There are so many reasons that white flour and sugar are bad for your health , and I highly suggest you do some research for yourself if you do n't already know why that is . Personally , I have found that my weight , my energy , my health , and my overall well being has been dramatically improved since I removed all products with sugar and flour in them years ago . <p> The purpose of this article however is not necessarily to discuss why sugar and white flour are bad for our health , ( although I have done so in various places on Dashing Dish ) , but rather it is to help you learn some easy ways to detox from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Start ? <p> One of the first places that I would suggest detoxing from sugar is to toss your processed and sugar packed foods and start filling your fridge and pantry with natures sweets ! I personally love fruit , because it is naturally sweet , and it is packed with nutrition ! I know that it can be tough to think about ' getting rid ' of some of your ( or your families ) favorite treats , but once it is out of sight , it will eventually become out of mind ! It is so much better to not even have the temptation for sugar in your house ! <p> But what about those days that you are craving chocolate , cookies , cake , etc ! ? ! Well , let me be the first to say that I am a ' sweets ' girl , so I totally get that ! So , instead of cutting out your favorite sweet treats all together , I suggest you replace them with a healthier option ... Which is what I provide here at Dashing Dish ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all know sugar is not the best thing for our bodies , but all those artificial sweeteners are n't good for our health either . So what is a good option that wo n't spike your blood sugar , or add unnecessary chemicals to your diet ? <p> After much experimentation in a quest to find a natural no-calories sweetener , I found a couple of great options . And the great news is , many grocery stores are starting to carry these products ! So here are some different options to swap out with sugar , with a little review about each one ! ( Note : There are more options than the ones listed below , but these are the ones that I have personally tried . ) <p> Stevia : This is by far the best natural sweetener I have found . It is derived from a stevia leaf and has been used for years in other countries . It is starting to be used more and more in things like diet soda and drinks . In my opinion , the best brand by far is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Amazon ) . You can find stevia in the form of powder , a baking blend , packets , or liquid stevia . They even have made flavored liquid stevia , which is great for coffee ! <p> The Pros : The brand NuStevia has no bitter after-taste and proportionally it is as close to sugar as you can get . ( It is still sweeter than sugar ... as are most substitutes , so you generally need less than the amount of sugar you would use . ) <p> The Cons : Well , I have n't found any yet , except some brands do have a bitter taste , which is why I prefer Nu Naturals brand , as it is not bitter at all . <p> Truvia : Truvia is made from the stevia plant and is mixed with another natural sweetener , erythritol . Erythritol is the naturally fermented sugar alcohol found in fruits such as pears and grapes . <p> The Pros : Truvia can be found in most supermarkets . It has the texture of natural sugar , which makes it great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as sweet as stevia and it does cause GI discomfort , if used in excess . <p> Xylitol : This is a natural sweetener found in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables . You 'll find that most of your sugar-free gum has xylitol in it . <p> The Pros : Research has found that chewing gum with xylitol in it can actually reduce the risk of cavities . <p> The Cons : This sugar alternative unfortunately is n't calorie free . It has 2.4 calories per gram ... but hey , its better than sugar ! It also does cause a bit of gastrointestinal discomfort if you use it in excess . <p> Maple Syrup , Honey and Agave Nectar:All three are natural sweeteners made in nature . <p> The Pros : Besides the mentioned comparison to honey , some studies state that it is low on the glycemic index , which makes it a better option for diabetics and for weight management . <p> The Cons : The only downfall I have found with these are that they do add calories ( about 60 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added as easily to baking recipes , because it is a liquid . <p> Sugar in the Raw and Coconut Sugar : Sugar in the Raw is sugar made exclusively from sugarcane.The juice is extracted from the sugarcane and then crystallized through evaporation to maintain its natural molasses , golden color and distinctive flavor . Coconut sugar is a sugar produced from the sap of cut flower buds of the coconut palm . Coconut sugar has been used as a traditional sweetener for thousands of years in the South and South-East Asian regions where the coconut palm is in abundant supply . <p> The Pros : Depending on the brand you purchase , they could potentially be less processed than white sugar . They also can be swapped out for sugar exactly in baking recipes . <p> The Cons : Both of these sugars have the same number of calories and carbohydrates as regular white sugar . They can also negatively affect your blood glucose levels , especially if you are diabetic . Overall , there is not proof that either of these sugars are any better for you than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevia in Recipes : <p> When it comes to sweeteners , I personally like to use baking stevia and stevia packets like I mentioned above . However , all of these recipes call for a sweetener that measures like sugar , which includes any sweetener that can be measured the same as sugar , or you could use sugar if you prefer . <p> If you prefer to use stevia or another sweetener , you will have to alter the amount based on the conversion table below , or according to your desired taste . This can take some experimenting , but once you get a feel for baking with different sweeteners , it is very simple to know how much to use . To get you started , I have provided a simple conversion table that works with stevia . <p> Please also note , that the amounts listed below may vary based on the brand of stevia you are using . The following chart pertains to NuNaturals stevia , which is the brand I personally recommend .

@@100639050 @4839050/ <p> Over the past few years , I have received a lot of questions and emails from people who asking how to study the Bible . I want to begin by saying that the great thing about spending time in the Word is that we get to spend time with our Father , and He wants to speak to us through His Word even more than we want to hear from Him ! He loves us more than we could ever imagine , and His love letter to each one of us is the Bible ! <p> I wanted to start by saying , because I truly think that if we go into studying the Word of God with the mindset that it is something that we ' should ' or ' have ' to do , it sucks the life right out of it ! Instead , if we approach the Word as time to be with our Father and fellowship with the creator of the universe , we will see this time as a treasure , rather than a religious duty . <p> Not only is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great love for us , but it is also the road map to our lives , guiding us and leading us into all truth and showing us the way to go . It also builds us up in our faith , gives us direction , renews our minds , lovingly corrects us , gives us wisdom , and brings true peace , joy , and fulfillment ... and the list goes on . An important thing to remember is that the Word of God has the answer to every situation we will ever face in this life , and it will nourish and satisfy us like nothing on this earth ever could ! <p> How do we Study the Word ? <p> Now that I have laid a foundation for the benefits of spending time in the Word , the second thing I want to say about studying the Bible is that it is not a simple answer because the Word is Alive ( Hebrews 4:12 ) . It is different than any other book , because the Holy Spirit wrote it through people , and it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each one of us as we study it . Therefore , the study of the Word and time spent with the Lord will look a little different for each person . It may look different each day and season of our lives because there may times/days when we really just need to spend time studying one passage or scripture for a period of time while asking the Lord to reveal it to us in a deeper way and bring it to life to us . There may be other times , however , when we read a whole chapter in one day and the Lord uses bits and pieces of it to speak different things to us . However , that being said , there are some truths that are constant and remain the same when it comes to believers reading the Word . <p> Here are the five things that should stay the same and apply to everyone in their time spent studying the Word : <p> 1 . Give God 's Word First Place . When we put God 's Word first place , everything in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8:31-32 tells us that if we abide in the Word , then we will be His disciples . We will know the truth and the truth will set us free . If we want to walk in the freedom that God has for us in every area of our life , we must make it our first priority to spend time with the Lord each day . If you feel that you do n't have time early in the morning , I would encourage you to try going to bed earlier so that you can set your alarm to wake up earlier ! You can always study during your lunch break , at night , or any time throughout the day , but I personally have found that my whole day gets off to the right start when I make time to fellowship with Him first thing ! <p> 2 . Go into Reading your Bible with Expectancy . When you spend time with the Lord , begin looking at it like getting to know your best friend . When you spend time with that person , they rub off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . That is the way we should go into spending time with God . That takes away any tendency that someone might have to spend time with God out of ' duty ' or obligation . When we expect to hear from Him , we are walking in faith that He will speak to us . This kind of attitude not only pleases Him ( Hebrews 11:6 ) , but it opens our hearts up to receive what He is speaking to us ! <p> 3 . Pray Before you Read . Ask the Lord to bring the Word alive to you , to bring you revelation , and to give you eyes to see , ears to hear , and a heart to receive what He is saying to you . I always ask the Holy Spirit to give me insight and understanding when reading the Word . The Holy Spirit was sent to us to teach us , counsel us , and remind us of the truths of God 's Word . He is also the one who inspired the people who wrote the Word , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14:26 ) <p> 4 . Seek and You will Find . If you have a question , something you are going through , or just want to know the Lord more , know that when you seek , you will find , and that the Word has the answer to everything we have need of in this life . ( Matthew 7:7 ) <p> 5 . Meditate and Pray the Word . I personally love journaling while studying the Word . When I write down scriptures , it allows me to think about each word and think about how it applies to my own life . I also love praying the Word , because I know that I am praying God 's perfect will when I am praying in alignment with what He said ! I also love writing and praying scripture based prayers , because it increases my faith in His promises and it allows me to look back and reflect on His faithfulness ! <p> Where Should I Start Reading ? <p> As far as where to start reading or what Bible to read , I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Testament equally . However , if it is your first time reading the Bible , I would suggest starting with the New Testament because this is where you will find your identity about who you are in Jesus . The New Testament is composed of The Gospels ( Matthew , Mark , Luke John ) , which were written by the disciples , sharing their encounters with Jesus when He was on the earth.The Epistles " ( Acts-Revelation ) were written for the Christian church instructing us on how to live and carry out the ministry of Jesus today , while teaching us who we are in Christ . The New Testament is beneficial to us today because as Christians , we are saved by what Jesus did for us on the cross . For that reason , we are now under a new covenant with God , which means that we are no longer subject to the punishment of God and we do n't have to offer sacrifices for our sins . Jesus came as a sacrifice once and for all for all and carried our sins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a personal relationship with God ( 1 Peter 2:24 ) . <p> The Old Testament is also equally important because it is the foundation for the New Testament , teaching us about who God created us to be from the beginning . It also contains countless prophesies of things to come in the New Testament that could only be fully understood if you read the Old Testament . It has powerful life lessons that provide wisdom , insight , and understanding to our lives today . <p> What Version Should I Read ? <p> I personally like the NKJV and the NLT . However , it is important that it is a version that you can understand . The NIV , NKJV , NLT , Amplified , and The Message are all versions I have studied in the past . I would say that it also helps to have a dictionary to help you understand certain words and/or a concordance to study the Greek or Hebrew root words and their meanings . Some other additional study guides that I have found helpful in learning my foundation of who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Battlefield of the Mindby Joyce Meyer . I also wrote my devotional Devotions for a Healthier You in hopes to help women find their true fulfillment and identity in Christ based on what I have studied and learned over the years . <p> I hope this helps ! This topic can go much deeper than one post can explain , but I hope this encourages you to explore and study the Word if you have n't already started ! I truly believe that God 's Word is the foundation for our lives , and it will be our rock- firm , steady , and never changing through all of life 's seasons ... But most of all , it is God 's personal love letter to you ! xo Katie 45730 @qwx905730 45734 @qwx905734

@@100639054 @4839054/ <p> Traveling can be so refreshing . - It is a time away from the every day ' routine ' and a time to rest and relax ! This can also mean a time of seriously getting off track when it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle . To some to degree , this can be a good thing- I always think it is good to change things up from time to time , so I take this opportunity to try some new foods , enjoy a few treats , and shake up my workouts ! <p> However , if you do n't plan ahead , it can definitely go from being a good ' change ' to a bad one , especially if you find yourself completely skimping out on fiber , water , and indulge in too much sugar and processed foods . Without some sort of balance , I can tell you from past experience that it is only a matter of time before you start to notice that your body ( especially your digestive system ) will not be happy ! <p> For that reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel and bring some healthy snacks and options with me . I hope this inspires you guys to plan ahead and pack some of your own favorite healthy treats on your next vacation ! In the end , I can promise that your body will thank you ! <p> For snacks I like to bring fruit , particularly apples because they are high in fiber and lower in sugar . They also keep fresh for a long time , and you can even buy individual nut butter packets to have with them for a well rounded snack . I also like to bring a small bag of baby carrots . I am not a huge fan of eating them once they are warm , so I try to eat those first when I 'm on a long car ride , or I bring a small cooler or lunch bag if possible . I also enjoy small 100 calorie bags of popcorn on trips , because let 's face it , sometimes you need something salty and crunchy ! I found this amazing kettle corn at Trader Joes , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great snack as well . I buy the 100 calorie pack since they are higher in calories . <p> Whenever I travel , I try to pack some good sources of protein that are portable . The best option I have found when I do n't have access to a cooler or fridge is protein powder and peanut flour . I also bring oats with me and make peanut butter protein oatmeal with just a little water , oats , stevia , peanut flour , and protein powder ! You would be amazed at how good it tastes and how much it fills you up ! <p> I also enjoy protein bars when I travel , because there are times when you need protein , and fast ! I like Mojo , Quest , Chocolite , and Think Thins ! The main thing to look at with bars is the calories , protein , and sugar ! I always check to make sure the calories are not much over 200 per bar , the sugar is less than 10 grams , and the protein is around 10-20 grams per bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but if I am going somewhere that I can prepare my own food ( and I will have a kitchen and fridge ) , then I like to bring a few packs of high fiber wraps with me . Wrap sandwiches are great for packing up in a cooler and taking with you to the beach for example ! Jospeph 's and La Tortilla are my favorite brands . High fiber bran crackers are also a great thing to have around for a quick snack ! I like to put a little peanut butter and low sugar jelly on them or some tuna salad ! <p> I love to bring a water bottle with me just about everywhere I go . - I like to fill it up with ice water and carry a few all natural drink mixes around in my purse ! That way I always stay hydrated , without filling up on chemicals , sugar , or calories that are in most beverages ! Another great quick and healthy beverage option that that travels well is my Protein Iced Coffee recipe ! If you bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein powder , and stevia , then it only requires that you have access to cold water ( and/or ice water ) on the road , and you have delicious and protein packed coffee treat ! <p> If possible , I like to make a batch of my homemade muffins to bring with me . I love bringing muffins to snack on because they taste delicious- and- are packed with protein and fiber to keep me satisfied for a long time ! They also stay good for about 1 week , which is perfect for a trip ! <p> And last but not least , I do like to bring a few different flavors of gum . Now , I am the first to admit that there are chemicals in sugar free gum , but to me , if you chew it in moderation , I feel like it 's better than chewing on sugary gum anytime , especially when it comes to my teeth . I like the dessert gums by Extra , - Orbit and Trident flavors ! <p> These are just a few ideas of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really depends on the type of trip you are going on , how you are traveling , and where you are going , but I almost always try to plan ahead and pack accordingly .

@@100639062 @4839062/ <p> From the very beginning of time Satan came as a serpent to tempt Adam and Even by distorting the truth of God 's Word in the garden ( Genesis 3 ) . Fast forward to when Jesus walked the earth , and we can see that the enemy used the same old tricks when he tempted Jesus multiple times using deception ( Matthew 4 ) . Satan is pulling the same conniving stunts today , but he is not quite as clever as some might believe . He is still using deception , lies , and distortion of the truth to steal , kill , and destroy ( John 10:10 ) ... and it is all done with one motive , which is to steal our identity . <p> The enemy has and will continue to aim his attack at our identity for one simple reason .

Well Let me show you how it 's done in just a few simple steps ! <p> STEP 1 : - PLAN &amp; SHOP- <p> I begin meal planning by making a list of recipes on my " Favorites Board " . ( This can be found under the membership section of Dashing Dish. ) - I create a ' favorites ' list each week based on what I want to have for breakfasts , lunches , snacks , and dinners . - <p> From there I write down the ingredient list for each recipe. - ( I generally divide the ingredient list by 2 if I plan to prepare it for my husband and I and it is a recipe that calls for four servings or more ) . - After writing out my grocery list I double check that I do n't already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm off to the grocery store ! <p> When I get home from the grocery store I generally do n't put any of the groceries away , ( unless of course they are frozen and will melt quickly ) ... I simply take everything out of the grocery bag and set it out on the counter , putting things in organized piles according to each recipe . I then pull up my favorites list and get to cooking ! - I generally start with the breakfasts and move on from there . <p> Throughout- the week I typically have a protein shake for breakfast , but I find that many of my breakfast recipes are great for mid-morning snacks , and/or if I am in need of a breakfast on-the-go . If I do n't end up eating them I simply freeze them for a time that I am in need of a quick and healthy snack ! <p> One of my favorite ways to prepare chicken is in the crockpot !

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I generally pop some frozen chicken in the crockpot and set it to high heat the morning of my meal prepping day . ( That way it is all ready when I am ready to start meal prepping ! ) <p> For lunches I typically make something really simple such as a couple big salads and wrap- sandwiches and put them in- Tupperware- containers or wrap them in foil individually . ( Leftovers from dinner are also a great option ! ) <p> For dinners I typically make a few different main dishes and a couple of side dishes. - <p> After all the food is prepped and the recipes are made , I put- everything- in- Tupperware- containers and place it in the fridge ! That way I have something to throw in a cooler if I am heading out for the day or to pop in the microwave and/or oven to heat up and have a delicious dinner on the table in minutes ! <p> This whole process from start to finish takes anywhere from 2-3 hours .

@@100639082 @4839082/ <p> I have- received many emails with questions about counting calories , so I thought I would share my perspective in a post ! In general , I do think that counting calories , especially at first can be beneficial for someone who is just starting to read nutrition labels and get familiar with different foods . However , I always suggest that the ultimate goal that people should aim for is to listen to their body , rather than counting calories long term . <p> Counting calories in the beginning of a weight loss journey can be helpful because you can get a realistic sense of how to space out calories throughout- your day to best fuel your body , and you get familiar with portion sizes in general . On the other hand , when it comes to maintaining this long-term , counting calories really is n't realistic , and it can even become obsessive if taken to the extreme . <p> I personally found that counting calories for about a month in the beginning of my journey worked well for me , because it allowed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my day in a way that made me feel energized throughout the day . After becoming ' familiar ' with proper portion sizes , I decided to stop tracking calories and start to listen to my body 's natural hunger cues. - This means I would eat until I was satisfied ... Not stuffed . <p> Yes , I still continue to pay attention to the amount of calories , fat , sugar , carbohydrates , and protein in food . However , this is more about being informed and aware of what I am putting in my body . For example , something may seem healthy , especially with all of the tricky labels out there , but if you do n't pay attention or do any planning on your part , you could easily end up taking in a lot of calories , fat , and sugar without even realizing it ! <p> So , although I am aware of what I am eating , I do n't keep a running total of calories for the day on paper , or in general . Here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eating with friends and family can get tricky if you are always counting calories . In general , if you do n't know what was put in the food , this can lead to anxiety ... Or even a ' bingeing ' mentality , when you throw all ' care ' out the window because you do n't know what to write down . Instead , when I am at a get-together , I try to pick the healthiest choices that I see and make it my goal to focus more on enjoying the people I 'm with rather than on the food ... ( after all that is really what life is all about is n't it ! ? ! ) - And if I do pick a dessert , or something that I know is n't so healthy , then I stick to one portion , and really spend time enjoying each bite ( or I share it ) ! <p> 2 . If you count calories , you can actually over eat ! Here 's what I mean ... If you count calories , then chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single bite , even if you are truly full , in an effort to track the calories properly ! This is a bit crazy if you think about it , because God really did put a ' full ' signal inside each one of us for a reason ! When I was first learning to pay attention to my body , I would take a few bites , put my fork down , and really pay attention to how I felt . Then , when I felt like my stomach was- satisfied , I stopped , and saved the rest for later . Sure , it was tough to do this at first , and it does take practice ( and prayer ) in the beginning , but eventually you will be so in tune with your body , you wo n't even have to think twice about it ! <p> 3 . It can lead to bingeing . For me personally , counting calories led to binges when I let myself have ' a day off ' of counting . This was most likely because I felt like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest - by eating whatever came- across- my path . Again , this is not entirely logical if you think about it , because there will always be another chance to eat any certain type of food again . However , on the days that I was n't counting calories , I felt as though I had to eat everything like it was my last chance to eat , knowing that the very next day I was going to be back to ' tracking ' . <p> Those are just a few of the reasons I do n't advocate counting calories long term . On that note , I will say that everyone is different , and everyone has different things that work for them . So , all that being said , I will say that I do n't mean to condemn anyone if this is what works for you ! In general , I would say that it is better to have some kind of plan than no plan at all ! : ) <p> A realistic way of incorporating all that I have just discussed would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get an idea of how much to eat , and - become familiar with composing meals that are a good balance of protein and fiber to keep you- satisfied . With that foundation established , you should be able to move onto truly listening to your body , and eating until you are satisfied . Like I said , this may seem ' strange ' at first , but that is how God created our bodies to function ! He gave us the ability to know when we are hungry , and full , so we would eat only what our bodies truly need ! - Also , with this approach , I find that it is easier to put the focus on eating healthy and nutritious foods rather than all the numbers ! <p> When combined with the main principals of healthy eating , ( limiting amount of processed foods and sugar , trying to get a good balance of protein and fiber with meals , and filling up on healthy snacks in between meals ) , you should be able to maintain a healthy weight in a way that is sustainable for life !

@@100639106 @4839106/ <p> Losing or maintaining weight is actually a simple mathematical equation that is often made more complicated than it needs to be . The bottom line is your weight is determined by how many calories you take in versus how many calories you put out . <p> Having 5-6 smaller meals per day helps to balance out your blood sugar and exercising on a regular basis ( which should include strength training to maintain and develop lean muscle mass ) also helps boost your metabolism . <p> The key is to find the proper balance of these two for you depending on if you would like to lose or maintain your weight .
