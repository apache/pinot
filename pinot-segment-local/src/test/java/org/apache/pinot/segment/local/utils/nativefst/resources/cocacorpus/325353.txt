While enabling the taxonomist , in principle , to obtain an estimate of the overall similarity between the genomes of two strains , this technique is tedious and not easily be made reproducible between different labs and can not be used to incrementally built up a comparative database .

Values calculated with GGDC yield a better correlation with wet-lab DDH values than alternative approaches such as " ANI " . These distance functions can also cope with heavily reduced genomes and repetitive sequence regions . Some of them are also very robust against missing fractions of genomic information ( due to incomplete genome sequencing ) . Thus , this web service can be used for genome-based species delineation .

This could be important for cells which are difficult to culture , or cells which will be used to prepare or assay viruses , used in cytotoxicity assays or other systems where complement may have an unwanted influence . On the other hand , heat inactivation may deplete serum growth factors . <p> Which sera are routinely used at the DSMZ as growth supplements ? <p> The DSMZ cell lines were all propagated in FBS/FCS ( fetal bovine/calf serum ) or HS ( horse serum ) . With one exception ( PB-1 , ACC-no. 241 ) we use only heat-inactivated serum . <p> Which cell culture media are used at the DSMZ ? <p> The media we use are currently sourced from Invitrogen . This , however , should not be taken as an endorsement . All media contain L-glutamine . <p> We believe that passage numbers are unreliable criteria for ageing cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trypsination of a culture and its subsequent re-seeding , passage-numbering arbitrarily depends on the split ratio used by the individual cell culturist . Thus , if operator A splits 1:2 , and B 1:4 , they will end up with two different passage numbers ( " B " half of " A " ) , even though both cell cultures will have been growing for the same time period . <p> How should I prepare samples for mycoplasma testing ? <p> General considerations : <p> 1 ) Cryopreserved cell cultures should be cultured for circa 2 weeks prior to testing to ensure a sufficient mycoplasma titer . Thus , we recommend submission of samples from growing cultures to minimize chargeable costs for shipment and cell culture.2 ) For the same reason , cell lines must be cultured without antibiotics for at least two weeks prior to submission.3 ) We recommend submission of samples taken on Monday 's ( conditioned medium from a three days culture or older ) and immediate shipment . Do not send the samples later than Wednesday to ensure same-week delivery.4 ) Work in DSMZ laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including risk group 2 . Suspension cell cultures:For suspension cell lines , stand culture flasks vertically allowing cells to settle for about 30 minutes prior to removal of 2 ml of the supernatant and transfer to two sterile tubes.Adherent cell cultures:Grow the cultures almost to confluence and remove 2 ml supernatant . Transfer the supernatant to two sterile reaction tubes . <p> These procedures should yield optimum numbers of cells to detect mycoplasma adhering to the eukaryotic cells to facilitate detection of adherent mycoplasma . <p> How should I send samples for mycoplasma testing ? <p> Seal the reaction tubes with Parafilm and wrap carefully . Send the samples unchilled by conventional mail or courier chosen to ensure same-week delivery . <p> We first isolate the cellular particles present in 1 ml culture supernatant by centrifugation , and wash with PBS .

The counting of colony forming units ( cfu ) is inexact because mycoplasmas often grow as clumps and one colony might be seeded from multiple mycoplasmas . Thus , we have cultivated pure cultures of mycoplasmas , isolated and quantitated the DNA , and performed PCR reactions with a dilution series of the DNA . <p> Depending on the antibiotic used , the eradication procedure takes at least four to five weeks . <p> How is mycoplasma elimination performed at the DSMZ ? <p> We apply different antibiotics to eliminate the mycoplasmas .

@@25195905 @5195905/ <h> Adaptation of anoxygenic phototrophs to extreme low-light and long-wavelength IR <p> The Black Sea chemocline represents the largest extant habitat of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria on Earth and harbours a monospecific population of Chlorobium BS-1 . Application of a highly specific RT-qPCR method which targets the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) region of the rrn operon of BS-1 demonstrated that cells at 80 - 95 m water depths are physiologically active at in situ light intensities below 0.18 -mol quantam-2s-1 which renders it the most extreme low-light-adapted phototroph known to date . According to laboratory measurements , Chlorobium BS-1 has a maintenance energy requirement of 1.6-4.910-15 kJcell-1d-1 which is the lowest value determined for any bacterial culture so far . Chlorobium BS-1 thus can serve as a laboratory model to elucidate general cellular mechanisms of long-term starvation survival . Because of its adaptation to extreme low light marine environments , Chlorobium BS-1 also represents a suitable indicator for palaeoceanography studies of deep photic zone anoxia in ancient oceans . <p> Whole cells of the purple sulfur bacterium strain 970 exhibit an unusual absorption peak at 963 nm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LHC1 ) and the photosynthetic reaction center proteins was amplified , cloned and sequenced .

Based on our structural modeling , the side chain of this +His is predicted to be in close proximity to the BChla , suggesting that it exerts a modulating effect on the spectral properties of the highly unusual LHC1 complex of strain 970 . <p> The Eastern Mediterranean Sea represents one of the most oligotrophic habitats on Earth and contains very low concentrations of inorganic nutrients . Organic carbon substrates and phosphate elicit a pronounced chemotactic response of heterotrophic bacterioplankton whereby different copiotrophic members of the bacterioplankton exhibit distinct responses . In particular , the alphaproteobacterium Thalassospira sp. exhibited a pronounced response towards inorganic phosphate . This previously unrecognized component of marine ultraoligotrophic bacterioplankton thus seems to be specifically adapted to accumulate at point sources of phosphate . The present study provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphate , thereby identifying an alternative strategy of motile bacteria to enhance their phosphate acquisition . The differential chemotactic response has implications for our understanding of the ecological niche of typical but low abundance marine planktonic genera and their potential role in the marine carbon and phosphorus cycles . <p> Global warming causes a mobilization of terrigenous refractory carbon in arctic Permafrost . The increased input of organic carbon into the neighboring coastal seas is expected to result in considerable changes of the marine carbon cycle . Seasonal variations of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon ( tDOC ) and increased CO2 emissions in the coastal seas , together with low tDOC in the open ocean suggest an effective mineralization in coastal areas . However , little is known about the microorganisms involved , their physiological properties and environmental factors which control microbial tDOC mineralization in the marine habitats .

" <p> Taxonomy can be clearly defined as encompassing characterization , classification , and nomenclature . <p> The characterization of an organism is no longer bounded by methodological barriers , and it is now possible to fully sequence the whole genome of a strain , to study individual genes , or to examine the genetic information by using amplified fragment length polymorphism , random amplification of polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) , and G+C content analysis . However , genes do not exist on their own , and it is becoming increasingly clear that the study of the biochemical pathways of an organism , the roles structural elements ( proteins and lipopolysaccharides , etc. ) may play in morphology , or the chemical composition of the cell should be correlated with the underlying genetic information . <p> Classification is the arrangement of prokaryotes into groups . Different forms of classification may have different goals . Organisms may be grouped according to their pathogenic potentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more complex theories ( i.e. , the course of evolution ) . Nomenclature is the naming of those groups . When the groups are species , genera , and families , etc. , then the way they are named or the links between names which have been used in the past are governed by an International Code of Nomenclature ( 147 ) . <p> Identification is often considered to be a part of taxonomy but is concerned with comparing unknown organisms with organisms which have already been classified . As such , identification can be carried out only once a taxonomy has been established . Typically , identification protocols have the goal of quickly assigning an organism to a known group by using the minimum number of methods . In contrast , a novel organism should be characterized as fully as possible in order for subsequent identification systems to have a reliable basis on which to work . The more reliable the characterization and classification , the greater chance one will have of being able to pick identification methods which both are accurate and have a long-term future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of registering ( or indexing ) those names which may be used in prokaryote taxonomy via a centralized system . The formal term for registering a name is " valid publication of a name . " This system was unique to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( but virology has followed this principle ) and was introduced in 1980 to combat uncertainties in the application of some 40,000 names ; which had accumulated over the previous 200 years . With the introduction of the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names ( 240 ) , only 2,000+ names made the grade into the modern system . While nomenclature is formally regulated , it is important to be aware that taxonomy is not regulated by the code . Thus , the code recognizes a " valid published species name , " but the term " validly published species " has no meaning , despite being frequently met with in some of the literature . In order for a name to be validly published , the proposal for the name must be accompanied by a number of criteria ( 147 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designation of a nomenclatural type . Just as physics has reference points for the meter or the kilogramm - so too does biology , with the nomenclatural types being the reference points for a taxon . In the cases of the species and subspecies , these reference points are represented by type strains ( 147 ) . Given the central importance of type strains , it is important that they be made available as widely as possible . The best course of action would appear to be to deposit type strains in a suitable culture collection , which should be able to maintain the distribution of the strain in the future ( 83 , 141 ) . Clearly , depositing a type strain in such a way that it is not easy to access is counterproductive to the principle behind the deposit of type strains , that of making them widely and easily available for comparative purposes .
